The new location will be announced soon."Chile's government on Wednesday canceled the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation summit set for Nov. 16-17 due to continuing anti-government protests.

Want to Stop Russia From Messing With Our Democracy? Rethink U.S. Counterintelligence.Politico.comOctober 7, 2019 Monday 10:02 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1378 wordsBodyNews that hackers backed by the Iranian government targeted a 2020 presidential campaign brings back vivid flashbacks of Russia's infiltration into the 2016 election-and raises concerns about what could happen next year. Congress is still investigating Russia's attempts to undermine U.S. democracy last election cycle, while dedicated intelligence and law enforcement officers, diplomatic, security and military personnel are doubling down on their efforts to keep it from happening again. But looking back will not be enough to keep it from happening again-whether at the hands of Russia, Iran or any other foreign adversary. In all the reports and hearings over the past  2½ years, no one has identified the real problem: U.S. counterintelligence is not set up to preempt foreign intelligence operations directed against the United States. If the government doesn't empower U.S. counterintelligence to go on offense, we are destined to remain on our back feet.It's not only our elections that are under assault. Russian intelligence services have been on a global offensive under President Vladimir Putin. They are poisoning people in England, working to undermine the hard-won beginnings of democracy in Eastern Europe and propping up brutal dictators like Bashar Assad in Syria. They're running aggressive operations to recruit and plant spies, steal America's most closely guarded secrets, and hack into our computer systems to take what they want and disrupt our society at will. Moscow is far from alone, as evidenced by China's increasing efforts to recruit U.S. officials, ongoing cyberattacks, influence operations and defense technology theft. According to press reports, at least 20 CIA sources were executed by the Chinese government between 2010 and 2012-a sweeping roundup of men and women in China who had risked their lives providing information about Chinese plans and capabilities directed against the United States and our allies. It was a devastating blow to U.S. intelligence and to the policymakers and operators who depend on that intelligence to make critical decisions.Similarly, targeting of U.S. business and industry-especially by the Chinese-to steal proprietary information and acquire key assets  is a purposeful, strategically orchestrated undertaking, in which foreign intelligence services play integral roles. There are trillions of dollars at stake, yet the principal U.S. response has been to chase export control violations and industrial security incident reports while we continue to lose ground.It's time U.S. counterintelligence went on the offense. Hostile intelligence operations are not uncontrollable forces of nature. Some can be deterred, and all have vulnerabilities that can be exploited given sufficient time, resources and creativity. But here is the problem. Apart from the CIA's approach to the KGB during the Cold War, American counterintelligence has never had a standing strategic mission of finding and disabling hostile intelligence services before they target the United States. As a result, U.S. counterintelligence is not wired to preempt. Unlike most other governments, the United States has never had a unified organization or a national counterintelligence "service" to carry out CI operations. Instead, the U.S. has a siloed system, with each branch organized, trained and equipped to accomplish agency-specific objectives. In simple terms, the FBI's job is to find the spies in the U.S. and arrest them, the CIA's job is to make sure our spies abroad succeed, and the military's job is to protect U.S. troops against enemy intelligence operations. These are all vital CI missions, but all the incentives are to work one case at a time-Did we catch the spy? Did we find the hidden microphone or the embedded microchip? Did we expose the front company?- instead of going after the foreign service as a whole to disrupt its operations. There is no centralized planning to assess hostile intelligence services and their vulnerabilities-How and where do they operate? How are they resourced, trained, tasked? Who are their leaders, their American targets officers, their liaison relationships?-in order to devise a coherent strategy to stop them.This is a big problem. The rich diversity of complementary skills and capabilities across the CI enterprise should be an inherent strength of the United States, but without a national program to provide strategic direction or integration, America's counterintelligence will never be as effective as it could be. And since no one government organization has a common operating picture of foreign intelligence threats or the resources available to counter them, there are inherent holes in the CI architecture that adversaries can and do exploit. These structural flaws have been understood at least since 2002, which was the last time Congress took a hard look at U.S. counterintelligence. The country had just weathered betrayals by traitors like CIA officer Aldrich Ames, FBI special agent Robert Hanssen and DIA analyst Ana Montes, as well as the staggering theft of all U.S. nuclear design secrets by the Chinese. Something had to change. Congress decided it was time to put someone in charge. When President George W. Bush appointed me his national counterintelligence executive in 2003, I became the first statutory head of U.S. counterintelligence. I was charged with integrating and providing strategic direction to CI activities government-wide. As a first order of business, my new office conducted a top-to-bottom review and concluded that the disjointed CI model was working about as well as it could. Clearly, we needed a new way of doing business.The first national counterintelligence strategy, signed by Bush in 2005, directed that the national counterintelligence enterprise be reconfigured to be able to work together to go on offense. A national team would do the centralized strategic planning; the execution would be distributed to the FBI, CIA and the Defense Department. The goal was to exploit where we can, and interdict where we must, degrading adversary intelligence services and their ability to operate against us.But just as our work was getting underway, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence  was established, along with a new bureaucracy that had other priorities. The realignment of U.S. counterintelligence was put on hold indefinitely as the Bush and Obama administrations concentrated effort and resources on the war on terror. The prototype CI program we had designed was stripped of funding and never renewed. In 2014, my old position (which had been moved under the DNI) was renamed director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center. Most of the director's time has been consumed by raising awareness of security concerns and the grievous harm caused by insiders like Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning. At best, we're back to where we started  in 2002. America is paying the price. It's not only the high cost in lives lost, which have been tragic, or treasure taken. It's the uncertainty interjected across the U.S. defense infrastructure, American diplomatic initiatives, intelligence efforts, global competitiveness and now even our democratic institutions-today and for decades to come. The next move is up to Congress. As they consider how to respond to foreign interference in U.S. elections, the oversight committees should take a serious look at the stalled modernization of America's counterintelligence enterprise and the performance of the national CI office. I think they will find that the United States needs a national-level strategic counterintelligence program to shake free creative thinking and desperately needed new energy to get inside hostile intelligence services, find their vulnerabilities and disrupt their operations. When all of dust settles, the hearings conclude and the investigations are behind us, the Russian, Chinese, Iranian and other adversary services will still be hard at work, looking for the next opening to corrupt the workings of our democracy, weaken our allies, steal our secrets and hold America's security at risk. No one wants the next question to be: Why didn't Congress do more to stop them?Article originally published on POLITICO MagazineLoad-Date: October 15, 2019End of Document

Liberals, conservatives hammer Apple for removing Hong Kong appPolitico.comOctober 10, 2019 Thursday 6:03 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 782 wordsByline: soverly@politico.com,  (Steven Overly)Highlight: Supporters of the app say it helps protesters avoid being drawn into confrontations with police.BodyU.S. lawmakers on both sides of the aisle lambasted Apple and its CEO Tim Cook over the iPhone maker's decision to remove an app that allowed protesters in Hong Kong to track the movements of police."Apple is yet another capitalist who'll sell rope to communists to hang us," Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) tweeted Thursday morning."An authoritarian regime is violently suppressing its own citizens who are fighting for democracy," Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) added. "Apple just sided with them."The criticisms come after Apple and Google, which owns the Android smartphone operating system, have removed apps related to the Hong Kong protests amid scrutiny from state media controlled by China's Communist Party. Police and protesters have been clashing for months over concerns the mainland Chinese government is eroding Hong Kong's more liberalized political system.Apple has seen the brunt of the rebukes over spiking the police-tracking app, dubbed HKmap.live, whose supporters say helps protesters avoid being drawn into confrontations with police.As far back as 1998, Apple has faced criticism for complying with demands placed upon it by the Chinese government. But this development comes as China increasingly seeks to exert pressure on multinational corporations as the country seeks to assert global power and recapture aggressive growth to turn around its flagging economy.The NBA and Disney are among a growing list of giant companies and organizations also drawing blowback for taking action that appears designed to appease China (in their cases, quelling employee statements of support for Hong Kong protesters).But tech companies have long billed themselves as champions of free expression and defenders of their users against government abuses. Apple drew plaudits from civil libertarians both right and left for refusing to comply with the Obama administration's demands to unlock an iPhone used by one of the perpetrators of a 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.Now, Capitol Hill critics contend the company is allowing itself to be cowed by China, which represents a multibillion-dollar market for the company and is the origin point for many Apple products' supply chains.Apple began investigating the HKmap.live app after receiving complaints from "many concerned customers" and it was removed for violating both Apple's guidelines and local laws, the company said."The app displays police locations and we have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement," Apple said in a statement.The Google version of the HKmap.live app, meanwhile, is still available globally, a company spokesperson said.The Hong Kong Police Force did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Apple's explanation wasn't enough to placate lawmakers like Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), who first criticized the company last week, after reports surfaced then that the app had been banned."Apple assured me last week that their initial decision to ban this app was a mistake," Hawley tweeted Thursday. "Looks like the Chinese censors have had a word with them since. Who is really running Apple? Tim Cook or Beijing?"And last night, Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) had a rebuke of his own for the company: "It's time for Apple to stand up to Communist China. American companies should never be censored or told what to do by foreign adversaries," he tweeted.A Twitter account appearing to represent the creators of HKmap.live defended the app in a series of posts, asserting there is zero evidence to indicate the app has been used to target police or victims, and that the app does not "solicit, promote, or encourage criminal activity.""We once believed the App rejection is simply a bureaucratic f up, but now it is clearly a political decision to suppress freedom and human right [sic] in Hong Kong," the creators tweeted.For its part, Google took down a game called "The Revolution of Our Times" that allowed users to role play as Hong Kong protesters. A Google spokesperson said the company has a long-standing policy against applications "capitalizing on sensitive events" and denied that the company removed the app at the request of Hong Kong police, as the Wall Street Journal reported."After careful review, we found this app to be violating that particular policy and suspended it, as we have done with similar attempts to profit from other high-profile events such as earthquakes, crises, suicides and conflicts," the spokesperson said.Article originally published on POLITICO MagazineLoad-Date: October 11, 2019End of Document

Dec: 1345Moving the MarketSector Watch-- Stock market trades little changed after yesterday's earnings-driven rally; relative weakness in software stocks-- Retail sales unexpectedly decline in September -- Bank earnings come in better than expectedStrong: Materials, Consumer Discretionary, FinancialsWeak: Information Technology, Real Estate11:25 ETDow -10.30 at 27014.5, Nasdaq -18.49 at 8130.22, S&P -2.22 at 2993.46[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains trading just below its unchanged mark with a 0.1% loss. Some uncertainty on the Brexit and U.S.-China trade fronts has some investors feeling less optimistic today.Specifically, there have been reports that a Brexit agreement by Oct. 31 continues to see some hurdles, while China has threatened "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. should the Senate pass a legislation that supports protesters in Hong Kong. The House passed the bill yesterday, which prompted the response that could complicate a trade deal with China.In the health care space, The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson Corporation (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, which would be phased over 18 years.10:55 ETDow -17.81 at 27006.99, Nasdaq -13.04 at 8135.67, S&P -0.66 at 2995.02[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade just below their flat lines after increasing about 1% apiece yesterday. The S&P 500 is flat, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.2%.Earnings season began in earnest yesterday, and results have come in mostly better than expected today. Bank of America (BAC 30.33, +0.60, +2.0%), J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 114.96, +3.36, +3.0%), and United Airlines (UAL 89.54, +1.64, +1.9%) are some notable earnings gainers. JBHT did miss earnings estimates, though.Separately, Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) recently said he doesn't think more rate cuts are needed this year, according to CNBC. Mr. Evans' comments have been met with muted reaction, as the market still expects a 25-basis points rate cut at the October FOMC meeting.10:25 ETDow -30.96 at 26993.84, Nasdaq -20.26 at 8128.45, S&P -3.12 at 2992.56[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to hold a modest 0.2% decline. Macro news and retail sales data have been attributed to today's negative bias, but today could simply be a breather from a recent stretch of gains. Entering today, the benchmark index was up 4.9% from its low on Oct. 3.Noticeable weakness in the software stocks after an uninspiring analyst day for Workday (WDAY 160.50, -20.52, -11.3%) has had a more noticeable effect on the market.

The S&P 500 opened just 0.3% higher, and it quickly pushed to session highs amid news that the EU and UK are nearing a draft Brexit deal and that General Motors (GM 36.26, +0.76, +2.1%) and the UAW could also reach a deal soon. Although nothing was finalized, the optimism helped solidify a risk-on mindset following today's batch of better-than-feared earnings results.The benchmark index traded around the 3000 level for most of the session, supported by gains in nine of its 11 sectors. The health care sector (+1.8%) provided the leadership, followed by the communication services (+1.6%) and financials (+1.3%) sectors. The consumer staples (-0.4%) and utilities (-0.3%) sectors ended the day lower.Wells Fargo (WFC 50.07, +0.80, +1.6%), Citigroup (C 71.23, +0.99, +1.4%), and Goldman Sachs (GS 206.41, +0.59, +0.3%) each began the day in negative territory after the banks provided mixed results, but a turnaround in shares provided extra support for the early move higher.Elsewhere, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+2.2%) set a new all-time high on Tuesday. 29 of its 30 components finished higher, with NVIDIA (NVDA 196.37, +9.84, +5.3%) advancing the most after its price target was raised to $250 from $225 at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Trade news continued to make headlines, although the muted reaction likely reflected some exhaustion to trade speculation. "People familiar with the matter" told Bloomberg News that China may struggle fulfilling part of its agreement to purchase $50 billion of U.S. agricultural goods unless President Trump lifts retaliatory tariffs.U.S. Treasuries finished near their session lows, leaving yields slightly higher. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 98.31.

Some uncertainty on the Brexit and U.S.-China trade fronts has some investors feeling less optimistic today.Specifically, there have been reports that a Brexit agreement by Oct. 31 continues to see some hurdles, while China has threatened "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. should the Senate pass a legislation that supports protesters in Hong Kong. The House passed the bill yesterday, which prompted the response that could complicate a trade deal with China.In the health care space, The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson Corporation (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, which would be phased over 18 years.10:55 ETDow -17.81 at 27006.99, Nasdaq -13.04 at 8135.67, S&P -0.66 at 2995.02[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade just below their flat lines after increasing about 1% apiece yesterday. The S&P 500 is flat, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.2%.Earnings season began in earnest yesterday, and results have come in mostly better than expected today. Bank of America (BAC 30.33, +0.60, +2.0%), J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 114.96, +3.36, +3.0%), and United Airlines (UAL 89.54, +1.64, +1.9%) are some notable earnings gainers. JBHT did miss earnings estimates, though.Separately, Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) recently said he doesn't think more rate cuts are needed this year, according to CNBC. Mr. Evans' comments have been met with muted reaction, as the market still expects a 25-basis points rate cut at the October FOMC meeting.10:25 ETDow -30.96 at 26993.84, Nasdaq -20.26 at 8128.45, S&P -3.12 at 2992.56[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to hold a modest 0.2% decline. Macro news and retail sales data have been attributed to today's negative bias, but today could simply be a breather from a recent stretch of gains. Entering today, the benchmark index was up 4.9% from its low on Oct. 3.Noticeable weakness in the software stocks after an uninspiring analyst day for Workday (WDAY 160.50, -20.52, -11.3%) has had a more noticeable effect on the market. Morgan Stanley also cut its price target on several software stocks, including VMware (VMW 152.22, -2.32, -1.5%).The S&P 500 information technology sector is down 0.8% and is today's laggard.10:00 ETDow -60.37 at 26964.43, Nasdaq -37.71 at 8111, S&P -8.13 at 2987.55[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.3%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.1%.Just in, business inventories were unchanged for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%).

The S&P 500 opened just 0.3% higher, and it quickly pushed to session highs amid news that the EU and UK are nearing a draft Brexit deal and that General Motors (GM 36.26, +0.76, +2.1%) and the UAW could also reach a deal soon. Although nothing was finalized, the optimism helped solidify a risk-on mindset following today's batch of better-than-feared earnings results.The benchmark index traded around the 3000 level for most of the session, supported by gains in nine of its 11 sectors. The health care sector (+1.8%) provided the leadership, followed by the communication services (+1.6%) and financials (+1.3%) sectors. The consumer staples (-0.4%) and utilities (-0.3%) sectors ended the day lower.Wells Fargo (WFC 50.07, +0.80, +1.6%), Citigroup (C 71.23, +0.99, +1.4%), and Goldman Sachs (GS 206.41, +0.59, +0.3%) each began the day in negative territory after the banks provided mixed results, but a turnaround in shares provided extra support for the early move higher.Elsewhere, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+2.2%) set a new all-time high on Tuesday. 29 of its 30 components finished higher, with NVIDIA (NVDA 196.37, +9.84, +5.3%) advancing the most after its price target was raised to $250 from $225 at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Trade news continued to make headlines, although the muted reaction likely reflected some exhaustion to trade speculation. "People familiar with the matter" told Bloomberg News that China may struggle fulfilling part of its agreement to purchase $50 billion of U.S. agricultural goods unless President Trump lifts retaliatory tariffs.U.S. Treasuries finished near their session lows, leaving yields slightly higher. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 98.31. WTI crude declined 1.4%, or $0.76, to $53.55/bbl.Tuesday's economic data was limited to the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for October, which increased to 4.0 (Briefing.com consensus -1.0) from 2.0.

ISIS is reportedly using popular Gen Z app TikTok as its newest recruitment toolBusiness Insider USOctober 21, 2019 Monday 05:52 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 644 wordsByline: mmeisenzahl@businessinsider.com,  (Mary Meisenzahl)Highlight: Members of the Islamic State have reportedly posted propaganda videos on TikTok of fighters and young women, which have since been deleted.BodyReuters• TikTokhas removed about two-dozen accounts that posted Islamic State propaganda, according to            The Wall Street Journal.• The short-form video app has thousands of moderators in China and the US.• The platform has been accused of going too far in removing sensitive content, allegedly censoring controversial posts that could anger China.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.Short-form video platform TikTok has removed two-dozen accounts for posting propaganda for the Islamic State, Georgia Wells at The Wall Street Journal reported.Videos featuring ISIS fighters with guns, corpses, and Islamic State songs were posted to the app, according to the Journal. Some of the videos reportedly targeted potential future fighters, with shots glorifying militants set to ISIS songs. Others seemed to target young girls, reportedly using the term "jihad lover," and women calling themselves "jihadist and proud." The videos also used TikTok's in-app features, like filters and hearts.Promoting terrorism is specifically banned under TikTok's community policy, which states that terrorist organizations and any other criminal organizations are banned from using TikTok. A TikTok spokesperson told Business Insider: "Content promoting terrorist organizations has absolutely no place on TikTok. We permanently ban any such accounts and associated devices as soon as identified, and we continuously develop ever-stronger controls to proactively detect suspicious activity. This is an industry-wide challenge complicated by bad actors who actively seek to circumvent protective measures, but we have a team dedicated to aggressively protecting against malicious behavior on TikTok."Read more: Trading in your smartphone could be a 'ticking time bomb' for your personal data - here's how one expert says you can protect yourselfThe Islamic State has recruited members through social media since the group's infancy, which has caused trouble for other tech companies like Facebook as it tries to delete content that promotes violence, in accordance with its            community standards. TikTok now has thousands of content moderators in China and the US, according to the Journal.While other tech companies like Facebook have been criticized for not removing terrorist content - like footage from the Christchurch shooting - quickly enough, TikTok has reportedly been too quick to censor videos, especially those dealing with topics that might anger the Chinese government.Earlier this month, TikTok hired a US law firm, including two former lawmakers, to help it revise content moderation policies.            The Guardian reported in September on internal documents from Chinese parent company ByteDance instructing moderators to censor content about controversial topics likely to upset the Chinese government, like Tiananmen Square and Tibetan independence.            Sen. Marco Rubio has since asked the federal government to investigate the company for censoring content at China's request.TikTok has wide reach as a propaganda tool. Parent company ByteDance is the highest-valued private company in the world, and in September, TikTok was the top free non-gaming app. One-third of the app's users are under 18, the Journal reported.NOW WATCH: Amazon is reportedly seeking a new space in New York City.

This is just off the session high of 3006.50 and left the overnight low sitting at 2985.25.In Asia, both the Nikkei and Shanghai closed fractionally lower on the day.

The Nikkei was led lower by tech stocks. Tokyo Electron fell 9% after chip peer ASML saw weakness following earnings on Wednesday. In Europe, the major bourses are witnessing a mixed tape with the FTSE outpacing the region. The status of Brexit talks remain the key focus. The British Pound has seen a volatile session and is up nearly 1%. This has not weighed on the FTSE, however. Outside of the UK, the markets have seen more of a cautious environment. Automakers are notably stronger with Daimler and BMW both showing gains of greater than 0.5%.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: +14.010 yr Note: 1.79%USD/JPY: 108.90 +0.13EUR/USD: 1.1117 +0.0045Europe: FTSE +0.6% DAX +0.3% CAC -0.1%Asia: Hang Seng +0.7% Shanghai -0.1% Nikkei -0.1%Gold (1488.90 -5.10) Silver (17.44 +0.01) Crude (53.18 -0.18)17:49EGO Eldorado Gold reports preliminary Q3 results; production guidance for 2019 remains unchanged (7.39 +0.16)Total gold production was 101,596 ounces for the third quarter and 276,376 ounces year-to-date. Guidance for 2019 remains unchanged. Recent test results from Kisladag confirm that recoveries from leaching deeper material over 250-day cycles support an extension of mine life beyond the company's current three-year guidance. Waste stripping to support a mine life extension will commence prior to the end of October. Test work is still ongoing to determine the ultimate heap leach recovery of this material and thus the ultimate length of the mine life extension. Waste stripping over the remainder of 2019 is expected to minimize production interruptions in 2020 and beyond. Estimated expenditure for waste stripping in 2019 is $4 mln. Production at Olympias was lower than plan. During the third quarter, measures to increase production volumes were continued in key areas of the operation and will support the ramp up towards 2020 and beyond. These measures included increased capital development resources and other operational improvement initiatives.17:37WTFC Wintrust Fin beats by $0.07, beats on revs (64.50 -0.29)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.69 per share, $0.07 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.62; revenues rose 9.4% year/year to $380 mln vs the $374.98 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.17:36CCK Crown reports EPS in-line, misses on revs; guides Q4 EPS below consensus (63.53 +0.67)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.56 per share, excluding non-recurring items, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.56; revenues fell 2.8% year/year to $3.08 bln vs the $3.19 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

This results is down $67 mln from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower alumina pricing that was partially offset by higher alumina sales volume and lower production costs.Co says a new operating model, which goes into effect on November 1, 2019, will result in a leaner corporate structure, with operations more closely connected to leadership, through elimination of the co's business unit structure and consolidation of sales, procurement and other commercial capabilities at an enterprise level.In addition to reporting quarterly results, co also announces a multi-year portfolio review to drive lower costs and sustainable profitability.

The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%) closed slightly lower, while the Russell 2000 (+0.1%) inched higher.The positive reaction to today's batch of earnings reports was limited to shares of companies that reported, namely Bank of America (BAC 30.18, +0.45, +1.5%), United Airlines (UAL 89.70, +1.82, +2.1%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 115.65, +4.05, +3.6%), as opposed to Tuesday's earnings-driven rally. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors closed near their flat lines.The energy sector (-1.5%) was today's laggard despite an increase in oil prices ($53.42/bbl, +0.63, +1.2%), followed by the information technology sector (-0.7%) amid weakness in the software stocks. The consumer discretionary sector (+0.4%) outperformed despite an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The relatively conservative spending did follow an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August, which presumably allayed an overreaction among sellers. Still, the headline figure could feed into the slowdown narrative for the U.S. economy, especially when uncertainty remains on the U.S.-China trade front.On Wednesday, China threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. after the House of Representatives approved legislation to support pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The Senate has yet to vote on the measures, but the situation could complicate the completion of the first phase of a trade deal with the U.S.In other potential deals, General Motors (GM 36.65, +0.39, +1.1%) and the UAW reached a tentative agreement that could end the monthlong strike at GM. McKesson (MCK 144.84, +6.67, +4.8%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.07, +1.17, +2.4%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 86.05, +2.85, +3.4%) began talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note, leaving yields slightly lower. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield both declined two basis points each to 1.59% and 1.75%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 98.02.Reviewing Wednesday's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive Housing Starts and Building Permits for September, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for September, the Philadelphia Fed Index for October, and the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +22.4% YTDS&P 500 +19.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.8% YTDRussell 2000 +13.1% YTD16:13NFLX Netflix beats by $0.04, reports revs in-line with U.S. subs below guidance and international subs slightly above; guides Q4 subs, EPS and revs below consensus (286.28 +2.03)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.09 per share excluding an unrealized gain from euro denominated bonds, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.05; revenues rose 31.2% year/year to $5.25 bln vs the $5.25 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Total paid net adds of 6.8m increased 12% year over year and was an all-time Q3 record. Operating margin of 18.7% (up 670 bps year over year) was above guidance due to timing of content and marketing spend, which will be more weighted to Q4'19. In the US, paid net adds totaled 0.5m in Q3 vs. our 0.8m forecast, and year to date paid net adds are 2.1m vs. 4.1m in the first nine months of 2018. Since our US price increase earlier this year, retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower US membership growth. revenue growth has been accelerating as US ARPU increased 16.5% year over year in Q3. International paid net additions totaled 6.3m in Q3, a 23% increase vs. 5.1m in the year ago quarter, and slightly above our 6.2m guidance forecast. The US dollar strengthened vs. several key currencies over the course of the quarter, which resulted in the variance between our forecasted vs. actual international revenue. International ARPU, excluding the impact of F/X, rose 10% year over year. We're making strides in our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing encouraging signs of progress.Co issues downside guidance for Q4, sees EPS of $0.51 vs. $0.85 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q4 revs of $5.442 bln vs. $5.51 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.For Q4, we're expecting consolidated revenue to increase 30% year over year with 9% streaming ARPU growth. We're forecasting 7.6m global paid net adds (vs. 9.5 mln estimates and 8.8m last Q4), with 0.6m in the US and 7.0m for the international segment. This implies full year 2019 paid net adds of 26.7m, down from 28.6m last year. While we had previously expected 2019 paid net adds to be up year over year, our current forecast reflects several factors including less precision in our ability to forecast the impact of our Q4 content slate, which consists of several new big IP launches (as opposed to returning seasons), the minor elevated churn in response to some price changes, and new forthcoming competition. Our long term outlook on our business is unchanged. We're on track to achieve our full year 2019 operating margin goal of 13%. In 2020, we'll be targeting another 300 basis points in operating margin expansion, consistent with the annual margin improvement we've delivered each year since 2017. Competition: There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long-term, though, we expect we'll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity. For the full year 2019, we're still expecting FCF of ~-$3.5 billion. With our quickly growing revenue base and expanding operating margins, we will be able to fund more of our content spending internally. As a result, we're expecting free cash flow to improve in 2020 vs. 2019 and we expect to continue to improve annually beyond 2020. Starting with our Q4'19 earnings report in January 2020, we plan to disclose revenue and membership by region16:12CRZO Carrizo Oil & Gas provides third quarter operational update; expects production volumes of 69,500-69,600 Boe/d (7.81 +0.14)Production volumes during the third quarter of 2019 are currently expected to be 69,500-69,600 Boe/d, an increase of approx. 6% from the second quarter.

The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%) closed slightly lower, while the Russell 2000 (+0.1%) inched higher.The positive reaction to today's batch of earnings reports was limited to shares of companies that reported, namely Bank of America (BAC 30.18, +0.45, +1.5%), United Airlines (UAL 89.70, +1.82, +2.1%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 115.65, +4.05, +3.6%), as opposed to Tuesday's earnings-driven rally. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors closed near their flat lines.The energy sector (-1.5%) was today's laggard despite an increase in oil prices ($53.42/bbl, +0.63, +1.2%), followed by the information technology sector (-0.7%) amid weakness in the software stocks. The consumer discretionary sector (+0.4%) outperformed despite an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The relatively conservative spending did follow an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August, which presumably allayed an overreaction among sellers. Still, the headline figure could feed into the slowdown narrative for the U.S. economy, especially when uncertainty remains on the U.S.-China trade front.On Wednesday, China threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. after the House of Representatives approved legislation to support pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The Senate has yet to vote on the measures, but the situation could complicate the completion of the first phase of a trade deal with the U.S.In other potential deals, General Motors (GM 36.65, +0.39, +1.1%) and the UAW reached a tentative agreement that could end the monthlong strike at GM. McKesson (MCK 144.84, +6.67, +4.8%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.07, +1.17, +2.4%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 86.05, +2.85, +3.4%) began talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note, leaving yields slightly lower. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield both declined two basis points each to 1.59% and 1.75%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 98.02.Reviewing Wednesday's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive Housing Starts and Building Permits for September, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for September, the Philadelphia Fed Index for October, and the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +22.4% YTDS&P 500 +19.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.8% YTDRussell 2000 +13.1% YTD16:13NFLX Netflix beats by $0.04, reports revs in-line with U.S. subs below guidance and international subs slightly above; guides Q4 subs, EPS and revs below consensus (286.28 +2.03)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.09 per share excluding an unrealized gain from euro denominated bonds, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.05; revenues rose 31.2% year/year to $5.25 bln vs the $5.25 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Total paid net adds of 6.8m increased 12% year over year and was an all-time Q3 record. Operating margin of 18.7% (up 670 bps year over year) was above guidance due to timing of content and marketing spend, which will be more weighted to Q4'19. In the US, paid net adds totaled 0.5m in Q3 vs. our 0.8m forecast, and year to date paid net adds are 2.1m vs. 4.1m in the first nine months of 2018. Since our US price increase earlier this year, retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower US membership growth. revenue growth has been accelerating as US ARPU increased 16.5% year over year in Q3. International paid net additions totaled 6.3m in Q3, a 23% increase vs. 5.1m in the year ago quarter, and slightly above our 6.2m guidance forecast. The US dollar strengthened vs. several key currencies over the course of the quarter, which resulted in the variance between our forecasted vs. actual international revenue. International ARPU, excluding the impact of F/X, rose 10% year over year. We're making strides in our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing encouraging signs of progress.Co issues downside guidance for Q4, sees EPS of $0.51 vs. $0.85 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q4 revs of $5.442 bln vs. $5.51 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.For Q4, we're expecting consolidated revenue to increase 30% year over year with 9% streaming ARPU growth. We're forecasting 7.6m global paid net adds (vs. 9.5 mln estimates and 8.8m last Q4), with 0.6m in the US and 7.0m for the international segment. This implies full year 2019 paid net adds of 26.7m, down from 28.6m last year. While we had previously expected 2019 paid net adds to be up year over year, our current forecast reflects several factors including less precision in our ability to forecast the impact of our Q4 content slate, which consists of several new big IP launches (as opposed to returning seasons), the minor elevated churn in response to some price changes, and new forthcoming competition. Our long term outlook on our business is unchanged. We're on track to achieve our full year 2019 operating margin goal of 13%. In 2020, we'll be targeting another 300 basis points in operating margin expansion, consistent with the annual margin improvement we've delivered each year since 2017. Competition: There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long-term, though, we expect we'll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity. For the full year 2019, we're still expecting FCF of ~-$3.5 billion. With our quickly growing revenue base and expanding operating margins, we will be able to fund more of our content spending internally. As a result, we're expecting free cash flow to improve in 2020 vs. 2019 and we expect to continue to improve annually beyond 2020. Starting with our Q4'19 earnings report in January 2020, we plan to disclose revenue and membership by region16:12CRZO Carrizo Oil & Gas provides third quarter operational update; expects production volumes of 69,500-69,600 Boe/d (7.81 +0.14)Production volumes during the third quarter of 2019 are currently expected to be 69,500-69,600 Boe/d, an increase of approx. 6% from the second quarter.

Adjusted EBITDA is currently estimated to be approximately 3 percent below budget, primarily due to the delay in Elba's in-service date, lower commodity prices and volumes impacting the CO2 segment, and the impact of 501-G settlements, partially offset by the strong performance of the West Region Natural Gas16:06CGNX Cognex acquires industrial machine vision software developer SUALAB (48.88 -0.26)SUALAB is a Korean-based developer of vision software using deep learning for industrial applications.

The S&P 500 is down 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the information technology sector (-0.8%) exerting an influential drag on the broader market.

The latter is viewed as a complication in getting the first part of a trade deal written out.Reaction to the release of the retail sales report for September, which unexpectedly declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), has been relatively muted. The reading followed an upwards revision of 0.6% in August (from 0.4%). The 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.74%.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -4.40.

United Airlines (UAL 89.10, +1.22, +1.4%) also topped earnings estimates and raised its FY19 EPS guidance.

Although nothing was finalized, the optimism helped solidify a risk-on mindset following today's batch of better-than-feared earnings results.The benchmark index traded around the 3000 level for most of the session, supported by gains in nine of its 11 sectors. The health care sector (+1.8%) provided the leadership, followed by the communication services (+1.6%) and financials (+1.3%) sectors. The consumer staples (-0.4%) and utilities (-0.3%) sectors ended the day lower.Wells Fargo (WFC 50.07, +0.80, +1.6%), Citigroup (C 71.23, +0.99, +1.4%), and Goldman Sachs (GS 206.41, +0.59, +0.3%) each began the day in negative territory after the banks provided mixed results, but a turnaround in shares provided extra support for the early move higher.Elsewhere, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+2.2%) set a new all-time high on Tuesday. 29 of its 30 components finished higher, with NVIDIA (NVDA 196.37, +9.84, +5.3%) advancing the most after its price target was raised to $250 from $225 at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Trade news continued to make headlines, although the muted reaction likely reflected some exhaustion to trade speculation. "People familiar with the matter" told Bloomberg News that China may struggle fulfilling part of its agreement to purchase $50 billion of U.S. agricultural goods unless President Trump lifts retaliatory tariffs.U.S. Treasuries finished near their session lows, leaving yields slightly higher.

The S&P 500 is down 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the information technology sector (-0.8%) exerting an influential drag on the broader market.

The latter is viewed as a complication in getting the first part of a trade deal written out.Reaction to the release of the retail sales report for September, which unexpectedly declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), has been relatively muted. The reading followed an upwards revision of 0.6% in August (from 0.4%). The 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.74%.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -4.40.

Today, investors continue to assess incoming earnings reports, U.S.-China trade relations, and an elusive Brexit deal.Bank of America (BAC 30.37, +0.64, +2.2%) headlines today's batch of bank earnings, and results have come in better than expected. United Airlines (UAL 89.10, +1.22, +1.4%) also topped earnings estimates and raised its FY19 EPS guidance. Overall, results have been better than feared, but political uncertainty has tempered sentiment.For instance, China warned it would take "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. if it passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The House of Representative passed the bill, but it remains uncertain when the Senate would vote. Elsewhere, some uncertainty remains on a modified Brexit deal despite reports yesterday indicating a draft deal was near.On the data front, investors will receive Retail Sales for September (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) at 8:30 a.m. ET, Business Inventories for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%) at 10:00 a.m. ET, the Fed's Beige Book for October at 2:00 p.m. ET, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for August at 4:00 p.m. ET.

The S&P 500 opened just 0.3% higher, and it quickly pushed to session highs amid news that the EU and UK are nearing a draft Brexit deal and that General Motors (GM 36.26, +0.76, +2.1%) and the UAW could also reach a deal soon. Although nothing was finalized, the optimism helped solidify a risk-on mindset following today's batch of better-than-feared earnings results.The benchmark index traded around the 3000 level for most of the session, supported by gains in nine of its 11 sectors.

Macro news and retail sales data have been attributed to today's negative bias, but today could also be simply a breather from a recent stretch of gains. Entering today, the benchmark index was up 4.9% from its low on Oct. 3.Noticeable weakness in the software stocks after an uninspiring analyst day for Workday (WDAY 160.50, -20.52, -11.3%) has had a more noticeable effect on the market. Morgan Stanley also cut its price target on several software stocks, including VMware (VMW 152.22, -2.32, -1.5%).The S&P 500 information technology sector is down 0.8% and is today's laggard.10:00 ETDow -60.37 at 26964.43, Nasdaq -37.71 at 8111, S&P -8.13 at 2987.55[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.3%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.1%.Just in, business inventories were unchanged for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%). The July reading was revised to 0.3% (from 0.4%).Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.09:40 ETDow -15.78 at 27009.02, Nasdaq -24.99 at 8123.72, S&P -4.35 at 2991.33[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day slightly lower, retracing some of yesterday's earnings-driven rally. The S&P 500 is down 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the information technology sector (-0.8%) exerting an influential drag on the broader market. The materials (+0.2%), consumer discretionary (+0.2%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors hold slim gains.U.S. Treasuries are up slightly, which has yields slightly lower today. The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 98.18. WTI crude is up 0.2% to $52.93/bbl.09:15 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -3.60. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -17.30.Wall Street is indicated to open slightly lower as the S&P 500 futures trade four points, or 0.1%, below fair value. Earnings news has been upbeat, although some macro news is presumably keeping the market in check after yesterday's rally.Earnings results have come in mostly better than expected today, with shares of Bank of America (BAC 30.38, +0.65, +2.2%) and United Airlines (UAL 89.60, +1.72, +2.0%) up 2% in pre-market action following their results.As for macro news, there has been some renewed uncertainty about a Brexit deal and some angst about China threatening countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Hong. The latter is viewed as a complication in getting the first part of a trade deal written out.Reaction to the release of the retail sales report for September, which unexpectedly declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), has been relatively muted. The reading followed an upwards revision of 0.6% in August (from 0.4%). The 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.74%.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -4.40.

The consumer staples (-0.4%) and utilities (-0.3%) sectors ended the day lower.Wells Fargo (WFC 50.07, +0.80, +1.6%), Citigroup (C 71.23, +0.99, +1.4%), and Goldman Sachs (GS 206.41, +0.59, +0.3%) each began the day in negative territory after the banks provided mixed results, but a turnaround in shares provided extra support for the early move higher.Elsewhere, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+2.2%) set a new all-time high on Tuesday. 29 of its 30 components finished higher, with NVIDIA (NVDA 196.37, +9.84, +5.3%) advancing the most after its price target was raised to $250 from $225 at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Trade news continued to make headlines, although the muted reaction likely reflected some exhaustion to trade speculation. "People familiar with the matter" told Bloomberg News that China may struggle fulfilling part of its agreement to purchase $50 billion of U.S. agricultural goods unless President Trump lifts retaliatory tariffs.U.S. Treasuries finished near their session lows, leaving yields slightly higher. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 98.31.

Macro news and retail sales data have been attributed to today's negative bias, but today could simply be a breather from a recent stretch of gains. Entering today, the benchmark index was up 4.9% from its low on Oct. 3.Noticeable weakness in the software stocks after an uninspiring analyst day for Workday (WDAY 160.50, -20.52, -11.3%) has had a more noticeable effect on the market.

The latter is viewed as a complication in getting the first part of a trade deal written out.Reaction to the release of the retail sales report for September, which unexpectedly declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), has been relatively muted.

Today, investors continue to assess incoming earnings reports, U.S.-China trade relations, and an elusive Brexit deal.Bank of America (BAC 30.37, +0.64, +2.2%) headlines today's batch of bank earnings, and results have come in better than expected. United Airlines (UAL 89.10, +1.22, +1.4%) also topped earnings estimates and raised its FY19 EPS guidance. Overall, results have been better than feared, but political uncertainty has tempered sentiment.For instance, China warned it would take "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. if it passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The House of Representative passed the bill, but it remains uncertain when the Senate would vote. Elsewhere, some uncertainty remains on a modified Brexit deal despite reports yesterday indicating a draft deal was near.On the data front, investors will receive Retail Sales for September (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) at 8:30 a.m. ET, Business Inventories for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%) at 10:00 a.m. ET, the Fed's Beige Book for October at 2:00 p.m. ET, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for August at 4:00 p.m. ET.

The S&P 500 opened just 0.3% higher, and it quickly pushed to session highs amid news that the EU and UK are nearing a draft Brexit deal and that General Motors (GM 36.26, +0.76, +2.1%) and the UAW could also reach a deal soon. Although nothing was finalized, the optimism helped solidify a risk-on mindset following today's batch of better-than-feared earnings results.The benchmark index traded around the 3000 level for most of the session, supported by gains in nine of its 11 sectors. The health care sector (+1.8%) provided the leadership, followed by the communication services (+1.6%) and financials (+1.3%) sectors.

"People familiar with the matter" told Bloomberg News that China may struggle fulfilling part of its agreement to purchase $50 billion of U.S. agricultural goods unless President Trump lifts retaliatory tariffs.U.S. Treasuries finished near their session lows, leaving yields slightly higher. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 98.31.

Stocks Slide for Second Straight Session Amid Doubts Over US-China TradeMT Newswires Live Briefs PROOctober 8, 2019 Tuesday 11:34 AM ESTCopyright 2019 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 353 wordsBody Equities in the US sank on Tuesday, declining for a second straight session amid broad losses on the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average and as financials led the widespread declines among the Standard & Poor's 500 sectors. The Dow saw all of its components slide apart from Walmart (WMT), which clung to a slim gain in mid-morning trading. The steepest declines came from technology and bank names, with Cisco Systems (CSCO) down 2.2% and IBM (IBM) shedding 2%, while JPMorgan Chase (JPM) sank 2.2% and Goldman Sachs (GS) fell 1.9%.Trade-sensitive industrials were also weaker, with Boeing (BA) falling 1.8% and Caterpillar (CAT) down 1.7% amid dimming hopes heading into US-China trade talks after the US added 28 Chinese government and commercial organizations to an export blacklist on Monday over claims of human-rights violations.In economic news, producer-price inflation for September posted a 0.3% decline on a monthly basis, the lowest since January and compared with a 0.1% rise in August. The consensus on Econoday was for another 0.1% print."Should this lack of price pressure carry over into the CPI and PCE, coupled with ongoing weakness in the data, it will be increasingly difficult for the Fed to bypass the upcoming October FOMC meeting without offering a third-round rate cut," said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist with Stifel Economics.The prospect of rate cuts couldn't lift up stocks, though. In company news, Domino's Pizza (DPZ) recouped losses  made after disappointing quarterly results to trade 2.4% higher amid reports the restaurant chain outlined plans for a stock buyback program on a conference call with investors.Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) sank 19% after saying its chief commercial officer, Steven Lo, will resign. He's joining Zosano Pharma (ZSAN), it said separately, and that stock dropped 4.8%.Financials shed 1.6% in the sharpest loss among the S&P 500 sectors, while real estate and health care were both down about 1.5% and tech was 1.1% weaker. None of the 11 groups posted a gain.In morning trading, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were down 1.2% while the Dow was about 1% lower.Load-Date: October 9, 2019End of Document

Hong Kong stock exchange swoops in for London rivalAssociated Press InternationalSeptember 11, 2019 Wednesday 4:55 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 767 wordsByline: By CARLO PIOVANO, Associated PressDateline: LONDON BodyLONDON (AP) - The Hong Kong stock exchange wants to buy its London counterpart to create a $70 billion-company, a bold move that faces big hurdles and will likely raise concerns in Britain about the Chinese government's potential influence over one of the symbols of global capitalism.The London Stock Exchange, a 300-year old institution that was at the heart of a British empire that included Hong Kong, said Wednesday it would consider the cash-and-shares offer that values it at 29.6 billion pounds ($36.6 billion).A deal would give it a lucrative foothold in Asia, a fast-growing region that could be attractive if Britain ends up leaving the European Union without a deal, a scenario that would see an array of trade barriers go up with its neighbors.But while investors cheered the move, pushing shares in the LSE up 6%, many experts remained skeptical, not least because the company has been subject to various failed deals in the past.One aspect of the proposed deal that could give leaders at the London exchange and British regulators pause for thought is the fact that at least half the board, including the chairman, of the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd. is nominated by the Hong Kong government, whose leader is ultimately appointed by China's communist rulers."The proposed offer would be totemic in terms of East-West relations," said Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor. "The very nature of the Hong Kong approach will be subject to any number of considerations, such as competitive and regulatory issues."As a result, he said, it's "far from a done deal."Many Western governments are increasingly at odds with China over its state-led control of many companies and markets, and regulators may be wary of giving Beijing indirect control of a key stock exchange like London's.The United States, a key U.K. ally, is in a wide-ranging campaign to stifle China's rise to economic and technological pre-eminence, so this deal could raise political questions.Then there is the fact that the London Stock Exchange already has vowed to tie up with London-based financial data provider Refinitiv for $27 billion. A deal with Hong Kong would be contingent on that deal being abandoned.Hong Kong exchange CEO Charles Li acknowledged the company was coming late with its offer, but hoped to win over the London firm in a "corporate Romeo and Juliet" story.Refinitiv's appeal is its data, viewed as a lucrative new business operation that would help the London exchange move on from being a simple trading platform.In Hong Kong's favor is that a deal in Asia would give the London exchange, which also owns the Milan bourse and the Russell Indexes in the U.S., access to a new market whenever it leaves the EU. As things stand, Britain is due to leave the EU, which it has been a part of for 46 years and with which it has extensive and deep economic ties, on Oct. 31.If it leaves without a divorce deal, then tariffs and more red tape will be imposed on trade with the other 27 European Union countries. Financial services are a big part of the British economy and a no-deal Brexit will lead to a period of disruption, at least in the short-term.Britain's pro-Brexit government has proclaimed its desire to turn to markets beyond Europe to shore up business and London's role as a financial hub, so a deal in Asia for the London exchange could be viewed as an asset."A combined group will be strongly placed to benefit from the dynamic and evolving macroeconomic landscape, whilst enhancing the long-term resilience and relevance of London and Hong Kong as global financial centers," Li argued.For the Hong Kong exchange, the potential deal has been made cheaper by the 20%-or-so fall in the pound in the wake of the country's 2016 decision to leave the EU. The currency this summer trended down toward its lowest level against the dollar since 1985, effectively making British companies cheaper.

Hong Kong stock exchange swoops in for London rivalAssociated Press Financial WireSeptember 11, 2019 Wednesday 4:55 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 767 wordsByline: By CARLO PIOVANO, Associated PressDateline: LONDON BodyLONDON (AP) - The Hong Kong stock exchange wants to buy its London counterpart to create a $70 billion-company, a bold move that faces big hurdles and will likely raise concerns in Britain about the Chinese government's potential influence over one of the symbols of global capitalism.The London Stock Exchange, a 300-year old institution that was at the heart of a British empire that included Hong Kong, said Wednesday it would consider the cash-and-shares offer that values it at 29.6 billion pounds ($36.6 billion).A deal would give it a lucrative foothold in Asia, a fast-growing region that could be attractive if Britain ends up leaving the European Union without a deal, a scenario that would see an array of trade barriers go up with its neighbors.But while investors cheered the move, pushing shares in the LSE up 6%, many experts remained skeptical, not least because the company has been subject to various failed deals in the past.One aspect of the proposed deal that could give leaders at the London exchange and British regulators pause for thought is the fact that at least half the board, including the chairman, of the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd. is nominated by the Hong Kong government, whose leader is ultimately appointed by China's communist rulers."The proposed offer would be totemic in terms of East-West relations," said Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor. "The very nature of the Hong Kong approach will be subject to any number of considerations, such as competitive and regulatory issues."As a result, he said, it's "far from a done deal."Many Western governments are increasingly at odds with China over its state-led control of many companies and markets, and regulators may be wary of giving Beijing indirect control of a key stock exchange like London's.The United States, a key U.K. ally, is in a wide-ranging campaign to stifle China's rise to economic and technological pre-eminence, so this deal could raise political questions.Then there is the fact that the London Stock Exchange already has vowed to tie up with London-based financial data provider Refinitiv for $27 billion. A deal with Hong Kong would be contingent on that deal being abandoned.Hong Kong exchange CEO Charles Li acknowledged the company was coming late with its offer, but hoped to win over the London firm in a "corporate Romeo and Juliet" story.Refinitiv's appeal is its data, viewed as a lucrative new business operation that would help the London exchange move on from being a simple trading platform.In Hong Kong's favor is that a deal in Asia would give the London exchange, which also owns the Milan bourse and the Russell Indexes in the U.S., access to a new market whenever it leaves the EU. As things stand, Britain is due to leave the EU, which it has been a part of for 46 years and with which it has extensive and deep economic ties, on Oct. 31.If it leaves without a divorce deal, then tariffs and more red tape will be imposed on trade with the other 27 European Union countries. Financial services are a big part of the British economy and a no-deal Brexit will lead to a period of disruption, at least in the short-term.Britain's pro-Brexit government has proclaimed its desire to turn to markets beyond Europe to shore up business and London's role as a financial hub, so a deal in Asia for the London exchange could be viewed as an asset."A combined group will be strongly placed to benefit from the dynamic and evolving macroeconomic landscape, whilst enhancing the long-term resilience and relevance of London and Hong Kong as global financial centers," Li argued.For the Hong Kong exchange, the potential deal has been made cheaper by the 20%-or-so fall in the pound in the wake of the country's 2016 decision to leave the EU. The currency this summer trended down toward its lowest level against the dollar since 1985, effectively making British companies cheaper. That's certainly the case for companies in Hong Kong, whose currency is pegged to the dollar.For the Hong Kong exchange, the deal could help it diversify at a time of tensions in the city over the Chinese government's influence. Pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong after Beijing's attempts to exert greater control have created uncertainty over the city's role as an international business hub.But the protests, if anything, could harden opposition by the London exchange, its shareholders or British authorities."There is a very high bar to clear in order for this to succeed," said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com.___Kelvin Chan contributed to this report.Load-Date: September 12, 2019End of Document

Sen. Cruz: American Companies and Sports Leagues Should Act With the Courage of Shaquille O'Neal and Quentin TarantinoTargeted News ServiceOctober 25, 2019 Friday 8:43 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 539 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, issued the following news release:U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on Wednesday applauded the courage of Shaquille O'Neal and Quentin Tarantino, who this week stood up against the Chinese Communist Party's efforts to censor the American people. In an interview with Yahoo Finance's editor-in-chief Andy Serwer, Sen. Cruz discussed his op-ed in USA Today where he called on the NBA, Nike, Apple, Google, and other iconic American companies to stop importing the Chinese Communist Party's censorship and oppression to the United States, as well as his recent 'Friends &#38; Allies Tour' to the Indo-Pacific. Watch the full interview here.Sen. Cruz urged the NBA to demonstrate the courage of Shaquille O'Neal, who on national television defended free speech and Daryl Morey's tweet:"You want to talk about someone standing up and being a hero? Shaq had the courage on national television to rightly say, Darryl Morey was right and that in America our values, we believe in free speech. I think Shaq's exactly right. I think he's demonstrating courage and I think others in the NBA should follow."He continued, applauding the courage of Quentin Tarantino, who said this week he would not recut his film, 'Once Upon A Time in Hollywood' to appease the Chinese Communist Party:"And, by the way, while we're celebrating people who have shown courage, we also saw someone from Hollywood do that, which is Quentin Tarantino. Quentin Tarantino with his movie, 'Once Upon A Time in Hollywood,' the Chinese government wanted him to censor that movie. Wanted him to edit out a portion of it and Tarantino to his credit said no, he's not going to give into censorship. Tarantino's exactly right. Shaq's exactly right. And we need to see more people demonstrate the courage that Shaq and Tarantino are demonstrating."Sen. Cruz also emphasized the geo-political threat China poses to America's national security and interests in the region:"China is, I believe, the most significant long-term geopolitical threat facing America. I mentioned the Asia tour that I was just on of Japan, Taiwan, India, [and] Hong Kong. That was really designed to be a "Friends &#38; Allies Tour." It was all of our close friends, or a number of our close friends all surrounding China. And dealing with China's enhanced military aggression. You know, China is modernizing its military--they're doing so in large part with technology and intellectual property they've stolen from the United States because they employ the theft of IP as a policy agenda item. And that threat is very real. China's human rights record is abysmal. They torture their citizens, they murder their citizens. Roughly, a million Uyghurs are held in concentration camps."He continued saying in the face of these threats, America's fundamental values should not be for sale:"I've long spoken out against Chinese human rights abuses. What we're seeing now, though, is a more dangerous incarnation. Which is, U.S. companies, they're so desperate to make a buck in China, and I get it.

Is the US losing the artificial intelligence arms race?The Conversation - United StatesOctober 29, 2019 Tuesday 12:58 PM ESTCopyright 2019 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights ReservedLength: 660 wordsByline: James Johnson, Postdoctoral Fellow in Nonproliferation Studies, Middlebury Institute of International StudiesHighlight: The US defense community is coming to understand that AI will significantly transform, if not completely reinvent, the world's military power balance.BodyThe U.S. government, long a proponent of advancing technology for military purposes, sees artificial intelligence as key to the next generation of fighting tools. Several recent investments and Pentagon initiatives show that military leaders are concerned about keeping up with - and ahead of - China and Russia, two countries that have made big gains in developing artificial-intelligence systems.            AI-powered weapons include target recognition systems, weapons guided by AI, and cyberattack and cyberdefense software that runs without human intervention.The U.S. defense community is coming to understand that AI will significantly transform, if not completely reinvent, the world's military power balance. The concern is more than military. As Chinese and Russian technologies become more sophisticated, they threaten U.S. domination of technological innovation and development, as well as global economic power and influence.Military leaders see the threat to U.S. technological leadership coming from two main sources: a rising and            ambitious China and a mischievous and declining Russia. Taken together, these forces challenge global stability. The nature of the threatA 2018 Pentagon report noted that technological developments could change the types of threats facing the U.S., which might include space-based weapons, long-range ballistic missiles and cyberweapons.A February 2019 analysis warned that China's investments in its military's AI systems - in particular, those supporting robotics, autonomy, precision munitions and cyber warfare -            threaten to overtake the United States. Chinese            government agencies are working closely with the country's civilian businesses to keep on top of            fast-changing technological developments. In addition, some Chinese and Russian projects have developed military AI systems specifically aimed at what they perceive as U.S. technological weaknesses. For instance,            swarms of armed AI-enhanced drones might locate and attack the secure computer systems countries rely on to control and launch their            nuclear weapons.Pentagon's responseSo far the Pentagon's actions have been largely bureaucratic, rather than concrete. It has released a Defense Department-wide strategy document that articulates broad principles for the development and use of AI in future warfare. The military has  established a            Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is tasked with accelerating the delivery and adoption of AI. But projects with names like "the Third Offset," "           Project Maven" and the "           AI Next Campaign" have minimal funding. Leaders have released few details about what they will actually do.Working with Silicon ValleyThe Pentagon has also established the Defense Innovation Unit, with permission to circumvent the cumbersome military purchasing process, to            coordinate with Silicon Valley and bring new technologies into military use relatively quickly.That unit has sparked discussions about the potential for the Chinese military to acquire and use U.S.-designed technologies, which led to            U.S. bans on doing business with many Chinese technology firms. Many experts consider it possible for China to surpass the U.S. in the            development and use of AI. However,            China trails the U.S. in several ways. The United States has the world's largest intelligence budget; the most popular hardware, software and technology companies; and the most advanced cyberwarfare capabilities, both offensive and defensive.            I and other experts expect these advantages to preserve U.S. technological leadership for now, at least - but perhaps not forever.James Johnson does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.Load-Date: October 29, 2019End of Document

Hong Kong demonstrators understand the importance of freedom The Daily Campus: University of ConnecticutSeptember 5, 2019 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 774 wordsBodyOver the years, Hong Kong has cemented its status as a global financial center, as well as a tourist and shopping paradise. Photo by farfar on Unsplash. Thumbnail photo by Anatoliy Gromov on Unsplash.Over the years, Hong Kong has cemented its status as a global financial center, as well as a tourist and shopping paradise. The region's unique ties to mainland China have allowed its people to remain largely independent and reap the benefits of a free market economy.However, the rights of Hong Kongers are always in jeopardy. Mainland Chinese officials recognize the area's value and have become increasingly reluctant to loosen Beijing's grip on it. In many ways, Hong Kong has become this century's answer to West Berlin-a bubble of democracy interlocked with a great communist power.The history of modern Hong Kong dates back to the British colonial era. In 1898, Britain signed a 99-year lease with the Imperial Chinese Qing dynasty, allowing the colony to remain firmly in British hands and prosper economically. When the lease expired in 1997, China regained control of Hong Kong and designated it a "special administrative region" .Hong Kong's classification as an SAR gives way to a large gray area regarding its relationship with China. Officially, China's two SARs (the other being Macau) are governed under the "one country, two systems" doctrine. While Beijing is officially responsible for the defense and foreign affairs of SARs, they enjoy self-governance and greater civil liberties than those on the mainland.The terms "defense" and "self-governance" directly contradict each other. The Chinese government cited the need to defend Hong Kong during the 2014 "Umbrella Revolution," during which Hong Kongers took to the streets to demand greater involvement in Chinese elections. Ultimately, the protests ended with no changes to the structure of said elections.Of course, a similar situation unfolded this year. Pro-Beijing officials in the SAR government proposed a controversial extradition bill, which would allow suspected criminals to be detained by local authorities and sent to China and other countries to stand trial.As the bill fails to consider the principle of due process, critics quickly denounced it as a hostility to democracy and gathered by the thousands to oppose it. Last month, protesters stormed into Hong Kong International Airport and disrupted hundreds of flights in an effort to send a message to the international community.Americans received that message loudly and clearly when a video showing a group of protesters waving American flags and singing "The Star-Spangled Banner." The video's origin is unknown, but it gained traction after conservative activist Kaya Jones posted it to her Twitter account.Other citizens marched with pro-Second Amendment signs in hand. While calling for the policy of a foreign nation to take place during an internal crisis is extreme, the protesters' favorable rhetoric toward the United States serves several purposes:First, such bold actions centered around American values indicate that Hong Kongers are looking outward to distance themselves from China. Hua Chunying, the spokeswoman of China's Foreign Ministry, publicly blamed the U.S. for sponsoring and influencing the protesters.Given that U.S.-China trade relations are tense right now, the demonstrators may have the right idea to call on the U.S. to address the situation and leverage against China in the process. Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden has already pledged his support to the protesters.More importantly, both the national anthem video and Second Amendment signs are symbolic of America's image on the world stage. While the United States is an imperfect society, it speaks volumes about our country when citizens who feel oppressed in their homeland rally to our flag and our style of democracy with hopes of a more promising future. That future is something that a governmental structure such as China's cannot provide.Recently in the United States, Antifa protesters have caused public disturbances in multiple cities. Members of the group, whose name is short for "anti-facism," have flown Soviet flags at demonstrations to disavow far-right ideas. But these flags stand for a defunct and broken nation. Antifa's criticisms are valid, but its protesters never express a desire to break from the country that stands for the values that fortunate citizens across the world know and love.After months of unrest, Hong Kongers have come to know the value of this freedom. Just like Americans, these protesters recognize that a free society can be deeply flawed but always fixed.Load-Date: September 5, 2019End of Document

Threat to US elections in 2020 is not limited to RussiaAssociated Press InternationalOctober 30, 2019 Wednesday 8:41 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: WASHINGTON DATELINELength: 1185 wordsByline: By ERIC TUCKER, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - Russia interfered in the 2016 election and may try to sway next year's vote as well. But it's not the only nation with an eye on U.S. politics.American officials sounding the alarm about foreign efforts to disrupt the 2020 election include multiple countries in that warning. Concerns abound not only about possible hacking of campaigns but also about the spread of disinformation on social media and potential efforts to breach voting databases and even alter votes.The anxiety goes beyond the possibility that U.S. adversaries could affect election results: The mere hint of foreign meddling could undermine public confidence in vote tallies, a worrisome possibility in a tight election."Unfortunately, it's not just Russia anymore. In particular, China, Iran, a couple of others, studied what the Russians did in 2016," said James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.U.S. intelligence agencies reported Russian, Chinese and Iranian influence activities targeting last year's midterms, and a senior FBI official last week singled out Beijing as a particular source of concern. Meanwhile, Microsoft recently reported that Iranian hackers had targeted an unidentified presidential campaign along with government officials, journalists and prominent expatriate Iranians.FBI Director Chris Wray told a congressional hearing Wednesday that the FBI does not have evidence that China, Iran or North Korea plan to target election infrastructure in next year's election, but "that doesn't mean they're not looking carefully at what the Russians attempted to do and trying to learn lessons from that.""All of those countries in different ways are clearly interested in engaging in malign foreign influence," he added.As for Russia, he said, the U.S. expects that they "already have continued to up their game from what they did in 2016. Of course, we've upped our game too."Any foreign effort to interfere in the 2020 election won't necessarily mirror Russia's attack in 2016, when Kremlin-linked military intelligence officers hacked Democratic emails and shared them with WikiLeaks to try to help Republican Donald Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton.More likely are the social media campaigns, like the Russian-based one that shaped public opinion in the 2016 election and divided Americans on hot-button topics like race and religion.Facebook, for instance, announced recently that it has removed four networks of fake, state-backed misinformation-spreading accounts based in Russia and Iran. The company said the networks sought to disrupt elections in the U.S., North Africa and Latin America.A Senate Intelligence Committee report described Russia's social media activities in 2016 as a "vastly more complex and strategic assault on the United States than was initially understood." A recent memo from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security warned Russia may use social media to exacerbate divisions within political parties during primaries or hack election websites to spread misinformation on voting processes.Concerns about foreign influence campaigns coincide with stepped-up enforcement of a law requiring the registration with the Justice Department of lobbyists, media organizations and other entities that do the bidding of foreign government.Special counsel Robert Mueller exposed through his investigation the unregistered, covert Russian campaign to spread disinformation on social media.On Wednesday, Facebook announced that it had removed from its site three Russia-based networks that engaged in foreign influence targeting more than a half-dozen African countries. The company said its investigation linked those accounts to a Russian already indicted in Mueller's investigation in connection with the social media disinformation effort.The Justice Department is concerned about China undertaking similar activities. Twitter said it has suspended more than 200,000 accounts that it believes were part of a Chinese government influence campaign targeting the protest movement in Hong Kong. The department also required China's state-owned television network, CGTN, to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act."Make no mistake, China is aggressively pursuing foreign influence operations," Nikki Floris, an FBI deputy assistant director, said at a recent congressional hearing. "So as we roll into 2020, though Russia was certainly a threat in 2016 (and) 2018, and will continue to be so in 2020, we are also aggressively looking at China as well."U.S. officials said the foreign influence campaigns didn't change midterm vote totals, but there's no question that concern remains for 2020. Besides the hacking and subsequent release of stolen emails, Russian agents in 2016 searched for vulnerabilities within election systems in all 50 states and breached the election systems of two Florida counties but don't appear to have done any damage.America's adversaries might have a stake in the 2020 vote. Trump, for instance, speaks well of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un while deepening tensions with Iran by withdrawing the U.S. from a nuclear deal. He has also engaged China in a trade war.But some experts are skeptical that those countries will use hacking to try to boost a particular candidate - or to influence the election at all. Much of their hacking has been tied to more narrow national interests, and Wray said the FBI doesn't see them as targeting elections directly.China, for instance, has so far largely used its cyber capabilities for the purposes of espionage and intellectual property theft and to further its goal of challenging the U.S. role as a global economic superpower. The Justice Department in 2014 charged five Chinese military hackers with siphoning secrets from major American corporations.Iranian hackers have attacked dozens of banks and a small dam outside New York City and, more recently, sought to pilfer sensitive information from hundreds of universities, private companies and American government agencies.North Korea tends to focus its efforts on defectors, academics and others with a hostile relationship to the country, said Jung Pak, a Brookings Institution expert. It hacked Sony Pictures Entertainment and released the private emails of its executives in apparent retaliation for a Hollywood comedy that mocked Kim."We haven't really seen politically motivated attacks where they try to sway elections," said Matt Ha, a research associate at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. "Right now, their main objective is the summits, the diplomacy, to try to gain as much as they can - gaining a lot for giving up nothing."Even as other countries have bolstered their own capabilities, Russia's own decadeslong interest in American politics makes it the most challenging and realistic adversary, said Lewis, of CSIS."They're politically astute in a way that no other country can match, and that makes them the most formidable opponent," Lewis said. "They just know us really well."___Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAPLoad-Date: October 31, 2019End of Document

The fire safety systems market is expected to register a CAGR of over 7.5 % during the forecast period (2019PR NewswireSeptember 11, 2019 Wednesday 1:00 PM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1275 wordsDateline: NEW YORK, Sept. 11, 2019 BodyPR NewswireMarket OverviewThe fire safety systems market is expected to register a CAGR of over 7.5 % during the forecast period (2019-2024). Knowing all, future fire alarm systems will be software-based, where one need to find a way to train one or two programmers to avoid being dependent on the equipment supplier. This can also help the supplier and should lead to better pricing. Also with the improvement of the sensors' capabilities and communication channel technology, IoT devices present in industries and residential spaces have boosted the adoption of new-tech fire safety solutions.Read the full report:https://www.reportlinker.com/p05815032/?utm_source=PRN- The increase in the number of deaths and property loss has increased the awareness of fire safety system which is driving the market. The countries with low infrastructure development investments are showing an interest in the installation of fire safety systems. Factors, such as poor-handling of burning lamps and cooking gas leakage, alternating voltage and electric spark, and overheating of electronic equipment, were identified as the prime causes for fire outbreaks in the incidents.- Stringent government regulations and mandates is driving the market. The implementation of unified building codes in various developed and developing countries across all end-user segments, mandated by local authorities, has pushed the demand for fire safety systems. For instance, UK government recommends that all fire alarm and detection systems should be installed and maintained under the relevant British Standard, i.e., BS 5839.- High installation and maintenance cost is restraining the market to grow. The fire safety systems' costs vary, depending on the lifespan, size, use, and type of the building. In general, fire alarm systems are more expensive to install in older buildings than in the newly constructed ones.Scope of the ReportThe scope of the fire safety systems market includes the type of safety system with fire detectors and suppressors, such as gas, foam, and detectors. The increasing focus of the government bodies on implementing fire safety equipment across various industries, such as chemical and petrochemical, oil and gas, pharmaceutical, aerospace, and defense, has led to the growth of the market studied.Key Market TrendsResidential Segment to Register Significant Growth- Fire safety systems find applications in homes. Single station residential smoke alarms are installed in most homes, as they are the simplest system for detecting a fire and warning the building occupants. Embedded system is applied for the development of smart residential fire detection and extinguishing system. Due to rapid urbanization in Asia-Pacific, the market is propelling with applications in the residential sector.- Every year, residential fires occur practically around the world. For example, in the United States, recent estimates showed an average yearly of 371,700 residential structures fires causing 2,590 civilian deaths, 12,910 civilian injuries, and USD 7.2 billion in direct property damage.- Recently, a wireless system (ZigBee) has received attention for its application in the fire early detection system. This system is becoming more attractive to housing, as it accommodates elderly people who live alone, because it is perceived to be more secure.- Recently on June 2019, Hassantuk, the centralized smart fire alarm system introduced in buildings and villas, helped prevent a fire in a villa in Dubai. This system is aimed at linking houses with the smart alarm system. The recent vila incident is an example of how the system helped prevent a fire.- In England, every year the fire and rescue service is called to over 600,000 fires which result in over 800 deaths and over 17,000 injuries. About 50,000 (140 a day) of these are in the home and kill nearly 500 and injure over 11,000, many which could have been prevented if people had an early warning and were able to get out in time, by which the demand of fire safety systems will increase in coming period.Asia-Pacific is Estimated to Emerge as the Fastest Growing Region- Major countries in the Asia-Pacific region, like India and China, are witnessing significant expansions of industries and manufacturing factories. The revenue is expected to grow for the fire and safety systems market.- For instance, the GoI is increasing the investment in infrastructure-related projects over the past few years. In the recent union budget for 2019-20, the GoI has allocated around USD 63.20 billion for the infrastructure sector. Also, the infrastructure sector in India witnessed investments worth USD 1.97 billion from private equity and venture capitals, in 2018.- In addition to it, rapid urbanization in India is expected to accelerate the spending on infrastructure for vital sectors that include transportation, textile, water and wastewater treatment, power, etc. For instance, Raymond is investing around USD 14 billion to construct a new textile park with eight major textile units, in India.- As China has also been witnessing significant expansions of industries and manufacturing factories. The country is anticipated to exhibit substantial growth, owing to the increased investments and spending on the development of the infrastructure for surveillance.- Along with it, he incident alarmed by the fire accident that took place at Notre Dame Cathedral in central Paris, France, the Chinese government has vowed to strengthen firefighting measures to promote cultural relics preservation. National Cultural Heritage Administration (NCHA) reported about six fire accidents at heritage sites, in 2019. In order to prevent similar fire accidents at other heritage sites, the Chinese government is deploying firefighters and providing fire prevention measures.Competitive LandscapeThe fire safety systems market is fragmenting as the intensity of competitive rivalry in the market studied is moderate and growing, due to the presence of electrical product manufacturers. In order to gain a competitive market share, the companies operating in the market are involved in active innovation, by providing advanced fire detection systems. Key players are Johnson Controls International PLC, Honeywell International Inc., Gentex Corporation, etc. Recent developments in the market are -- June 2019 - Halma announced acquisition of leading Australian fire and evacuation systems company Ampac.

Yesterday included plenty of trade speculation, but today's trade angst has been based on more substantive news.Specifically, the U.S. added 28 more Chinese firms to a trade blacklist for violating human rights against a Muslim minority in China. Beijing indicated it could retaliate, and it could reportedly leave trade talks one day early. A separate report from Bloomberg noted that the White House is considering limiting Chinese stocks in government pension plans.That is the news. Today's selling is then rooted in concerns that this week's trade talks will produce little progress, suggesting that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will still increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15.On a related note, China suspended broadcasting of games for the Houston Rockets after its general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong over the weekend.09:55 ETDow -255.54 at 26222.48, Nasdaq -92.17 at 7864.13, S&P -32.88 at 2905.95[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 1.1%, and the Russell 2000 also trades lower by 1.1%.The trade-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has dropped 2.3% in the early going, as many of its components derive a sizable portion of their revenue from China. The 28 newest Chinese firms blacklisted in the U.S. must be approved a license to conduct business with U.S. companies.Shares of Ambarella (AMBA 51.49, -5.80, -10.0%) have given back 10% after the company's Chinese customer, Hikvision, was among the companies blacklisted.

The U.S. added 28 Chinese firms to a trade blacklist over China's treatment of Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. On a related note, China suspended broadcast of games for the Houston Rockets after its general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong over the weekend.China has signaled it might retaliate against the trade blacklist, and it could reportedly leave trade talks one day early. Evidently, investors are feeling less optimistic about senior-level talks slated to begin on Thursday.The yield on the 10-yr note is down three basis points to 1.52%, little changed after the Producer Price Index for September unexpected declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%).08:51 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -18.10.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%), and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) also finished with modest losses.Ostensibly, the stock market opened lower following a Bloomberg report that suggested China was not interested in a complete trade deal at this time, then rallied into positive territory after NEC Director Larry Kudlow said comments out of Beijing have been more positive. Throw in some conflicting tweets from a Fox Business reporter, and it was enough to inject more gyrations and confusion into the market.It would be remiss, however, to explain today's price action solely on these headlines. There might have been a lack of conviction after a strong ending to last week, with technical factors lingering in the background. The S&P 500 closed a hair below its 50-day moving average (2941). As for trade, the market will likely have to wait for senior-level talks on Thursday and Friday for more clarity.In turn, ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower amid relatively light trading volume. The energy sector (-0.9%) was today's laggard, while the communication services sector (+0.04%) finished fractionally higher.In corporate news, Silicon Motion (SIMO 38.30, +2.45, +6.8%) raised its Q3 revenue guidance, signaling that healthy demand for Apple's (AAPL 227.06, +0.05, unch) iPhone 11 is funneling through the supply chain. Silicon Motion was one of the few gainers in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%).Elsewhere, PG&E (PCG 11.50, +0.63, +5.8%) outperformed following a report that indicated wildfire claims will be capped at $13.5 billion. Uber (UBER 30.37, +0.70, +2.4%) was upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup on improving risk vs reward. Labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.75, -0.16, -0.5%) and the UAW were said to have taken a "turn for the worse" over the weekend.U.S. Treasuries finished firmly lower, driving yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.55%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 98.97. WTI crude gave up an intraday gain to finish unchanged at $52.79/bbl.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit report for August:Consumer credit increased by $17.9 bln in August (Briefing.com consensus $13.3 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $23.0 bln (from $23.3 bln) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that nonrevolving credit accounted for the entire expansion in consumer credit in August. Nonrevolving credit decreased on the heels of an increase in July that had marked the fastest pace of expansion since November 2017.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +19.9% YTDS&P 500 +17.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.5% YTDRussell 2000 +11.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 952/1615. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1318/1751.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: October 8, 2019End of Document

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%), and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) also finished with modest losses.Ostensibly, the stock market opened lower following a Bloomberg report that suggested China was not interested in a complete trade deal at this time, then rallied into positive territory after NEC Director Larry Kudlow said comments out of Beijing have been more positive. Throw in some conflicting tweets from a Fox Business reporter, and it was enough to inject more gyrations and confusion into the market.It would be remiss, however, to explain today's price action solely on these headlines. There might have been a lack of conviction after a strong ending to last week, with technical factors lingering in the background. The S&P 500 closed a hair below its 50-day moving average (2941). As for trade, the market will likely have to wait for senior-level talks on Thursday and Friday for more clarity.In turn, ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower amid relatively light trading volume.

The S&P 500 is down 1.2%.The newspaper said that the size and composition of the delegation traveling to Washington "signaled that China is sincerely looking to reach a comprehensive trade deal with the U.S." Regarding the blacklisting of its firms, China's foreign ministry spokesman said, "It adds to the uncertainty, but Beijing has become accustomed to such tricks and will deal with them calmly."Like yesterday, then, market participants will have to wait for those talks to begin on Thursday for a definitive answer on what happens next, especially with the tariff-rate increase planned for Oct. 15. In the meantime, the market continues to price-in some disappointment.10:55 ETDow -298.50 at 26179.52, Nasdaq -103.10 at 7853.2, S&P -37.29 at 2901.54[BRIEFING.COM] The major average remain deep in the red near session lows. The S&P 500 is down 1.3%, the Dow is down 1.2%, and the Nasdaq is down 1.3%.There is a lack of buying conviction, evidenced by the broad-based losses in the S&P 500 sectors that are down between 0.7% (consumer staples) and 1.9% (financials). The CBOE Volatility Index is up 1.7 points, or 9.7%, to 19.60, reflecting an increased interest to hedge against further downside.Shares of Domino's Pizza (DPZ 246.58, +4.40, +1.8%), on the other hand, have turned it around and now trade higher by 2.1%. Shares were initially down big after the company missed earnings estimates, reported slower growth in domestic same store sales, and tempered its long-term outlook. The company also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.10:30 ETDow -275.61 at 26202.41, Nasdaq -98.96 at 7857.34, S&P -35.50 at 2903.33[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 1.2%. Yesterday included plenty of trade speculation, but today's trade angst has been based on more substantive news.Specifically, the U.S. added 28 more Chinese firms to a trade blacklist for violating human rights against a Muslim minority in China. Beijing indicated it could retaliate, and it could reportedly leave trade talks one day early. A separate report from Bloomberg noted that the White House is considering limiting Chinese stocks in government pension plans.That is the news. Today's selling is then rooted in concerns that this week's trade talks will produce little progress, suggesting that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will still increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15.On a related note, China suspended broadcasting of games for the Houston Rockets after its general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong over the weekend.09:55 ETDow -255.54 at 26222.48, Nasdaq -92.17 at 7864.13, S&P -32.88 at 2905.95[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 1.1%, and the Russell 2000 also trades lower by 1.1%.The trade-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has dropped 2.3% in the early going, as many of its components derive a sizable portion of their revenue from China. The 28 newest Chinese firms blacklisted in the U.S. must be approved a license to conduct business with U.S. companies.Shares of Ambarella (AMBA 51.49, -5.80, -10.0%) have given back 10% after the company's Chinese customer, Hikvision, was among the companies blacklisted. Ambarella is not a part of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.09:40 ETDow -254.56 at 26223.46, Nasdaq -81.71 at 7874.59, S&P -30.78 at 2908.05[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have dropped at the open after the U.S. added 28 more Chinese firms to a trade blacklist ahead of trade talks. The S&P 500 is down 1.0%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.0%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.0%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows all 11 sectors trading in negative territory. Financials (-1.4%) and industrials (-1.3%) lead the retreat with losses over 1.0%, while real estate (-0.3%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) hold modest losses.U.S. Treasuries are up, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.43%, and the 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.52%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.96.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -45.50.The stock market is on track for a noticeably lower open, as new trade developments cast some doubt on this week's trade talks. The S&P 500 futures trade 18 points, or 0.6%, below fair value.Differences between views on human rights appears to be the latest dispute between the countries. The U.S. added 28 Chinese firms to a trade blacklist over China's treatment of Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. On a related note, China suspended broadcast of games for the Houston Rockets after its general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong over the weekend.China has signaled it might retaliate against the trade blacklist, and it could reportedly leave trade talks one day early. Evidently, investors are feeling less optimistic about senior-level talks slated to begin on Thursday.The yield on the 10-yr note is down three basis points to 1.52%, little changed after the Producer Price Index for September unexpected declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%).08:51 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -18.10.

Unsurprisingly, the cyclical sectors are among today's worst-performing groups amid growth concerns, but so is the health care sector (-1.7%).It could be speculated that its underperformance today is not only a function of the broad-based decline today, but also the pestering idea that there is bipartisan support for efforts aimed at curbing healthcare costs.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%), and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) also finished with modest losses.Ostensibly, the stock market opened lower following a Bloomberg report that suggested China was not interested in a complete trade deal at this time, then rallied into positive territory after NEC Director Larry Kudlow said comments out of Beijing have been more positive. Throw in some conflicting tweets from a Fox Business reporter, and it was enough to inject more gyrations and confusion into the market.It would be remiss, however, to explain today's price action solely on these headlines. There might have been a lack of conviction after a strong ending to last week, with technical factors lingering in the background. The S&P 500 closed a hair below its 50-day moving average (2941). As for trade, the market will likely have to wait for senior-level talks on Thursday and Friday for more clarity.In turn, ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower amid relatively light trading volume. The energy sector (-0.9%) was today's laggard, while the communication services sector (+0.04%) finished fractionally higher.In corporate news, Silicon Motion (SIMO 38.30, +2.45, +6.8%) raised its Q3 revenue guidance, signaling that healthy demand for Apple's (AAPL 227.06, +0.05, unch) iPhone 11 is funneling through the supply chain. Silicon Motion was one of the few gainers in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%).Elsewhere, PG&E (PCG 11.50, +0.63, +5.8%) outperformed following a report that indicated wildfire claims will be capped at $13.5 billion. Uber (UBER 30.37, +0.70, +2.4%) was upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup on improving risk vs reward. Labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.75, -0.16, -0.5%) and the UAW were said to have taken a "turn for the worse" over the weekend.U.S. Treasuries finished firmly lower, driving yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.55%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 98.97. WTI crude gave up an intraday gain to finish unchanged at $52.79/bbl.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit report for August:Consumer credit increased by $17.9 bln in August (Briefing.com consensus $13.3 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $23.0 bln (from $23.3 bln) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that nonrevolving credit accounted for the entire expansion in consumer credit in August. Nonrevolving credit decreased on the heels of an increase in July that had marked the fastest pace of expansion since November 2017.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +19.9% YTDS&P 500 +17.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.5% YTDRussell 2000 +11.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 952/1615. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1318/1751.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: October 8, 2019End of Document

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%), and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) also finished with modest losses.Ostensibly, the stock market opened lower following a Bloomberg report that suggested China was not interested in a complete trade deal at this time, then rallied into positive territory after NEC Director Larry Kudlow said comments out of Beijing have been more positive. Throw in some conflicting tweets from a Fox Business reporter, and it was enough to inject more gyrations and confusion into the market.It would be remiss, however, to explain today's price action solely on these headlines. There might have been a lack of conviction after a strong ending to last week, with technical factors lingering in the background. The S&P 500 closed a hair below its 50-day moving average (2941). As for trade, the market will likely have to wait for senior-level talks on Thursday and Friday for more clarity.In turn, ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower amid relatively light trading volume. The energy sector (-0.9%) was today's laggard, while the communication services sector (+0.04%) finished fractionally higher.In corporate news, Silicon Motion (SIMO 38.30, +2.45, +6.8%) raised its Q3 revenue guidance, signaling that healthy demand for Apple's (AAPL 227.06, +0.05, unch) iPhone 11 is funneling through the supply chain. Silicon Motion was one of the few gainers in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%).Elsewhere, PG&E (PCG 11.50, +0.63, +5.8%) outperformed following a report that indicated wildfire claims will be capped at $13.5 billion. Uber (UBER 30.37, +0.70, +2.4%) was upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup on improving risk vs reward. Labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.75, -0.16, -0.5%) and the UAW were said to have taken a "turn for the worse" over the weekend.U.S. Treasuries finished firmly lower, driving yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.55%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 98.97. WTI crude gave up an intraday gain to finish unchanged at $52.79/bbl.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit report for August:Consumer credit increased by $17.9 bln in August (Briefing.com consensus $13.3 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $23.0 bln (from $23.3 bln) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that nonrevolving credit accounted for the entire expansion in consumer credit in August. Nonrevolving credit decreased on the heels of an increase in July that had marked the fastest pace of expansion since November 2017.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +19.9% YTDS&P 500 +17.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.5% YTDRussell 2000 +11.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 952/1615. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1318/1751.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: October 8, 2019End of Document

Alphabet (GOOG 1196.37, -11.39, -0.9%) and Amazon (AMZN 1719.91, -12.75, -0.7%) are down noticeably, while Facebook (FB 178.91, -0.77, -0.5%) and Apple (AAPL 226.13, -0.91, -0.4%) are down modestly. Netflix (NFLX 274.84, +0.38) is up 0.2%.On a related note, Facebook announced it will expand its Workplace business service to include a Portal video chat. Shares of Zoom Video (ZM 73.76, -3.29) are down 4.3%.11:55 ETDow -289.06 at 26188.96, Nasdaq -99.13 at 7857.17, S&P -36.73 at 2902.1[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to struggle deep in negative territory with a 1.3% decline. Unsurprisingly, the cyclical sectors are among today's worst-performing groups amid growth concerns, but so is the health care sector (-1.7%).It could be speculated that its underperformance today is not only a function of the broad-based decline today, but also the pestering idea that there is bipartisan support for efforts aimed at curbing healthcare costs. Shares of Thermo Fisher (TMO 272.78, -16.34, -5.7%) are down nearly 6%.Overseas, the major European indices closed firmly lower. Germany's DAX lost 1.1%, UK's FTSE lost 0.8%, and France's CAC lost 1.2%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 1.0%.11:25 ETDow -275.88 at 26202.14, Nasdaq -91.30 at 7865, S&P -34.42 at 2904.41[BRIEFING.COM] The market briefly ticked higher earlier following a hopeful-sounding report from China's Global Times. The S&P 500 is down 1.2%.The newspaper said that the size and composition of the delegation traveling to Washington "signaled that China is sincerely looking to reach a comprehensive trade deal with the U.S." Regarding the blacklisting of its firms, China's foreign ministry spokesman said, "It adds to the uncertainty, but Beijing has become accustomed to such tricks and will deal with them calmly."Like yesterday, then, market participants will have to wait for those talks to begin on Thursday for a definitive answer on what happens next, especially with the tariff-rate increase planned for Oct. 15. In the meantime, the market continues to price-in some disappointment.10:55 ETDow -298.50 at 26179.52, Nasdaq -103.10 at 7853.2, S&P -37.29 at 2901.54[BRIEFING.COM] The major average remain deep in the red near session lows. The S&P 500 is down 1.3%, the Dow is down 1.2%, and the Nasdaq is down 1.3%.There is a lack of buying conviction, evidenced by the broad-based losses in the S&P 500 sectors that are down between 0.7% (consumer staples) and 1.9% (financials). The CBOE Volatility Index is up 1.7 points, or 9.7%, to 19.60, reflecting an increased interest to hedge against further downside.Shares of Domino's Pizza (DPZ 246.58, +4.40, +1.8%), on the other hand, have turned it around and now trade higher by 2.1%. Shares were initially down big after the company missed earnings estimates, reported slower growth in domestic same store sales, and tempered its long-term outlook. The company also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.10:30 ETDow -275.61 at 26202.41, Nasdaq -98.96 at 7857.34, S&P -35.50 at 2903.33[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 1.2%. Yesterday included plenty of trade speculation, but today's trade angst has been based on more substantive news.Specifically, the U.S. added 28 more Chinese firms to a trade blacklist for violating human rights against a Muslim minority in China. Beijing indicated it could retaliate, and it could reportedly leave trade talks one day early. A separate report from Bloomberg noted that the White House is considering limiting Chinese stocks in government pension plans.That is the news. Today's selling is then rooted in concerns that this week's trade talks will produce little progress, suggesting that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will still increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15.On a related note, China suspended broadcasting of games for the Houston Rockets after its general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong over the weekend.09:55 ETDow -255.54 at 26222.48, Nasdaq -92.17 at 7864.13, S&P -32.88 at 2905.95[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 1.1%, and the Russell 2000 also trades lower by 1.1%.The trade-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has dropped 2.3% in the early going, as many of its components derive a sizable portion of their revenue from China. The 28 newest Chinese firms blacklisted in the U.S. must be approved a license to conduct business with U.S. companies.Shares of Ambarella (AMBA 51.49, -5.80, -10.0%) have given back 10% after the company's Chinese customer, Hikvision, was among the companies blacklisted. Ambarella is not a part of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.09:40 ETDow -254.56 at 26223.46, Nasdaq -81.71 at 7874.59, S&P -30.78 at 2908.05[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have dropped at the open after the U.S. added 28 more Chinese firms to a trade blacklist ahead of trade talks. The S&P 500 is down 1.0%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.0%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.0%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows all 11 sectors trading in negative territory. Financials (-1.4%) and industrials (-1.3%) lead the retreat with losses over 1.0%, while real estate (-0.3%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) hold modest losses.U.S. Treasuries are up, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.43%, and the 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.52%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.96. WTI crude is down 1.1% to $52.15/bbl.09:15 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -18.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -45.50.The stock market is on track for a noticeably lower open, as new trade developments cast some doubt on this week's trade talks. The S&P 500 futures trade 18 points, or 0.6%, below fair value.Differences between views on human rights appears to be the latest dispute between the countries. The U.S. added 28 Chinese firms to a trade blacklist over China's treatment of Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. On a related note, China suspended broadcast of games for the Houston Rockets after its general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong over the weekend.China has signaled it might retaliate against the trade blacklist, and it could reportedly leave trade talks one day early. Evidently, investors are feeling less optimistic about senior-level talks slated to begin on Thursday.The yield on the 10-yr note is down three basis points to 1.52%, little changed after the Producer Price Index for September unexpected declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%).08:51 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -18.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -45.50.The S&P 500 futures trade 18 points, or 0.6%, below fair value.Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended Tuesday on a modestly higher note. China's Shanghai Composite (+0.3%) reopened after a weeklong closure, registering a slight gain.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%), and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) also finished with modest losses.Ostensibly, the stock market opened lower following a Bloomberg report that suggested China was not interested in a complete trade deal at this time, then rallied into positive territory after NEC Director Larry Kudlow said comments out of Beijing have been more positive. Throw in some conflicting tweets from a Fox Business reporter, and it was enough to inject more gyrations and confusion into the market.It would be remiss, however, to explain today's price action solely on these headlines. There might have been a lack of conviction after a strong ending to last week, with technical factors lingering in the background. The S&P 500 closed a hair below its 50-day moving average (2941). As for trade, the market will likely have to wait for senior-level talks on Thursday and Friday for more clarity.In turn, ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower amid relatively light trading volume.

Alphabet (GOOG 1196.37, -11.39, -0.9%) and Amazon (AMZN 1719.91, -12.75, -0.7%) are down noticeably, while Facebook (FB 178.91, -0.77, -0.5%) and Apple (AAPL 226.13, -0.91, -0.4%) are down modestly. Netflix (NFLX 274.84, +0.38) is up 0.2%.On a related note, Facebook announced it will expand its Workplace business service to include a Portal video chat. Shares of Zoom Video (ZM 73.76, -3.29) are down 4.3%.11:55 ETDow -289.06 at 26188.96, Nasdaq -99.13 at 7857.17, S&P -36.73 at 2902.1[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to struggle deep in negative territory with a 1.3% decline. Unsurprisingly, the cyclical sectors are among today's worst-performing groups amid growth concerns, but so is the health care sector (-1.7%).It could be speculated that its underperformance today is not only a function of the broad-based decline today, but also the pestering idea that there is bipartisan support for efforts aimed at curbing healthcare costs. Shares of Thermo Fisher (TMO 272.78, -16.34, -5.7%) are down nearly 6%.Overseas, the major European indices closed firmly lower. Germany's DAX lost 1.1%, UK's FTSE lost 0.8%, and France's CAC lost 1.2%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 1.0%.11:25 ETDow -275.88 at 26202.14, Nasdaq -91.30 at 7865, S&P -34.42 at 2904.41[BRIEFING.COM] The market briefly ticked higher earlier following a hopeful-sounding report from China's Global Times. The S&P 500 is down 1.2%.The newspaper said that the size and composition of the delegation traveling to Washington "signaled that China is sincerely looking to reach a comprehensive trade deal with the U.S." Regarding the blacklisting of its firms, China's foreign ministry spokesman said, "It adds to the uncertainty, but Beijing has become accustomed to such tricks and will deal with them calmly."Like yesterday, then, market participants will have to wait for those talks to begin on Thursday for a definitive answer on what happens next, especially with the tariff-rate increase planned for Oct. 15. In the meantime, the market continues to price-in some disappointment.10:55 ETDow -298.50 at 26179.52, Nasdaq -103.10 at 7853.2, S&P -37.29 at 2901.54[BRIEFING.COM] The major average remain deep in the red near session lows. The S&P 500 is down 1.3%, the Dow is down 1.2%, and the Nasdaq is down 1.3%.There is a lack of buying conviction, evidenced by the broad-based losses in the S&P 500 sectors that are down between 0.7% (consumer staples) and 1.9% (financials). The CBOE Volatility Index is up 1.7 points, or 9.7%, to 19.60, reflecting an increased interest to hedge against further downside.Shares of Domino's Pizza (DPZ 246.58, +4.40, +1.8%), on the other hand, have turned it around and now trade higher by 2.1%. Shares were initially down big after the company missed earnings estimates, reported slower growth in domestic same store sales, and tempered its long-term outlook. The company also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.10:30 ETDow -275.61 at 26202.41, Nasdaq -98.96 at 7857.34, S&P -35.50 at 2903.33[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 1.2%. Yesterday included plenty of trade speculation, but today's trade angst has been based on more substantive news.Specifically, the U.S. added 28 more Chinese firms to a trade blacklist for violating human rights against a Muslim minority in China. Beijing indicated it could retaliate, and it could reportedly leave trade talks one day early. A separate report from Bloomberg noted that the White House is considering limiting Chinese stocks in government pension plans.That is the news. Today's selling is then rooted in concerns that this week's trade talks will produce little progress, suggesting that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will still increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15.On a related note, China suspended broadcasting of games for the Houston Rockets after its general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong over the weekend.09:55 ETDow -255.54 at 26222.48, Nasdaq -92.17 at 7864.13, S&P -32.88 at 2905.95[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 1.1%, and the Russell 2000 also trades lower by 1.1%.The trade-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has dropped 2.3% in the early going, as many of its components derive a sizable portion of their revenue from China. The 28 newest Chinese firms blacklisted in the U.S. must be approved a license to conduct business with U.S. companies.Shares of Ambarella (AMBA 51.49, -5.80, -10.0%) have given back 10% after the company's Chinese customer, Hikvision, was among the companies blacklisted. Ambarella is not a part of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.09:40 ETDow -254.56 at 26223.46, Nasdaq -81.71 at 7874.59, S&P -30.78 at 2908.05[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have dropped at the open after the U.S. added 28 more Chinese firms to a trade blacklist ahead of trade talks. The S&P 500 is down 1.0%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.0%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.0%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows all 11 sectors trading in negative territory. Financials (-1.4%) and industrials (-1.3%) lead the retreat with losses over 1.0%, while real estate (-0.3%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) hold modest losses.U.S. Treasuries are up, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.43%, and the 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.52%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.96. WTI crude is down 1.1% to $52.15/bbl.09:15 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -18.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -45.50.The stock market is on track for a noticeably lower open, as new trade developments cast some doubt on this week's trade talks. The S&P 500 futures trade 18 points, or 0.6%, below fair value.Differences between views on human rights appears to be the latest dispute between the countries. The U.S. added 28 Chinese firms to a trade blacklist over China's treatment of Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. On a related note, China suspended broadcast of games for the Houston Rockets after its general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong over the weekend.China has signaled it might retaliate against the trade blacklist, and it could reportedly leave trade talks one day early. Evidently, investors are feeling less optimistic about senior-level talks slated to begin on Thursday.The yield on the 10-yr note is down three basis points to 1.52%, little changed after the Producer Price Index for September unexpected declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%).08:51 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -18.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -45.50.The S&P 500 futures trade 18 points, or 0.6%, below fair value.Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended Tuesday on a modestly higher note. China's Shanghai Composite (+0.3%) reopened after a weeklong closure, registering a slight gain. The index rallied to begin the day but backed off its session high after the release of a weaker than expected Caixin Services PMI (actual 51.3; expected 52.1; last 52.1).

The S&P 500 futures trade 17 points, or 0.6%, below fair value.The U.S. Commerce Department added 28 Chinese companies, including Hikvision, to a trade blacklist for "engaging in or enabling activities contrary to the foreign policy interests" of the U.S. Bloomberg followed up this morning indicating that the Trump administration is now considering limiting Chinese stocks in U.S. government pension funds.When asked if China would retaliate to the trade blacklist, Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman reportedly said, "stay tuned." As for trade talks, the South China Morning Post reported that the Chinese delegation could go home from the negotiations one day early as expectations are falling for any resolution to the trade dispute.In other matters, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that a Brexit deal is "overwhelmingly unlikely" if Northern Ireland doesn't stay in the customs union.

The cash session began with modest losses after the overnight affair saw a mixed showing from equity markets in Asia. It is worth noting that China reported its inflation figures for August, showing the largest decrease in producer prices in two years while consumer prices grew more than expected due to surging pork prices. Treasuries made a half-hearted attempt at a rebound during the initial hour of trade before embarking on a steady retreat that continued into the afternoon. The selling was partially supported by a report that the European Central Bank may announce a delayed resumption of asset purchases contingent on further weakness in the eurozone. The MNI report cited an anonymous ECB official, and noted that a disagreement among policymakers may prevent the ECB from announcing aggressive easing measures on Thursday. Treasuries hit session lows after the completion of today's $38 bln 3-yr note auction, which was received with lukewarm demand, as the high yield (1.573%) tailed the when-issued yield by 0.3 bps while the bid-to-cover ratio (2.42x) was below average (2.53x). The U.S. Dollar Index ticked up 0.1% to 98.38. Yield Check: 2-yr: +9 bps to 1.66% 3-yr: +8 bps to 1.60% 5-yr: +9 bps to 1.57% 10-yr: +8 bps to 1.70% 30-yr: +8 bps to 2.18%News: South China Morning Post reported that Chinese trade negotiators could offer to buy more agricultural products from the United States if the U.S. eases tariffs on imports from China. China is currently suffering from a severe pork shortage, meaning the country may have no choice but to increase its purchases of pork and feed (soybeans) from the U.S. President Trump issued an executive order, enhancing the Treasury Department's ability to sanction terrorist leaders. Bloomberg reported that China's Jilin Transportation Investment Group did not exercise a call option on a perpetual note and will instead pay a higher coupon, which is likely to invite concerns about the cash position of the local government financing vehicle. North Korea fired two projectiles into the East Sea, shortly after a DPRK official indicated that North Korea is ready for another round of talks with U.S. officials. China's August CPI increased 0.7% m/m (expected 0.5%; last 0.4%), rising 2.8% yr/yr (expected 2.6%; last 2.8%). August PPI decreased 0.8% yr/yr (expected -0.9%; last -0.3%). Germany's Finance Minister, Olaf Scholz, presented a draft 2020 budget, which does not call for increased debt issuance. Italy's Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, survived his confidence vote in the Senate after winning yesterday's vote in the Chamber of Deputies. U.K.'s July Average Earnings Index + Bonus increased 4.0% yr/yr (expected 3.7%; last 3.8%). July Claimant Count Change totaled 28,200 (expected 29,300; last 19,800), and July Unemployment Rate decreased to 3.8% (expected 3.9%) from 3.9%. France's July Industrial Production increased 0.3% m/m (expected 0.5%; last -2.3%) while Q2 Nonfarm Payrolls increased 0.2% qtr/qtr (last 0.4%) Italy's July Industrial Production fell 0.7% m/m (expected -0.1%; last -0.3%), decreasing 0.7% yr/yr (expected 0.3%; last -1.2%) $38 bln 3-year Treasury note auction results (prior 12-auction average): High yield: 1.573% (2.407%) Bid-to-cover: 2.42 (2.53) Indirect bid: 46.2% (46.9%) Direct bid: 16.6% (14.2%) Today's Data: The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index fell to 103.1 in August from 104.7 in July.

The luxury furniture retailer raised second quarter guidance on July 29. The company raised EPS guidance to $2.65-2.72 from $2.33-2.47 and revenue to $696-699 mln from $681-688 mln.Q2 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.70 (+8% yr/yr) on revenue of $697.7 mln (+9% yr/yr). The company also raised guidance for fiscal 2020 to $9.08-9.52 from $8.76-9.27 and raised its FY20 guidance revenue guidance to $2.658-2.674 bln form $2.64-2.66 bln. Capital IQ consensus for FY20 calls for EPS of $9.46 (+10.7% yr/yr) on revenue of $2.67 bln (+6.5% yr/yr). Regarding China tariffs, the company said it has renegotiated product costs and selectively raised prices to mitigate the impact of the increase from 10 to 25%. Co is also moving certain production and new product development out of China, plus exploring new partnerships and expanding its own manufacturing facilities in the US. Long term, RH does not believe the current trade climate will impair its ability to achieve stated financial goals. In late August, the company announced that it expects no impact to FY19 or FY20 financial results from the tariffs imposed on current and new product categories imported from China effective September 1st, 2019, October 1st, 2019 and December 15th, 2019.Looking back, the company beat on EPS four out of the last four quarters and best on revenue three out of the last four quarters. Since its core customer base mainly comprises high-end consumers, its business is correlated to how the stock market is performing. From early December through late March, the market experienced sharp volatility as tariff-related headlines wildly swung the indices. During the Q1 earnings call, RH's CEO commented that the Dow plunged 800 points the day after it provided its FY20 guidance. This type of action plays into the psyche and sentiment of consumers who are considering making big-ticket purchases, such as expensive furniture.RH has a $2.7 bln market cap and trades at 16x earnings vs WSM at 14 times earnings. Some 32 of the 16 mlns hare float is sold short.Based on the weekly RH Sep13 $152.50 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~11% in either direction by weekly expiration (Friday).On a positive report, look for resistance near the $156-158 area, while support sits near the $146-148.14:46TPC Tutor Perini reports that it has collected a total to date of $101 mln of cash in connection with the resolution of the five contract matters totaling $125 mln (11.81 +0.89)Most of the $101 mln was collected in the company's third quarter, which ends September 30, 2019, and the company still expects to receive additional cash collections in the near term in connection with the resolution of these five matters. The company does not expect that amounts collected will have an impact on the company's third quarter earnings, in light of the amount of estimated collections previously recorded by the company in its contract assets. The company also confirms that it is continuing to make progress in resolving disputed amounts relating to other contract assets that are subject to negotiation, arbitration, or litigation.14:35SAH Sonic Automotive jumps 12%, reaching 12.5-year high after JP Morgan upgrades to Neutral (from Underweight) and raises PT to $30 (from $23) (32.38 +3.43)Peers: GPI +4.66%, AN +3.42%, PAG +3.27%, CARS +3.02%; CVNA -5.36% as investors rotate out of high-multiple growth stocks14:14NJR NJ Resources increases quarterly cash dividend to $0.3125/share from $0.2925/share (43.87 -0.02)14:01ILMN Illumina outperforming as shares jump 3.5% after sliding to 52-week low earlier in today's session (276.18 +9.34)13:59SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Wendy's (WEN) drops on nationwide breakfast roll-out plan -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersNKTR (19.81 +10.89%): Progresses to its highest levels in almost a month as a collection of biotech stocks display relative strength. Co also disclosed a recent insider purchase from its Chief Scientific Officer, who bought 15,000 shares worth circa $260K. (Related: IMMU, MRNA, AGIO...)ACAD (41.02 +5.59%): Continued strength following interim efficacy analysis updates from its Phase 3 HARMONY trial for pimavanserin (NUPLAZID). Upgraded to Buy from Hold and price target raised to $50 at Canaccord Genuity, citing a belief that co, in light of the DRP indication results, presents scarcity value for strategic interests in the neuro space.FSLY (28.71 +5.45%): Continued volatility; the stock had pulled back circa 19% in the prior two sessions after reaching a new all-time high.Mid Cap LosersWEN (19.57 -10.87%): Announced that it will launch its breakfast menu across its US system in 2020; the menu is currently available in 300+ restaurants. Owing to upfront investment expenses amounting to approx. $20 mln associated with the national breakfast daypart entry, co updated certain aspects of its 2019 outlook, lowering its view for adj. EBITDA and adj. EPS, now calling for losses vs previous guidance for growth, as well as for cash flows from operations and free cash flow. Co is also removing its standing 2020 goals; it intends to update its long-term guidance during its Investor Day in October.OLED (189.15 -10.33%): The stock pulls back on more than 2x average volume from all-time highs established above $230 on Friday. In other items, co's CEO disclosed his recent sale of shares worth approx. $6.9 mln pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 Non-Discretionary Trading Plan. LAUR (16.11 -8.23%): Commenced a secondary public offering of 15.0 mln shares of Class A common stock by selling stockholder Wengen Alberta, Limited Partnership, co's controlling shareholder. Furthermore, co disclosed in connection with the secondary offering that due to the combined impact of the delay of the expected closing of the planned sale of Inti Holdings beyond year-end 2019 and the closing of the divestiture of Education Turkey B.V. prior to year-end 2019, co now expects an approx. $30 mln one-time negative impact to its 2019 free cash flow estimates.13:03BONDX Auction OutTreasury Auction Results$38 bln 3-year Treasury note auction: Auction results: High yield: 1.573% (When-Issued: 1.570%) Bid-to-cover: 2.42Indirect bid: 46.2% Direct bid: 16.6% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.407% Bid-to-cover: 2.53 Indirect bid: 46.9% Direct bid: 14.2%12:57WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stock market trades mixed as investors shift into value stocksThe stock market trades mixed, as investors shift away from crowded areas of the market and into more value-oriented sectors like energy and retail. The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperforms for the second straight day.Today's action has reflected much of yesterday's value trade that benefits underperforming areas of the stock market, most notably the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.8%) and SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.36, +0.93, +2.2%). An upturn in Boeing (BA 366.34, +7.56, +2.1%) and many of the transportation stocks has had a similar effect on the industrials sector (+0.5%).The gains in these areas, however, are coming at the expense of crowded groups like the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.9%), which is the S&P 500's most heavily-weighted sector. The real estate sector (-1.7%), which investors had piled into for its higher dividend yields and low-beta disposition, is today's worst performer.Allowing today's value trade to play out are the improved views on trade and growth, which have helped some money flow out of the Treasury market and drive yields higher. The 2-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.64%, and the 10-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.35.Separately, the market saw a sharp uptick on a report from the South China Morning Post indicating that China is ready to purchase more agricultural products from the U.S. The caveat, though, is that China would want the U.S. to agree to delay tariffs and ease its supply ban on Huawei. Nothing material has transpired, but the report likely triggered some algorithms.Some story stocks today include Wendy's (WEN 19.45, -2.50, -11.4%) and Ford Motor (F 9.28, -0.26, -2.9%). Wendy's is down big after the company lowered its earnings guidance to reflect costs needed to expand its breakfast menu nationwide. Ford Motor is down after its senior unsecured debt was downgraded to "junk status" at Moody's.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August declined to 103.1 from 104.7 in July. The August reading was its lowest in five months, but the index remains running at elevated levels.The July Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed that job openings declined to 7.217 million from a revised 7.248 million in June (from 7.348 million).As a reminder, Apple's (AAPL 214.13, -0.10, -0.1%) annual product event is expected to start within the next few minutes.12:54SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: MNK (32.03 mln +62.86%), TEVA (25.92 mln +10.08%), PFE (17.35 mln +0.74%), ENDP (14.29 mln +31.38%)Materials: FCX (18.78 mln +3.56%)Industrials: GE (38.9 mln +1.67%)Consumer Discretionary: F (45.1 mln -2.99%), JCP (16.14 mln +19.76%), ROKU (15.89 mln -4.55%)Information Technology: AMD (26.95 mln -1.27%), MSFT (14.87 mln -1.32%), MU (13.96 mln -0.12%), Financials: BAC (36.95 mln +1.62%), Energy: CHK (71.72 mln +0.53%), SWN (24.77 mln +5.56%), DNR (19.19 mln +10.21%), RIG (18.03 mln +1.19%), ECA (15.04 mln +0.95%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: MNK (3.88x +62.86%), ITCI (3.59x -2.71%), MMSI (2.79x -9.64%), AUPH (2.62x +13.97%), ACAD (2.23x +7.21%)Materials: GSV (2.16x -7.33%)Industrials: MAXR (2.25x +12.52%), MRTN (2.19x +6.15%), HDS (2.07x -6.49%)Consumer Discretionary: WEN (3.6x -11.82%), LAUR (3.49x -6.21%), ASNA (2.58x +18.14%), NLS (2.23x +4.14%)Financials: HLNE (3.09x -5.17%), IGIB (3.07x -0.28%), STC (2.51x -0.99%), NAC (2.31x -1.45%)Consumer Staples: DF (2.53x +27.78%)12:53SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: MNK (3.42 +62.86%), ENDP (4.03 +31.38%), ADAP (2.07 +21.47%), ACOR (3.62 +14.92%), AUPH (6.61 +13.97%), AKBA (4.86 +13.43%), LXRX (1.6 +12.46%), AMRX (3.37 +12.33%), AKRX (3.03 +12.22%), IMMU (14.89 +12.12%), INO (2.44 +11.42%)Industrials: MAXR (7.91 +12.52%)Consumer Discretionary: JCP (1.02 +19.76%), ASNA (0.36 +18.14%), EXPR (2.98 +14.62%)Energy: SDRL (3.33 +16.84%)Consumer Staples: DF (1.5 +27.78%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: MMSI (27.95 -9.64%), NBIX (94.26 -5.74%), NEO (21.51 -5.65%)Materials: GSV (0.92 -7.33%)Industrials: HDS (38.17 -6.49%)Consumer Discretionary: WEN (19.36 -11.82%), LAUR (16.46 -6.21%), LOPE (107.5 -6.09%), SHAK (96.85 -5.66%), RACE (151.97 -5.46%)Information Technology: OLED (189.99 -9.94%), EPAM (180.44 -6.74%), EVTC (33.36 -6.53%), LSCC (19.53 -6.33%), BAH (69.07 -6.24%), FICO (327.82 -6.14%), PAYC (214.88 -6.05%)Financials: MKTX (343.31 -7.14%), QD (7.37 -6.52%)Consumer Staples: TPB (28.67 -5.88%)12:46OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:NLNK Sep 2 calls are seeing interest with the underlying stock up 10% (volume: 2080, open int: 0, implied vol: ~284%, prev day implied vol: 96%).

The shaky start to the week has trimmed the sector's Q3 gain to 2.2%, but the group remains up almost 29.0% for the year, which leaves it well ahead of the remaining ten sectors.Momentum names lagged yesterday, and they are showing relative weakness again today on no news other than the price action itself. To that point, the likes of Synopsys (SNPS 135.61, -5.65, -4.0%), Visa (V 175.35, -6.20, -3.4%), MasterCard (MA 273.42, -9.94, -3.5%), Fiserv (FISV 103.26, -3.42, -3.2%), Global Payments (GPN 165.77, -5.03, -2.9%), and Automatic Data Processing (ADP 162.96, -5.09, -3.0%) show losses between 3.5% and 4.0% after hitting record highs in recent days.Top-weighted sector components have fared a bit better. For instance, Apple (AAPL 213.40, -0.77, -0.4%) is down just 0.4% ahead of an upcoming product reveal while Alphabet (GOOGL 1202.35, -2.93, -0.2%) shows a slimmer loss. Microsoft (MSFT 135.35, -2.15, -1.6%), however, is down more than 1.5%.The technology sector traded beneath its 50-day moving average at today's low point, but it is currently back above that level, which has acted as an area of congestion over the past month.12:02TALKX Market Briefing: Hold the trade deal enthusiasmThe stock market has gotten a nice pop following a South China Morning Post report indicating China is open to agreeing to buy more agricultural products from the U.S. in a lead up to the October trade meeting in Washington. Tucked inside the same article is a qualifier, however, that China would like to do this in exchange for the U.S. dialing back its restrictions on Huawei and delaying the tariff increases it has planned.In other words, it's a familiar page from the trade playbook, only this play hasn't really gained any yardage in the past.The market (or maybe the algorithms) reacted to the headline with a knee-jerk buying effort, but there isn't much of a basis to run with this news as a major breakthrough since it isn't one. That doesn't mean this market can't, or won't, make more out of the headline than it's worth since it has rallied of late on a sense of relief that neither China nor the U.S. seems intent at this juncture on escalating the trade war even further.Still, this shouldn't be construed as a material development.The Russell 2000 is up 0.8%; the Dow Jones industrial Average is flat; the S&P 500 is down 0.5%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.5%.11:51SCANX Stocks that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (49) outpacing new lows (15) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ABG, ACM, ACRE, AMBA, AN, APO, ARCC, ARNC, AY, AYR, BF.B, BRC, BRX, BX, CASH, CCRN, CE, CHH, CIO, CPRX, CY, DCOM, DRRX, GL, GNRC, HTH, HTLD, ITI, ITRI, KIM, KSU, LM, NVMI, NYCB, OKE, PFNX, PSXP, PTGX, SAH, SAIA, SFL, SITC, SSW, STNG, STWD, SUM, SYY, TROW, WUStocks that traded to 52 week lows: BERY, BMRN, ENTA, FVRR, ILMN, LGND, LVGO, LYFT, MMSI, PD, REGN, RUBY, TRXC, VAPO, WMGIThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AGM, ALG, CMBM, IMKTA, NNI, SAR, TIPTThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: ESTA, HSKA, KRTX11:30XERS Xeris Pharmaceuticals receives FDA approval for GVOKE injection for severe hypoglycemia (shares halted) (11.04 +0.10)Xeris Pharmaceuticals has received regulatory approval from the FDA for GVOKE (glucagon) injection, its ready-to-use, room-temperature stable liquid glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in pediatric and adult patients with diabetes ages 2 years and above.

The FDA's approval is based on positive results from three Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy, safety, and utility of GVOKE in treating severe hypoglycemia when compared with conventional glucagon emergency kits among adults and children with type 1 diabetes.The company is preparing to introduce GVOKE in two different administration options to accommodate the community's preferences, starting with its pre-filled syringe in 4-6 weeks and the auto-injector in 2020.Xeris also has entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and Silicon Valley Bank.

Revenue is expected to decrease 18.7% yr/yr to $1.34 bln. The company reiterated its FY20 guidance on June 4, priming the market for revenue between $7.46 bln and $7.87 bln. The last three months saw just a handful of noteworthy game releases, which likely presented a headwind to overall store traffic in Q2. There are more big titles scheduled to be released in the fall and in early 2020, which should be a positive for the company's outlook.Shares of GME hit a fresh record low in mid-August amid dimming prospects for a meaningful turnaround. The stock recovered from that low over the past couple weeks, aided by comments from investor Michael Burry, who revealed that his fund owns 3% of outstanding shares of GME. Mr. Burry's view is based on the expectation that the next generation of consoles will not do away with physical Blu-ray drives. While the decision to keep physical drives would be a positive for GME, the company would still need to compete with large retailers like Best Buy (BBY 68.95, -0.27, -0.4%), Target (TGT 107.56, -0.39, -0.4%), and Walmart (WMT 116.02, -0.31, -0.3%) at a time when GME has been closing many of its locations.10:18AAPL Apple September product event previewApple is set to unveil new products today at 13:00 ET. Most of these products will have very incremental upgrades. Most of the attention for shareholders will be placed to the pricing of the company's Apple TV Plus and Apple Arcade services. Apple stock is up 35% year-to-date vs. a 22.5% gain in the Nasdaq 100. The stock remains near the high end of its recent range and less than 10% from its all-time high.iPhones: The company is expected to release three new iPhones. The first iPhone will likely be called the iPhone 11 and will feature a 6.1-inch LCD screen similar to the iPhone XR that is currently on sale. The other two phones will be called the iPhone 11 Pro and will feature organic light-emitting diode displays similar to the iPhone Xs and Xs Max. The iPhone 11 Pro will come in two sizes: 5.8 and 6.5 inches. The phones are expected to feature faster processors and better cameras. However, these phones will likely only have incremental improvements as Apple is expected to unveil its 5G iPhone in 2020. Analysts are expecting pricing similar to prior models between $749-1099.Services: Apple could confirm the pricing for its gaming and TV services and introduce additional content expected for those services. It has been reported by several sources that the gaming service will cost $4.99/month and the TV service will cost $9.99/month. Apple will have to compete with other streaming offerings from Disney (DIS) which will be priced lower.Apple Watch 5: The updated smartwatch is expected to feature a ceramic design, faster processors, and more health features such as sleep tracking.Mac: Apple is expected to introduce a 16-inch Mac Book Pro.iPads: There is some speculation that Apple will update its iPad Pro lineup with faster processors and larger screens. However, some analysts feel the iPad will get its own event in October.Other Products: Apple could introduce Apple "tracking tags" that will allow users to find lost items. Expectations are for another underwhelming iPhone cycle ahead of next year's 5G offering. Analysts note that there is a lot of pent up demand with many older iPhones in the installed base. Therefore, there is an expectation for a super cycle for the 5G handset next year. Still, the investment thesis has shifted from iPhone cycles to a more diversified set of hardware and services. Last quarter, iPhone sales fell to less than 50% of revenue for the first time as the success of services, iPads, AirPods, and the Apple Watch picked up the slack for falling iPhone sales. Apple's earnings are expected to grow 10% next year after falling 2% in fiscal 2019, which concludes this month. With a $943 bln market cap, the stock trades at ~17x earnings, or ~15x, backing out the cash.Suppliers to keep on note include: SSNLF, LPL (for displays) and LITE, FNSR and IIVI (for FaceID.) Other suppliers include: SWKS, CRUS, AVGO, QRVO, TSM, and QCOM, among others.

Patients 02002 and 02006 were treated with higher dose levels of RP-L102. Patients 02004 and 02005 received non-optimized and lower doses of RP-L102. Key highlights of the manuscript include:Follow-up data for the initial four patients 18-30 months post-infusion demonstrate progressively increased engraftment in peripheral blood leukocytes and in the bone marrow following administration of RP-L102 without the use of conditioning. In Patient 02002 at 30 months follow-up, approximately 44% of bone marrow CD34+ cells displayed gene marking, suggesting the engraftment of very primitive corrected hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Sequential increases in gene marking in peripheral blood and in the bone marrow for Patients 02004 and 02005 were also seen, but at more modest levels and after longer durations. The bone marrow resistance to MMC in Patient 02002 increased to 70% at 24 months, approaching the phenotype of a healthy donor. Patients 02004, 02005 and 02006 also displayed progressive increases in MMC resistance. DEB exposure resulted in a lower proportion of cells with aberrant chromosomes in Patients 02002, 02004 and 02006. Patient 02002 demonstrated stabilized neutrophil counts and hemoglobin levels as early as six months post-administration of RP-L102. Similar trends were also seen in Patient 02006. Progressive increases in the total number of corrected leukocytes were observed shortly after the initial administration of RP-L102 in all treated patients. Favorable safety profile with no serious adverse events associated with infusion of the investigational product in these initial four patients.07:08STOR STORE Capital increases quarterly dividend to $0.35/share from $0.33/share (37.08 )07:07STC Stewart Info confirms termination of Fidelity National (FNF) merger, names new CEO (33.77 )In light of the FTC's decision, the Stewart Board has clearly determined that leveraging the company's strong brand, financial position, and valued employees to grow the organization as a standalone entity will create the greatest shareholder value.

NfL is a protein that provides structural support to nerve fibres in the brain. An increase in the amount of NfL may be associated with nerve cell damage, and detection of increased NfL levels in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may serve as a biomarker of nerve cell damage.In the Phase III OPERA I study in RMS and the ORATORIO study in PPMS, blood NfL levels were significantly lower after treatment with OCREVUS. In RMS, blood serum NfL levels were reduced by 43 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with a 31 percent reduction with interferon beta-1a (p<0.001). In PPMS, blood plasma NfL levels were reduced by 16 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with 0.2 percent reduction with placebo (p<0.001). Additionally, these analyses showed higher blood NfL levels at the start of the study were correlated with more disability progression in upper and lower limbs in PPMS and overall disability in the interferon beta-1a RMS treatment group at 96 weeks.06:03FTS Fortis announces five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 bln for the period 2020 to 2024, increases quarterly dividend to $0.4775/share from $0.45/share (42.08 )The co announced its five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 billion for the period 2020 to 2024, up $1.0 billion from the prior year's plan.

Reduction in the composite porphyria attack rate with givosiran treatment, which had been observed in the ENVISION Phase 3 study as early as one month after dosing, was shown to be sustained with continued dosing in the OLE phase of the study. Sustained reduction in levels of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), an intermediate in the heme biosynthesis pathway believed to be the primary neurotoxic intermediate responsible for causing both porphyria attacks and ongoing symptoms in between attacks, was also observed with continued dosing. Rapid and sustained lowering of attack rate and ALA levels was also observed in placebo patients who crossed over after the six-month double blind phase of the ENVISION Phase 3 study to receive givosiran in the OLE phase of the study. Givosiran's safety profile in the OLE phase has remained consistent with the profile observed in the double blind phase of the ENVISION study.ENVISION Results of Select Patient Reported Outcomes -- A number of patient reported outcomes were collected as secondary and exploratory measures in the ENVISION study. Daily worst pain did not achieve statistical significance based on the prespecified ANCOVA analysis (p equals 0.0530), however, the data were found to not be normally distributed. A post-hoc analysis of daily worst pain was therefore performed using the non-parametric stratified Wilcoxon test. Based on the non-parametric test, patients on givosiran had a significant reduction in daily worst pain (nominal p equals 0.0455). In exploratory analyses, the reductions in pain were accompanied by fewer days of use of both opioid and non-opioid analgesics. Givosiran did not impact daily worst fatigue or daily worst nausea at six months, although these assessments will be repeated at twelve months to explore the effects of longer term dosing. Updated Phase 1/2 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of April 19, 2019, a robust treatment effect was maintained in givosiran-treated patients with continued dosing in the Phase 1/2 OLE study (N=16), with a mean time on treatment of 22.8 months and total time on treatment across the Phase 1 and OLE studies of up to 35 months. Substantial mean reductions in annualized attack rate (AAR) and in annualized hemin use of greater than 90 percent were observed, with evidence for sustained or potentially enhanced clinical activity with continued dosing. Five out of twelve patients (42 percent) who received givosiran during the Phase 1 study and continued with givosiran dosing in the OLE study and two out of four patients (50 percent) who had been in the placebo arm of the Phase 1 study and crossed over to givosiran treatment in the OLE study achieved an AAR of zero for a mean of 18.1 and 24.9 months, respectively.06:00ACN Accenture acquires Pragsis Bidoop; terms not disclosed (194.83 )Pragsis Bidoop, headquartered in Madrid with additional offices in Barcelona and the U.K., will add more than 200 employees with deep machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data engineering experience, along with its portfolio of end-to-end solutions, to Accenture's Applied Intelligence business.06:00ASX ASE Technology reports August net revenues +10.3% yr/yr to $1.28 bln (4.51 )06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets ease back; S&P Futures take out yesterday's lowThe global equity markets are under slight pressure to start the day.

In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD16:20IMXI International Money Express announces secondary public offering of 5,217,392 shares of common stock by selling stockholders (13.60 -0.55)Shares will be offered by affiliates of Stella Point Capital and certain of the company's other stockholders.

Additionally, the company has decided to discontinue the development of MRT5201, a liver-targeted treatment for OTC deficiency.The company's decision to discontinue the development of MRT5201 for OTC deficiency is based on data from recently completed preclinical studies that do not support the desired pharmacokinetic and safety profile for advancement of the program. These data are related to the first-generation lipid nanoparticle (LNP) designed to be delivered to the liver via intravenous administration for the OTC deficiency program. As such, this LNP is different than that used in the CF and other pulmonary development programs which are designed to deliver the LNP-encapsulated mRNA through nebulization. Additionally, ongoing discovery efforts have generated promising, novel next-generation LNPs supporting the further development of liver disease mRNA therapeutics with potentially favorable product profiles.The company's prioritization of pulmonary diseases is supported by the previously reported positive single-ascending dose Phase 1/2 data from the CF program, which utilizes its proprietary lung delivery platform. MRT5005 is a first-in-class mRNA therapeutic designed to address the underlying cause of CF regardless of genetic mutation by delivering mRNA encoding fully functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein to cells in the lung through nebulization. The multiple-ascending dose portion of the clinical trial is ongoing with data expected in 2020.16:08CASY Casey's General beats by $0.28, beats on revs; reaffirms guidance (167.30 -2.03)Reports Q1 (Jul) earnings of $2.31 per share, $0.28 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.03; revenues rose 1.5% year/year to $2.63 bln vs the $2.59 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The cash session began with modest losses after the overnight affair saw a mixed showing from equity markets in Asia. It is worth noting that China reported its inflation figures for August, showing the largest decrease in producer prices in two years while consumer prices grew more than expected due to surging pork prices. Treasuries made a half-hearted attempt at a rebound during the initial hour of trade before embarking on a steady retreat that continued into the afternoon. The selling was partially supported by a report that the European Central Bank may announce a delayed resumption of asset purchases contingent on further weakness in the eurozone. The MNI report cited an anonymous ECB official, and noted that a disagreement among policymakers may prevent the ECB from announcing aggressive easing measures on Thursday. Treasuries hit session lows after the completion of today's $38 bln 3-yr note auction, which was received with lukewarm demand, as the high yield (1.573%) tailed the when-issued yield by 0.3 bps while the bid-to-cover ratio (2.42x) was below average (2.53x). The U.S. Dollar Index ticked up 0.1% to 98.38. Yield Check: 2-yr: +9 bps to 1.66% 3-yr: +8 bps to 1.60% 5-yr: +9 bps to 1.57% 10-yr: +8 bps to 1.70% 30-yr: +8 bps to 2.18%News: South China Morning Post reported that Chinese trade negotiators could offer to buy more agricultural products from the United States if the U.S. eases tariffs on imports from China. China is currently suffering from a severe pork shortage, meaning the country may have no choice but to increase its purchases of pork and feed (soybeans) from the U.S. President Trump issued an executive order, enhancing the Treasury Department's ability to sanction terrorist leaders. Bloomberg reported that China's Jilin Transportation Investment Group did not exercise a call option on a perpetual note and will instead pay a higher coupon, which is likely to invite concerns about the cash position of the local government financing vehicle. North Korea fired two projectiles into the East Sea, shortly after a DPRK official indicated that North Korea is ready for another round of talks with U.S. officials. China's August CPI increased 0.7% m/m (expected 0.5%; last 0.4%), rising 2.8% yr/yr (expected 2.6%; last 2.8%). August PPI decreased 0.8% yr/yr (expected -0.9%; last -0.3%). Germany's Finance Minister, Olaf Scholz, presented a draft 2020 budget, which does not call for increased debt issuance. Italy's Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, survived his confidence vote in the Senate after winning yesterday's vote in the Chamber of Deputies. U.K.'s July Average Earnings Index + Bonus increased 4.0% yr/yr (expected 3.7%; last 3.8%).

The luxury furniture retailer raised second quarter guidance on July 29. The company raised EPS guidance to $2.65-2.72 from $2.33-2.47 and revenue to $696-699 mln from $681-688 mln.Q2 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.70 (+8% yr/yr) on revenue of $697.7 mln (+9% yr/yr). The company also raised guidance for fiscal 2020 to $9.08-9.52 from $8.76-9.27 and raised its FY20 guidance revenue guidance to $2.658-2.674 bln form $2.64-2.66 bln. Capital IQ consensus for FY20 calls for EPS of $9.46 (+10.7% yr/yr) on revenue of $2.67 bln (+6.5% yr/yr). Regarding China tariffs, the company said it has renegotiated product costs and selectively raised prices to mitigate the impact of the increase from 10 to 25%. Co is also moving certain production and new product development out of China, plus exploring new partnerships and expanding its own manufacturing facilities in the US. Long term, RH does not believe the current trade climate will impair its ability to achieve stated financial goals. In late August, the company announced that it expects no impact to FY19 or FY20 financial results from the tariffs imposed on current and new product categories imported from China effective September 1st, 2019, October 1st, 2019 and December 15th, 2019.Looking back, the company beat on EPS four out of the last four quarters and best on revenue three out of the last four quarters. Since its core customer base mainly comprises high-end consumers, its business is correlated to how the stock market is performing. From early December through late March, the market experienced sharp volatility as tariff-related headlines wildly swung the indices. During the Q1 earnings call, RH's CEO commented that the Dow plunged 800 points the day after it provided its FY20 guidance. This type of action plays into the psyche and sentiment of consumers who are considering making big-ticket purchases, such as expensive furniture.RH has a $2.7 bln market cap and trades at 16x earnings vs WSM at 14 times earnings. Some 32 of the 16 mlns hare float is sold short.Based on the weekly RH Sep13 $152.50 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~11% in either direction by weekly expiration (Friday).On a positive report, look for resistance near the $156-158 area, while support sits near the $146-148.14:46TPC Tutor Perini reports that it has collected a total to date of $101 mln of cash in connection with the resolution of the five contract matters totaling $125 mln (11.81 +0.89)Most of the $101 mln was collected in the company's third quarter, which ends September 30, 2019, and the company still expects to receive additional cash collections in the near term in connection with the resolution of these five matters. The company does not expect that amounts collected will have an impact on the company's third quarter earnings, in light of the amount of estimated collections previously recorded by the company in its contract assets. The company also confirms that it is continuing to make progress in resolving disputed amounts relating to other contract assets that are subject to negotiation, arbitration, or litigation.14:35SAH Sonic Automotive jumps 12%, reaching 12.5-year high after JP Morgan upgrades to Neutral (from Underweight) and raises PT to $30 (from $23) (32.38 +3.43)Peers: GPI +4.66%, AN +3.42%, PAG +3.27%, CARS +3.02%; CVNA -5.36% as investors rotate out of high-multiple growth stocks14:14NJR NJ Resources increases quarterly cash dividend to $0.3125/share from $0.2925/share (43.87 -0.02)14:01ILMN Illumina outperforming as shares jump 3.5% after sliding to 52-week low earlier in today's session (276.18 +9.34)13:59SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Wendy's (WEN) drops on nationwide breakfast roll-out plan -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersNKTR (19.81 +10.89%): Progresses to its highest levels in almost a month as a collection of biotech stocks display relative strength.

Owing to upfront investment expenses amounting to approx. $20 mln associated with the national breakfast daypart entry, co updated certain aspects of its 2019 outlook, lowering its view for adj. EBITDA and adj. EPS, now calling for losses vs previous guidance for growth, as well as for cash flows from operations and free cash flow. Co is also removing its standing 2020 goals; it intends to update its long-term guidance during its Investor Day in October.OLED (189.15 -10.33%): The stock pulls back on more than 2x average volume from all-time highs established above $230 on Friday.

LAUR (16.11 -8.23%): Commenced a secondary public offering of 15.0 mln shares of Class A common stock by selling stockholder Wengen Alberta, Limited Partnership, co's controlling shareholder. Furthermore, co disclosed in connection with the secondary offering that due to the combined impact of the delay of the expected closing of the planned sale of Inti Holdings beyond year-end 2019 and the closing of the divestiture of Education Turkey B.V. prior to year-end 2019, co now expects an approx. $30 mln one-time negative impact to its 2019 free cash flow estimates.13:03BONDX Auction OutTreasury Auction Results$38 bln 3-year Treasury note auction: Auction results: High yield: 1.573% (When-Issued: 1.570%) Bid-to-cover: 2.42Indirect bid: 46.2% Direct bid: 16.6% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.407% Bid-to-cover: 2.53 Indirect bid: 46.9% Direct bid: 14.2%12:57WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stock market trades mixed as investors shift into value stocksThe stock market trades mixed, as investors shift away from crowded areas of the market and into more value-oriented sectors like energy and retail. The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperforms for the second straight day.Today's action has reflected much of yesterday's value trade that benefits underperforming areas of the stock market, most notably the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.8%) and SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.36, +0.93, +2.2%). An upturn in Boeing (BA 366.34, +7.56, +2.1%) and many of the transportation stocks has had a similar effect on the industrials sector (+0.5%).The gains in these areas, however, are coming at the expense of crowded groups like the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.9%), which is the S&P 500's most heavily-weighted sector. The real estate sector (-1.7%), which investors had piled into for its higher dividend yields and low-beta disposition, is today's worst performer.Allowing today's value trade to play out are the improved views on trade and growth, which have helped some money flow out of the Treasury market and drive yields higher. The 2-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.64%, and the 10-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.35.Separately, the market saw a sharp uptick on a report from the South China Morning Post indicating that China is ready to purchase more agricultural products from the U.S. The caveat, though, is that China would want the U.S. to agree to delay tariffs and ease its supply ban on Huawei. Nothing material has transpired, but the report likely triggered some algorithms.Some story stocks today include Wendy's (WEN 19.45, -2.50, -11.4%) and Ford Motor (F 9.28, -0.26, -2.9%).

The shaky start to the week has trimmed the sector's Q3 gain to 2.2%, but the group remains up almost 29.0% for the year, which leaves it well ahead of the remaining ten sectors.Momentum names lagged yesterday, and they are showing relative weakness again today on no news other than the price action itself. To that point, the likes of Synopsys (SNPS 135.61, -5.65, -4.0%), Visa (V 175.35, -6.20, -3.4%), MasterCard (MA 273.42, -9.94, -3.5%), Fiserv (FISV 103.26, -3.42, -3.2%), Global Payments (GPN 165.77, -5.03, -2.9%), and Automatic Data Processing (ADP 162.96, -5.09, -3.0%) show losses between 3.5% and 4.0% after hitting record highs in recent days.Top-weighted sector components have fared a bit better. For instance, Apple (AAPL 213.40, -0.77, -0.4%) is down just 0.4% ahead of an upcoming product reveal while Alphabet (GOOGL 1202.35, -2.93, -0.2%) shows a slimmer loss. Microsoft (MSFT 135.35, -2.15, -1.6%), however, is down more than 1.5%.The technology sector traded beneath its 50-day moving average at today's low point, but it is currently back above that level, which has acted as an area of congestion over the past month.12:02TALKX Market Briefing: Hold the trade deal enthusiasmThe stock market has gotten a nice pop following a South China Morning Post report indicating China is open to agreeing to buy more agricultural products from the U.S. in a lead up to the October trade meeting in Washington. Tucked inside the same article is a qualifier, however, that China would like to do this in exchange for the U.S. dialing back its restrictions on Huawei and delaying the tariff increases it has planned.In other words, it's a familiar page from the trade playbook, only this play hasn't really gained any yardage in the past.The market (or maybe the algorithms) reacted to the headline with a knee-jerk buying effort, but there isn't much of a basis to run with this news as a major breakthrough since it isn't one. That doesn't mean this market can't, or won't, make more out of the headline than it's worth since it has rallied of late on a sense of relief that neither China nor the U.S. seems intent at this juncture on escalating the trade war even further.Still, this shouldn't be construed as a material development.The Russell 2000 is up 0.8%; the Dow Jones industrial Average is flat; the S&P 500 is down 0.5%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.5%.11:51SCANX Stocks that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (49) outpacing new lows (15) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ABG, ACM, ACRE, AMBA, AN, APO, ARCC, ARNC, AY, AYR, BF.B, BRC, BRX, BX, CASH, CCRN, CE, CHH, CIO, CPRX, CY, DCOM, DRRX, GL, GNRC, HTH, HTLD, ITI, ITRI, KIM, KSU, LM, NVMI, NYCB, OKE, PFNX, PSXP, PTGX, SAH, SAIA, SFL, SITC, SSW, STNG, STWD, SUM, SYY, TROW, WUStocks that traded to 52 week lows: BERY, BMRN, ENTA, FVRR, ILMN, LGND, LVGO, LYFT, MMSI, PD, REGN, RUBY, TRXC, VAPO, WMGIThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AGM, ALG, CMBM, IMKTA, NNI, SAR, TIPTThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: ESTA, HSKA, KRTX11:30XERS Xeris Pharmaceuticals receives FDA approval for GVOKE injection for severe hypoglycemia (shares halted) (11.04 +0.10)Xeris Pharmaceuticals has received regulatory approval from the FDA for GVOKE (glucagon) injection, its ready-to-use, room-temperature stable liquid glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in pediatric and adult patients with diabetes ages 2 years and above. GVOKE is the first glucagon product approved that can be administered via a prefilled syringe (GVOKE PFS) or auto-injector (GVOKE HypoPen), reducing the steps to prepare and administer glucagon in the event of severe hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar levels. The FDA's approval is based on positive results from three Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy, safety, and utility of GVOKE in treating severe hypoglycemia when compared with conventional glucagon emergency kits among adults and children with type 1 diabetes.The company is preparing to introduce GVOKE in two different administration options to accommodate the community's preferences, starting with its pre-filled syringe in 4-6 weeks and the auto-injector in 2020.Xeris also has entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and Silicon Valley Bank. The agreement increases the borrowing base from $45 mln to up to $85 mln and extends the maturity date of the debt to as late as June 2024, if the second tranche is drawn.11:30BONDX New SupplyTreasury Auction Preview$38 bln 3-year Treasury note auction (results at 13:00 ET) Prior auction results: High yield: 1.562% Bid-to-cover: 2.41 Indirect bid: 46.7% Direct bid: 19.3% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.407% Bid-to-cover: 2.53 Indirect bid: 46.9% Direct bid: 14.2%11:17SPY Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary of State Pompeo and National Security Advisor Bolton will hold a media briefing at 13:30; topic unknown11:15SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Merit Medical (MMSI) sinks following downgrade -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersENDP (3.72 +21.01%): Continued volatility; the stock recovers yesterday's losses and proceeds to its new highest levels in almost two months.

Revenue is expected to decrease 18.7% yr/yr to $1.34 bln. The company reiterated its FY20 guidance on June 4, priming the market for revenue between $7.46 bln and $7.87 bln. The last three months saw just a handful of noteworthy game releases, which likely presented a headwind to overall store traffic in Q2. There are more big titles scheduled to be released in the fall and in early 2020, which should be a positive for the company's outlook.Shares of GME hit a fresh record low in mid-August amid dimming prospects for a meaningful turnaround. The stock recovered from that low over the past couple weeks, aided by comments from investor Michael Burry, who revealed that his fund owns 3% of outstanding shares of GME. Mr. Burry's view is based on the expectation that the next generation of consoles will not do away with physical Blu-ray drives. While the decision to keep physical drives would be a positive for GME, the company would still need to compete with large retailers like Best Buy (BBY 68.95, -0.27, -0.4%), Target (TGT 107.56, -0.39, -0.4%), and Walmart (WMT 116.02, -0.31, -0.3%) at a time when GME has been closing many of its locations.10:18AAPL Apple September product event previewApple is set to unveil new products today at 13:00 ET. Most of these products will have very incremental upgrades. Most of the attention for shareholders will be placed to the pricing of the company's Apple TV Plus and Apple Arcade services. Apple stock is up 35% year-to-date vs. a 22.5% gain in the Nasdaq 100. The stock remains near the high end of its recent range and less than 10% from its all-time high.iPhones: The company is expected to release three new iPhones. The first iPhone will likely be called the iPhone 11 and will feature a 6.1-inch LCD screen similar to the iPhone XR that is currently on sale. The other two phones will be called the iPhone 11 Pro and will feature organic light-emitting diode displays similar to the iPhone Xs and Xs Max. The iPhone 11 Pro will come in two sizes: 5.8 and 6.5 inches. The phones are expected to feature faster processors and better cameras. However, these phones will likely only have incremental improvements as Apple is expected to unveil its 5G iPhone in 2020. Analysts are expecting pricing similar to prior models between $749-1099.Services: Apple could confirm the pricing for its gaming and TV services and introduce additional content expected for those services. It has been reported by several sources that the gaming service will cost $4.99/month and the TV service will cost $9.99/month. Apple will have to compete with other streaming offerings from Disney (DIS) which will be priced lower.Apple Watch 5: The updated smartwatch is expected to feature a ceramic design, faster processors, and more health features such as sleep tracking.Mac: Apple is expected to introduce a 16-inch Mac Book Pro.iPads: There is some speculation that Apple will update its iPad Pro lineup with faster processors and larger screens. However, some analysts feel the iPad will get its own event in October.Other Products: Apple could introduce Apple "tracking tags" that will allow users to find lost items. Expectations are for another underwhelming iPhone cycle ahead of next year's 5G offering. Analysts note that there is a lot of pent up demand with many older iPhones in the installed base. Therefore, there is an expectation for a super cycle for the 5G handset next year. Still, the investment thesis has shifted from iPhone cycles to a more diversified set of hardware and services. Last quarter, iPhone sales fell to less than 50% of revenue for the first time as the success of services, iPads, AirPods, and the Apple Watch picked up the slack for falling iPhone sales. Apple's earnings are expected to grow 10% next year after falling 2% in fiscal 2019, which concludes this month. With a $943 bln market cap, the stock trades at ~17x earnings, or ~15x, backing out the cash.Suppliers to keep on note include: SSNLF, LPL (for displays) and LITE, FNSR and IIVI (for FaceID.) Other suppliers include: SWKS, CRUS, AVGO, QRVO, TSM, and QCOM, among others.

Patients 02002 and 02006 were treated with higher dose levels of RP-L102. Patients 02004 and 02005 received non-optimized and lower doses of RP-L102. Key highlights of the manuscript include:Follow-up data for the initial four patients 18-30 months post-infusion demonstrate progressively increased engraftment in peripheral blood leukocytes and in the bone marrow following administration of RP-L102 without the use of conditioning. In Patient 02002 at 30 months follow-up, approximately 44% of bone marrow CD34+ cells displayed gene marking, suggesting the engraftment of very primitive corrected hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Sequential increases in gene marking in peripheral blood and in the bone marrow for Patients 02004 and 02005 were also seen, but at more modest levels and after longer durations. The bone marrow resistance to MMC in Patient 02002 increased to 70% at 24 months, approaching the phenotype of a healthy donor.

NfL is a protein that provides structural support to nerve fibres in the brain. An increase in the amount of NfL may be associated with nerve cell damage, and detection of increased NfL levels in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may serve as a biomarker of nerve cell damage.In the Phase III OPERA I study in RMS and the ORATORIO study in PPMS, blood NfL levels were significantly lower after treatment with OCREVUS. In RMS, blood serum NfL levels were reduced by 43 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with a 31 percent reduction with interferon beta-1a (p<0.001). In PPMS, blood plasma NfL levels were reduced by 16 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with 0.2 percent reduction with placebo (p<0.001). Additionally, these analyses showed higher blood NfL levels at the start of the study were correlated with more disability progression in upper and lower limbs in PPMS and overall disability in the interferon beta-1a RMS treatment group at 96 weeks.06:03FTS Fortis announces five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 bln for the period 2020 to 2024, increases quarterly dividend to $0.4775/share from $0.45/share (42.08 )The co announced its five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 billion for the period 2020 to 2024, up $1.0 billion from the prior year's plan.

OS rates at five years were 13.4% for Opdivo and 2.6% for docetaxel. The OS benefit for Opdivo-treated patients was observed across all subgroups.The safety profile for patients treated with Opdivo was consistent with previously reported findings in second-line NSCLC and no new safety signals were seen with extended follow-up. Of patients still on study, only 2 of 70 experienced a new treatment-related select AE between years three and four and there were no new treatment-related select AE's reported between years four and five among the 55 patients still on study.Among patients with an objective response to Opdivo, 32.2% continued to see a response at five years. 0% of patients with an objective response to docetaxel continued to see a response at five years. The median duration of response was 19.9 months for Opdivo-treated patients and 5.6 months for patients treated with docetaxel.06:00ALNY Alnylam Pharma presents new clinical results for Givosiran -- Porphyria attack reductions observed in ENVISION Phase 3 study maintained with ongoing Givosiran dosing in open-label extension study (82.69 )ENVISION Phase 3 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of January 31, 2019, all eligible patients (N=93) from the ENVISION Phase 3 study of givosiran rolled over into the OLE phase of the study. Reduction in the composite porphyria attack rate with givosiran treatment, which had been observed in the ENVISION Phase 3 study as early as one month after dosing, was shown to be sustained with continued dosing in the OLE phase of the study. Sustained reduction in levels of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), an intermediate in the heme biosynthesis pathway believed to be the primary neurotoxic intermediate responsible for causing both porphyria attacks and ongoing symptoms in between attacks, was also observed with continued dosing. Rapid and sustained lowering of attack rate and ALA levels was also observed in placebo patients who crossed over after the six-month double blind phase of the ENVISION Phase 3 study to receive givosiran in the OLE phase of the study. Givosiran's safety profile in the OLE phase has remained consistent with the profile observed in the double blind phase of the ENVISION study.ENVISION Results of Select Patient Reported Outcomes -- A number of patient reported outcomes were collected as secondary and exploratory measures in the ENVISION study. Daily worst pain did not achieve statistical significance based on the prespecified ANCOVA analysis (p equals 0.0530), however, the data were found to not be normally distributed. A post-hoc analysis of daily worst pain was therefore performed using the non-parametric stratified Wilcoxon test. Based on the non-parametric test, patients on givosiran had a significant reduction in daily worst pain (nominal p equals 0.0455). In exploratory analyses, the reductions in pain were accompanied by fewer days of use of both opioid and non-opioid analgesics. Givosiran did not impact daily worst fatigue or daily worst nausea at six months, although these assessments will be repeated at twelve months to explore the effects of longer term dosing. Updated Phase 1/2 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of April 19, 2019, a robust treatment effect was maintained in givosiran-treated patients with continued dosing in the Phase 1/2 OLE study (N=16), with a mean time on treatment of 22.8 months and total time on treatment across the Phase 1 and OLE studies of up to 35 months. Substantial mean reductions in annualized attack rate (AAR) and in annualized hemin use of greater than 90 percent were observed, with evidence for sustained or potentially enhanced clinical activity with continued dosing. Five out of twelve patients (42 percent) who received givosiran during the Phase 1 study and continued with givosiran dosing in the OLE study and two out of four patients (50 percent) who had been in the placebo arm of the Phase 1 study and crossed over to givosiran treatment in the OLE study achieved an AAR of zero for a mean of 18.1 and 24.9 months, respectively.06:00ACN Accenture acquires Pragsis Bidoop; terms not disclosed (194.83 )Pragsis Bidoop, headquartered in Madrid with additional offices in Barcelona and the U.K., will add more than 200 employees with deep machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data engineering experience, along with its portfolio of end-to-end solutions, to Accenture's Applied Intelligence business.06:00ASX ASE Technology reports August net revenues +10.3% yr/yr to $1.28 bln (4.51 )06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets ease back; S&P Futures take out yesterday's lowThe global equity markets are under slight pressure to start the day.

The S&P 500 (-0.01%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) finished near their flat lines.The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%), which is home to many energy and financial stocks, outperformed the broader market.The market entered today on the heels of a two-week rally, with some investors beginning to feel less concerned about growth prospects and trade relations with China. For instance, data has shown the U.S. consumer to be resilient in the face of trade tensions, which could see a reprieve with trade talks coming up next month.This positive sentiment was manifested in the higher oil prices ($57.87/bbl, +$1.42, +2.5%) and the selling in the Treasury market on Monday. In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD16:20IMXI International Money Express announces secondary public offering of 5,217,392 shares of common stock by selling stockholders (13.60 -0.55)Shares will be offered by affiliates of Stella Point Capital and certain of the company's other stockholders.

Additionally, the company has decided to discontinue the development of MRT5201, a liver-targeted treatment for OTC deficiency.The company's decision to discontinue the development of MRT5201 for OTC deficiency is based on data from recently completed preclinical studies that do not support the desired pharmacokinetic and safety profile for advancement of the program. These data are related to the first-generation lipid nanoparticle (LNP) designed to be delivered to the liver via intravenous administration for the OTC deficiency program. As such, this LNP is different than that used in the CF and other pulmonary development programs which are designed to deliver the LNP-encapsulated mRNA through nebulization. Additionally, ongoing discovery efforts have generated promising, novel next-generation LNPs supporting the further development of liver disease mRNA therapeutics with potentially favorable product profiles.The company's prioritization of pulmonary diseases is supported by the previously reported positive single-ascending dose Phase 1/2 data from the CF program, which utilizes its proprietary lung delivery platform. MRT5005 is a first-in-class mRNA therapeutic designed to address the underlying cause of CF regardless of genetic mutation by delivering mRNA encoding fully functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein to cells in the lung through nebulization. The multiple-ascending dose portion of the clinical trial is ongoing with data expected in 2020.16:08CASY Casey's General beats by $0.28, beats on revs; reaffirms guidance (167.30 -2.03)Reports Q1 (Jul) earnings of $2.31 per share, $0.28 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.03; revenues rose 1.5% year/year to $2.63 bln vs the $2.59 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Tuesday's action saw investors continuing to rotate out of this year's best-performing stocks for those perceived as having more potential value.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.3%) was lifted by its highest-priced component, Boeing (BA 369.49, +10.71, +3.0%), while the Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperformed amid big gains in energy stocks. The Nasdaq Composite (-0.04%) finished just below its flat line amid relative weakness in shares of technology companies.Value-oriented stocks, in this case those that have underperformed amid growth concerns, have come to life this week.

The August reading was its lowest in five months, but the index remains running at elevated levels.The July Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed that job openings declined to 7.217 million from a revised 7.248 million in June (from 7.348 million).Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for August, Wholesale Inventories for July, and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.8% YTDS&P 500 +18.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.4% YTDRussell 2000 +14.4% YTD16:21HLIT Harmonic proposes private offering of $105 mln convertible senior notes due 2024 (6.66 +0.06)Harmonic intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase a portion of their outstanding 4.00% convertible senior notes due 2020 in privately negotiated transactions concurrently with the offering of the notes.16:20FSM Fortuna Silver Mines announces US$40 mln bought deal financing - senior subordinated unsecured convertible debentures will mature October 31, 2024 (3.69 +0.05)The Company will use the net proceeds from the Offering for working capital in relation to the start-up of the Lindero project and for general working capital purposes.16:18PRVL Prevail Therapeutics provides update on PR001 development program; announces clinical hold for nGD indication (9.42 +0.33)Prevail Therapeutics today provided an update on the company's clinical development of PR001, a potentially disease-modifying, single-dose gene therapy in development for Parkinson's disease with GBA1 mutations (PD-GBA) and neuronopathic Gaucher disease (nGD).Prevail has an open Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for PR001 for the treatment of PD-GBA, the first indication the company is pursuing. The company is in the process of activating clinical sites for its Phase 1/2 clinical trial in PD-GBA and is on track to initiate patient dosing this year. This ascending dose Phase 1/2 clinical trial will enroll up to sixteen PD-GBA patients. Two escalating dose cohorts are planned. The trial will investigate the safety and tolerability of PR001 and will also measure key biomarkers and exploratory efficacy endpoints.Prevail is also developing PR001 for pediatric nGD, a second indication with urgent unmet need. The company submitted an IND to the FDA for PR001 for the treatment of pediatric patients with nGD. Following discussions with the FDA, and based on preclinical studies that demonstrated increased efficacy at a higher dose, Prevail is modifying the design of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial in nGD to commence at a dose higher than originally proposed. Prevail's IND for PR001 for the treatment of pediatric nGD has been placed on clinical hold pending FDA review of an amendment to the nGD IND, which will detail this modification. No safety or adverse events have been observed in any of Prevail's studies of PR001. The start of the Phase 1/2 trial in nGD is anticipated to be delayed approximately one quarter and to begin enrollment in the first half of 2020. The modification to the nGD Phase 1/2 trial design is not anticipated to delay the overall timeline to trial completion.16:16GHM Graham wins three new international projects in crude oil refining market totaling $19 mln (18.50 +0.27)Co announces it was awarded orders for three projects totally $19 mln.

The higher cost of goods sold is attributed to higher mark downs on slow moving inventory, higher manufacturing costs driven by downtime associated with certain aging production infrastructure, higher coffee brewing equipment and labor costs, and unfavorable shift in customer mix. Margin impact was partially offset by lower green coffee prices. Net loss was $8.8 mln compared to net income of $0.1 mln in the prior year period.Adjusted EBITDA was $3.9 mln compared to $14.0 mln in the prior year period.Appoints new CEOCo announced the appointment of Deverl Maserang as President, Chief Executive Officer, and a member of the company's Board of Directors, effective September 13, 2019.

The cash session began with modest losses after the overnight affair saw a mixed showing from equity markets in Asia. It is worth noting that China reported its inflation figures for August, showing the largest decrease in producer prices in two years while consumer prices grew more than expected due to surging pork prices. Treasuries made a half-hearted attempt at a rebound during the initial hour of trade before embarking on a steady retreat that continued into the afternoon. The selling was partially supported by a report that the European Central Bank may announce a delayed resumption of asset purchases contingent on further weakness in the eurozone. The MNI report cited an anonymous ECB official, and noted that a disagreement among policymakers may prevent the ECB from announcing aggressive easing measures on Thursday. Treasuries hit session lows after the completion of today's $38 bln 3-yr note auction, which was received with lukewarm demand, as the high yield (1.573%) tailed the when-issued yield by 0.3 bps while the bid-to-cover ratio (2.42x) was below average (2.53x). The U.S. Dollar Index ticked up 0.1% to 98.38. Yield Check: 2-yr: +9 bps to 1.66% 3-yr: +8 bps to 1.60% 5-yr: +9 bps to 1.57% 10-yr: +8 bps to 1.70% 30-yr: +8 bps to 2.18%News: South China Morning Post reported that Chinese trade negotiators could offer to buy more agricultural products from the United States if the U.S. eases tariffs on imports from China. China is currently suffering from a severe pork shortage, meaning the country may have no choice but to increase its purchases of pork and feed (soybeans) from the U.S. President Trump issued an executive order, enhancing the Treasury Department's ability to sanction terrorist leaders. Bloomberg reported that China's Jilin Transportation Investment Group did not exercise a call option on a perpetual note and will instead pay a higher coupon, which is likely to invite concerns about the cash position of the local government financing vehicle. North Korea fired two projectiles into the East Sea, shortly after a DPRK official indicated that North Korea is ready for another round of talks with U.S. officials. China's August CPI increased 0.7% m/m (expected 0.5%; last 0.4%), rising 2.8% yr/yr (expected 2.6%; last 2.8%). August PPI decreased 0.8% yr/yr (expected -0.9%; last -0.3%).

The company raised EPS guidance to $2.65-2.72 from $2.33-2.47 and revenue to $696-699 mln from $681-688 mln.Q2 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.70 (+8% yr/yr) on revenue of $697.7 mln (+9% yr/yr).

Capital IQ consensus for FY20 calls for EPS of $9.46 (+10.7% yr/yr) on revenue of $2.67 bln (+6.5% yr/yr). Regarding China tariffs, the company said it has renegotiated product costs and selectively raised prices to mitigate the impact of the increase from 10 to 25%. Co is also moving certain production and new product development out of China, plus exploring new partnerships and expanding its own manufacturing facilities in the US. Long term, RH does not believe the current trade climate will impair its ability to achieve stated financial goals. In late August, the company announced that it expects no impact to FY19 or FY20 financial results from the tariffs imposed on current and new product categories imported from China effective September 1st, 2019, October 1st, 2019 and December 15th, 2019.Looking back, the company beat on EPS four out of the last four quarters and best on revenue three out of the last four quarters. Since its core customer base mainly comprises high-end consumers, its business is correlated to how the stock market is performing. From early December through late March, the market experienced sharp volatility as tariff-related headlines wildly swung the indices. During the Q1 earnings call, RH's CEO commented that the Dow plunged 800 points the day after it provided its FY20 guidance. This type of action plays into the psyche and sentiment of consumers who are considering making big-ticket purchases, such as expensive furniture.RH has a $2.7 bln market cap and trades at 16x earnings vs WSM at 14 times earnings.

The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperforms for the second straight day.Today's action has reflected much of yesterday's value trade that benefits underperforming areas of the stock market, most notably the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.8%) and SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.36, +0.93, +2.2%). An upturn in Boeing (BA 366.34, +7.56, +2.1%) and many of the transportation stocks has had a similar effect on the industrials sector (+0.5%).The gains in these areas, however, are coming at the expense of crowded groups like the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.9%), which is the S&P 500's most heavily-weighted sector. The real estate sector (-1.7%), which investors had piled into for its higher dividend yields and low-beta disposition, is today's worst performer.Allowing today's value trade to play out are the improved views on trade and growth, which have helped some money flow out of the Treasury market and drive yields higher. The 2-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.64%, and the 10-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.35.Separately, the market saw a sharp uptick on a report from the South China Morning Post indicating that China is ready to purchase more agricultural products from the U.S. The caveat, though, is that China would want the U.S. to agree to delay tariffs and ease its supply ban on Huawei. Nothing material has transpired, but the report likely triggered some algorithms.Some story stocks today include Wendy's (WEN 19.45, -2.50, -11.4%) and Ford Motor (F 9.28, -0.26, -2.9%).

The shaky start to the week has trimmed the sector's Q3 gain to 2.2%, but the group remains up almost 29.0% for the year, which leaves it well ahead of the remaining ten sectors.Momentum names lagged yesterday, and they are showing relative weakness again today on no news other than the price action itself. To that point, the likes of Synopsys (SNPS 135.61, -5.65, -4.0%), Visa (V 175.35, -6.20, -3.4%), MasterCard (MA 273.42, -9.94, -3.5%), Fiserv (FISV 103.26, -3.42, -3.2%), Global Payments (GPN 165.77, -5.03, -2.9%), and Automatic Data Processing (ADP 162.96, -5.09, -3.0%) show losses between 3.5% and 4.0% after hitting record highs in recent days.Top-weighted sector components have fared a bit better. For instance, Apple (AAPL 213.40, -0.77, -0.4%) is down just 0.4% ahead of an upcoming product reveal while Alphabet (GOOGL 1202.35, -2.93, -0.2%) shows a slimmer loss. Microsoft (MSFT 135.35, -2.15, -1.6%), however, is down more than 1.5%.The technology sector traded beneath its 50-day moving average at today's low point, but it is currently back above that level, which has acted as an area of congestion over the past month.12:02TALKX Market Briefing: Hold the trade deal enthusiasmThe stock market has gotten a nice pop following a South China Morning Post report indicating China is open to agreeing to buy more agricultural products from the U.S. in a lead up to the October trade meeting in Washington. Tucked inside the same article is a qualifier, however, that China would like to do this in exchange for the U.S. dialing back its restrictions on Huawei and delaying the tariff increases it has planned.In other words, it's a familiar page from the trade playbook, only this play hasn't really gained any yardage in the past.The market (or maybe the algorithms) reacted to the headline with a knee-jerk buying effort, but there isn't much of a basis to run with this news as a major breakthrough since it isn't one. That doesn't mean this market can't, or won't, make more out of the headline than it's worth since it has rallied of late on a sense of relief that neither China nor the U.S. seems intent at this juncture on escalating the trade war even further.Still, this shouldn't be construed as a material development.The Russell 2000 is up 0.8%; the Dow Jones industrial Average is flat; the S&P 500 is down 0.5%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.5%.11:51SCANX Stocks that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (49) outpacing new lows (15) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ABG, ACM, ACRE, AMBA, AN, APO, ARCC, ARNC, AY, AYR, BF.B, BRC, BRX, BX, CASH, CCRN, CE, CHH, CIO, CPRX, CY, DCOM, DRRX, GL, GNRC, HTH, HTLD, ITI, ITRI, KIM, KSU, LM, NVMI, NYCB, OKE, PFNX, PSXP, PTGX, SAH, SAIA, SFL, SITC, SSW, STNG, STWD, SUM, SYY, TROW, WUStocks that traded to 52 week lows: BERY, BMRN, ENTA, FVRR, ILMN, LGND, LVGO, LYFT, MMSI, PD, REGN, RUBY, TRXC, VAPO, WMGIThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AGM, ALG, CMBM, IMKTA, NNI, SAR, TIPTThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: ESTA, HSKA, KRTX11:30XERS Xeris Pharmaceuticals receives FDA approval for GVOKE injection for severe hypoglycemia (shares halted) (11.04 +0.10)Xeris Pharmaceuticals has received regulatory approval from the FDA for GVOKE (glucagon) injection, its ready-to-use, room-temperature stable liquid glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in pediatric and adult patients with diabetes ages 2 years and above. GVOKE is the first glucagon product approved that can be administered via a prefilled syringe (GVOKE PFS) or auto-injector (GVOKE HypoPen), reducing the steps to prepare and administer glucagon in the event of severe hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar levels. The FDA's approval is based on positive results from three Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy, safety, and utility of GVOKE in treating severe hypoglycemia when compared with conventional glucagon emergency kits among adults and children with type 1 diabetes.The company is preparing to introduce GVOKE in two different administration options to accommodate the community's preferences, starting with its pre-filled syringe in 4-6 weeks and the auto-injector in 2020.Xeris also has entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and Silicon Valley Bank. The agreement increases the borrowing base from $45 mln to up to $85 mln and extends the maturity date of the debt to as late as June 2024, if the second tranche is drawn.11:30BONDX New SupplyTreasury Auction Preview$38 bln 3-year Treasury note auction (results at 13:00 ET) Prior auction results: High yield: 1.562% Bid-to-cover: 2.41 Indirect bid: 46.7% Direct bid: 19.3% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.407% Bid-to-cover: 2.53 Indirect bid: 46.9% Direct bid: 14.2%11:17SPY Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary of State Pompeo and National Security Advisor Bolton will hold a media briefing at 13:30; topic unknown11:15SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Merit Medical (MMSI) sinks following downgrade -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersENDP (3.72 +21.01%): Continued volatility; the stock recovers yesterday's losses and proceeds to its new highest levels in almost two months.

Revenue is expected to decrease 18.7% yr/yr to $1.34 bln. The company reiterated its FY20 guidance on June 4, priming the market for revenue between $7.46 bln and $7.87 bln. The last three months saw just a handful of noteworthy game releases, which likely presented a headwind to overall store traffic in Q2. There are more big titles scheduled to be released in the fall and in early 2020, which should be a positive for the company's outlook.Shares of GME hit a fresh record low in mid-August amid dimming prospects for a meaningful turnaround. The stock recovered from that low over the past couple weeks, aided by comments from investor Michael Burry, who revealed that his fund owns 3% of outstanding shares of GME. Mr. Burry's view is based on the expectation that the next generation of consoles will not do away with physical Blu-ray drives. While the decision to keep physical drives would be a positive for GME, the company would still need to compete with large retailers like Best Buy (BBY 68.95, -0.27, -0.4%), Target (TGT 107.56, -0.39, -0.4%), and Walmart (WMT 116.02, -0.31, -0.3%) at a time when GME has been closing many of its locations.10:18AAPL Apple September product event previewApple is set to unveil new products today at 13:00 ET. Most of these products will have very incremental upgrades. Most of the attention for shareholders will be placed to the pricing of the company's Apple TV Plus and Apple Arcade services. Apple stock is up 35% year-to-date vs. a 22.5% gain in the Nasdaq 100. The stock remains near the high end of its recent range and less than 10% from its all-time high.iPhones: The company is expected to release three new iPhones. The first iPhone will likely be called the iPhone 11 and will feature a 6.1-inch LCD screen similar to the iPhone XR that is currently on sale. The other two phones will be called the iPhone 11 Pro and will feature organic light-emitting diode displays similar to the iPhone Xs and Xs Max. The iPhone 11 Pro will come in two sizes: 5.8 and 6.5 inches. The phones are expected to feature faster processors and better cameras. However, these phones will likely only have incremental improvements as Apple is expected to unveil its 5G iPhone in 2020. Analysts are expecting pricing similar to prior models between $749-1099.Services: Apple could confirm the pricing for its gaming and TV services and introduce additional content expected for those services. It has been reported by several sources that the gaming service will cost $4.99/month and the TV service will cost $9.99/month. Apple will have to compete with other streaming offerings from Disney (DIS) which will be priced lower.Apple Watch 5: The updated smartwatch is expected to feature a ceramic design, faster processors, and more health features such as sleep tracking.Mac: Apple is expected to introduce a 16-inch Mac Book Pro.iPads: There is some speculation that Apple will update its iPad Pro lineup with faster processors and larger screens. However, some analysts feel the iPad will get its own event in October.Other Products: Apple could introduce Apple "tracking tags" that will allow users to find lost items. Expectations are for another underwhelming iPhone cycle ahead of next year's 5G offering. Analysts note that there is a lot of pent up demand with many older iPhones in the installed base. Therefore, there is an expectation for a super cycle for the 5G handset next year. Still, the investment thesis has shifted from iPhone cycles to a more diversified set of hardware and services. Last quarter, iPhone sales fell to less than 50% of revenue for the first time as the success of services, iPads, AirPods, and the Apple Watch picked up the slack for falling iPhone sales. Apple's earnings are expected to grow 10% next year after falling 2% in fiscal 2019, which concludes this month. With a $943 bln market cap, the stock trades at ~17x earnings, or ~15x, backing out the cash.Suppliers to keep on note include: SSNLF, LPL (for displays) and LITE, FNSR and IIVI (for FaceID.) Other suppliers include: SWKS, CRUS, AVGO, QRVO, TSM, and QCOM, among others.

Patients 02002 and 02006 were treated with higher dose levels of RP-L102. Patients 02004 and 02005 received non-optimized and lower doses of RP-L102. Key highlights of the manuscript include:Follow-up data for the initial four patients 18-30 months post-infusion demonstrate progressively increased engraftment in peripheral blood leukocytes and in the bone marrow following administration of RP-L102 without the use of conditioning. In Patient 02002 at 30 months follow-up, approximately 44% of bone marrow CD34+ cells displayed gene marking, suggesting the engraftment of very primitive corrected hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Sequential increases in gene marking in peripheral blood and in the bone marrow for Patients 02004 and 02005 were also seen, but at more modest levels and after longer durations. The bone marrow resistance to MMC in Patient 02002 increased to 70% at 24 months, approaching the phenotype of a healthy donor.

NfL is a protein that provides structural support to nerve fibres in the brain. An increase in the amount of NfL may be associated with nerve cell damage, and detection of increased NfL levels in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may serve as a biomarker of nerve cell damage.In the Phase III OPERA I study in RMS and the ORATORIO study in PPMS, blood NfL levels were significantly lower after treatment with OCREVUS. In RMS, blood serum NfL levels were reduced by 43 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with a 31 percent reduction with interferon beta-1a (p<0.001). In PPMS, blood plasma NfL levels were reduced by 16 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with 0.2 percent reduction with placebo (p<0.001). Additionally, these analyses showed higher blood NfL levels at the start of the study were correlated with more disability progression in upper and lower limbs in PPMS and overall disability in the interferon beta-1a RMS treatment group at 96 weeks.06:03FTS Fortis announces five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 bln for the period 2020 to 2024, increases quarterly dividend to $0.4775/share from $0.45/share (42.08 )The co announced its five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 billion for the period 2020 to 2024, up $1.0 billion from the prior year's plan.

OS rates at five years were 13.4% for Opdivo and 2.6% for docetaxel. The OS benefit for Opdivo-treated patients was observed across all subgroups.The safety profile for patients treated with Opdivo was consistent with previously reported findings in second-line NSCLC and no new safety signals were seen with extended follow-up. Of patients still on study, only 2 of 70 experienced a new treatment-related select AE between years three and four and there were no new treatment-related select AE's reported between years four and five among the 55 patients still on study.Among patients with an objective response to Opdivo, 32.2% continued to see a response at five years. 0% of patients with an objective response to docetaxel continued to see a response at five years. The median duration of response was 19.9 months for Opdivo-treated patients and 5.6 months for patients treated with docetaxel.06:00ALNY Alnylam Pharma presents new clinical results for Givosiran -- Porphyria attack reductions observed in ENVISION Phase 3 study maintained with ongoing Givosiran dosing in open-label extension study (82.69 )ENVISION Phase 3 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of January 31, 2019, all eligible patients (N=93) from the ENVISION Phase 3 study of givosiran rolled over into the OLE phase of the study. Reduction in the composite porphyria attack rate with givosiran treatment, which had been observed in the ENVISION Phase 3 study as early as one month after dosing, was shown to be sustained with continued dosing in the OLE phase of the study. Sustained reduction in levels of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), an intermediate in the heme biosynthesis pathway believed to be the primary neurotoxic intermediate responsible for causing both porphyria attacks and ongoing symptoms in between attacks, was also observed with continued dosing. Rapid and sustained lowering of attack rate and ALA levels was also observed in placebo patients who crossed over after the six-month double blind phase of the ENVISION Phase 3 study to receive givosiran in the OLE phase of the study. Givosiran's safety profile in the OLE phase has remained consistent with the profile observed in the double blind phase of the ENVISION study.ENVISION Results of Select Patient Reported Outcomes -- A number of patient reported outcomes were collected as secondary and exploratory measures in the ENVISION study. Daily worst pain did not achieve statistical significance based on the prespecified ANCOVA analysis (p equals 0.0530), however, the data were found to not be normally distributed. A post-hoc analysis of daily worst pain was therefore performed using the non-parametric stratified Wilcoxon test. Based on the non-parametric test, patients on givosiran had a significant reduction in daily worst pain (nominal p equals 0.0455). In exploratory analyses, the reductions in pain were accompanied by fewer days of use of both opioid and non-opioid analgesics. Givosiran did not impact daily worst fatigue or daily worst nausea at six months, although these assessments will be repeated at twelve months to explore the effects of longer term dosing. Updated Phase 1/2 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of April 19, 2019, a robust treatment effect was maintained in givosiran-treated patients with continued dosing in the Phase 1/2 OLE study (N=16), with a mean time on treatment of 22.8 months and total time on treatment across the Phase 1 and OLE studies of up to 35 months. Substantial mean reductions in annualized attack rate (AAR) and in annualized hemin use of greater than 90 percent were observed, with evidence for sustained or potentially enhanced clinical activity with continued dosing. Five out of twelve patients (42 percent) who received givosiran during the Phase 1 study and continued with givosiran dosing in the OLE study and two out of four patients (50 percent) who had been in the placebo arm of the Phase 1 study and crossed over to givosiran treatment in the OLE study achieved an AAR of zero for a mean of 18.1 and 24.9 months, respectively.06:00ACN Accenture acquires Pragsis Bidoop; terms not disclosed (194.83 )Pragsis Bidoop, headquartered in Madrid with additional offices in Barcelona and the U.K., will add more than 200 employees with deep machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data engineering experience, along with its portfolio of end-to-end solutions, to Accenture's Applied Intelligence business.06:00ASX ASE Technology reports August net revenues +10.3% yr/yr to $1.28 bln (4.51 )06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets ease back; S&P Futures take out yesterday's lowThe global equity markets are under slight pressure to start the day.

The S&P 500 (-0.01%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) finished near their flat lines.The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%), which is home to many energy and financial stocks, outperformed the broader market.The market entered today on the heels of a two-week rally, with some investors beginning to feel less concerned about growth prospects and trade relations with China. For instance, data has shown the U.S. consumer to be resilient in the face of trade tensions, which could see a reprieve with trade talks coming up next month.This positive sentiment was manifested in the higher oil prices ($57.87/bbl, +$1.42, +2.5%) and the selling in the Treasury market on Monday. In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD16:20IMXI International Money Express announces secondary public offering of 5,217,392 shares of common stock by selling stockholders (13.60 -0.55)Shares will be offered by affiliates of Stella Point Capital and certain of the company's other stockholders.

Additionally, the company has decided to discontinue the development of MRT5201, a liver-targeted treatment for OTC deficiency.The company's decision to discontinue the development of MRT5201 for OTC deficiency is based on data from recently completed preclinical studies that do not support the desired pharmacokinetic and safety profile for advancement of the program. These data are related to the first-generation lipid nanoparticle (LNP) designed to be delivered to the liver via intravenous administration for the OTC deficiency program. As such, this LNP is different than that used in the CF and other pulmonary development programs which are designed to deliver the LNP-encapsulated mRNA through nebulization. Additionally, ongoing discovery efforts have generated promising, novel next-generation LNPs supporting the further development of liver disease mRNA therapeutics with potentially favorable product profiles.The company's prioritization of pulmonary diseases is supported by the previously reported positive single-ascending dose Phase 1/2 data from the CF program, which utilizes its proprietary lung delivery platform. MRT5005 is a first-in-class mRNA therapeutic designed to address the underlying cause of CF regardless of genetic mutation by delivering mRNA encoding fully functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein to cells in the lung through nebulization. The multiple-ascending dose portion of the clinical trial is ongoing with data expected in 2020.16:08CASY Casey's General beats by $0.28, beats on revs; reaffirms guidance (167.30 -2.03)Reports Q1 (Jul) earnings of $2.31 per share, $0.28 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.03; revenues rose 1.5% year/year to $2.63 bln vs the $2.59 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Tuesday's action saw investors continuing to rotate out of this year's best-performing stocks for those perceived as having more potential value.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.3%) was lifted by its highest-priced component, Boeing (BA 369.49, +10.71, +3.0%), while the Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperformed amid big gains in energy stocks. The Nasdaq Composite (-0.04%) finished just below its flat line amid relative weakness in shares of technology companies.Value-oriented stocks, in this case those that have underperformed amid growth concerns, have come to life this week.

The August reading was its lowest in five months, but the index remains running at elevated levels.The July Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed that job openings declined to 7.217 million from a revised 7.248 million in June (from 7.348 million).Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for August, Wholesale Inventories for July, and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.8% YTDS&P 500 +18.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.4% YTDRussell 2000 +14.4% YTD16:21HLIT Harmonic proposes private offering of $105 mln convertible senior notes due 2024 (6.66 +0.06)Harmonic intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase a portion of their outstanding 4.00% convertible senior notes due 2020 in privately negotiated transactions concurrently with the offering of the notes.16:20FSM Fortuna Silver Mines announces US$40 mln bought deal financing - senior subordinated unsecured convertible debentures will mature October 31, 2024 (3.69 +0.05)The Company will use the net proceeds from the Offering for working capital in relation to the start-up of the Lindero project and for general working capital purposes.16:18PRVL Prevail Therapeutics provides update on PR001 development program; announces clinical hold for nGD indication (9.42 +0.33)Prevail Therapeutics today provided an update on the company's clinical development of PR001, a potentially disease-modifying, single-dose gene therapy in development for Parkinson's disease with GBA1 mutations (PD-GBA) and neuronopathic Gaucher disease (nGD).Prevail has an open Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for PR001 for the treatment of PD-GBA, the first indication the company is pursuing. The company is in the process of activating clinical sites for its Phase 1/2 clinical trial in PD-GBA and is on track to initiate patient dosing this year. This ascending dose Phase 1/2 clinical trial will enroll up to sixteen PD-GBA patients. Two escalating dose cohorts are planned. The trial will investigate the safety and tolerability of PR001 and will also measure key biomarkers and exploratory efficacy endpoints.Prevail is also developing PR001 for pediatric nGD, a second indication with urgent unmet need. The company submitted an IND to the FDA for PR001 for the treatment of pediatric patients with nGD. Following discussions with the FDA, and based on preclinical studies that demonstrated increased efficacy at a higher dose, Prevail is modifying the design of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial in nGD to commence at a dose higher than originally proposed. Prevail's IND for PR001 for the treatment of pediatric nGD has been placed on clinical hold pending FDA review of an amendment to the nGD IND, which will detail this modification. No safety or adverse events have been observed in any of Prevail's studies of PR001. The start of the Phase 1/2 trial in nGD is anticipated to be delayed approximately one quarter and to begin enrollment in the first half of 2020. The modification to the nGD Phase 1/2 trial design is not anticipated to delay the overall timeline to trial completion.16:16GHM Graham wins three new international projects in crude oil refining market totaling $19 mln (18.50 +0.27)Co announces it was awarded orders for three projects totally $19 mln.

The higher cost of goods sold is attributed to higher mark downs on slow moving inventory, higher manufacturing costs driven by downtime associated with certain aging production infrastructure, higher coffee brewing equipment and labor costs, and unfavorable shift in customer mix. Margin impact was partially offset by lower green coffee prices. Net loss was $8.8 mln compared to net income of $0.1 mln in the prior year period.Adjusted EBITDA was $3.9 mln compared to $14.0 mln in the prior year period.Appoints new CEOCo announced the appointment of Deverl Maserang as President, Chief Executive Officer, and a member of the company's Board of Directors, effective September 13, 2019.

The cash session began with modest losses after the overnight affair saw a mixed showing from equity markets in Asia. It is worth noting that China reported its inflation figures for August, showing the largest decrease in producer prices in two years while consumer prices grew more than expected due to surging pork prices. Treasuries made a half-hearted attempt at a rebound during the initial hour of trade before embarking on a steady retreat that continued into the afternoon. The selling was partially supported by a report that the European Central Bank may announce a delayed resumption of asset purchases contingent on further weakness in the eurozone. The MNI report cited an anonymous ECB official, and noted that a disagreement among policymakers may prevent the ECB from announcing aggressive easing measures on Thursday. Treasuries hit session lows after the completion of today's $38 bln 3-yr note auction, which was received with lukewarm demand, as the high yield (1.573%) tailed the when-issued yield by 0.3 bps while the bid-to-cover ratio (2.42x) was below average (2.53x). The U.S. Dollar Index ticked up 0.1% to 98.38. Yield Check: 2-yr: +9 bps to 1.66% 3-yr: +8 bps to 1.60% 5-yr: +9 bps to 1.57% 10-yr: +8 bps to 1.70% 30-yr: +8 bps to 2.18%News: South China Morning Post reported that Chinese trade negotiators could offer to buy more agricultural products from the United States if the U.S. eases tariffs on imports from China. China is currently suffering from a severe pork shortage, meaning the country may have no choice but to increase its purchases of pork and feed (soybeans) from the U.S. President Trump issued an executive order, enhancing the Treasury Department's ability to sanction terrorist leaders. Bloomberg reported that China's Jilin Transportation Investment Group did not exercise a call option on a perpetual note and will instead pay a higher coupon, which is likely to invite concerns about the cash position of the local government financing vehicle. North Korea fired two projectiles into the East Sea, shortly after a DPRK official indicated that North Korea is ready for another round of talks with U.S. officials. China's August CPI increased 0.7% m/m (expected 0.5%; last 0.4%), rising 2.8% yr/yr (expected 2.6%; last 2.8%). August PPI decreased 0.8% yr/yr (expected -0.9%; last -0.3%).

The company raised EPS guidance to $2.65-2.72 from $2.33-2.47 and revenue to $696-699 mln from $681-688 mln.Q2 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.70 (+8% yr/yr) on revenue of $697.7 mln (+9% yr/yr).

Capital IQ consensus for FY20 calls for EPS of $9.46 (+10.7% yr/yr) on revenue of $2.67 bln (+6.5% yr/yr). Regarding China tariffs, the company said it has renegotiated product costs and selectively raised prices to mitigate the impact of the increase from 10 to 25%. Co is also moving certain production and new product development out of China, plus exploring new partnerships and expanding its own manufacturing facilities in the US. Long term, RH does not believe the current trade climate will impair its ability to achieve stated financial goals. In late August, the company announced that it expects no impact to FY19 or FY20 financial results from the tariffs imposed on current and new product categories imported from China effective September 1st, 2019, October 1st, 2019 and December 15th, 2019.Looking back, the company beat on EPS four out of the last four quarters and best on revenue three out of the last four quarters. Since its core customer base mainly comprises high-end consumers, its business is correlated to how the stock market is performing. From early December through late March, the market experienced sharp volatility as tariff-related headlines wildly swung the indices. During the Q1 earnings call, RH's CEO commented that the Dow plunged 800 points the day after it provided its FY20 guidance. This type of action plays into the psyche and sentiment of consumers who are considering making big-ticket purchases, such as expensive furniture.RH has a $2.7 bln market cap and trades at 16x earnings vs WSM at 14 times earnings.

The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperforms for the second straight day.Today's action has reflected much of yesterday's value trade that benefits underperforming areas of the stock market, most notably the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.8%) and SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.36, +0.93, +2.2%). An upturn in Boeing (BA 366.34, +7.56, +2.1%) and many of the transportation stocks has had a similar effect on the industrials sector (+0.5%).The gains in these areas, however, are coming at the expense of crowded groups like the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.9%), which is the S&P 500's most heavily-weighted sector. The real estate sector (-1.7%), which investors had piled into for its higher dividend yields and low-beta disposition, is today's worst performer.Allowing today's value trade to play out are the improved views on trade and growth, which have helped some money flow out of the Treasury market and drive yields higher. The 2-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.64%, and the 10-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.35.Separately, the market saw a sharp uptick on a report from the South China Morning Post indicating that China is ready to purchase more agricultural products from the U.S. The caveat, though, is that China would want the U.S. to agree to delay tariffs and ease its supply ban on Huawei. Nothing material has transpired, but the report likely triggered some algorithms.Some story stocks today include Wendy's (WEN 19.45, -2.50, -11.4%) and Ford Motor (F 9.28, -0.26, -2.9%).

The shaky start to the week has trimmed the sector's Q3 gain to 2.2%, but the group remains up almost 29.0% for the year, which leaves it well ahead of the remaining ten sectors.Momentum names lagged yesterday, and they are showing relative weakness again today on no news other than the price action itself. To that point, the likes of Synopsys (SNPS 135.61, -5.65, -4.0%), Visa (V 175.35, -6.20, -3.4%), MasterCard (MA 273.42, -9.94, -3.5%), Fiserv (FISV 103.26, -3.42, -3.2%), Global Payments (GPN 165.77, -5.03, -2.9%), and Automatic Data Processing (ADP 162.96, -5.09, -3.0%) show losses between 3.5% and 4.0% after hitting record highs in recent days.Top-weighted sector components have fared a bit better. For instance, Apple (AAPL 213.40, -0.77, -0.4%) is down just 0.4% ahead of an upcoming product reveal while Alphabet (GOOGL 1202.35, -2.93, -0.2%) shows a slimmer loss. Microsoft (MSFT 135.35, -2.15, -1.6%), however, is down more than 1.5%.The technology sector traded beneath its 50-day moving average at today's low point, but it is currently back above that level, which has acted as an area of congestion over the past month.12:02TALKX Market Briefing: Hold the trade deal enthusiasmThe stock market has gotten a nice pop following a South China Morning Post report indicating China is open to agreeing to buy more agricultural products from the U.S. in a lead up to the October trade meeting in Washington. Tucked inside the same article is a qualifier, however, that China would like to do this in exchange for the U.S. dialing back its restrictions on Huawei and delaying the tariff increases it has planned.In other words, it's a familiar page from the trade playbook, only this play hasn't really gained any yardage in the past.The market (or maybe the algorithms) reacted to the headline with a knee-jerk buying effort, but there isn't much of a basis to run with this news as a major breakthrough since it isn't one. That doesn't mean this market can't, or won't, make more out of the headline than it's worth since it has rallied of late on a sense of relief that neither China nor the U.S. seems intent at this juncture on escalating the trade war even further.Still, this shouldn't be construed as a material development.The Russell 2000 is up 0.8%; the Dow Jones industrial Average is flat; the S&P 500 is down 0.5%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.5%.11:51SCANX Stocks that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (49) outpacing new lows (15) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ABG, ACM, ACRE, AMBA, AN, APO, ARCC, ARNC, AY, AYR, BF.B, BRC, BRX, BX, CASH, CCRN, CE, CHH, CIO, CPRX, CY, DCOM, DRRX, GL, GNRC, HTH, HTLD, ITI, ITRI, KIM, KSU, LM, NVMI, NYCB, OKE, PFNX, PSXP, PTGX, SAH, SAIA, SFL, SITC, SSW, STNG, STWD, SUM, SYY, TROW, WUStocks that traded to 52 week lows: BERY, BMRN, ENTA, FVRR, ILMN, LGND, LVGO, LYFT, MMSI, PD, REGN, RUBY, TRXC, VAPO, WMGIThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AGM, ALG, CMBM, IMKTA, NNI, SAR, TIPTThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: ESTA, HSKA, KRTX11:30XERS Xeris Pharmaceuticals receives FDA approval for GVOKE injection for severe hypoglycemia (shares halted) (11.04 +0.10)Xeris Pharmaceuticals has received regulatory approval from the FDA for GVOKE (glucagon) injection, its ready-to-use, room-temperature stable liquid glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in pediatric and adult patients with diabetes ages 2 years and above. GVOKE is the first glucagon product approved that can be administered via a prefilled syringe (GVOKE PFS) or auto-injector (GVOKE HypoPen), reducing the steps to prepare and administer glucagon in the event of severe hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar levels. The FDA's approval is based on positive results from three Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy, safety, and utility of GVOKE in treating severe hypoglycemia when compared with conventional glucagon emergency kits among adults and children with type 1 diabetes.The company is preparing to introduce GVOKE in two different administration options to accommodate the community's preferences, starting with its pre-filled syringe in 4-6 weeks and the auto-injector in 2020.Xeris also has entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and Silicon Valley Bank. The agreement increases the borrowing base from $45 mln to up to $85 mln and extends the maturity date of the debt to as late as June 2024, if the second tranche is drawn.11:30BONDX New SupplyTreasury Auction Preview$38 bln 3-year Treasury note auction (results at 13:00 ET) Prior auction results: High yield: 1.562% Bid-to-cover: 2.41 Indirect bid: 46.7% Direct bid: 19.3% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.407% Bid-to-cover: 2.53 Indirect bid: 46.9% Direct bid: 14.2%11:17SPY Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary of State Pompeo and National Security Advisor Bolton will hold a media briefing at 13:30; topic unknown11:15SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Merit Medical (MMSI) sinks following downgrade -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersENDP (3.72 +21.01%): Continued volatility; the stock recovers yesterday's losses and proceeds to its new highest levels in almost two months.

Revenue is expected to decrease 18.7% yr/yr to $1.34 bln. The company reiterated its FY20 guidance on June 4, priming the market for revenue between $7.46 bln and $7.87 bln. The last three months saw just a handful of noteworthy game releases, which likely presented a headwind to overall store traffic in Q2. There are more big titles scheduled to be released in the fall and in early 2020, which should be a positive for the company's outlook.Shares of GME hit a fresh record low in mid-August amid dimming prospects for a meaningful turnaround. The stock recovered from that low over the past couple weeks, aided by comments from investor Michael Burry, who revealed that his fund owns 3% of outstanding shares of GME. Mr. Burry's view is based on the expectation that the next generation of consoles will not do away with physical Blu-ray drives. While the decision to keep physical drives would be a positive for GME, the company would still need to compete with large retailers like Best Buy (BBY 68.95, -0.27, -0.4%), Target (TGT 107.56, -0.39, -0.4%), and Walmart (WMT 116.02, -0.31, -0.3%) at a time when GME has been closing many of its locations.10:18AAPL Apple September product event previewApple is set to unveil new products today at 13:00 ET. Most of these products will have very incremental upgrades. Most of the attention for shareholders will be placed to the pricing of the company's Apple TV Plus and Apple Arcade services. Apple stock is up 35% year-to-date vs. a 22.5% gain in the Nasdaq 100. The stock remains near the high end of its recent range and less than 10% from its all-time high.iPhones: The company is expected to release three new iPhones. The first iPhone will likely be called the iPhone 11 and will feature a 6.1-inch LCD screen similar to the iPhone XR that is currently on sale. The other two phones will be called the iPhone 11 Pro and will feature organic light-emitting diode displays similar to the iPhone Xs and Xs Max. The iPhone 11 Pro will come in two sizes: 5.8 and 6.5 inches. The phones are expected to feature faster processors and better cameras. However, these phones will likely only have incremental improvements as Apple is expected to unveil its 5G iPhone in 2020. Analysts are expecting pricing similar to prior models between $749-1099.Services: Apple could confirm the pricing for its gaming and TV services and introduce additional content expected for those services. It has been reported by several sources that the gaming service will cost $4.99/month and the TV service will cost $9.99/month. Apple will have to compete with other streaming offerings from Disney (DIS) which will be priced lower.Apple Watch 5: The updated smartwatch is expected to feature a ceramic design, faster processors, and more health features such as sleep tracking.Mac: Apple is expected to introduce a 16-inch Mac Book Pro.iPads: There is some speculation that Apple will update its iPad Pro lineup with faster processors and larger screens. However, some analysts feel the iPad will get its own event in October.Other Products: Apple could introduce Apple "tracking tags" that will allow users to find lost items. Expectations are for another underwhelming iPhone cycle ahead of next year's 5G offering. Analysts note that there is a lot of pent up demand with many older iPhones in the installed base. Therefore, there is an expectation for a super cycle for the 5G handset next year. Still, the investment thesis has shifted from iPhone cycles to a more diversified set of hardware and services. Last quarter, iPhone sales fell to less than 50% of revenue for the first time as the success of services, iPads, AirPods, and the Apple Watch picked up the slack for falling iPhone sales. Apple's earnings are expected to grow 10% next year after falling 2% in fiscal 2019, which concludes this month. With a $943 bln market cap, the stock trades at ~17x earnings, or ~15x, backing out the cash.Suppliers to keep on note include: SSNLF, LPL (for displays) and LITE, FNSR and IIVI (for FaceID.) Other suppliers include: SWKS, CRUS, AVGO, QRVO, TSM, and QCOM, among others.

Patients 02002 and 02006 were treated with higher dose levels of RP-L102. Patients 02004 and 02005 received non-optimized and lower doses of RP-L102. Key highlights of the manuscript include:Follow-up data for the initial four patients 18-30 months post-infusion demonstrate progressively increased engraftment in peripheral blood leukocytes and in the bone marrow following administration of RP-L102 without the use of conditioning. In Patient 02002 at 30 months follow-up, approximately 44% of bone marrow CD34+ cells displayed gene marking, suggesting the engraftment of very primitive corrected hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Sequential increases in gene marking in peripheral blood and in the bone marrow for Patients 02004 and 02005 were also seen, but at more modest levels and after longer durations. The bone marrow resistance to MMC in Patient 02002 increased to 70% at 24 months, approaching the phenotype of a healthy donor.

NfL is a protein that provides structural support to nerve fibres in the brain. An increase in the amount of NfL may be associated with nerve cell damage, and detection of increased NfL levels in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may serve as a biomarker of nerve cell damage.In the Phase III OPERA I study in RMS and the ORATORIO study in PPMS, blood NfL levels were significantly lower after treatment with OCREVUS. In RMS, blood serum NfL levels were reduced by 43 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with a 31 percent reduction with interferon beta-1a (p<0.001). In PPMS, blood plasma NfL levels were reduced by 16 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with 0.2 percent reduction with placebo (p<0.001). Additionally, these analyses showed higher blood NfL levels at the start of the study were correlated with more disability progression in upper and lower limbs in PPMS and overall disability in the interferon beta-1a RMS treatment group at 96 weeks.06:03FTS Fortis announces five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 bln for the period 2020 to 2024, increases quarterly dividend to $0.4775/share from $0.45/share (42.08 )The co announced its five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 billion for the period 2020 to 2024, up $1.0 billion from the prior year's plan.

OS rates at five years were 13.4% for Opdivo and 2.6% for docetaxel. The OS benefit for Opdivo-treated patients was observed across all subgroups.The safety profile for patients treated with Opdivo was consistent with previously reported findings in second-line NSCLC and no new safety signals were seen with extended follow-up. Of patients still on study, only 2 of 70 experienced a new treatment-related select AE between years three and four and there were no new treatment-related select AE's reported between years four and five among the 55 patients still on study.Among patients with an objective response to Opdivo, 32.2% continued to see a response at five years. 0% of patients with an objective response to docetaxel continued to see a response at five years. The median duration of response was 19.9 months for Opdivo-treated patients and 5.6 months for patients treated with docetaxel.06:00ALNY Alnylam Pharma presents new clinical results for Givosiran -- Porphyria attack reductions observed in ENVISION Phase 3 study maintained with ongoing Givosiran dosing in open-label extension study (82.69 )ENVISION Phase 3 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of January 31, 2019, all eligible patients (N=93) from the ENVISION Phase 3 study of givosiran rolled over into the OLE phase of the study. Reduction in the composite porphyria attack rate with givosiran treatment, which had been observed in the ENVISION Phase 3 study as early as one month after dosing, was shown to be sustained with continued dosing in the OLE phase of the study. Sustained reduction in levels of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), an intermediate in the heme biosynthesis pathway believed to be the primary neurotoxic intermediate responsible for causing both porphyria attacks and ongoing symptoms in between attacks, was also observed with continued dosing. Rapid and sustained lowering of attack rate and ALA levels was also observed in placebo patients who crossed over after the six-month double blind phase of the ENVISION Phase 3 study to receive givosiran in the OLE phase of the study. Givosiran's safety profile in the OLE phase has remained consistent with the profile observed in the double blind phase of the ENVISION study.ENVISION Results of Select Patient Reported Outcomes -- A number of patient reported outcomes were collected as secondary and exploratory measures in the ENVISION study. Daily worst pain did not achieve statistical significance based on the prespecified ANCOVA analysis (p equals 0.0530), however, the data were found to not be normally distributed. A post-hoc analysis of daily worst pain was therefore performed using the non-parametric stratified Wilcoxon test. Based on the non-parametric test, patients on givosiran had a significant reduction in daily worst pain (nominal p equals 0.0455). In exploratory analyses, the reductions in pain were accompanied by fewer days of use of both opioid and non-opioid analgesics. Givosiran did not impact daily worst fatigue or daily worst nausea at six months, although these assessments will be repeated at twelve months to explore the effects of longer term dosing. Updated Phase 1/2 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of April 19, 2019, a robust treatment effect was maintained in givosiran-treated patients with continued dosing in the Phase 1/2 OLE study (N=16), with a mean time on treatment of 22.8 months and total time on treatment across the Phase 1 and OLE studies of up to 35 months. Substantial mean reductions in annualized attack rate (AAR) and in annualized hemin use of greater than 90 percent were observed, with evidence for sustained or potentially enhanced clinical activity with continued dosing. Five out of twelve patients (42 percent) who received givosiran during the Phase 1 study and continued with givosiran dosing in the OLE study and two out of four patients (50 percent) who had been in the placebo arm of the Phase 1 study and crossed over to givosiran treatment in the OLE study achieved an AAR of zero for a mean of 18.1 and 24.9 months, respectively.06:00ACN Accenture acquires Pragsis Bidoop; terms not disclosed (194.83 )Pragsis Bidoop, headquartered in Madrid with additional offices in Barcelona and the U.K., will add more than 200 employees with deep machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data engineering experience, along with its portfolio of end-to-end solutions, to Accenture's Applied Intelligence business.06:00ASX ASE Technology reports August net revenues +10.3% yr/yr to $1.28 bln (4.51 )06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets ease back; S&P Futures take out yesterday's lowThe global equity markets are under slight pressure to start the day.

The S&P 500 (-0.01%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) finished near their flat lines.The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%), which is home to many energy and financial stocks, outperformed the broader market.The market entered today on the heels of a two-week rally, with some investors beginning to feel less concerned about growth prospects and trade relations with China. For instance, data has shown the U.S. consumer to be resilient in the face of trade tensions, which could see a reprieve with trade talks coming up next month.This positive sentiment was manifested in the higher oil prices ($57.87/bbl, +$1.42, +2.5%) and the selling in the Treasury market on Monday. In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD16:20IMXI International Money Express announces secondary public offering of 5,217,392 shares of common stock by selling stockholders (13.60 -0.55)Shares will be offered by affiliates of Stella Point Capital and certain of the company's other stockholders.

American Realty Capital Properties, Inc., at a cost to the company of approximately $765.5 mln, comprised of a contribution of $738.5 mln toward the Class Action settlement and $27.0 mln toward the Opt Out Action settlements.On September 8, 2019, the company signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) providing for the settlement of the Class Action.

Additionally, the company has decided to discontinue the development of MRT5201, a liver-targeted treatment for OTC deficiency.The company's decision to discontinue the development of MRT5201 for OTC deficiency is based on data from recently completed preclinical studies that do not support the desired pharmacokinetic and safety profile for advancement of the program. These data are related to the first-generation lipid nanoparticle (LNP) designed to be delivered to the liver via intravenous administration for the OTC deficiency program. As such, this LNP is different than that used in the CF and other pulmonary development programs which are designed to deliver the LNP-encapsulated mRNA through nebulization. Additionally, ongoing discovery efforts have generated promising, novel next-generation LNPs supporting the further development of liver disease mRNA therapeutics with potentially favorable product profiles.The company's prioritization of pulmonary diseases is supported by the previously reported positive single-ascending dose Phase 1/2 data from the CF program, which utilizes its proprietary lung delivery platform. MRT5005 is a first-in-class mRNA therapeutic designed to address the underlying cause of CF regardless of genetic mutation by delivering mRNA encoding fully functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein to cells in the lung through nebulization. The multiple-ascending dose portion of the clinical trial is ongoing with data expected in 2020.16:08CASY Casey's General beats by $0.28, beats on revs; reaffirms guidance (167.30 -2.03)Reports Q1 (Jul) earnings of $2.31 per share, $0.28 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.03; revenues rose 1.5% year/year to $2.63 bln vs the $2.59 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Range is updating production guidance for third quarter 2019 to reflect the increased ethane rejection, which results in expected production of approximately 2.22 to 2.23 Bcfe per day, on a reported basis, versus original guidance of 2.25 to 2.26 Bcfe per day.

Tuesday's action saw investors continuing to rotate out of this year's best-performing stocks for those perceived as having more potential value.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.3%) was lifted by its highest-priced component, Boeing (BA 369.49, +10.71, +3.0%), while the Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperformed amid big gains in energy stocks. The Nasdaq Composite (-0.04%) finished just below its flat line amid relative weakness in shares of technology companies.Value-oriented stocks, in this case those that have underperformed amid growth concerns, have come to life this week. Improved sentiment pertaining to growth and trade has contributed to this value trade, which was made most pronounced in the outperformance in the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.3%), SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.61, +1.18, +2.8%), and Dow Jones Transportation Average (+1.5%) on Tuesday.The gains in the transportation space further padded the S&P 500 industrials sector (+1.0%), while Dow Inc. (DOW 46.32, +1.87, +4.2%) boosted the materials sector (+1.0%).The same underlying sentiment boosting these stocks contributed to the selling in the Treasury market and in the S&P 500 information technology (-0.5%), consumer staples (-0.6%), and real estate (-1.4%) sectors. The tech and real estate sectors have been this year's best-performing sectors, largely due to their respective high-growth and defensive-oriented dispositions.Treasury yields finished noticeably higher, as the crowded Treasury market continued to see less demand. The 2-yr yield increased nine basis points to 1.66%, and the 10-yr yield increased eight basis points to 1.70%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.38.In corporate news, Apple (AAPL 216.70, +2.53, +1.2%) held its annual product event where it unveiled its latest iPhone. The $4.99/month pricing for its TV+ streaming service came as a surprise to some and contributed to weakness in Netflix (NFLX 287.99, -6.35, -2.2%).Wendy's (WEN 19.71, -2.24, -10.2%) was a part of the broader effort to sell momentum stocks, but shares were further pressured by the company cutting its EPS guidance. The lower guidance accounted for its plan to launch a breakfast menu in all locations in 2020.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August declined to 103.1 from 104.7 in July.

The company is in the process of activating clinical sites for its Phase 1/2 clinical trial in PD-GBA and is on track to initiate patient dosing this year. This ascending dose Phase 1/2 clinical trial will enroll up to sixteen PD-GBA patients. Two escalating dose cohorts are planned. The trial will investigate the safety and tolerability of PR001 and will also measure key biomarkers and exploratory efficacy endpoints.Prevail is also developing PR001 for pediatric nGD, a second indication with urgent unmet need. The company submitted an IND to the FDA for PR001 for the treatment of pediatric patients with nGD. Following discussions with the FDA, and based on preclinical studies that demonstrated increased efficacy at a higher dose, Prevail is modifying the design of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial in nGD to commence at a dose higher than originally proposed. Prevail's IND for PR001 for the treatment of pediatric nGD has been placed on clinical hold pending FDA review of an amendment to the nGD IND, which will detail this modification. No safety or adverse events have been observed in any of Prevail's studies of PR001. The start of the Phase 1/2 trial in nGD is anticipated to be delayed approximately one quarter and to begin enrollment in the first half of 2020. The modification to the nGD Phase 1/2 trial design is not anticipated to delay the overall timeline to trial completion.16:16GHM Graham wins three new international projects in crude oil refining market totaling $19 mln (18.50 +0.27)Co announces it was awarded orders for three projects totally $19 mln.

The higher cost of goods sold is attributed to higher mark downs on slow moving inventory, higher manufacturing costs driven by downtime associated with certain aging production infrastructure, higher coffee brewing equipment and labor costs, and unfavorable shift in customer mix. Margin impact was partially offset by lower green coffee prices. Net loss was $8.8 mln compared to net income of $0.1 mln in the prior year period.Adjusted EBITDA was $3.9 mln compared to $14.0 mln in the prior year period.Appoints new CEOCo announced the appointment of Deverl Maserang as President, Chief Executive Officer, and a member of the company's Board of Directors, effective September 13, 2019.

The cash session began with modest losses after the overnight affair saw a mixed showing from equity markets in Asia. It is worth noting that China reported its inflation figures for August, showing the largest decrease in producer prices in two years while consumer prices grew more than expected due to surging pork prices. Treasuries made a half-hearted attempt at a rebound during the initial hour of trade before embarking on a steady retreat that continued into the afternoon. The selling was partially supported by a report that the European Central Bank may announce a delayed resumption of asset purchases contingent on further weakness in the eurozone. The MNI report cited an anonymous ECB official, and noted that a disagreement among policymakers may prevent the ECB from announcing aggressive easing measures on Thursday. Treasuries hit session lows after the completion of today's $38 bln 3-yr note auction, which was received with lukewarm demand, as the high yield (1.573%) tailed the when-issued yield by 0.3 bps while the bid-to-cover ratio (2.42x) was below average (2.53x). The U.S. Dollar Index ticked up 0.1% to 98.38. Yield Check: 2-yr: +9 bps to 1.66% 3-yr: +8 bps to 1.60% 5-yr: +9 bps to 1.57% 10-yr: +8 bps to 1.70% 30-yr: +8 bps to 2.18%News: South China Morning Post reported that Chinese trade negotiators could offer to buy more agricultural products from the United States if the U.S. eases tariffs on imports from China. China is currently suffering from a severe pork shortage, meaning the country may have no choice but to increase its purchases of pork and feed (soybeans) from the U.S. President Trump issued an executive order, enhancing the Treasury Department's ability to sanction terrorist leaders. Bloomberg reported that China's Jilin Transportation Investment Group did not exercise a call option on a perpetual note and will instead pay a higher coupon, which is likely to invite concerns about the cash position of the local government financing vehicle. North Korea fired two projectiles into the East Sea, shortly after a DPRK official indicated that North Korea is ready for another round of talks with U.S. officials. China's August CPI increased 0.7% m/m (expected 0.5%; last 0.4%), rising 2.8% yr/yr (expected 2.6%; last 2.8%). August PPI decreased 0.8% yr/yr (expected -0.9%; last -0.3%).

The company raised EPS guidance to $2.65-2.72 from $2.33-2.47 and revenue to $696-699 mln from $681-688 mln.Q2 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.70 (+8% yr/yr) on revenue of $697.7 mln (+9% yr/yr).

Capital IQ consensus for FY20 calls for EPS of $9.46 (+10.7% yr/yr) on revenue of $2.67 bln (+6.5% yr/yr). Regarding China tariffs, the company said it has renegotiated product costs and selectively raised prices to mitigate the impact of the increase from 10 to 25%. Co is also moving certain production and new product development out of China, plus exploring new partnerships and expanding its own manufacturing facilities in the US. Long term, RH does not believe the current trade climate will impair its ability to achieve stated financial goals. In late August, the company announced that it expects no impact to FY19 or FY20 financial results from the tariffs imposed on current and new product categories imported from China effective September 1st, 2019, October 1st, 2019 and December 15th, 2019.Looking back, the company beat on EPS four out of the last four quarters and best on revenue three out of the last four quarters. Since its core customer base mainly comprises high-end consumers, its business is correlated to how the stock market is performing. From early December through late March, the market experienced sharp volatility as tariff-related headlines wildly swung the indices. During the Q1 earnings call, RH's CEO commented that the Dow plunged 800 points the day after it provided its FY20 guidance. This type of action plays into the psyche and sentiment of consumers who are considering making big-ticket purchases, such as expensive furniture.RH has a $2.7 bln market cap and trades at 16x earnings vs WSM at 14 times earnings.

The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperforms for the second straight day.Today's action has reflected much of yesterday's value trade that benefits underperforming areas of the stock market, most notably the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.8%) and SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.36, +0.93, +2.2%). An upturn in Boeing (BA 366.34, +7.56, +2.1%) and many of the transportation stocks has had a similar effect on the industrials sector (+0.5%).The gains in these areas, however, are coming at the expense of crowded groups like the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.9%), which is the S&P 500's most heavily-weighted sector. The real estate sector (-1.7%), which investors had piled into for its higher dividend yields and low-beta disposition, is today's worst performer.Allowing today's value trade to play out are the improved views on trade and growth, which have helped some money flow out of the Treasury market and drive yields higher. The 2-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.64%, and the 10-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.35.Separately, the market saw a sharp uptick on a report from the South China Morning Post indicating that China is ready to purchase more agricultural products from the U.S. The caveat, though, is that China would want the U.S. to agree to delay tariffs and ease its supply ban on Huawei. Nothing material has transpired, but the report likely triggered some algorithms.Some story stocks today include Wendy's (WEN 19.45, -2.50, -11.4%) and Ford Motor (F 9.28, -0.26, -2.9%).

The shaky start to the week has trimmed the sector's Q3 gain to 2.2%, but the group remains up almost 29.0% for the year, which leaves it well ahead of the remaining ten sectors.Momentum names lagged yesterday, and they are showing relative weakness again today on no news other than the price action itself. To that point, the likes of Synopsys (SNPS 135.61, -5.65, -4.0%), Visa (V 175.35, -6.20, -3.4%), MasterCard (MA 273.42, -9.94, -3.5%), Fiserv (FISV 103.26, -3.42, -3.2%), Global Payments (GPN 165.77, -5.03, -2.9%), and Automatic Data Processing (ADP 162.96, -5.09, -3.0%) show losses between 3.5% and 4.0% after hitting record highs in recent days.Top-weighted sector components have fared a bit better. For instance, Apple (AAPL 213.40, -0.77, -0.4%) is down just 0.4% ahead of an upcoming product reveal while Alphabet (GOOGL 1202.35, -2.93, -0.2%) shows a slimmer loss. Microsoft (MSFT 135.35, -2.15, -1.6%), however, is down more than 1.5%.The technology sector traded beneath its 50-day moving average at today's low point, but it is currently back above that level, which has acted as an area of congestion over the past month.12:02TALKX Market Briefing: Hold the trade deal enthusiasmThe stock market has gotten a nice pop following a South China Morning Post report indicating China is open to agreeing to buy more agricultural products from the U.S. in a lead up to the October trade meeting in Washington. Tucked inside the same article is a qualifier, however, that China would like to do this in exchange for the U.S. dialing back its restrictions on Huawei and delaying the tariff increases it has planned.In other words, it's a familiar page from the trade playbook, only this play hasn't really gained any yardage in the past.The market (or maybe the algorithms) reacted to the headline with a knee-jerk buying effort, but there isn't much of a basis to run with this news as a major breakthrough since it isn't one. That doesn't mean this market can't, or won't, make more out of the headline than it's worth since it has rallied of late on a sense of relief that neither China nor the U.S. seems intent at this juncture on escalating the trade war even further.Still, this shouldn't be construed as a material development.The Russell 2000 is up 0.8%; the Dow Jones industrial Average is flat; the S&P 500 is down 0.5%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.5%.11:51SCANX Stocks that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (49) outpacing new lows (15) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ABG, ACM, ACRE, AMBA, AN, APO, ARCC, ARNC, AY, AYR, BF.B, BRC, BRX, BX, CASH, CCRN, CE, CHH, CIO, CPRX, CY, DCOM, DRRX, GL, GNRC, HTH, HTLD, ITI, ITRI, KIM, KSU, LM, NVMI, NYCB, OKE, PFNX, PSXP, PTGX, SAH, SAIA, SFL, SITC, SSW, STNG, STWD, SUM, SYY, TROW, WUStocks that traded to 52 week lows: BERY, BMRN, ENTA, FVRR, ILMN, LGND, LVGO, LYFT, MMSI, PD, REGN, RUBY, TRXC, VAPO, WMGIThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AGM, ALG, CMBM, IMKTA, NNI, SAR, TIPTThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: ESTA, HSKA, KRTX11:30XERS Xeris Pharmaceuticals receives FDA approval for GVOKE injection for severe hypoglycemia (shares halted) (11.04 +0.10)Xeris Pharmaceuticals has received regulatory approval from the FDA for GVOKE (glucagon) injection, its ready-to-use, room-temperature stable liquid glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in pediatric and adult patients with diabetes ages 2 years and above. GVOKE is the first glucagon product approved that can be administered via a prefilled syringe (GVOKE PFS) or auto-injector (GVOKE HypoPen), reducing the steps to prepare and administer glucagon in the event of severe hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar levels. The FDA's approval is based on positive results from three Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy, safety, and utility of GVOKE in treating severe hypoglycemia when compared with conventional glucagon emergency kits among adults and children with type 1 diabetes.The company is preparing to introduce GVOKE in two different administration options to accommodate the community's preferences, starting with its pre-filled syringe in 4-6 weeks and the auto-injector in 2020.Xeris also has entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and Silicon Valley Bank. The agreement increases the borrowing base from $45 mln to up to $85 mln and extends the maturity date of the debt to as late as June 2024, if the second tranche is drawn.11:30BONDX New SupplyTreasury Auction Preview$38 bln 3-year Treasury note auction (results at 13:00 ET) Prior auction results: High yield: 1.562% Bid-to-cover: 2.41 Indirect bid: 46.7% Direct bid: 19.3% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.407% Bid-to-cover: 2.53 Indirect bid: 46.9% Direct bid: 14.2%11:17SPY Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary of State Pompeo and National Security Advisor Bolton will hold a media briefing at 13:30; topic unknown11:15SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Merit Medical (MMSI) sinks following downgrade -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersENDP (3.72 +21.01%): Continued volatility; the stock recovers yesterday's losses and proceeds to its new highest levels in almost two months.

Revenue is expected to decrease 18.7% yr/yr to $1.34 bln. The company reiterated its FY20 guidance on June 4, priming the market for revenue between $7.46 bln and $7.87 bln. The last three months saw just a handful of noteworthy game releases, which likely presented a headwind to overall store traffic in Q2. There are more big titles scheduled to be released in the fall and in early 2020, which should be a positive for the company's outlook.Shares of GME hit a fresh record low in mid-August amid dimming prospects for a meaningful turnaround. The stock recovered from that low over the past couple weeks, aided by comments from investor Michael Burry, who revealed that his fund owns 3% of outstanding shares of GME. Mr. Burry's view is based on the expectation that the next generation of consoles will not do away with physical Blu-ray drives. While the decision to keep physical drives would be a positive for GME, the company would still need to compete with large retailers like Best Buy (BBY 68.95, -0.27, -0.4%), Target (TGT 107.56, -0.39, -0.4%), and Walmart (WMT 116.02, -0.31, -0.3%) at a time when GME has been closing many of its locations.10:18AAPL Apple September product event previewApple is set to unveil new products today at 13:00 ET. Most of these products will have very incremental upgrades. Most of the attention for shareholders will be placed to the pricing of the company's Apple TV Plus and Apple Arcade services. Apple stock is up 35% year-to-date vs. a 22.5% gain in the Nasdaq 100. The stock remains near the high end of its recent range and less than 10% from its all-time high.iPhones: The company is expected to release three new iPhones. The first iPhone will likely be called the iPhone 11 and will feature a 6.1-inch LCD screen similar to the iPhone XR that is currently on sale. The other two phones will be called the iPhone 11 Pro and will feature organic light-emitting diode displays similar to the iPhone Xs and Xs Max. The iPhone 11 Pro will come in two sizes: 5.8 and 6.5 inches. The phones are expected to feature faster processors and better cameras. However, these phones will likely only have incremental improvements as Apple is expected to unveil its 5G iPhone in 2020. Analysts are expecting pricing similar to prior models between $749-1099.Services: Apple could confirm the pricing for its gaming and TV services and introduce additional content expected for those services. It has been reported by several sources that the gaming service will cost $4.99/month and the TV service will cost $9.99/month. Apple will have to compete with other streaming offerings from Disney (DIS) which will be priced lower.Apple Watch 5: The updated smartwatch is expected to feature a ceramic design, faster processors, and more health features such as sleep tracking.Mac: Apple is expected to introduce a 16-inch Mac Book Pro.iPads: There is some speculation that Apple will update its iPad Pro lineup with faster processors and larger screens. However, some analysts feel the iPad will get its own event in October.Other Products: Apple could introduce Apple "tracking tags" that will allow users to find lost items. Expectations are for another underwhelming iPhone cycle ahead of next year's 5G offering. Analysts note that there is a lot of pent up demand with many older iPhones in the installed base. Therefore, there is an expectation for a super cycle for the 5G handset next year. Still, the investment thesis has shifted from iPhone cycles to a more diversified set of hardware and services. Last quarter, iPhone sales fell to less than 50% of revenue for the first time as the success of services, iPads, AirPods, and the Apple Watch picked up the slack for falling iPhone sales. Apple's earnings are expected to grow 10% next year after falling 2% in fiscal 2019, which concludes this month. With a $943 bln market cap, the stock trades at ~17x earnings, or ~15x, backing out the cash.Suppliers to keep on note include: SSNLF, LPL (for displays) and LITE, FNSR and IIVI (for FaceID.) Other suppliers include: SWKS, CRUS, AVGO, QRVO, TSM, and QCOM, among others.

Patients 02002 and 02006 were treated with higher dose levels of RP-L102. Patients 02004 and 02005 received non-optimized and lower doses of RP-L102. Key highlights of the manuscript include:Follow-up data for the initial four patients 18-30 months post-infusion demonstrate progressively increased engraftment in peripheral blood leukocytes and in the bone marrow following administration of RP-L102 without the use of conditioning. In Patient 02002 at 30 months follow-up, approximately 44% of bone marrow CD34+ cells displayed gene marking, suggesting the engraftment of very primitive corrected hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Sequential increases in gene marking in peripheral blood and in the bone marrow for Patients 02004 and 02005 were also seen, but at more modest levels and after longer durations. The bone marrow resistance to MMC in Patient 02002 increased to 70% at 24 months, approaching the phenotype of a healthy donor.

NfL is a protein that provides structural support to nerve fibres in the brain. An increase in the amount of NfL may be associated with nerve cell damage, and detection of increased NfL levels in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may serve as a biomarker of nerve cell damage.In the Phase III OPERA I study in RMS and the ORATORIO study in PPMS, blood NfL levels were significantly lower after treatment with OCREVUS. In RMS, blood serum NfL levels were reduced by 43 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with a 31 percent reduction with interferon beta-1a (p<0.001). In PPMS, blood plasma NfL levels were reduced by 16 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with 0.2 percent reduction with placebo (p<0.001). Additionally, these analyses showed higher blood NfL levels at the start of the study were correlated with more disability progression in upper and lower limbs in PPMS and overall disability in the interferon beta-1a RMS treatment group at 96 weeks.06:03FTS Fortis announces five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 bln for the period 2020 to 2024, increases quarterly dividend to $0.4775/share from $0.45/share (42.08 )The co announced its five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 billion for the period 2020 to 2024, up $1.0 billion from the prior year's plan.

OS rates at five years were 13.4% for Opdivo and 2.6% for docetaxel. The OS benefit for Opdivo-treated patients was observed across all subgroups.The safety profile for patients treated with Opdivo was consistent with previously reported findings in second-line NSCLC and no new safety signals were seen with extended follow-up. Of patients still on study, only 2 of 70 experienced a new treatment-related select AE between years three and four and there were no new treatment-related select AE's reported between years four and five among the 55 patients still on study.Among patients with an objective response to Opdivo, 32.2% continued to see a response at five years. 0% of patients with an objective response to docetaxel continued to see a response at five years. The median duration of response was 19.9 months for Opdivo-treated patients and 5.6 months for patients treated with docetaxel.06:00ALNY Alnylam Pharma presents new clinical results for Givosiran -- Porphyria attack reductions observed in ENVISION Phase 3 study maintained with ongoing Givosiran dosing in open-label extension study (82.69 )ENVISION Phase 3 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of January 31, 2019, all eligible patients (N=93) from the ENVISION Phase 3 study of givosiran rolled over into the OLE phase of the study. Reduction in the composite porphyria attack rate with givosiran treatment, which had been observed in the ENVISION Phase 3 study as early as one month after dosing, was shown to be sustained with continued dosing in the OLE phase of the study. Sustained reduction in levels of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), an intermediate in the heme biosynthesis pathway believed to be the primary neurotoxic intermediate responsible for causing both porphyria attacks and ongoing symptoms in between attacks, was also observed with continued dosing. Rapid and sustained lowering of attack rate and ALA levels was also observed in placebo patients who crossed over after the six-month double blind phase of the ENVISION Phase 3 study to receive givosiran in the OLE phase of the study. Givosiran's safety profile in the OLE phase has remained consistent with the profile observed in the double blind phase of the ENVISION study.ENVISION Results of Select Patient Reported Outcomes -- A number of patient reported outcomes were collected as secondary and exploratory measures in the ENVISION study. Daily worst pain did not achieve statistical significance based on the prespecified ANCOVA analysis (p equals 0.0530), however, the data were found to not be normally distributed. A post-hoc analysis of daily worst pain was therefore performed using the non-parametric stratified Wilcoxon test. Based on the non-parametric test, patients on givosiran had a significant reduction in daily worst pain (nominal p equals 0.0455). In exploratory analyses, the reductions in pain were accompanied by fewer days of use of both opioid and non-opioid analgesics. Givosiran did not impact daily worst fatigue or daily worst nausea at six months, although these assessments will be repeated at twelve months to explore the effects of longer term dosing. Updated Phase 1/2 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of April 19, 2019, a robust treatment effect was maintained in givosiran-treated patients with continued dosing in the Phase 1/2 OLE study (N=16), with a mean time on treatment of 22.8 months and total time on treatment across the Phase 1 and OLE studies of up to 35 months. Substantial mean reductions in annualized attack rate (AAR) and in annualized hemin use of greater than 90 percent were observed, with evidence for sustained or potentially enhanced clinical activity with continued dosing. Five out of twelve patients (42 percent) who received givosiran during the Phase 1 study and continued with givosiran dosing in the OLE study and two out of four patients (50 percent) who had been in the placebo arm of the Phase 1 study and crossed over to givosiran treatment in the OLE study achieved an AAR of zero for a mean of 18.1 and 24.9 months, respectively.06:00ACN Accenture acquires Pragsis Bidoop; terms not disclosed (194.83 )Pragsis Bidoop, headquartered in Madrid with additional offices in Barcelona and the U.K., will add more than 200 employees with deep machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data engineering experience, along with its portfolio of end-to-end solutions, to Accenture's Applied Intelligence business.06:00ASX ASE Technology reports August net revenues +10.3% yr/yr to $1.28 bln (4.51 )06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets ease back; S&P Futures take out yesterday's lowThe global equity markets are under slight pressure to start the day.

The S&P 500 (-0.01%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) finished near their flat lines.The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%), which is home to many energy and financial stocks, outperformed the broader market.The market entered today on the heels of a two-week rally, with some investors beginning to feel less concerned about growth prospects and trade relations with China. For instance, data has shown the U.S. consumer to be resilient in the face of trade tensions, which could see a reprieve with trade talks coming up next month.This positive sentiment was manifested in the higher oil prices ($57.87/bbl, +$1.42, +2.5%) and the selling in the Treasury market on Monday. In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD16:20IMXI International Money Express announces secondary public offering of 5,217,392 shares of common stock by selling stockholders (13.60 -0.55)Shares will be offered by affiliates of Stella Point Capital and certain of the company's other stockholders.

American Realty Capital Properties, Inc., at a cost to the company of approximately $765.5 mln, comprised of a contribution of $738.5 mln toward the Class Action settlement and $27.0 mln toward the Opt Out Action settlements.On September 8, 2019, the company signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) providing for the settlement of the Class Action.

Additionally, the company has decided to discontinue the development of MRT5201, a liver-targeted treatment for OTC deficiency.The company's decision to discontinue the development of MRT5201 for OTC deficiency is based on data from recently completed preclinical studies that do not support the desired pharmacokinetic and safety profile for advancement of the program. These data are related to the first-generation lipid nanoparticle (LNP) designed to be delivered to the liver via intravenous administration for the OTC deficiency program. As such, this LNP is different than that used in the CF and other pulmonary development programs which are designed to deliver the LNP-encapsulated mRNA through nebulization. Additionally, ongoing discovery efforts have generated promising, novel next-generation LNPs supporting the further development of liver disease mRNA therapeutics with potentially favorable product profiles.The company's prioritization of pulmonary diseases is supported by the previously reported positive single-ascending dose Phase 1/2 data from the CF program, which utilizes its proprietary lung delivery platform. MRT5005 is a first-in-class mRNA therapeutic designed to address the underlying cause of CF regardless of genetic mutation by delivering mRNA encoding fully functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein to cells in the lung through nebulization. The multiple-ascending dose portion of the clinical trial is ongoing with data expected in 2020.16:08CASY Casey's General beats by $0.28, beats on revs; reaffirms guidance (167.30 -2.03)Reports Q1 (Jul) earnings of $2.31 per share, $0.28 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.03; revenues rose 1.5% year/year to $2.63 bln vs the $2.59 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Range is updating production guidance for third quarter 2019 to reflect the increased ethane rejection, which results in expected production of approximately 2.22 to 2.23 Bcfe per day, on a reported basis, versus original guidance of 2.25 to 2.26 Bcfe per day.

Tuesday's action saw investors continuing to rotate out of this year's best-performing stocks for those perceived as having more potential value.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.3%) was lifted by its highest-priced component, Boeing (BA 369.49, +10.71, +3.0%), while the Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperformed amid big gains in energy stocks. The Nasdaq Composite (-0.04%) finished just below its flat line amid relative weakness in shares of technology companies.Value-oriented stocks, in this case those that have underperformed amid growth concerns, have come to life this week. Improved sentiment pertaining to growth and trade has contributed to this value trade, which was made most pronounced in the outperformance in the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.3%), SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.61, +1.18, +2.8%), and Dow Jones Transportation Average (+1.5%) on Tuesday.The gains in the transportation space further padded the S&P 500 industrials sector (+1.0%), while Dow Inc. (DOW 46.32, +1.87, +4.2%) boosted the materials sector (+1.0%).The same underlying sentiment boosting these stocks contributed to the selling in the Treasury market and in the S&P 500 information technology (-0.5%), consumer staples (-0.6%), and real estate (-1.4%) sectors. The tech and real estate sectors have been this year's best-performing sectors, largely due to their respective high-growth and defensive-oriented dispositions.Treasury yields finished noticeably higher, as the crowded Treasury market continued to see less demand. The 2-yr yield increased nine basis points to 1.66%, and the 10-yr yield increased eight basis points to 1.70%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.38.In corporate news, Apple (AAPL 216.70, +2.53, +1.2%) held its annual product event where it unveiled its latest iPhone. The $4.99/month pricing for its TV+ streaming service came as a surprise to some and contributed to weakness in Netflix (NFLX 287.99, -6.35, -2.2%).Wendy's (WEN 19.71, -2.24, -10.2%) was a part of the broader effort to sell momentum stocks, but shares were further pressured by the company cutting its EPS guidance. The lower guidance accounted for its plan to launch a breakfast menu in all locations in 2020.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August declined to 103.1 from 104.7 in July.

The company is in the process of activating clinical sites for its Phase 1/2 clinical trial in PD-GBA and is on track to initiate patient dosing this year. This ascending dose Phase 1/2 clinical trial will enroll up to sixteen PD-GBA patients. Two escalating dose cohorts are planned. The trial will investigate the safety and tolerability of PR001 and will also measure key biomarkers and exploratory efficacy endpoints.Prevail is also developing PR001 for pediatric nGD, a second indication with urgent unmet need. The company submitted an IND to the FDA for PR001 for the treatment of pediatric patients with nGD. Following discussions with the FDA, and based on preclinical studies that demonstrated increased efficacy at a higher dose, Prevail is modifying the design of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial in nGD to commence at a dose higher than originally proposed. Prevail's IND for PR001 for the treatment of pediatric nGD has been placed on clinical hold pending FDA review of an amendment to the nGD IND, which will detail this modification. No safety or adverse events have been observed in any of Prevail's studies of PR001. The start of the Phase 1/2 trial in nGD is anticipated to be delayed approximately one quarter and to begin enrollment in the first half of 2020. The modification to the nGD Phase 1/2 trial design is not anticipated to delay the overall timeline to trial completion.16:16GHM Graham wins three new international projects in crude oil refining market totaling $19 mln (18.50 +0.27)Co announces it was awarded orders for three projects totally $19 mln.

The higher cost of goods sold is attributed to higher mark downs on slow moving inventory, higher manufacturing costs driven by downtime associated with certain aging production infrastructure, higher coffee brewing equipment and labor costs, and unfavorable shift in customer mix. Margin impact was partially offset by lower green coffee prices. Net loss was $8.8 mln compared to net income of $0.1 mln in the prior year period.Adjusted EBITDA was $3.9 mln compared to $14.0 mln in the prior year period.Appoints new CEOCo announced the appointment of Deverl Maserang as President, Chief Executive Officer, and a member of the company's Board of Directors, effective September 13, 2019.

The cash session began with modest losses after the overnight affair saw a mixed showing from equity markets in Asia. It is worth noting that China reported its inflation figures for August, showing the largest decrease in producer prices in two years while consumer prices grew more than expected due to surging pork prices. Treasuries made a half-hearted attempt at a rebound during the initial hour of trade before embarking on a steady retreat that continued into the afternoon. The selling was partially supported by a report that the European Central Bank may announce a delayed resumption of asset purchases contingent on further weakness in the eurozone. The MNI report cited an anonymous ECB official, and noted that a disagreement among policymakers may prevent the ECB from announcing aggressive easing measures on Thursday. Treasuries hit session lows after the completion of today's $38 bln 3-yr note auction, which was received with lukewarm demand, as the high yield (1.573%) tailed the when-issued yield by 0.3 bps while the bid-to-cover ratio (2.42x) was below average (2.53x). The U.S. Dollar Index ticked up 0.1% to 98.38. Yield Check: 2-yr: +9 bps to 1.66% 3-yr: +8 bps to 1.60% 5-yr: +9 bps to 1.57% 10-yr: +8 bps to 1.70% 30-yr: +8 bps to 2.18%News: South China Morning Post reported that Chinese trade negotiators could offer to buy more agricultural products from the United States if the U.S. eases tariffs on imports from China. China is currently suffering from a severe pork shortage, meaning the country may have no choice but to increase its purchases of pork and feed (soybeans) from the U.S. President Trump issued an executive order, enhancing the Treasury Department's ability to sanction terrorist leaders. Bloomberg reported that China's Jilin Transportation Investment Group did not exercise a call option on a perpetual note and will instead pay a higher coupon, which is likely to invite concerns about the cash position of the local government financing vehicle. North Korea fired two projectiles into the East Sea, shortly after a DPRK official indicated that North Korea is ready for another round of talks with U.S. officials. China's August CPI increased 0.7% m/m (expected 0.5%; last 0.4%), rising 2.8% yr/yr (expected 2.6%; last 2.8%). August PPI decreased 0.8% yr/yr (expected -0.9%; last -0.3%).

The company raised EPS guidance to $2.65-2.72 from $2.33-2.47 and revenue to $696-699 mln from $681-688 mln.Q2 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.70 (+8% yr/yr) on revenue of $697.7 mln (+9% yr/yr).

Capital IQ consensus for FY20 calls for EPS of $9.46 (+10.7% yr/yr) on revenue of $2.67 bln (+6.5% yr/yr). Regarding China tariffs, the company said it has renegotiated product costs and selectively raised prices to mitigate the impact of the increase from 10 to 25%. Co is also moving certain production and new product development out of China, plus exploring new partnerships and expanding its own manufacturing facilities in the US. Long term, RH does not believe the current trade climate will impair its ability to achieve stated financial goals. In late August, the company announced that it expects no impact to FY19 or FY20 financial results from the tariffs imposed on current and new product categories imported from China effective September 1st, 2019, October 1st, 2019 and December 15th, 2019.Looking back, the company beat on EPS four out of the last four quarters and best on revenue three out of the last four quarters. Since its core customer base mainly comprises high-end consumers, its business is correlated to how the stock market is performing. From early December through late March, the market experienced sharp volatility as tariff-related headlines wildly swung the indices. During the Q1 earnings call, RH's CEO commented that the Dow plunged 800 points the day after it provided its FY20 guidance. This type of action plays into the psyche and sentiment of consumers who are considering making big-ticket purchases, such as expensive furniture.RH has a $2.7 bln market cap and trades at 16x earnings vs WSM at 14 times earnings.

The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperforms for the second straight day.Today's action has reflected much of yesterday's value trade that benefits underperforming areas of the stock market, most notably the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.8%) and SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.36, +0.93, +2.2%). An upturn in Boeing (BA 366.34, +7.56, +2.1%) and many of the transportation stocks has had a similar effect on the industrials sector (+0.5%).The gains in these areas, however, are coming at the expense of crowded groups like the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.9%), which is the S&P 500's most heavily-weighted sector. The real estate sector (-1.7%), which investors had piled into for its higher dividend yields and low-beta disposition, is today's worst performer.Allowing today's value trade to play out are the improved views on trade and growth, which have helped some money flow out of the Treasury market and drive yields higher. The 2-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.64%, and the 10-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.35.Separately, the market saw a sharp uptick on a report from the South China Morning Post indicating that China is ready to purchase more agricultural products from the U.S. The caveat, though, is that China would want the U.S. to agree to delay tariffs and ease its supply ban on Huawei. Nothing material has transpired, but the report likely triggered some algorithms.Some story stocks today include Wendy's (WEN 19.45, -2.50, -11.4%) and Ford Motor (F 9.28, -0.26, -2.9%).

The shaky start to the week has trimmed the sector's Q3 gain to 2.2%, but the group remains up almost 29.0% for the year, which leaves it well ahead of the remaining ten sectors.Momentum names lagged yesterday, and they are showing relative weakness again today on no news other than the price action itself. To that point, the likes of Synopsys (SNPS 135.61, -5.65, -4.0%), Visa (V 175.35, -6.20, -3.4%), MasterCard (MA 273.42, -9.94, -3.5%), Fiserv (FISV 103.26, -3.42, -3.2%), Global Payments (GPN 165.77, -5.03, -2.9%), and Automatic Data Processing (ADP 162.96, -5.09, -3.0%) show losses between 3.5% and 4.0% after hitting record highs in recent days.Top-weighted sector components have fared a bit better. For instance, Apple (AAPL 213.40, -0.77, -0.4%) is down just 0.4% ahead of an upcoming product reveal while Alphabet (GOOGL 1202.35, -2.93, -0.2%) shows a slimmer loss. Microsoft (MSFT 135.35, -2.15, -1.6%), however, is down more than 1.5%.The technology sector traded beneath its 50-day moving average at today's low point, but it is currently back above that level, which has acted as an area of congestion over the past month.12:02TALKX Market Briefing: Hold the trade deal enthusiasmThe stock market has gotten a nice pop following a South China Morning Post report indicating China is open to agreeing to buy more agricultural products from the U.S. in a lead up to the October trade meeting in Washington. Tucked inside the same article is a qualifier, however, that China would like to do this in exchange for the U.S. dialing back its restrictions on Huawei and delaying the tariff increases it has planned.In other words, it's a familiar page from the trade playbook, only this play hasn't really gained any yardage in the past.The market (or maybe the algorithms) reacted to the headline with a knee-jerk buying effort, but there isn't much of a basis to run with this news as a major breakthrough since it isn't one. That doesn't mean this market can't, or won't, make more out of the headline than it's worth since it has rallied of late on a sense of relief that neither China nor the U.S. seems intent at this juncture on escalating the trade war even further.Still, this shouldn't be construed as a material development.The Russell 2000 is up 0.8%; the Dow Jones industrial Average is flat; the S&P 500 is down 0.5%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.5%.11:51SCANX Stocks that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (49) outpacing new lows (15) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ABG, ACM, ACRE, AMBA, AN, APO, ARCC, ARNC, AY, AYR, BF.B, BRC, BRX, BX, CASH, CCRN, CE, CHH, CIO, CPRX, CY, DCOM, DRRX, GL, GNRC, HTH, HTLD, ITI, ITRI, KIM, KSU, LM, NVMI, NYCB, OKE, PFNX, PSXP, PTGX, SAH, SAIA, SFL, SITC, SSW, STNG, STWD, SUM, SYY, TROW, WUStocks that traded to 52 week lows: BERY, BMRN, ENTA, FVRR, ILMN, LGND, LVGO, LYFT, MMSI, PD, REGN, RUBY, TRXC, VAPO, WMGIThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AGM, ALG, CMBM, IMKTA, NNI, SAR, TIPTThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: ESTA, HSKA, KRTX11:30XERS Xeris Pharmaceuticals receives FDA approval for GVOKE injection for severe hypoglycemia (shares halted) (11.04 +0.10)Xeris Pharmaceuticals has received regulatory approval from the FDA for GVOKE (glucagon) injection, its ready-to-use, room-temperature stable liquid glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in pediatric and adult patients with diabetes ages 2 years and above. GVOKE is the first glucagon product approved that can be administered via a prefilled syringe (GVOKE PFS) or auto-injector (GVOKE HypoPen), reducing the steps to prepare and administer glucagon in the event of severe hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar levels. The FDA's approval is based on positive results from three Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy, safety, and utility of GVOKE in treating severe hypoglycemia when compared with conventional glucagon emergency kits among adults and children with type 1 diabetes.The company is preparing to introduce GVOKE in two different administration options to accommodate the community's preferences, starting with its pre-filled syringe in 4-6 weeks and the auto-injector in 2020.Xeris also has entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and Silicon Valley Bank. The agreement increases the borrowing base from $45 mln to up to $85 mln and extends the maturity date of the debt to as late as June 2024, if the second tranche is drawn.11:30BONDX New SupplyTreasury Auction Preview$38 bln 3-year Treasury note auction (results at 13:00 ET) Prior auction results: High yield: 1.562% Bid-to-cover: 2.41 Indirect bid: 46.7% Direct bid: 19.3% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.407% Bid-to-cover: 2.53 Indirect bid: 46.9% Direct bid: 14.2%11:17SPY Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary of State Pompeo and National Security Advisor Bolton will hold a media briefing at 13:30; topic unknown11:15SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Merit Medical (MMSI) sinks following downgrade -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersENDP (3.72 +21.01%): Continued volatility; the stock recovers yesterday's losses and proceeds to its new highest levels in almost two months.

Revenue is expected to decrease 18.7% yr/yr to $1.34 bln. The company reiterated its FY20 guidance on June 4, priming the market for revenue between $7.46 bln and $7.87 bln. The last three months saw just a handful of noteworthy game releases, which likely presented a headwind to overall store traffic in Q2. There are more big titles scheduled to be released in the fall and in early 2020, which should be a positive for the company's outlook.Shares of GME hit a fresh record low in mid-August amid dimming prospects for a meaningful turnaround. The stock recovered from that low over the past couple weeks, aided by comments from investor Michael Burry, who revealed that his fund owns 3% of outstanding shares of GME. Mr. Burry's view is based on the expectation that the next generation of consoles will not do away with physical Blu-ray drives. While the decision to keep physical drives would be a positive for GME, the company would still need to compete with large retailers like Best Buy (BBY 68.95, -0.27, -0.4%), Target (TGT 107.56, -0.39, -0.4%), and Walmart (WMT 116.02, -0.31, -0.3%) at a time when GME has been closing many of its locations.10:18AAPL Apple September product event previewApple is set to unveil new products today at 13:00 ET. Most of these products will have very incremental upgrades. Most of the attention for shareholders will be placed to the pricing of the company's Apple TV Plus and Apple Arcade services. Apple stock is up 35% year-to-date vs. a 22.5% gain in the Nasdaq 100. The stock remains near the high end of its recent range and less than 10% from its all-time high.iPhones: The company is expected to release three new iPhones. The first iPhone will likely be called the iPhone 11 and will feature a 6.1-inch LCD screen similar to the iPhone XR that is currently on sale. The other two phones will be called the iPhone 11 Pro and will feature organic light-emitting diode displays similar to the iPhone Xs and Xs Max. The iPhone 11 Pro will come in two sizes: 5.8 and 6.5 inches. The phones are expected to feature faster processors and better cameras. However, these phones will likely only have incremental improvements as Apple is expected to unveil its 5G iPhone in 2020. Analysts are expecting pricing similar to prior models between $749-1099.Services: Apple could confirm the pricing for its gaming and TV services and introduce additional content expected for those services. It has been reported by several sources that the gaming service will cost $4.99/month and the TV service will cost $9.99/month. Apple will have to compete with other streaming offerings from Disney (DIS) which will be priced lower.Apple Watch 5: The updated smartwatch is expected to feature a ceramic design, faster processors, and more health features such as sleep tracking.Mac: Apple is expected to introduce a 16-inch Mac Book Pro.iPads: There is some speculation that Apple will update its iPad Pro lineup with faster processors and larger screens. However, some analysts feel the iPad will get its own event in October.Other Products: Apple could introduce Apple "tracking tags" that will allow users to find lost items. Expectations are for another underwhelming iPhone cycle ahead of next year's 5G offering. Analysts note that there is a lot of pent up demand with many older iPhones in the installed base. Therefore, there is an expectation for a super cycle for the 5G handset next year. Still, the investment thesis has shifted from iPhone cycles to a more diversified set of hardware and services. Last quarter, iPhone sales fell to less than 50% of revenue for the first time as the success of services, iPads, AirPods, and the Apple Watch picked up the slack for falling iPhone sales. Apple's earnings are expected to grow 10% next year after falling 2% in fiscal 2019, which concludes this month. With a $943 bln market cap, the stock trades at ~17x earnings, or ~15x, backing out the cash.Suppliers to keep on note include: SSNLF, LPL (for displays) and LITE, FNSR and IIVI (for FaceID.) Other suppliers include: SWKS, CRUS, AVGO, QRVO, TSM, and QCOM, among others.

Patients 02002 and 02006 were treated with higher dose levels of RP-L102. Patients 02004 and 02005 received non-optimized and lower doses of RP-L102. Key highlights of the manuscript include:Follow-up data for the initial four patients 18-30 months post-infusion demonstrate progressively increased engraftment in peripheral blood leukocytes and in the bone marrow following administration of RP-L102 without the use of conditioning. In Patient 02002 at 30 months follow-up, approximately 44% of bone marrow CD34+ cells displayed gene marking, suggesting the engraftment of very primitive corrected hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Sequential increases in gene marking in peripheral blood and in the bone marrow for Patients 02004 and 02005 were also seen, but at more modest levels and after longer durations. The bone marrow resistance to MMC in Patient 02002 increased to 70% at 24 months, approaching the phenotype of a healthy donor.

NfL is a protein that provides structural support to nerve fibres in the brain. An increase in the amount of NfL may be associated with nerve cell damage, and detection of increased NfL levels in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may serve as a biomarker of nerve cell damage.In the Phase III OPERA I study in RMS and the ORATORIO study in PPMS, blood NfL levels were significantly lower after treatment with OCREVUS. In RMS, blood serum NfL levels were reduced by 43 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with a 31 percent reduction with interferon beta-1a (p<0.001). In PPMS, blood plasma NfL levels were reduced by 16 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with 0.2 percent reduction with placebo (p<0.001). Additionally, these analyses showed higher blood NfL levels at the start of the study were correlated with more disability progression in upper and lower limbs in PPMS and overall disability in the interferon beta-1a RMS treatment group at 96 weeks.06:03FTS Fortis announces five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 bln for the period 2020 to 2024, increases quarterly dividend to $0.4775/share from $0.45/share (42.08 )The co announced its five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 billion for the period 2020 to 2024, up $1.0 billion from the prior year's plan.

OS rates at five years were 13.4% for Opdivo and 2.6% for docetaxel. The OS benefit for Opdivo-treated patients was observed across all subgroups.The safety profile for patients treated with Opdivo was consistent with previously reported findings in second-line NSCLC and no new safety signals were seen with extended follow-up. Of patients still on study, only 2 of 70 experienced a new treatment-related select AE between years three and four and there were no new treatment-related select AE's reported between years four and five among the 55 patients still on study.Among patients with an objective response to Opdivo, 32.2% continued to see a response at five years. 0% of patients with an objective response to docetaxel continued to see a response at five years. The median duration of response was 19.9 months for Opdivo-treated patients and 5.6 months for patients treated with docetaxel.06:00ALNY Alnylam Pharma presents new clinical results for Givosiran -- Porphyria attack reductions observed in ENVISION Phase 3 study maintained with ongoing Givosiran dosing in open-label extension study (82.69 )ENVISION Phase 3 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of January 31, 2019, all eligible patients (N=93) from the ENVISION Phase 3 study of givosiran rolled over into the OLE phase of the study. Reduction in the composite porphyria attack rate with givosiran treatment, which had been observed in the ENVISION Phase 3 study as early as one month after dosing, was shown to be sustained with continued dosing in the OLE phase of the study. Sustained reduction in levels of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), an intermediate in the heme biosynthesis pathway believed to be the primary neurotoxic intermediate responsible for causing both porphyria attacks and ongoing symptoms in between attacks, was also observed with continued dosing. Rapid and sustained lowering of attack rate and ALA levels was also observed in placebo patients who crossed over after the six-month double blind phase of the ENVISION Phase 3 study to receive givosiran in the OLE phase of the study. Givosiran's safety profile in the OLE phase has remained consistent with the profile observed in the double blind phase of the ENVISION study.ENVISION Results of Select Patient Reported Outcomes -- A number of patient reported outcomes were collected as secondary and exploratory measures in the ENVISION study. Daily worst pain did not achieve statistical significance based on the prespecified ANCOVA analysis (p equals 0.0530), however, the data were found to not be normally distributed. A post-hoc analysis of daily worst pain was therefore performed using the non-parametric stratified Wilcoxon test. Based on the non-parametric test, patients on givosiran had a significant reduction in daily worst pain (nominal p equals 0.0455). In exploratory analyses, the reductions in pain were accompanied by fewer days of use of both opioid and non-opioid analgesics. Givosiran did not impact daily worst fatigue or daily worst nausea at six months, although these assessments will be repeated at twelve months to explore the effects of longer term dosing. Updated Phase 1/2 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of April 19, 2019, a robust treatment effect was maintained in givosiran-treated patients with continued dosing in the Phase 1/2 OLE study (N=16), with a mean time on treatment of 22.8 months and total time on treatment across the Phase 1 and OLE studies of up to 35 months. Substantial mean reductions in annualized attack rate (AAR) and in annualized hemin use of greater than 90 percent were observed, with evidence for sustained or potentially enhanced clinical activity with continued dosing. Five out of twelve patients (42 percent) who received givosiran during the Phase 1 study and continued with givosiran dosing in the OLE study and two out of four patients (50 percent) who had been in the placebo arm of the Phase 1 study and crossed over to givosiran treatment in the OLE study achieved an AAR of zero for a mean of 18.1 and 24.9 months, respectively.06:00ACN Accenture acquires Pragsis Bidoop; terms not disclosed (194.83 )Pragsis Bidoop, headquartered in Madrid with additional offices in Barcelona and the U.K., will add more than 200 employees with deep machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data engineering experience, along with its portfolio of end-to-end solutions, to Accenture's Applied Intelligence business.06:00ASX ASE Technology reports August net revenues +10.3% yr/yr to $1.28 bln (4.51 )06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets ease back; S&P Futures take out yesterday's lowThe global equity markets are under slight pressure to start the day.

The S&P 500 (-0.01%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) finished near their flat lines.The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%), which is home to many energy and financial stocks, outperformed the broader market.The market entered today on the heels of a two-week rally, with some investors beginning to feel less concerned about growth prospects and trade relations with China. For instance, data has shown the U.S. consumer to be resilient in the face of trade tensions, which could see a reprieve with trade talks coming up next month.This positive sentiment was manifested in the higher oil prices ($57.87/bbl, +$1.42, +2.5%) and the selling in the Treasury market on Monday. In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD16:20IMXI International Money Express announces secondary public offering of 5,217,392 shares of common stock by selling stockholders (13.60 -0.55)Shares will be offered by affiliates of Stella Point Capital and certain of the company's other stockholders.

American Realty Capital Properties, Inc., at a cost to the company of approximately $765.5 mln, comprised of a contribution of $738.5 mln toward the Class Action settlement and $27.0 mln toward the Opt Out Action settlements.On September 8, 2019, the company signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) providing for the settlement of the Class Action.

Additionally, the company has decided to discontinue the development of MRT5201, a liver-targeted treatment for OTC deficiency.The company's decision to discontinue the development of MRT5201 for OTC deficiency is based on data from recently completed preclinical studies that do not support the desired pharmacokinetic and safety profile for advancement of the program. These data are related to the first-generation lipid nanoparticle (LNP) designed to be delivered to the liver via intravenous administration for the OTC deficiency program. As such, this LNP is different than that used in the CF and other pulmonary development programs which are designed to deliver the LNP-encapsulated mRNA through nebulization. Additionally, ongoing discovery efforts have generated promising, novel next-generation LNPs supporting the further development of liver disease mRNA therapeutics with potentially favorable product profiles.The company's prioritization of pulmonary diseases is supported by the previously reported positive single-ascending dose Phase 1/2 data from the CF program, which utilizes its proprietary lung delivery platform. MRT5005 is a first-in-class mRNA therapeutic designed to address the underlying cause of CF regardless of genetic mutation by delivering mRNA encoding fully functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein to cells in the lung through nebulization. The multiple-ascending dose portion of the clinical trial is ongoing with data expected in 2020.16:08CASY Casey's General beats by $0.28, beats on revs; reaffirms guidance (167.30 -2.03)Reports Q1 (Jul) earnings of $2.31 per share, $0.28 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.03; revenues rose 1.5% year/year to $2.63 bln vs the $2.59 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Tuesday's action saw investors continuing to rotate out of this year's best-performing stocks for those perceived as having more potential value.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.3%) was lifted by its highest-priced component, Boeing (BA 369.49, +10.71, +3.0%), while the Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperformed amid big gains in energy stocks. The Nasdaq Composite (-0.04%) finished just below its flat line amid relative weakness in shares of technology companies.Value-oriented stocks, in this case those that have underperformed amid growth concerns, have come to life this week. Improved sentiment pertaining to growth and trade has contributed to this value trade, which was made most pronounced in the outperformance in the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.3%), SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.61, +1.18, +2.8%), and Dow Jones Transportation Average (+1.5%) on Tuesday.The gains in the transportation space further padded the S&P 500 industrials sector (+1.0%), while Dow Inc. (DOW 46.32, +1.87, +4.2%) boosted the materials sector (+1.0%).The same underlying sentiment boosting these stocks contributed to the selling in the Treasury market and in the S&P 500 information technology (-0.5%), consumer staples (-0.6%), and real estate (-1.4%) sectors. The tech and real estate sectors have been this year's best-performing sectors, largely due to their respective high-growth and defensive-oriented dispositions.Treasury yields finished noticeably higher, as the crowded Treasury market continued to see less demand. The 2-yr yield increased nine basis points to 1.66%, and the 10-yr yield increased eight basis points to 1.70%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.38.In corporate news, Apple (AAPL 216.70, +2.53, +1.2%) held its annual product event where it unveiled its latest iPhone. The $4.99/month pricing for its TV+ streaming service came as a surprise to some and contributed to weakness in Netflix (NFLX 287.99, -6.35, -2.2%).Wendy's (WEN 19.71, -2.24, -10.2%) was a part of the broader effort to sell momentum stocks, but shares were further pressured by the company cutting its EPS guidance. The lower guidance accounted for its plan to launch a breakfast menu in all locations in 2020.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August declined to 103.1 from 104.7 in July.

The company is in the process of activating clinical sites for its Phase 1/2 clinical trial in PD-GBA and is on track to initiate patient dosing this year. This ascending dose Phase 1/2 clinical trial will enroll up to sixteen PD-GBA patients. Two escalating dose cohorts are planned. The trial will investigate the safety and tolerability of PR001 and will also measure key biomarkers and exploratory efficacy endpoints.Prevail is also developing PR001 for pediatric nGD, a second indication with urgent unmet need. The company submitted an IND to the FDA for PR001 for the treatment of pediatric patients with nGD. Following discussions with the FDA, and based on preclinical studies that demonstrated increased efficacy at a higher dose, Prevail is modifying the design of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial in nGD to commence at a dose higher than originally proposed. Prevail's IND for PR001 for the treatment of pediatric nGD has been placed on clinical hold pending FDA review of an amendment to the nGD IND, which will detail this modification. No safety or adverse events have been observed in any of Prevail's studies of PR001. The start of the Phase 1/2 trial in nGD is anticipated to be delayed approximately one quarter and to begin enrollment in the first half of 2020. The modification to the nGD Phase 1/2 trial design is not anticipated to delay the overall timeline to trial completion.16:16GHM Graham wins three new international projects in crude oil refining market totaling $19 mln (18.50 +0.27)Co announces it was awarded orders for three projects totally $19 mln.

The higher cost of goods sold is attributed to higher mark downs on slow moving inventory, higher manufacturing costs driven by downtime associated with certain aging production infrastructure, higher coffee brewing equipment and labor costs, and unfavorable shift in customer mix. Margin impact was partially offset by lower green coffee prices. Net loss was $8.8 mln compared to net income of $0.1 mln in the prior year period.Adjusted EBITDA was $3.9 mln compared to $14.0 mln in the prior year period.Appoints new CEOCo announced the appointment of Deverl Maserang as President, Chief Executive Officer, and a member of the company's Board of Directors, effective September 13, 2019.

The cash session began with modest losses after the overnight affair saw a mixed showing from equity markets in Asia. It is worth noting that China reported its inflation figures for August, showing the largest decrease in producer prices in two years while consumer prices grew more than expected due to surging pork prices. Treasuries made a half-hearted attempt at a rebound during the initial hour of trade before embarking on a steady retreat that continued into the afternoon. The selling was partially supported by a report that the European Central Bank may announce a delayed resumption of asset purchases contingent on further weakness in the eurozone. The MNI report cited an anonymous ECB official, and noted that a disagreement among policymakers may prevent the ECB from announcing aggressive easing measures on Thursday. Treasuries hit session lows after the completion of today's $38 bln 3-yr note auction, which was received with lukewarm demand, as the high yield (1.573%) tailed the when-issued yield by 0.3 bps while the bid-to-cover ratio (2.42x) was below average (2.53x). The U.S. Dollar Index ticked up 0.1% to 98.38. Yield Check: 2-yr: +9 bps to 1.66% 3-yr: +8 bps to 1.60% 5-yr: +9 bps to 1.57% 10-yr: +8 bps to 1.70% 30-yr: +8 bps to 2.18%News: South China Morning Post reported that Chinese trade negotiators could offer to buy more agricultural products from the United States if the U.S. eases tariffs on imports from China. China is currently suffering from a severe pork shortage, meaning the country may have no choice but to increase its purchases of pork and feed (soybeans) from the U.S. President Trump issued an executive order, enhancing the Treasury Department's ability to sanction terrorist leaders. Bloomberg reported that China's Jilin Transportation Investment Group did not exercise a call option on a perpetual note and will instead pay a higher coupon, which is likely to invite concerns about the cash position of the local government financing vehicle. North Korea fired two projectiles into the East Sea, shortly after a DPRK official indicated that North Korea is ready for another round of talks with U.S. officials. China's August CPI increased 0.7% m/m (expected 0.5%; last 0.4%), rising 2.8% yr/yr (expected 2.6%; last 2.8%). August PPI decreased 0.8% yr/yr (expected -0.9%; last -0.3%).

The company raised EPS guidance to $2.65-2.72 from $2.33-2.47 and revenue to $696-699 mln from $681-688 mln.Q2 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.70 (+8% yr/yr) on revenue of $697.7 mln (+9% yr/yr).

Capital IQ consensus for FY20 calls for EPS of $9.46 (+10.7% yr/yr) on revenue of $2.67 bln (+6.5% yr/yr). Regarding China tariffs, the company said it has renegotiated product costs and selectively raised prices to mitigate the impact of the increase from 10 to 25%. Co is also moving certain production and new product development out of China, plus exploring new partnerships and expanding its own manufacturing facilities in the US. Long term, RH does not believe the current trade climate will impair its ability to achieve stated financial goals. In late August, the company announced that it expects no impact to FY19 or FY20 financial results from the tariffs imposed on current and new product categories imported from China effective September 1st, 2019, October 1st, 2019 and December 15th, 2019.Looking back, the company beat on EPS four out of the last four quarters and best on revenue three out of the last four quarters. Since its core customer base mainly comprises high-end consumers, its business is correlated to how the stock market is performing. From early December through late March, the market experienced sharp volatility as tariff-related headlines wildly swung the indices. During the Q1 earnings call, RH's CEO commented that the Dow plunged 800 points the day after it provided its FY20 guidance. This type of action plays into the psyche and sentiment of consumers who are considering making big-ticket purchases, such as expensive furniture.RH has a $2.7 bln market cap and trades at 16x earnings vs WSM at 14 times earnings.

The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperforms for the second straight day.Today's action has reflected much of yesterday's value trade that benefits underperforming areas of the stock market, most notably the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.8%) and SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.36, +0.93, +2.2%). An upturn in Boeing (BA 366.34, +7.56, +2.1%) and many of the transportation stocks has had a similar effect on the industrials sector (+0.5%).The gains in these areas, however, are coming at the expense of crowded groups like the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.9%), which is the S&P 500's most heavily-weighted sector. The real estate sector (-1.7%), which investors had piled into for its higher dividend yields and low-beta disposition, is today's worst performer.Allowing today's value trade to play out are the improved views on trade and growth, which have helped some money flow out of the Treasury market and drive yields higher. The 2-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.64%, and the 10-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.35.Separately, the market saw a sharp uptick on a report from the South China Morning Post indicating that China is ready to purchase more agricultural products from the U.S. The caveat, though, is that China would want the U.S. to agree to delay tariffs and ease its supply ban on Huawei. Nothing material has transpired, but the report likely triggered some algorithms.Some story stocks today include Wendy's (WEN 19.45, -2.50, -11.4%) and Ford Motor (F 9.28, -0.26, -2.9%).

The shaky start to the week has trimmed the sector's Q3 gain to 2.2%, but the group remains up almost 29.0% for the year, which leaves it well ahead of the remaining ten sectors.Momentum names lagged yesterday, and they are showing relative weakness again today on no news other than the price action itself. To that point, the likes of Synopsys (SNPS 135.61, -5.65, -4.0%), Visa (V 175.35, -6.20, -3.4%), MasterCard (MA 273.42, -9.94, -3.5%), Fiserv (FISV 103.26, -3.42, -3.2%), Global Payments (GPN 165.77, -5.03, -2.9%), and Automatic Data Processing (ADP 162.96, -5.09, -3.0%) show losses between 3.5% and 4.0% after hitting record highs in recent days.Top-weighted sector components have fared a bit better. For instance, Apple (AAPL 213.40, -0.77, -0.4%) is down just 0.4% ahead of an upcoming product reveal while Alphabet (GOOGL 1202.35, -2.93, -0.2%) shows a slimmer loss. Microsoft (MSFT 135.35, -2.15, -1.6%), however, is down more than 1.5%.The technology sector traded beneath its 50-day moving average at today's low point, but it is currently back above that level, which has acted as an area of congestion over the past month.12:02TALKX Market Briefing: Hold the trade deal enthusiasmThe stock market has gotten a nice pop following a South China Morning Post report indicating China is open to agreeing to buy more agricultural products from the U.S. in a lead up to the October trade meeting in Washington. Tucked inside the same article is a qualifier, however, that China would like to do this in exchange for the U.S. dialing back its restrictions on Huawei and delaying the tariff increases it has planned.In other words, it's a familiar page from the trade playbook, only this play hasn't really gained any yardage in the past.The market (or maybe the algorithms) reacted to the headline with a knee-jerk buying effort, but there isn't much of a basis to run with this news as a major breakthrough since it isn't one. That doesn't mean this market can't, or won't, make more out of the headline than it's worth since it has rallied of late on a sense of relief that neither China nor the U.S. seems intent at this juncture on escalating the trade war even further.Still, this shouldn't be construed as a material development.The Russell 2000 is up 0.8%; the Dow Jones industrial Average is flat; the S&P 500 is down 0.5%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.5%.11:51SCANX Stocks that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (49) outpacing new lows (15) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ABG, ACM, ACRE, AMBA, AN, APO, ARCC, ARNC, AY, AYR, BF.B, BRC, BRX, BX, CASH, CCRN, CE, CHH, CIO, CPRX, CY, DCOM, DRRX, GL, GNRC, HTH, HTLD, ITI, ITRI, KIM, KSU, LM, NVMI, NYCB, OKE, PFNX, PSXP, PTGX, SAH, SAIA, SFL, SITC, SSW, STNG, STWD, SUM, SYY, TROW, WUStocks that traded to 52 week lows: BERY, BMRN, ENTA, FVRR, ILMN, LGND, LVGO, LYFT, MMSI, PD, REGN, RUBY, TRXC, VAPO, WMGIThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AGM, ALG, CMBM, IMKTA, NNI, SAR, TIPTThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: ESTA, HSKA, KRTX11:30XERS Xeris Pharmaceuticals receives FDA approval for GVOKE injection for severe hypoglycemia (shares halted) (11.04 +0.10)Xeris Pharmaceuticals has received regulatory approval from the FDA for GVOKE (glucagon) injection, its ready-to-use, room-temperature stable liquid glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in pediatric and adult patients with diabetes ages 2 years and above. GVOKE is the first glucagon product approved that can be administered via a prefilled syringe (GVOKE PFS) or auto-injector (GVOKE HypoPen), reducing the steps to prepare and administer glucagon in the event of severe hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar levels. The FDA's approval is based on positive results from three Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy, safety, and utility of GVOKE in treating severe hypoglycemia when compared with conventional glucagon emergency kits among adults and children with type 1 diabetes.The company is preparing to introduce GVOKE in two different administration options to accommodate the community's preferences, starting with its pre-filled syringe in 4-6 weeks and the auto-injector in 2020.Xeris also has entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and Silicon Valley Bank. The agreement increases the borrowing base from $45 mln to up to $85 mln and extends the maturity date of the debt to as late as June 2024, if the second tranche is drawn.11:30BONDX New SupplyTreasury Auction Preview$38 bln 3-year Treasury note auction (results at 13:00 ET) Prior auction results: High yield: 1.562% Bid-to-cover: 2.41 Indirect bid: 46.7% Direct bid: 19.3% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.407% Bid-to-cover: 2.53 Indirect bid: 46.9% Direct bid: 14.2%11:17SPY Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary of State Pompeo and National Security Advisor Bolton will hold a media briefing at 13:30; topic unknown11:15SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Merit Medical (MMSI) sinks following downgrade -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersENDP (3.72 +21.01%): Continued volatility; the stock recovers yesterday's losses and proceeds to its new highest levels in almost two months.

Revenue is expected to decrease 18.7% yr/yr to $1.34 bln. The company reiterated its FY20 guidance on June 4, priming the market for revenue between $7.46 bln and $7.87 bln. The last three months saw just a handful of noteworthy game releases, which likely presented a headwind to overall store traffic in Q2. There are more big titles scheduled to be released in the fall and in early 2020, which should be a positive for the company's outlook.Shares of GME hit a fresh record low in mid-August amid dimming prospects for a meaningful turnaround. The stock recovered from that low over the past couple weeks, aided by comments from investor Michael Burry, who revealed that his fund owns 3% of outstanding shares of GME. Mr. Burry's view is based on the expectation that the next generation of consoles will not do away with physical Blu-ray drives. While the decision to keep physical drives would be a positive for GME, the company would still need to compete with large retailers like Best Buy (BBY 68.95, -0.27, -0.4%), Target (TGT 107.56, -0.39, -0.4%), and Walmart (WMT 116.02, -0.31, -0.3%) at a time when GME has been closing many of its locations.10:18AAPL Apple September product event previewApple is set to unveil new products today at 13:00 ET. Most of these products will have very incremental upgrades. Most of the attention for shareholders will be placed to the pricing of the company's Apple TV Plus and Apple Arcade services. Apple stock is up 35% year-to-date vs. a 22.5% gain in the Nasdaq 100. The stock remains near the high end of its recent range and less than 10% from its all-time high.iPhones: The company is expected to release three new iPhones. The first iPhone will likely be called the iPhone 11 and will feature a 6.1-inch LCD screen similar to the iPhone XR that is currently on sale. The other two phones will be called the iPhone 11 Pro and will feature organic light-emitting diode displays similar to the iPhone Xs and Xs Max. The iPhone 11 Pro will come in two sizes: 5.8 and 6.5 inches. The phones are expected to feature faster processors and better cameras. However, these phones will likely only have incremental improvements as Apple is expected to unveil its 5G iPhone in 2020. Analysts are expecting pricing similar to prior models between $749-1099.Services: Apple could confirm the pricing for its gaming and TV services and introduce additional content expected for those services. It has been reported by several sources that the gaming service will cost $4.99/month and the TV service will cost $9.99/month. Apple will have to compete with other streaming offerings from Disney (DIS) which will be priced lower.Apple Watch 5: The updated smartwatch is expected to feature a ceramic design, faster processors, and more health features such as sleep tracking.Mac: Apple is expected to introduce a 16-inch Mac Book Pro.iPads: There is some speculation that Apple will update its iPad Pro lineup with faster processors and larger screens. However, some analysts feel the iPad will get its own event in October.Other Products: Apple could introduce Apple "tracking tags" that will allow users to find lost items. Expectations are for another underwhelming iPhone cycle ahead of next year's 5G offering. Analysts note that there is a lot of pent up demand with many older iPhones in the installed base. Therefore, there is an expectation for a super cycle for the 5G handset next year. Still, the investment thesis has shifted from iPhone cycles to a more diversified set of hardware and services. Last quarter, iPhone sales fell to less than 50% of revenue for the first time as the success of services, iPads, AirPods, and the Apple Watch picked up the slack for falling iPhone sales. Apple's earnings are expected to grow 10% next year after falling 2% in fiscal 2019, which concludes this month. With a $943 bln market cap, the stock trades at ~17x earnings, or ~15x, backing out the cash.Suppliers to keep on note include: SSNLF, LPL (for displays) and LITE, FNSR and IIVI (for FaceID.) Other suppliers include: SWKS, CRUS, AVGO, QRVO, TSM, and QCOM, among others.

Patients 02002 and 02006 were treated with higher dose levels of RP-L102. Patients 02004 and 02005 received non-optimized and lower doses of RP-L102. Key highlights of the manuscript include:Follow-up data for the initial four patients 18-30 months post-infusion demonstrate progressively increased engraftment in peripheral blood leukocytes and in the bone marrow following administration of RP-L102 without the use of conditioning. In Patient 02002 at 30 months follow-up, approximately 44% of bone marrow CD34+ cells displayed gene marking, suggesting the engraftment of very primitive corrected hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Sequential increases in gene marking in peripheral blood and in the bone marrow for Patients 02004 and 02005 were also seen, but at more modest levels and after longer durations. The bone marrow resistance to MMC in Patient 02002 increased to 70% at 24 months, approaching the phenotype of a healthy donor.

NfL is a protein that provides structural support to nerve fibres in the brain. An increase in the amount of NfL may be associated with nerve cell damage, and detection of increased NfL levels in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may serve as a biomarker of nerve cell damage.In the Phase III OPERA I study in RMS and the ORATORIO study in PPMS, blood NfL levels were significantly lower after treatment with OCREVUS. In RMS, blood serum NfL levels were reduced by 43 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with a 31 percent reduction with interferon beta-1a (p<0.001). In PPMS, blood plasma NfL levels were reduced by 16 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with 0.2 percent reduction with placebo (p<0.001). Additionally, these analyses showed higher blood NfL levels at the start of the study were correlated with more disability progression in upper and lower limbs in PPMS and overall disability in the interferon beta-1a RMS treatment group at 96 weeks.06:03FTS Fortis announces five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 bln for the period 2020 to 2024, increases quarterly dividend to $0.4775/share from $0.45/share (42.08 )The co announced its five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 billion for the period 2020 to 2024, up $1.0 billion from the prior year's plan.

OS rates at five years were 13.4% for Opdivo and 2.6% for docetaxel. The OS benefit for Opdivo-treated patients was observed across all subgroups.The safety profile for patients treated with Opdivo was consistent with previously reported findings in second-line NSCLC and no new safety signals were seen with extended follow-up. Of patients still on study, only 2 of 70 experienced a new treatment-related select AE between years three and four and there were no new treatment-related select AE's reported between years four and five among the 55 patients still on study.Among patients with an objective response to Opdivo, 32.2% continued to see a response at five years. 0% of patients with an objective response to docetaxel continued to see a response at five years. The median duration of response was 19.9 months for Opdivo-treated patients and 5.6 months for patients treated with docetaxel.06:00ALNY Alnylam Pharma presents new clinical results for Givosiran -- Porphyria attack reductions observed in ENVISION Phase 3 study maintained with ongoing Givosiran dosing in open-label extension study (82.69 )ENVISION Phase 3 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of January 31, 2019, all eligible patients (N=93) from the ENVISION Phase 3 study of givosiran rolled over into the OLE phase of the study. Reduction in the composite porphyria attack rate with givosiran treatment, which had been observed in the ENVISION Phase 3 study as early as one month after dosing, was shown to be sustained with continued dosing in the OLE phase of the study. Sustained reduction in levels of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), an intermediate in the heme biosynthesis pathway believed to be the primary neurotoxic intermediate responsible for causing both porphyria attacks and ongoing symptoms in between attacks, was also observed with continued dosing. Rapid and sustained lowering of attack rate and ALA levels was also observed in placebo patients who crossed over after the six-month double blind phase of the ENVISION Phase 3 study to receive givosiran in the OLE phase of the study. Givosiran's safety profile in the OLE phase has remained consistent with the profile observed in the double blind phase of the ENVISION study.ENVISION Results of Select Patient Reported Outcomes -- A number of patient reported outcomes were collected as secondary and exploratory measures in the ENVISION study. Daily worst pain did not achieve statistical significance based on the prespecified ANCOVA analysis (p equals 0.0530), however, the data were found to not be normally distributed. A post-hoc analysis of daily worst pain was therefore performed using the non-parametric stratified Wilcoxon test. Based on the non-parametric test, patients on givosiran had a significant reduction in daily worst pain (nominal p equals 0.0455). In exploratory analyses, the reductions in pain were accompanied by fewer days of use of both opioid and non-opioid analgesics. Givosiran did not impact daily worst fatigue or daily worst nausea at six months, although these assessments will be repeated at twelve months to explore the effects of longer term dosing. Updated Phase 1/2 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of April 19, 2019, a robust treatment effect was maintained in givosiran-treated patients with continued dosing in the Phase 1/2 OLE study (N=16), with a mean time on treatment of 22.8 months and total time on treatment across the Phase 1 and OLE studies of up to 35 months. Substantial mean reductions in annualized attack rate (AAR) and in annualized hemin use of greater than 90 percent were observed, with evidence for sustained or potentially enhanced clinical activity with continued dosing. Five out of twelve patients (42 percent) who received givosiran during the Phase 1 study and continued with givosiran dosing in the OLE study and two out of four patients (50 percent) who had been in the placebo arm of the Phase 1 study and crossed over to givosiran treatment in the OLE study achieved an AAR of zero for a mean of 18.1 and 24.9 months, respectively.06:00ACN Accenture acquires Pragsis Bidoop; terms not disclosed (194.83 )Pragsis Bidoop, headquartered in Madrid with additional offices in Barcelona and the U.K., will add more than 200 employees with deep machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data engineering experience, along with its portfolio of end-to-end solutions, to Accenture's Applied Intelligence business.06:00ASX ASE Technology reports August net revenues +10.3% yr/yr to $1.28 bln (4.51 )06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets ease back; S&P Futures take out yesterday's lowThe global equity markets are under slight pressure to start the day.

The S&P 500 (-0.01%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) finished near their flat lines.The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%), which is home to many energy and financial stocks, outperformed the broader market.The market entered today on the heels of a two-week rally, with some investors beginning to feel less concerned about growth prospects and trade relations with China. For instance, data has shown the U.S. consumer to be resilient in the face of trade tensions, which could see a reprieve with trade talks coming up next month.This positive sentiment was manifested in the higher oil prices ($57.87/bbl, +$1.42, +2.5%) and the selling in the Treasury market on Monday. In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD16:20IMXI International Money Express announces secondary public offering of 5,217,392 shares of common stock by selling stockholders (13.60 -0.55)Shares will be offered by affiliates of Stella Point Capital and certain of the company's other stockholders.

American Realty Capital Properties, Inc., at a cost to the company of approximately $765.5 mln, comprised of a contribution of $738.5 mln toward the Class Action settlement and $27.0 mln toward the Opt Out Action settlements.On September 8, 2019, the company signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) providing for the settlement of the Class Action.

Additionally, the company has decided to discontinue the development of MRT5201, a liver-targeted treatment for OTC deficiency.The company's decision to discontinue the development of MRT5201 for OTC deficiency is based on data from recently completed preclinical studies that do not support the desired pharmacokinetic and safety profile for advancement of the program. These data are related to the first-generation lipid nanoparticle (LNP) designed to be delivered to the liver via intravenous administration for the OTC deficiency program. As such, this LNP is different than that used in the CF and other pulmonary development programs which are designed to deliver the LNP-encapsulated mRNA through nebulization. Additionally, ongoing discovery efforts have generated promising, novel next-generation LNPs supporting the further development of liver disease mRNA therapeutics with potentially favorable product profiles.The company's prioritization of pulmonary diseases is supported by the previously reported positive single-ascending dose Phase 1/2 data from the CF program, which utilizes its proprietary lung delivery platform. MRT5005 is a first-in-class mRNA therapeutic designed to address the underlying cause of CF regardless of genetic mutation by delivering mRNA encoding fully functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein to cells in the lung through nebulization. The multiple-ascending dose portion of the clinical trial is ongoing with data expected in 2020.16:08CASY Casey's General beats by $0.28, beats on revs; reaffirms guidance (167.30 -2.03)Reports Q1 (Jul) earnings of $2.31 per share, $0.28 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.03; revenues rose 1.5% year/year to $2.63 bln vs the $2.59 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Tuesday's action saw investors continuing to rotate out of this year's best-performing stocks for those perceived as having more potential value.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.3%) was lifted by its highest-priced component, Boeing (BA 369.49, +10.71, +3.0%), while the Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperformed amid big gains in energy stocks. The Nasdaq Composite (-0.04%) finished just below its flat line amid relative weakness in shares of technology companies.Value-oriented stocks, in this case those that have underperformed amid growth concerns, have come to life this week. Improved sentiment pertaining to growth and trade has contributed to this value trade, which was made most pronounced in the outperformance in the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.3%), SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.61, +1.18, +2.8%), and Dow Jones Transportation Average (+1.5%) on Tuesday.The gains in the transportation space further padded the S&P 500 industrials sector (+1.0%), while Dow Inc. (DOW 46.32, +1.87, +4.2%) boosted the materials sector (+1.0%).The same underlying sentiment boosting these stocks contributed to the selling in the Treasury market and in the S&P 500 information technology (-0.5%), consumer staples (-0.6%), and real estate (-1.4%) sectors. The tech and real estate sectors have been this year's best-performing sectors, largely due to their respective high-growth and defensive-oriented dispositions.Treasury yields finished noticeably higher, as the crowded Treasury market continued to see less demand. The 2-yr yield increased nine basis points to 1.66%, and the 10-yr yield increased eight basis points to 1.70%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.38.In corporate news, Apple (AAPL 216.70, +2.53, +1.2%) held its annual product event where it unveiled its latest iPhone. The $4.99/month pricing for its TV+ streaming service came as a surprise to some and contributed to weakness in Netflix (NFLX 287.99, -6.35, -2.2%).Wendy's (WEN 19.71, -2.24, -10.2%) was a part of the broader effort to sell momentum stocks, but shares were further pressured by the company cutting its EPS guidance. The lower guidance accounted for its plan to launch a breakfast menu in all locations in 2020.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August declined to 103.1 from 104.7 in July.

The company is in the process of activating clinical sites for its Phase 1/2 clinical trial in PD-GBA and is on track to initiate patient dosing this year. This ascending dose Phase 1/2 clinical trial will enroll up to sixteen PD-GBA patients. Two escalating dose cohorts are planned. The trial will investigate the safety and tolerability of PR001 and will also measure key biomarkers and exploratory efficacy endpoints.Prevail is also developing PR001 for pediatric nGD, a second indication with urgent unmet need. The company submitted an IND to the FDA for PR001 for the treatment of pediatric patients with nGD. Following discussions with the FDA, and based on preclinical studies that demonstrated increased efficacy at a higher dose, Prevail is modifying the design of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial in nGD to commence at a dose higher than originally proposed. Prevail's IND for PR001 for the treatment of pediatric nGD has been placed on clinical hold pending FDA review of an amendment to the nGD IND, which will detail this modification. No safety or adverse events have been observed in any of Prevail's studies of PR001. The start of the Phase 1/2 trial in nGD is anticipated to be delayed approximately one quarter and to begin enrollment in the first half of 2020. The modification to the nGD Phase 1/2 trial design is not anticipated to delay the overall timeline to trial completion.16:16GHM Graham wins three new international projects in crude oil refining market totaling $19 mln (18.50 +0.27)Co announces it was awarded orders for three projects totally $19 mln.

The higher cost of goods sold is attributed to higher mark downs on slow moving inventory, higher manufacturing costs driven by downtime associated with certain aging production infrastructure, higher coffee brewing equipment and labor costs, and unfavorable shift in customer mix. Margin impact was partially offset by lower green coffee prices. Net loss was $8.8 mln compared to net income of $0.1 mln in the prior year period.Adjusted EBITDA was $3.9 mln compared to $14.0 mln in the prior year period.Appoints new CEOCo announced the appointment of Deverl Maserang as President, Chief Executive Officer, and a member of the company's Board of Directors, effective September 13, 2019.

The cash session began with modest losses after the overnight affair saw a mixed showing from equity markets in Asia. It is worth noting that China reported its inflation figures for August, showing the largest decrease in producer prices in two years while consumer prices grew more than expected due to surging pork prices. Treasuries made a half-hearted attempt at a rebound during the initial hour of trade before embarking on a steady retreat that continued into the afternoon. The selling was partially supported by a report that the European Central Bank may announce a delayed resumption of asset purchases contingent on further weakness in the eurozone. The MNI report cited an anonymous ECB official, and noted that a disagreement among policymakers may prevent the ECB from announcing aggressive easing measures on Thursday. Treasuries hit session lows after the completion of today's $38 bln 3-yr note auction, which was received with lukewarm demand, as the high yield (1.573%) tailed the when-issued yield by 0.3 bps while the bid-to-cover ratio (2.42x) was below average (2.53x). The U.S. Dollar Index ticked up 0.1% to 98.38. Yield Check: 2-yr: +9 bps to 1.66% 3-yr: +8 bps to 1.60% 5-yr: +9 bps to 1.57% 10-yr: +8 bps to 1.70% 30-yr: +8 bps to 2.18%News: South China Morning Post reported that Chinese trade negotiators could offer to buy more agricultural products from the United States if the U.S. eases tariffs on imports from China. China is currently suffering from a severe pork shortage, meaning the country may have no choice but to increase its purchases of pork and feed (soybeans) from the U.S. President Trump issued an executive order, enhancing the Treasury Department's ability to sanction terrorist leaders. Bloomberg reported that China's Jilin Transportation Investment Group did not exercise a call option on a perpetual note and will instead pay a higher coupon, which is likely to invite concerns about the cash position of the local government financing vehicle. North Korea fired two projectiles into the East Sea, shortly after a DPRK official indicated that North Korea is ready for another round of talks with U.S. officials. China's August CPI increased 0.7% m/m (expected 0.5%; last 0.4%), rising 2.8% yr/yr (expected 2.6%; last 2.8%). August PPI decreased 0.8% yr/yr (expected -0.9%; last -0.3%).

The company raised EPS guidance to $2.65-2.72 from $2.33-2.47 and revenue to $696-699 mln from $681-688 mln.Q2 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.70 (+8% yr/yr) on revenue of $697.7 mln (+9% yr/yr).

Capital IQ consensus for FY20 calls for EPS of $9.46 (+10.7% yr/yr) on revenue of $2.67 bln (+6.5% yr/yr). Regarding China tariffs, the company said it has renegotiated product costs and selectively raised prices to mitigate the impact of the increase from 10 to 25%. Co is also moving certain production and new product development out of China, plus exploring new partnerships and expanding its own manufacturing facilities in the US. Long term, RH does not believe the current trade climate will impair its ability to achieve stated financial goals. In late August, the company announced that it expects no impact to FY19 or FY20 financial results from the tariffs imposed on current and new product categories imported from China effective September 1st, 2019, October 1st, 2019 and December 15th, 2019.Looking back, the company beat on EPS four out of the last four quarters and best on revenue three out of the last four quarters. Since its core customer base mainly comprises high-end consumers, its business is correlated to how the stock market is performing. From early December through late March, the market experienced sharp volatility as tariff-related headlines wildly swung the indices. During the Q1 earnings call, RH's CEO commented that the Dow plunged 800 points the day after it provided its FY20 guidance. This type of action plays into the psyche and sentiment of consumers who are considering making big-ticket purchases, such as expensive furniture.RH has a $2.7 bln market cap and trades at 16x earnings vs WSM at 14 times earnings.

The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperforms for the second straight day.Today's action has reflected much of yesterday's value trade that benefits underperforming areas of the stock market, most notably the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.8%) and SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.36, +0.93, +2.2%). An upturn in Boeing (BA 366.34, +7.56, +2.1%) and many of the transportation stocks has had a similar effect on the industrials sector (+0.5%).The gains in these areas, however, are coming at the expense of crowded groups like the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.9%), which is the S&P 500's most heavily-weighted sector. The real estate sector (-1.7%), which investors had piled into for its higher dividend yields and low-beta disposition, is today's worst performer.Allowing today's value trade to play out are the improved views on trade and growth, which have helped some money flow out of the Treasury market and drive yields higher. The 2-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.64%, and the 10-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.35.Separately, the market saw a sharp uptick on a report from the South China Morning Post indicating that China is ready to purchase more agricultural products from the U.S. The caveat, though, is that China would want the U.S. to agree to delay tariffs and ease its supply ban on Huawei. Nothing material has transpired, but the report likely triggered some algorithms.Some story stocks today include Wendy's (WEN 19.45, -2.50, -11.4%) and Ford Motor (F 9.28, -0.26, -2.9%).

The shaky start to the week has trimmed the sector's Q3 gain to 2.2%, but the group remains up almost 29.0% for the year, which leaves it well ahead of the remaining ten sectors.Momentum names lagged yesterday, and they are showing relative weakness again today on no news other than the price action itself. To that point, the likes of Synopsys (SNPS 135.61, -5.65, -4.0%), Visa (V 175.35, -6.20, -3.4%), MasterCard (MA 273.42, -9.94, -3.5%), Fiserv (FISV 103.26, -3.42, -3.2%), Global Payments (GPN 165.77, -5.03, -2.9%), and Automatic Data Processing (ADP 162.96, -5.09, -3.0%) show losses between 3.5% and 4.0% after hitting record highs in recent days.Top-weighted sector components have fared a bit better. For instance, Apple (AAPL 213.40, -0.77, -0.4%) is down just 0.4% ahead of an upcoming product reveal while Alphabet (GOOGL 1202.35, -2.93, -0.2%) shows a slimmer loss. Microsoft (MSFT 135.35, -2.15, -1.6%), however, is down more than 1.5%.The technology sector traded beneath its 50-day moving average at today's low point, but it is currently back above that level, which has acted as an area of congestion over the past month.12:02TALKX Market Briefing: Hold the trade deal enthusiasmThe stock market has gotten a nice pop following a South China Morning Post report indicating China is open to agreeing to buy more agricultural products from the U.S. in a lead up to the October trade meeting in Washington. Tucked inside the same article is a qualifier, however, that China would like to do this in exchange for the U.S. dialing back its restrictions on Huawei and delaying the tariff increases it has planned.In other words, it's a familiar page from the trade playbook, only this play hasn't really gained any yardage in the past.The market (or maybe the algorithms) reacted to the headline with a knee-jerk buying effort, but there isn't much of a basis to run with this news as a major breakthrough since it isn't one. That doesn't mean this market can't, or won't, make more out of the headline than it's worth since it has rallied of late on a sense of relief that neither China nor the U.S. seems intent at this juncture on escalating the trade war even further.Still, this shouldn't be construed as a material development.The Russell 2000 is up 0.8%; the Dow Jones industrial Average is flat; the S&P 500 is down 0.5%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.5%.11:51SCANX Stocks that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (49) outpacing new lows (15) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ABG, ACM, ACRE, AMBA, AN, APO, ARCC, ARNC, AY, AYR, BF.B, BRC, BRX, BX, CASH, CCRN, CE, CHH, CIO, CPRX, CY, DCOM, DRRX, GL, GNRC, HTH, HTLD, ITI, ITRI, KIM, KSU, LM, NVMI, NYCB, OKE, PFNX, PSXP, PTGX, SAH, SAIA, SFL, SITC, SSW, STNG, STWD, SUM, SYY, TROW, WUStocks that traded to 52 week lows: BERY, BMRN, ENTA, FVRR, ILMN, LGND, LVGO, LYFT, MMSI, PD, REGN, RUBY, TRXC, VAPO, WMGIThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AGM, ALG, CMBM, IMKTA, NNI, SAR, TIPTThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: ESTA, HSKA, KRTX11:30XERS Xeris Pharmaceuticals receives FDA approval for GVOKE injection for severe hypoglycemia (shares halted) (11.04 +0.10)Xeris Pharmaceuticals has received regulatory approval from the FDA for GVOKE (glucagon) injection, its ready-to-use, room-temperature stable liquid glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in pediatric and adult patients with diabetes ages 2 years and above. GVOKE is the first glucagon product approved that can be administered via a prefilled syringe (GVOKE PFS) or auto-injector (GVOKE HypoPen), reducing the steps to prepare and administer glucagon in the event of severe hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar levels. The FDA's approval is based on positive results from three Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy, safety, and utility of GVOKE in treating severe hypoglycemia when compared with conventional glucagon emergency kits among adults and children with type 1 diabetes.The company is preparing to introduce GVOKE in two different administration options to accommodate the community's preferences, starting with its pre-filled syringe in 4-6 weeks and the auto-injector in 2020.Xeris also has entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and Silicon Valley Bank. The agreement increases the borrowing base from $45 mln to up to $85 mln and extends the maturity date of the debt to as late as June 2024, if the second tranche is drawn.11:30BONDX New SupplyTreasury Auction Preview$38 bln 3-year Treasury note auction (results at 13:00 ET) Prior auction results: High yield: 1.562% Bid-to-cover: 2.41 Indirect bid: 46.7% Direct bid: 19.3% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.407% Bid-to-cover: 2.53 Indirect bid: 46.9% Direct bid: 14.2%11:17SPY Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary of State Pompeo and National Security Advisor Bolton will hold a media briefing at 13:30; topic unknown11:15SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Merit Medical (MMSI) sinks following downgrade -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersENDP (3.72 +21.01%): Continued volatility; the stock recovers yesterday's losses and proceeds to its new highest levels in almost two months.

Revenue is expected to decrease 18.7% yr/yr to $1.34 bln. The company reiterated its FY20 guidance on June 4, priming the market for revenue between $7.46 bln and $7.87 bln. The last three months saw just a handful of noteworthy game releases, which likely presented a headwind to overall store traffic in Q2. There are more big titles scheduled to be released in the fall and in early 2020, which should be a positive for the company's outlook.Shares of GME hit a fresh record low in mid-August amid dimming prospects for a meaningful turnaround. The stock recovered from that low over the past couple weeks, aided by comments from investor Michael Burry, who revealed that his fund owns 3% of outstanding shares of GME. Mr. Burry's view is based on the expectation that the next generation of consoles will not do away with physical Blu-ray drives. While the decision to keep physical drives would be a positive for GME, the company would still need to compete with large retailers like Best Buy (BBY 68.95, -0.27, -0.4%), Target (TGT 107.56, -0.39, -0.4%), and Walmart (WMT 116.02, -0.31, -0.3%) at a time when GME has been closing many of its locations.10:18AAPL Apple September product event previewApple is set to unveil new products today at 13:00 ET. Most of these products will have very incremental upgrades. Most of the attention for shareholders will be placed to the pricing of the company's Apple TV Plus and Apple Arcade services. Apple stock is up 35% year-to-date vs. a 22.5% gain in the Nasdaq 100. The stock remains near the high end of its recent range and less than 10% from its all-time high.iPhones: The company is expected to release three new iPhones. The first iPhone will likely be called the iPhone 11 and will feature a 6.1-inch LCD screen similar to the iPhone XR that is currently on sale. The other two phones will be called the iPhone 11 Pro and will feature organic light-emitting diode displays similar to the iPhone Xs and Xs Max. The iPhone 11 Pro will come in two sizes: 5.8 and 6.5 inches. The phones are expected to feature faster processors and better cameras. However, these phones will likely only have incremental improvements as Apple is expected to unveil its 5G iPhone in 2020. Analysts are expecting pricing similar to prior models between $749-1099.Services: Apple could confirm the pricing for its gaming and TV services and introduce additional content expected for those services. It has been reported by several sources that the gaming service will cost $4.99/month and the TV service will cost $9.99/month. Apple will have to compete with other streaming offerings from Disney (DIS) which will be priced lower.Apple Watch 5: The updated smartwatch is expected to feature a ceramic design, faster processors, and more health features such as sleep tracking.Mac: Apple is expected to introduce a 16-inch Mac Book Pro.iPads: There is some speculation that Apple will update its iPad Pro lineup with faster processors and larger screens. However, some analysts feel the iPad will get its own event in October.Other Products: Apple could introduce Apple "tracking tags" that will allow users to find lost items. Expectations are for another underwhelming iPhone cycle ahead of next year's 5G offering. Analysts note that there is a lot of pent up demand with many older iPhones in the installed base. Therefore, there is an expectation for a super cycle for the 5G handset next year. Still, the investment thesis has shifted from iPhone cycles to a more diversified set of hardware and services. Last quarter, iPhone sales fell to less than 50% of revenue for the first time as the success of services, iPads, AirPods, and the Apple Watch picked up the slack for falling iPhone sales. Apple's earnings are expected to grow 10% next year after falling 2% in fiscal 2019, which concludes this month. With a $943 bln market cap, the stock trades at ~17x earnings, or ~15x, backing out the cash.Suppliers to keep on note include: SSNLF, LPL (for displays) and LITE, FNSR and IIVI (for FaceID.) Other suppliers include: SWKS, CRUS, AVGO, QRVO, TSM, and QCOM, among others.

Patients 02002 and 02006 were treated with higher dose levels of RP-L102. Patients 02004 and 02005 received non-optimized and lower doses of RP-L102. Key highlights of the manuscript include:Follow-up data for the initial four patients 18-30 months post-infusion demonstrate progressively increased engraftment in peripheral blood leukocytes and in the bone marrow following administration of RP-L102 without the use of conditioning. In Patient 02002 at 30 months follow-up, approximately 44% of bone marrow CD34+ cells displayed gene marking, suggesting the engraftment of very primitive corrected hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Sequential increases in gene marking in peripheral blood and in the bone marrow for Patients 02004 and 02005 were also seen, but at more modest levels and after longer durations. The bone marrow resistance to MMC in Patient 02002 increased to 70% at 24 months, approaching the phenotype of a healthy donor.

NfL is a protein that provides structural support to nerve fibres in the brain. An increase in the amount of NfL may be associated with nerve cell damage, and detection of increased NfL levels in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may serve as a biomarker of nerve cell damage.In the Phase III OPERA I study in RMS and the ORATORIO study in PPMS, blood NfL levels were significantly lower after treatment with OCREVUS. In RMS, blood serum NfL levels were reduced by 43 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with a 31 percent reduction with interferon beta-1a (p<0.001). In PPMS, blood plasma NfL levels were reduced by 16 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with 0.2 percent reduction with placebo (p<0.001). Additionally, these analyses showed higher blood NfL levels at the start of the study were correlated with more disability progression in upper and lower limbs in PPMS and overall disability in the interferon beta-1a RMS treatment group at 96 weeks.06:03FTS Fortis announces five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 bln for the period 2020 to 2024, increases quarterly dividend to $0.4775/share from $0.45/share (42.08 )The co announced its five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 billion for the period 2020 to 2024, up $1.0 billion from the prior year's plan.

OS rates at five years were 13.4% for Opdivo and 2.6% for docetaxel. The OS benefit for Opdivo-treated patients was observed across all subgroups.The safety profile for patients treated with Opdivo was consistent with previously reported findings in second-line NSCLC and no new safety signals were seen with extended follow-up. Of patients still on study, only 2 of 70 experienced a new treatment-related select AE between years three and four and there were no new treatment-related select AE's reported between years four and five among the 55 patients still on study.Among patients with an objective response to Opdivo, 32.2% continued to see a response at five years. 0% of patients with an objective response to docetaxel continued to see a response at five years. The median duration of response was 19.9 months for Opdivo-treated patients and 5.6 months for patients treated with docetaxel.06:00ALNY Alnylam Pharma presents new clinical results for Givosiran -- Porphyria attack reductions observed in ENVISION Phase 3 study maintained with ongoing Givosiran dosing in open-label extension study (82.69 )ENVISION Phase 3 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of January 31, 2019, all eligible patients (N=93) from the ENVISION Phase 3 study of givosiran rolled over into the OLE phase of the study. Reduction in the composite porphyria attack rate with givosiran treatment, which had been observed in the ENVISION Phase 3 study as early as one month after dosing, was shown to be sustained with continued dosing in the OLE phase of the study. Sustained reduction in levels of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), an intermediate in the heme biosynthesis pathway believed to be the primary neurotoxic intermediate responsible for causing both porphyria attacks and ongoing symptoms in between attacks, was also observed with continued dosing. Rapid and sustained lowering of attack rate and ALA levels was also observed in placebo patients who crossed over after the six-month double blind phase of the ENVISION Phase 3 study to receive givosiran in the OLE phase of the study. Givosiran's safety profile in the OLE phase has remained consistent with the profile observed in the double blind phase of the ENVISION study.ENVISION Results of Select Patient Reported Outcomes -- A number of patient reported outcomes were collected as secondary and exploratory measures in the ENVISION study. Daily worst pain did not achieve statistical significance based on the prespecified ANCOVA analysis (p equals 0.0530), however, the data were found to not be normally distributed. A post-hoc analysis of daily worst pain was therefore performed using the non-parametric stratified Wilcoxon test. Based on the non-parametric test, patients on givosiran had a significant reduction in daily worst pain (nominal p equals 0.0455). In exploratory analyses, the reductions in pain were accompanied by fewer days of use of both opioid and non-opioid analgesics. Givosiran did not impact daily worst fatigue or daily worst nausea at six months, although these assessments will be repeated at twelve months to explore the effects of longer term dosing. Updated Phase 1/2 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of April 19, 2019, a robust treatment effect was maintained in givosiran-treated patients with continued dosing in the Phase 1/2 OLE study (N=16), with a mean time on treatment of 22.8 months and total time on treatment across the Phase 1 and OLE studies of up to 35 months. Substantial mean reductions in annualized attack rate (AAR) and in annualized hemin use of greater than 90 percent were observed, with evidence for sustained or potentially enhanced clinical activity with continued dosing. Five out of twelve patients (42 percent) who received givosiran during the Phase 1 study and continued with givosiran dosing in the OLE study and two out of four patients (50 percent) who had been in the placebo arm of the Phase 1 study and crossed over to givosiran treatment in the OLE study achieved an AAR of zero for a mean of 18.1 and 24.9 months, respectively.06:00ACN Accenture acquires Pragsis Bidoop; terms not disclosed (194.83 )Pragsis Bidoop, headquartered in Madrid with additional offices in Barcelona and the U.K., will add more than 200 employees with deep machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data engineering experience, along with its portfolio of end-to-end solutions, to Accenture's Applied Intelligence business.06:00ASX ASE Technology reports August net revenues +10.3% yr/yr to $1.28 bln (4.51 )06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets ease back; S&P Futures take out yesterday's lowThe global equity markets are under slight pressure to start the day.

The S&P 500 (-0.01%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) finished near their flat lines.The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%), which is home to many energy and financial stocks, outperformed the broader market.The market entered today on the heels of a two-week rally, with some investors beginning to feel less concerned about growth prospects and trade relations with China. For instance, data has shown the U.S. consumer to be resilient in the face of trade tensions, which could see a reprieve with trade talks coming up next month.This positive sentiment was manifested in the higher oil prices ($57.87/bbl, +$1.42, +2.5%) and the selling in the Treasury market on Monday. In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD16:20IMXI International Money Express announces secondary public offering of 5,217,392 shares of common stock by selling stockholders (13.60 -0.55)Shares will be offered by affiliates of Stella Point Capital and certain of the company's other stockholders.

American Realty Capital Properties, Inc., at a cost to the company of approximately $765.5 mln, comprised of a contribution of $738.5 mln toward the Class Action settlement and $27.0 mln toward the Opt Out Action settlements.On September 8, 2019, the company signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) providing for the settlement of the Class Action.

Additionally, the company has decided to discontinue the development of MRT5201, a liver-targeted treatment for OTC deficiency.The company's decision to discontinue the development of MRT5201 for OTC deficiency is based on data from recently completed preclinical studies that do not support the desired pharmacokinetic and safety profile for advancement of the program. These data are related to the first-generation lipid nanoparticle (LNP) designed to be delivered to the liver via intravenous administration for the OTC deficiency program. As such, this LNP is different than that used in the CF and other pulmonary development programs which are designed to deliver the LNP-encapsulated mRNA through nebulization. Additionally, ongoing discovery efforts have generated promising, novel next-generation LNPs supporting the further development of liver disease mRNA therapeutics with potentially favorable product profiles.The company's prioritization of pulmonary diseases is supported by the previously reported positive single-ascending dose Phase 1/2 data from the CF program, which utilizes its proprietary lung delivery platform. MRT5005 is a first-in-class mRNA therapeutic designed to address the underlying cause of CF regardless of genetic mutation by delivering mRNA encoding fully functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein to cells in the lung through nebulization. The multiple-ascending dose portion of the clinical trial is ongoing with data expected in 2020.16:08CASY Casey's General beats by $0.28, beats on revs; reaffirms guidance (167.30 -2.03)Reports Q1 (Jul) earnings of $2.31 per share, $0.28 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.03; revenues rose 1.5% year/year to $2.63 bln vs the $2.59 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Tuesday's action saw investors continuing to rotate out of this year's best-performing stocks for those perceived as having more potential value.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.3%) was lifted by its highest-priced component, Boeing (BA 369.49, +10.71, +3.0%), while the Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperformed amid big gains in energy stocks. The Nasdaq Composite (-0.04%) finished just below its flat line amid relative weakness in shares of technology companies.Value-oriented stocks, in this case those that have underperformed amid growth concerns, have come to life this week. Improved sentiment pertaining to growth and trade has contributed to this value trade, which was made most pronounced in the outperformance in the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.3%), SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.61, +1.18, +2.8%), and Dow Jones Transportation Average (+1.5%) on Tuesday.The gains in the transportation space further padded the S&P 500 industrials sector (+1.0%), while Dow Inc. (DOW 46.32, +1.87, +4.2%) boosted the materials sector (+1.0%).The same underlying sentiment boosting these stocks contributed to the selling in the Treasury market and in the S&P 500 information technology (-0.5%), consumer staples (-0.6%), and real estate (-1.4%) sectors. The tech and real estate sectors have been this year's best-performing sectors, largely due to their respective high-growth and defensive-oriented dispositions.Treasury yields finished noticeably higher, as the crowded Treasury market continued to see less demand. The 2-yr yield increased nine basis points to 1.66%, and the 10-yr yield increased eight basis points to 1.70%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.38.In corporate news, Apple (AAPL 216.70, +2.53, +1.2%) held its annual product event where it unveiled its latest iPhone. The $4.99/month pricing for its TV+ streaming service came as a surprise to some and contributed to weakness in Netflix (NFLX 287.99, -6.35, -2.2%).Wendy's (WEN 19.71, -2.24, -10.2%) was a part of the broader effort to sell momentum stocks, but shares were further pressured by the company cutting its EPS guidance. The lower guidance accounted for its plan to launch a breakfast menu in all locations in 2020.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August declined to 103.1 from 104.7 in July.

The company is in the process of activating clinical sites for its Phase 1/2 clinical trial in PD-GBA and is on track to initiate patient dosing this year. This ascending dose Phase 1/2 clinical trial will enroll up to sixteen PD-GBA patients. Two escalating dose cohorts are planned. The trial will investigate the safety and tolerability of PR001 and will also measure key biomarkers and exploratory efficacy endpoints.Prevail is also developing PR001 for pediatric nGD, a second indication with urgent unmet need. The company submitted an IND to the FDA for PR001 for the treatment of pediatric patients with nGD. Following discussions with the FDA, and based on preclinical studies that demonstrated increased efficacy at a higher dose, Prevail is modifying the design of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial in nGD to commence at a dose higher than originally proposed. Prevail's IND for PR001 for the treatment of pediatric nGD has been placed on clinical hold pending FDA review of an amendment to the nGD IND, which will detail this modification. No safety or adverse events have been observed in any of Prevail's studies of PR001. The start of the Phase 1/2 trial in nGD is anticipated to be delayed approximately one quarter and to begin enrollment in the first half of 2020. The modification to the nGD Phase 1/2 trial design is not anticipated to delay the overall timeline to trial completion.16:16GHM Graham wins three new international projects in crude oil refining market totaling $19 mln (18.50 +0.27)Co announces it was awarded orders for three projects totally $19 mln.

The higher cost of goods sold is attributed to higher mark downs on slow moving inventory, higher manufacturing costs driven by downtime associated with certain aging production infrastructure, higher coffee brewing equipment and labor costs, and unfavorable shift in customer mix. Margin impact was partially offset by lower green coffee prices. Net loss was $8.8 mln compared to net income of $0.1 mln in the prior year period.Adjusted EBITDA was $3.9 mln compared to $14.0 mln in the prior year period.Appoints new CEOCo announced the appointment of Deverl Maserang as President, Chief Executive Officer, and a member of the company's Board of Directors, effective September 13, 2019.

The cash session began with modest losses after the overnight affair saw a mixed showing from equity markets in Asia. It is worth noting that China reported its inflation figures for August, showing the largest decrease in producer prices in two years while consumer prices grew more than expected due to surging pork prices. Treasuries made a half-hearted attempt at a rebound during the initial hour of trade before embarking on a steady retreat that continued into the afternoon. The selling was partially supported by a report that the European Central Bank may announce a delayed resumption of asset purchases contingent on further weakness in the eurozone. The MNI report cited an anonymous ECB official, and noted that a disagreement among policymakers may prevent the ECB from announcing aggressive easing measures on Thursday. Treasuries hit session lows after the completion of today's $38 bln 3-yr note auction, which was received with lukewarm demand, as the high yield (1.573%) tailed the when-issued yield by 0.3 bps while the bid-to-cover ratio (2.42x) was below average (2.53x). The U.S. Dollar Index ticked up 0.1% to 98.38. Yield Check: 2-yr: +9 bps to 1.66% 3-yr: +8 bps to 1.60% 5-yr: +9 bps to 1.57% 10-yr: +8 bps to 1.70% 30-yr: +8 bps to 2.18%News: South China Morning Post reported that Chinese trade negotiators could offer to buy more agricultural products from the United States if the U.S. eases tariffs on imports from China. China is currently suffering from a severe pork shortage, meaning the country may have no choice but to increase its purchases of pork and feed (soybeans) from the U.S. President Trump issued an executive order, enhancing the Treasury Department's ability to sanction terrorist leaders. Bloomberg reported that China's Jilin Transportation Investment Group did not exercise a call option on a perpetual note and will instead pay a higher coupon, which is likely to invite concerns about the cash position of the local government financing vehicle. North Korea fired two projectiles into the East Sea, shortly after a DPRK official indicated that North Korea is ready for another round of talks with U.S. officials. China's August CPI increased 0.7% m/m (expected 0.5%; last 0.4%), rising 2.8% yr/yr (expected 2.6%; last 2.8%). August PPI decreased 0.8% yr/yr (expected -0.9%; last -0.3%).

The company raised EPS guidance to $2.65-2.72 from $2.33-2.47 and revenue to $696-699 mln from $681-688 mln.Q2 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.70 (+8% yr/yr) on revenue of $697.7 mln (+9% yr/yr). The company also raised guidance for fiscal 2020 to $9.08-9.52 from $8.76-9.27 and raised its FY20 guidance revenue guidance to $2.658-2.674 bln form $2.64-2.66 bln. Capital IQ consensus for FY20 calls for EPS of $9.46 (+10.7% yr/yr) on revenue of $2.67 bln (+6.5% yr/yr). Regarding China tariffs, the company said it has renegotiated product costs and selectively raised prices to mitigate the impact of the increase from 10 to 25%. Co is also moving certain production and new product development out of China, plus exploring new partnerships and expanding its own manufacturing facilities in the US. Long term, RH does not believe the current trade climate will impair its ability to achieve stated financial goals. In late August, the company announced that it expects no impact to FY19 or FY20 financial results from the tariffs imposed on current and new product categories imported from China effective September 1st, 2019, October 1st, 2019 and December 15th, 2019.Looking back, the company beat on EPS four out of the last four quarters and best on revenue three out of the last four quarters. Since its core customer base mainly comprises high-end consumers, its business is correlated to how the stock market is performing. From early December through late March, the market experienced sharp volatility as tariff-related headlines wildly swung the indices. During the Q1 earnings call, RH's CEO commented that the Dow plunged 800 points the day after it provided its FY20 guidance. This type of action plays into the psyche and sentiment of consumers who are considering making big-ticket purchases, such as expensive furniture.RH has a $2.7 bln market cap and trades at 16x earnings vs WSM at 14 times earnings.

The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperforms for the second straight day.Today's action has reflected much of yesterday's value trade that benefits underperforming areas of the stock market, most notably the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.8%) and SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.36, +0.93, +2.2%). An upturn in Boeing (BA 366.34, +7.56, +2.1%) and many of the transportation stocks has had a similar effect on the industrials sector (+0.5%).The gains in these areas, however, are coming at the expense of crowded groups like the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.9%), which is the S&P 500's most heavily-weighted sector. The real estate sector (-1.7%), which investors had piled into for its higher dividend yields and low-beta disposition, is today's worst performer.Allowing today's value trade to play out are the improved views on trade and growth, which have helped some money flow out of the Treasury market and drive yields higher. The 2-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.64%, and the 10-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.35.Separately, the market saw a sharp uptick on a report from the South China Morning Post indicating that China is ready to purchase more agricultural products from the U.S. The caveat, though, is that China would want the U.S. to agree to delay tariffs and ease its supply ban on Huawei. Nothing material has transpired, but the report likely triggered some algorithms.Some story stocks today include Wendy's (WEN 19.45, -2.50, -11.4%) and Ford Motor (F 9.28, -0.26, -2.9%).

The shaky start to the week has trimmed the sector's Q3 gain to 2.2%, but the group remains up almost 29.0% for the year, which leaves it well ahead of the remaining ten sectors.Momentum names lagged yesterday, and they are showing relative weakness again today on no news other than the price action itself. To that point, the likes of Synopsys (SNPS 135.61, -5.65, -4.0%), Visa (V 175.35, -6.20, -3.4%), MasterCard (MA 273.42, -9.94, -3.5%), Fiserv (FISV 103.26, -3.42, -3.2%), Global Payments (GPN 165.77, -5.03, -2.9%), and Automatic Data Processing (ADP 162.96, -5.09, -3.0%) show losses between 3.5% and 4.0% after hitting record highs in recent days.Top-weighted sector components have fared a bit better. For instance, Apple (AAPL 213.40, -0.77, -0.4%) is down just 0.4% ahead of an upcoming product reveal while Alphabet (GOOGL 1202.35, -2.93, -0.2%) shows a slimmer loss. Microsoft (MSFT 135.35, -2.15, -1.6%), however, is down more than 1.5%.The technology sector traded beneath its 50-day moving average at today's low point, but it is currently back above that level, which has acted as an area of congestion over the past month.12:02TALKX Market Briefing: Hold the trade deal enthusiasmThe stock market has gotten a nice pop following a South China Morning Post report indicating China is open to agreeing to buy more agricultural products from the U.S. in a lead up to the October trade meeting in Washington. Tucked inside the same article is a qualifier, however, that China would like to do this in exchange for the U.S. dialing back its restrictions on Huawei and delaying the tariff increases it has planned.In other words, it's a familiar page from the trade playbook, only this play hasn't really gained any yardage in the past.The market (or maybe the algorithms) reacted to the headline with a knee-jerk buying effort, but there isn't much of a basis to run with this news as a major breakthrough since it isn't one. That doesn't mean this market can't, or won't, make more out of the headline than it's worth since it has rallied of late on a sense of relief that neither China nor the U.S. seems intent at this juncture on escalating the trade war even further.Still, this shouldn't be construed as a material development.The Russell 2000 is up 0.8%; the Dow Jones industrial Average is flat; the S&P 500 is down 0.5%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.5%.11:51SCANX Stocks that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (49) outpacing new lows (15) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ABG, ACM, ACRE, AMBA, AN, APO, ARCC, ARNC, AY, AYR, BF.B, BRC, BRX, BX, CASH, CCRN, CE, CHH, CIO, CPRX, CY, DCOM, DRRX, GL, GNRC, HTH, HTLD, ITI, ITRI, KIM, KSU, LM, NVMI, NYCB, OKE, PFNX, PSXP, PTGX, SAH, SAIA, SFL, SITC, SSW, STNG, STWD, SUM, SYY, TROW, WUStocks that traded to 52 week lows: BERY, BMRN, ENTA, FVRR, ILMN, LGND, LVGO, LYFT, MMSI, PD, REGN, RUBY, TRXC, VAPO, WMGIThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AGM, ALG, CMBM, IMKTA, NNI, SAR, TIPTThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: ESTA, HSKA, KRTX11:30XERS Xeris Pharmaceuticals receives FDA approval for GVOKE injection for severe hypoglycemia (shares halted) (11.04 +0.10)Xeris Pharmaceuticals has received regulatory approval from the FDA for GVOKE (glucagon) injection, its ready-to-use, room-temperature stable liquid glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in pediatric and adult patients with diabetes ages 2 years and above. GVOKE is the first glucagon product approved that can be administered via a prefilled syringe (GVOKE PFS) or auto-injector (GVOKE HypoPen), reducing the steps to prepare and administer glucagon in the event of severe hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar levels. The FDA's approval is based on positive results from three Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy, safety, and utility of GVOKE in treating severe hypoglycemia when compared with conventional glucagon emergency kits among adults and children with type 1 diabetes.The company is preparing to introduce GVOKE in two different administration options to accommodate the community's preferences, starting with its pre-filled syringe in 4-6 weeks and the auto-injector in 2020.Xeris also has entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and Silicon Valley Bank. The agreement increases the borrowing base from $45 mln to up to $85 mln and extends the maturity date of the debt to as late as June 2024, if the second tranche is drawn.11:30BONDX New SupplyTreasury Auction Preview$38 bln 3-year Treasury note auction (results at 13:00 ET) Prior auction results: High yield: 1.562% Bid-to-cover: 2.41 Indirect bid: 46.7% Direct bid: 19.3% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.407% Bid-to-cover: 2.53 Indirect bid: 46.9% Direct bid: 14.2%11:17SPY Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary of State Pompeo and National Security Advisor Bolton will hold a media briefing at 13:30; topic unknown11:15SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Merit Medical (MMSI) sinks following downgrade -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersENDP (3.72 +21.01%): Continued volatility; the stock recovers yesterday's losses and proceeds to its new highest levels in almost two months.

Revenue is expected to decrease 18.7% yr/yr to $1.34 bln. The company reiterated its FY20 guidance on June 4, priming the market for revenue between $7.46 bln and $7.87 bln. The last three months saw just a handful of noteworthy game releases, which likely presented a headwind to overall store traffic in Q2. There are more big titles scheduled to be released in the fall and in early 2020, which should be a positive for the company's outlook.Shares of GME hit a fresh record low in mid-August amid dimming prospects for a meaningful turnaround. The stock recovered from that low over the past couple weeks, aided by comments from investor Michael Burry, who revealed that his fund owns 3% of outstanding shares of GME. Mr. Burry's view is based on the expectation that the next generation of consoles will not do away with physical Blu-ray drives. While the decision to keep physical drives would be a positive for GME, the company would still need to compete with large retailers like Best Buy (BBY 68.95, -0.27, -0.4%), Target (TGT 107.56, -0.39, -0.4%), and Walmart (WMT 116.02, -0.31, -0.3%) at a time when GME has been closing many of its locations.10:18AAPL Apple September product event previewApple is set to unveil new products today at 13:00 ET. Most of these products will have very incremental upgrades. Most of the attention for shareholders will be placed to the pricing of the company's Apple TV Plus and Apple Arcade services. Apple stock is up 35% year-to-date vs. a 22.5% gain in the Nasdaq 100. The stock remains near the high end of its recent range and less than 10% from its all-time high.iPhones: The company is expected to release three new iPhones. The first iPhone will likely be called the iPhone 11 and will feature a 6.1-inch LCD screen similar to the iPhone XR that is currently on sale. The other two phones will be called the iPhone 11 Pro and will feature organic light-emitting diode displays similar to the iPhone Xs and Xs Max. The iPhone 11 Pro will come in two sizes: 5.8 and 6.5 inches. The phones are expected to feature faster processors and better cameras. However, these phones will likely only have incremental improvements as Apple is expected to unveil its 5G iPhone in 2020. Analysts are expecting pricing similar to prior models between $749-1099.Services: Apple could confirm the pricing for its gaming and TV services and introduce additional content expected for those services. It has been reported by several sources that the gaming service will cost $4.99/month and the TV service will cost $9.99/month. Apple will have to compete with other streaming offerings from Disney (DIS) which will be priced lower.Apple Watch 5: The updated smartwatch is expected to feature a ceramic design, faster processors, and more health features such as sleep tracking.Mac: Apple is expected to introduce a 16-inch Mac Book Pro.iPads: There is some speculation that Apple will update its iPad Pro lineup with faster processors and larger screens. However, some analysts feel the iPad will get its own event in October.Other Products: Apple could introduce Apple "tracking tags" that will allow users to find lost items. Expectations are for another underwhelming iPhone cycle ahead of next year's 5G offering. Analysts note that there is a lot of pent up demand with many older iPhones in the installed base. Therefore, there is an expectation for a super cycle for the 5G handset next year. Still, the investment thesis has shifted from iPhone cycles to a more diversified set of hardware and services. Last quarter, iPhone sales fell to less than 50% of revenue for the first time as the success of services, iPads, AirPods, and the Apple Watch picked up the slack for falling iPhone sales. Apple's earnings are expected to grow 10% next year after falling 2% in fiscal 2019, which concludes this month. With a $943 bln market cap, the stock trades at ~17x earnings, or ~15x, backing out the cash.Suppliers to keep on note include: SSNLF, LPL (for displays) and LITE, FNSR and IIVI (for FaceID.) Other suppliers include: SWKS, CRUS, AVGO, QRVO, TSM, and QCOM, among others.

Patients 02002 and 02006 were treated with higher dose levels of RP-L102. Patients 02004 and 02005 received non-optimized and lower doses of RP-L102. Key highlights of the manuscript include:Follow-up data for the initial four patients 18-30 months post-infusion demonstrate progressively increased engraftment in peripheral blood leukocytes and in the bone marrow following administration of RP-L102 without the use of conditioning. In Patient 02002 at 30 months follow-up, approximately 44% of bone marrow CD34+ cells displayed gene marking, suggesting the engraftment of very primitive corrected hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Sequential increases in gene marking in peripheral blood and in the bone marrow for Patients 02004 and 02005 were also seen, but at more modest levels and after longer durations. The bone marrow resistance to MMC in Patient 02002 increased to 70% at 24 months, approaching the phenotype of a healthy donor.

NfL is a protein that provides structural support to nerve fibres in the brain. An increase in the amount of NfL may be associated with nerve cell damage, and detection of increased NfL levels in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may serve as a biomarker of nerve cell damage.In the Phase III OPERA I study in RMS and the ORATORIO study in PPMS, blood NfL levels were significantly lower after treatment with OCREVUS. In RMS, blood serum NfL levels were reduced by 43 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with a 31 percent reduction with interferon beta-1a (p<0.001). In PPMS, blood plasma NfL levels were reduced by 16 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with 0.2 percent reduction with placebo (p<0.001). Additionally, these analyses showed higher blood NfL levels at the start of the study were correlated with more disability progression in upper and lower limbs in PPMS and overall disability in the interferon beta-1a RMS treatment group at 96 weeks.06:03FTS Fortis announces five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 bln for the period 2020 to 2024, increases quarterly dividend to $0.4775/share from $0.45/share (42.08 )The co announced its five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 billion for the period 2020 to 2024, up $1.0 billion from the prior year's plan.

OS rates at five years were 13.4% for Opdivo and 2.6% for docetaxel. The OS benefit for Opdivo-treated patients was observed across all subgroups.The safety profile for patients treated with Opdivo was consistent with previously reported findings in second-line NSCLC and no new safety signals were seen with extended follow-up. Of patients still on study, only 2 of 70 experienced a new treatment-related select AE between years three and four and there were no new treatment-related select AE's reported between years four and five among the 55 patients still on study.Among patients with an objective response to Opdivo, 32.2% continued to see a response at five years. 0% of patients with an objective response to docetaxel continued to see a response at five years. The median duration of response was 19.9 months for Opdivo-treated patients and 5.6 months for patients treated with docetaxel.06:00ALNY Alnylam Pharma presents new clinical results for Givosiran -- Porphyria attack reductions observed in ENVISION Phase 3 study maintained with ongoing Givosiran dosing in open-label extension study (82.69 )ENVISION Phase 3 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of January 31, 2019, all eligible patients (N=93) from the ENVISION Phase 3 study of givosiran rolled over into the OLE phase of the study. Reduction in the composite porphyria attack rate with givosiran treatment, which had been observed in the ENVISION Phase 3 study as early as one month after dosing, was shown to be sustained with continued dosing in the OLE phase of the study. Sustained reduction in levels of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), an intermediate in the heme biosynthesis pathway believed to be the primary neurotoxic intermediate responsible for causing both porphyria attacks and ongoing symptoms in between attacks, was also observed with continued dosing. Rapid and sustained lowering of attack rate and ALA levels was also observed in placebo patients who crossed over after the six-month double blind phase of the ENVISION Phase 3 study to receive givosiran in the OLE phase of the study. Givosiran's safety profile in the OLE phase has remained consistent with the profile observed in the double blind phase of the ENVISION study.ENVISION Results of Select Patient Reported Outcomes -- A number of patient reported outcomes were collected as secondary and exploratory measures in the ENVISION study. Daily worst pain did not achieve statistical significance based on the prespecified ANCOVA analysis (p equals 0.0530), however, the data were found to not be normally distributed. A post-hoc analysis of daily worst pain was therefore performed using the non-parametric stratified Wilcoxon test. Based on the non-parametric test, patients on givosiran had a significant reduction in daily worst pain (nominal p equals 0.0455). In exploratory analyses, the reductions in pain were accompanied by fewer days of use of both opioid and non-opioid analgesics. Givosiran did not impact daily worst fatigue or daily worst nausea at six months, although these assessments will be repeated at twelve months to explore the effects of longer term dosing. Updated Phase 1/2 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of April 19, 2019, a robust treatment effect was maintained in givosiran-treated patients with continued dosing in the Phase 1/2 OLE study (N=16), with a mean time on treatment of 22.8 months and total time on treatment across the Phase 1 and OLE studies of up to 35 months. Substantial mean reductions in annualized attack rate (AAR) and in annualized hemin use of greater than 90 percent were observed, with evidence for sustained or potentially enhanced clinical activity with continued dosing. Five out of twelve patients (42 percent) who received givosiran during the Phase 1 study and continued with givosiran dosing in the OLE study and two out of four patients (50 percent) who had been in the placebo arm of the Phase 1 study and crossed over to givosiran treatment in the OLE study achieved an AAR of zero for a mean of 18.1 and 24.9 months, respectively.06:00ACN Accenture acquires Pragsis Bidoop; terms not disclosed (194.83 )Pragsis Bidoop, headquartered in Madrid with additional offices in Barcelona and the U.K., will add more than 200 employees with deep machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data engineering experience, along with its portfolio of end-to-end solutions, to Accenture's Applied Intelligence business.06:00ASX ASE Technology reports August net revenues +10.3% yr/yr to $1.28 bln (4.51 )06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets ease back; S&P Futures take out yesterday's lowThe global equity markets are under slight pressure to start the day.

The S&P 500 (-0.01%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) finished near their flat lines.The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%), which is home to many energy and financial stocks, outperformed the broader market.The market entered today on the heels of a two-week rally, with some investors beginning to feel less concerned about growth prospects and trade relations with China. For instance, data has shown the U.S. consumer to be resilient in the face of trade tensions, which could see a reprieve with trade talks coming up next month.This positive sentiment was manifested in the higher oil prices ($57.87/bbl, +$1.42, +2.5%) and the selling in the Treasury market on Monday. In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD16:20IMXI International Money Express announces secondary public offering of 5,217,392 shares of common stock by selling stockholders (13.60 -0.55)Shares will be offered by affiliates of Stella Point Capital and certain of the company's other stockholders.

American Realty Capital Properties, Inc., at a cost to the company of approximately $765.5 mln, comprised of a contribution of $738.5 mln toward the Class Action settlement and $27.0 mln toward the Opt Out Action settlements.On September 8, 2019, the company signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) providing for the settlement of the Class Action.

Additionally, the company has decided to discontinue the development of MRT5201, a liver-targeted treatment for OTC deficiency.The company's decision to discontinue the development of MRT5201 for OTC deficiency is based on data from recently completed preclinical studies that do not support the desired pharmacokinetic and safety profile for advancement of the program. These data are related to the first-generation lipid nanoparticle (LNP) designed to be delivered to the liver via intravenous administration for the OTC deficiency program. As such, this LNP is different than that used in the CF and other pulmonary development programs which are designed to deliver the LNP-encapsulated mRNA through nebulization. Additionally, ongoing discovery efforts have generated promising, novel next-generation LNPs supporting the further development of liver disease mRNA therapeutics with potentially favorable product profiles.The company's prioritization of pulmonary diseases is supported by the previously reported positive single-ascending dose Phase 1/2 data from the CF program, which utilizes its proprietary lung delivery platform. MRT5005 is a first-in-class mRNA therapeutic designed to address the underlying cause of CF regardless of genetic mutation by delivering mRNA encoding fully functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein to cells in the lung through nebulization. The multiple-ascending dose portion of the clinical trial is ongoing with data expected in 2020.16:08CASY Casey's General beats by $0.28, beats on revs; reaffirms guidance (167.30 -2.03)Reports Q1 (Jul) earnings of $2.31 per share, $0.28 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.03; revenues rose 1.5% year/year to $2.63 bln vs the $2.59 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Tuesday's action saw investors continuing to rotate out of this year's best-performing stocks for those perceived as having more potential value.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.3%) was lifted by its highest-priced component, Boeing (BA 369.49, +10.71, +3.0%), while the Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperformed amid big gains in energy stocks. The Nasdaq Composite (-0.04%) finished just below its flat line amid relative weakness in shares of technology companies.Value-oriented stocks, in this case those that have underperformed amid growth concerns, have come to life this week. Improved sentiment pertaining to growth and trade has contributed to this value trade, which was made most pronounced in the outperformance in the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.3%), SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.61, +1.18, +2.8%), and Dow Jones Transportation Average (+1.5%) on Tuesday.The gains in the transportation space further padded the S&P 500 industrials sector (+1.0%), while Dow Inc. (DOW 46.32, +1.87, +4.2%) boosted the materials sector (+1.0%).The same underlying sentiment boosting these stocks contributed to the selling in the Treasury market and in the S&P 500 information technology (-0.5%), consumer staples (-0.6%), and real estate (-1.4%) sectors. The tech and real estate sectors have been this year's best-performing sectors, largely due to their respective high-growth and defensive-oriented dispositions.Treasury yields finished noticeably higher, as the crowded Treasury market continued to see less demand. The 2-yr yield increased nine basis points to 1.66%, and the 10-yr yield increased eight basis points to 1.70%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.38.In corporate news, Apple (AAPL 216.70, +2.53, +1.2%) held its annual product event where it unveiled its latest iPhone. The $4.99/month pricing for its TV+ streaming service came as a surprise to some and contributed to weakness in Netflix (NFLX 287.99, -6.35, -2.2%).Wendy's (WEN 19.71, -2.24, -10.2%) was a part of the broader effort to sell momentum stocks, but shares were further pressured by the company cutting its EPS guidance. The lower guidance accounted for its plan to launch a breakfast menu in all locations in 2020.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August declined to 103.1 from 104.7 in July.

The company is in the process of activating clinical sites for its Phase 1/2 clinical trial in PD-GBA and is on track to initiate patient dosing this year. This ascending dose Phase 1/2 clinical trial will enroll up to sixteen PD-GBA patients. Two escalating dose cohorts are planned. The trial will investigate the safety and tolerability of PR001 and will also measure key biomarkers and exploratory efficacy endpoints.Prevail is also developing PR001 for pediatric nGD, a second indication with urgent unmet need. The company submitted an IND to the FDA for PR001 for the treatment of pediatric patients with nGD. Following discussions with the FDA, and based on preclinical studies that demonstrated increased efficacy at a higher dose, Prevail is modifying the design of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial in nGD to commence at a dose higher than originally proposed. Prevail's IND for PR001 for the treatment of pediatric nGD has been placed on clinical hold pending FDA review of an amendment to the nGD IND, which will detail this modification. No safety or adverse events have been observed in any of Prevail's studies of PR001. The start of the Phase 1/2 trial in nGD is anticipated to be delayed approximately one quarter and to begin enrollment in the first half of 2020. The modification to the nGD Phase 1/2 trial design is not anticipated to delay the overall timeline to trial completion.16:16GHM Graham wins three new international projects in crude oil refining market totaling $19 mln (18.50 +0.27)Co announces it was awarded orders for three projects totally $19 mln.

The higher cost of goods sold is attributed to higher mark downs on slow moving inventory, higher manufacturing costs driven by downtime associated with certain aging production infrastructure, higher coffee brewing equipment and labor costs, and unfavorable shift in customer mix. Margin impact was partially offset by lower green coffee prices. Net loss was $8.8 mln compared to net income of $0.1 mln in the prior year period.Adjusted EBITDA was $3.9 mln compared to $14.0 mln in the prior year period.Appoints new CEOCo announced the appointment of Deverl Maserang as President, Chief Executive Officer, and a member of the company's Board of Directors, effective September 13, 2019.

The cash session began with modest losses after the overnight affair saw a mixed showing from equity markets in Asia. It is worth noting that China reported its inflation figures for August, showing the largest decrease in producer prices in two years while consumer prices grew more than expected due to surging pork prices. Treasuries made a half-hearted attempt at a rebound during the initial hour of trade before embarking on a steady retreat that continued into the afternoon. The selling was partially supported by a report that the European Central Bank may announce a delayed resumption of asset purchases contingent on further weakness in the eurozone. The MNI report cited an anonymous ECB official, and noted that a disagreement among policymakers may prevent the ECB from announcing aggressive easing measures on Thursday. Treasuries hit session lows after the completion of today's $38 bln 3-yr note auction, which was received with lukewarm demand, as the high yield (1.573%) tailed the when-issued yield by 0.3 bps while the bid-to-cover ratio (2.42x) was below average (2.53x). The U.S. Dollar Index ticked up 0.1% to 98.38. Yield Check: 2-yr: +9 bps to 1.66% 3-yr: +8 bps to 1.60% 5-yr: +9 bps to 1.57% 10-yr: +8 bps to 1.70% 30-yr: +8 bps to 2.18%News: South China Morning Post reported that Chinese trade negotiators could offer to buy more agricultural products from the United States if the U.S. eases tariffs on imports from China. China is currently suffering from a severe pork shortage, meaning the country may have no choice but to increase its purchases of pork and feed (soybeans) from the U.S. President Trump issued an executive order, enhancing the Treasury Department's ability to sanction terrorist leaders. Bloomberg reported that China's Jilin Transportation Investment Group did not exercise a call option on a perpetual note and will instead pay a higher coupon, which is likely to invite concerns about the cash position of the local government financing vehicle. North Korea fired two projectiles into the East Sea, shortly after a DPRK official indicated that North Korea is ready for another round of talks with U.S. officials. China's August CPI increased 0.7% m/m (expected 0.5%; last 0.4%), rising 2.8% yr/yr (expected 2.6%; last 2.8%). August PPI decreased 0.8% yr/yr (expected -0.9%; last -0.3%).

The company raised EPS guidance to $2.65-2.72 from $2.33-2.47 and revenue to $696-699 mln from $681-688 mln.Q2 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.70 (+8% yr/yr) on revenue of $697.7 mln (+9% yr/yr). The company also raised guidance for fiscal 2020 to $9.08-9.52 from $8.76-9.27 and raised its FY20 guidance revenue guidance to $2.658-2.674 bln form $2.64-2.66 bln. Capital IQ consensus for FY20 calls for EPS of $9.46 (+10.7% yr/yr) on revenue of $2.67 bln (+6.5% yr/yr). Regarding China tariffs, the company said it has renegotiated product costs and selectively raised prices to mitigate the impact of the increase from 10 to 25%. Co is also moving certain production and new product development out of China, plus exploring new partnerships and expanding its own manufacturing facilities in the US. Long term, RH does not believe the current trade climate will impair its ability to achieve stated financial goals. In late August, the company announced that it expects no impact to FY19 or FY20 financial results from the tariffs imposed on current and new product categories imported from China effective September 1st, 2019, October 1st, 2019 and December 15th, 2019.Looking back, the company beat on EPS four out of the last four quarters and best on revenue three out of the last four quarters. Since its core customer base mainly comprises high-end consumers, its business is correlated to how the stock market is performing. From early December through late March, the market experienced sharp volatility as tariff-related headlines wildly swung the indices. During the Q1 earnings call, RH's CEO commented that the Dow plunged 800 points the day after it provided its FY20 guidance. This type of action plays into the psyche and sentiment of consumers who are considering making big-ticket purchases, such as expensive furniture.RH has a $2.7 bln market cap and trades at 16x earnings vs WSM at 14 times earnings.

The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperforms for the second straight day.Today's action has reflected much of yesterday's value trade that benefits underperforming areas of the stock market, most notably the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.8%) and SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.36, +0.93, +2.2%). An upturn in Boeing (BA 366.34, +7.56, +2.1%) and many of the transportation stocks has had a similar effect on the industrials sector (+0.5%).The gains in these areas, however, are coming at the expense of crowded groups like the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.9%), which is the S&P 500's most heavily-weighted sector. The real estate sector (-1.7%), which investors had piled into for its higher dividend yields and low-beta disposition, is today's worst performer.Allowing today's value trade to play out are the improved views on trade and growth, which have helped some money flow out of the Treasury market and drive yields higher. The 2-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.64%, and the 10-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.35.Separately, the market saw a sharp uptick on a report from the South China Morning Post indicating that China is ready to purchase more agricultural products from the U.S. The caveat, though, is that China would want the U.S. to agree to delay tariffs and ease its supply ban on Huawei. Nothing material has transpired, but the report likely triggered some algorithms.Some story stocks today include Wendy's (WEN 19.45, -2.50, -11.4%) and Ford Motor (F 9.28, -0.26, -2.9%).

The shaky start to the week has trimmed the sector's Q3 gain to 2.2%, but the group remains up almost 29.0% for the year, which leaves it well ahead of the remaining ten sectors.Momentum names lagged yesterday, and they are showing relative weakness again today on no news other than the price action itself. To that point, the likes of Synopsys (SNPS 135.61, -5.65, -4.0%), Visa (V 175.35, -6.20, -3.4%), MasterCard (MA 273.42, -9.94, -3.5%), Fiserv (FISV 103.26, -3.42, -3.2%), Global Payments (GPN 165.77, -5.03, -2.9%), and Automatic Data Processing (ADP 162.96, -5.09, -3.0%) show losses between 3.5% and 4.0% after hitting record highs in recent days.Top-weighted sector components have fared a bit better. For instance, Apple (AAPL 213.40, -0.77, -0.4%) is down just 0.4% ahead of an upcoming product reveal while Alphabet (GOOGL 1202.35, -2.93, -0.2%) shows a slimmer loss. Microsoft (MSFT 135.35, -2.15, -1.6%), however, is down more than 1.5%.The technology sector traded beneath its 50-day moving average at today's low point, but it is currently back above that level, which has acted as an area of congestion over the past month.12:02TALKX Market Briefing: Hold the trade deal enthusiasmThe stock market has gotten a nice pop following a South China Morning Post report indicating China is open to agreeing to buy more agricultural products from the U.S. in a lead up to the October trade meeting in Washington. Tucked inside the same article is a qualifier, however, that China would like to do this in exchange for the U.S. dialing back its restrictions on Huawei and delaying the tariff increases it has planned.In other words, it's a familiar page from the trade playbook, only this play hasn't really gained any yardage in the past.The market (or maybe the algorithms) reacted to the headline with a knee-jerk buying effort, but there isn't much of a basis to run with this news as a major breakthrough since it isn't one. That doesn't mean this market can't, or won't, make more out of the headline than it's worth since it has rallied of late on a sense of relief that neither China nor the U.S. seems intent at this juncture on escalating the trade war even further.Still, this shouldn't be construed as a material development.The Russell 2000 is up 0.8%; the Dow Jones industrial Average is flat; the S&P 500 is down 0.5%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.5%.11:51SCANX Stocks that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (49) outpacing new lows (15) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ABG, ACM, ACRE, AMBA, AN, APO, ARCC, ARNC, AY, AYR, BF.B, BRC, BRX, BX, CASH, CCRN, CE, CHH, CIO, CPRX, CY, DCOM, DRRX, GL, GNRC, HTH, HTLD, ITI, ITRI, KIM, KSU, LM, NVMI, NYCB, OKE, PFNX, PSXP, PTGX, SAH, SAIA, SFL, SITC, SSW, STNG, STWD, SUM, SYY, TROW, WUStocks that traded to 52 week lows: BERY, BMRN, ENTA, FVRR, ILMN, LGND, LVGO, LYFT, MMSI, PD, REGN, RUBY, TRXC, VAPO, WMGIThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AGM, ALG, CMBM, IMKTA, NNI, SAR, TIPTThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: ESTA, HSKA, KRTX11:30XERS Xeris Pharmaceuticals receives FDA approval for GVOKE injection for severe hypoglycemia (shares halted) (11.04 +0.10)Xeris Pharmaceuticals has received regulatory approval from the FDA for GVOKE (glucagon) injection, its ready-to-use, room-temperature stable liquid glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in pediatric and adult patients with diabetes ages 2 years and above. GVOKE is the first glucagon product approved that can be administered via a prefilled syringe (GVOKE PFS) or auto-injector (GVOKE HypoPen), reducing the steps to prepare and administer glucagon in the event of severe hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar levels. The FDA's approval is based on positive results from three Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy, safety, and utility of GVOKE in treating severe hypoglycemia when compared with conventional glucagon emergency kits among adults and children with type 1 diabetes.The company is preparing to introduce GVOKE in two different administration options to accommodate the community's preferences, starting with its pre-filled syringe in 4-6 weeks and the auto-injector in 2020.Xeris also has entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and Silicon Valley Bank. The agreement increases the borrowing base from $45 mln to up to $85 mln and extends the maturity date of the debt to as late as June 2024, if the second tranche is drawn.11:30BONDX New SupplyTreasury Auction Preview$38 bln 3-year Treasury note auction (results at 13:00 ET) Prior auction results: High yield: 1.562% Bid-to-cover: 2.41 Indirect bid: 46.7% Direct bid: 19.3% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.407% Bid-to-cover: 2.53 Indirect bid: 46.9% Direct bid: 14.2%11:17SPY Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary of State Pompeo and National Security Advisor Bolton will hold a media briefing at 13:30; topic unknown11:15SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Merit Medical (MMSI) sinks following downgrade -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersENDP (3.72 +21.01%): Continued volatility; the stock recovers yesterday's losses and proceeds to its new highest levels in almost two months.

Revenue is expected to decrease 18.7% yr/yr to $1.34 bln. The company reiterated its FY20 guidance on June 4, priming the market for revenue between $7.46 bln and $7.87 bln. The last three months saw just a handful of noteworthy game releases, which likely presented a headwind to overall store traffic in Q2. There are more big titles scheduled to be released in the fall and in early 2020, which should be a positive for the company's outlook.Shares of GME hit a fresh record low in mid-August amid dimming prospects for a meaningful turnaround. The stock recovered from that low over the past couple weeks, aided by comments from investor Michael Burry, who revealed that his fund owns 3% of outstanding shares of GME. Mr. Burry's view is based on the expectation that the next generation of consoles will not do away with physical Blu-ray drives. While the decision to keep physical drives would be a positive for GME, the company would still need to compete with large retailers like Best Buy (BBY 68.95, -0.27, -0.4%), Target (TGT 107.56, -0.39, -0.4%), and Walmart (WMT 116.02, -0.31, -0.3%) at a time when GME has been closing many of its locations.10:18AAPL Apple September product event previewApple is set to unveil new products today at 13:00 ET. Most of these products will have very incremental upgrades. Most of the attention for shareholders will be placed to the pricing of the company's Apple TV Plus and Apple Arcade services. Apple stock is up 35% year-to-date vs. a 22.5% gain in the Nasdaq 100. The stock remains near the high end of its recent range and less than 10% from its all-time high.iPhones: The company is expected to release three new iPhones. The first iPhone will likely be called the iPhone 11 and will feature a 6.1-inch LCD screen similar to the iPhone XR that is currently on sale. The other two phones will be called the iPhone 11 Pro and will feature organic light-emitting diode displays similar to the iPhone Xs and Xs Max. The iPhone 11 Pro will come in two sizes: 5.8 and 6.5 inches. The phones are expected to feature faster processors and better cameras. However, these phones will likely only have incremental improvements as Apple is expected to unveil its 5G iPhone in 2020. Analysts are expecting pricing similar to prior models between $749-1099.Services: Apple could confirm the pricing for its gaming and TV services and introduce additional content expected for those services. It has been reported by several sources that the gaming service will cost $4.99/month and the TV service will cost $9.99/month. Apple will have to compete with other streaming offerings from Disney (DIS) which will be priced lower.Apple Watch 5: The updated smartwatch is expected to feature a ceramic design, faster processors, and more health features such as sleep tracking.Mac: Apple is expected to introduce a 16-inch Mac Book Pro.iPads: There is some speculation that Apple will update its iPad Pro lineup with faster processors and larger screens. However, some analysts feel the iPad will get its own event in October.Other Products: Apple could introduce Apple "tracking tags" that will allow users to find lost items. Expectations are for another underwhelming iPhone cycle ahead of next year's 5G offering. Analysts note that there is a lot of pent up demand with many older iPhones in the installed base. Therefore, there is an expectation for a super cycle for the 5G handset next year. Still, the investment thesis has shifted from iPhone cycles to a more diversified set of hardware and services. Last quarter, iPhone sales fell to less than 50% of revenue for the first time as the success of services, iPads, AirPods, and the Apple Watch picked up the slack for falling iPhone sales. Apple's earnings are expected to grow 10% next year after falling 2% in fiscal 2019, which concludes this month. With a $943 bln market cap, the stock trades at ~17x earnings, or ~15x, backing out the cash.Suppliers to keep on note include: SSNLF, LPL (for displays) and LITE, FNSR and IIVI (for FaceID.) Other suppliers include: SWKS, CRUS, AVGO, QRVO, TSM, and QCOM, among others.

Patients 02002 and 02006 were treated with higher dose levels of RP-L102. Patients 02004 and 02005 received non-optimized and lower doses of RP-L102. Key highlights of the manuscript include:Follow-up data for the initial four patients 18-30 months post-infusion demonstrate progressively increased engraftment in peripheral blood leukocytes and in the bone marrow following administration of RP-L102 without the use of conditioning. In Patient 02002 at 30 months follow-up, approximately 44% of bone marrow CD34+ cells displayed gene marking, suggesting the engraftment of very primitive corrected hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Sequential increases in gene marking in peripheral blood and in the bone marrow for Patients 02004 and 02005 were also seen, but at more modest levels and after longer durations. The bone marrow resistance to MMC in Patient 02002 increased to 70% at 24 months, approaching the phenotype of a healthy donor.

NfL is a protein that provides structural support to nerve fibres in the brain. An increase in the amount of NfL may be associated with nerve cell damage, and detection of increased NfL levels in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may serve as a biomarker of nerve cell damage.In the Phase III OPERA I study in RMS and the ORATORIO study in PPMS, blood NfL levels were significantly lower after treatment with OCREVUS. In RMS, blood serum NfL levels were reduced by 43 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with a 31 percent reduction with interferon beta-1a (p<0.001). In PPMS, blood plasma NfL levels were reduced by 16 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with 0.2 percent reduction with placebo (p<0.001). Additionally, these analyses showed higher blood NfL levels at the start of the study were correlated with more disability progression in upper and lower limbs in PPMS and overall disability in the interferon beta-1a RMS treatment group at 96 weeks.06:03FTS Fortis announces five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 bln for the period 2020 to 2024, increases quarterly dividend to $0.4775/share from $0.45/share (42.08 )The co announced its five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 billion for the period 2020 to 2024, up $1.0 billion from the prior year's plan.

OS rates at five years were 13.4% for Opdivo and 2.6% for docetaxel. The OS benefit for Opdivo-treated patients was observed across all subgroups.The safety profile for patients treated with Opdivo was consistent with previously reported findings in second-line NSCLC and no new safety signals were seen with extended follow-up. Of patients still on study, only 2 of 70 experienced a new treatment-related select AE between years three and four and there were no new treatment-related select AE's reported between years four and five among the 55 patients still on study.Among patients with an objective response to Opdivo, 32.2% continued to see a response at five years. 0% of patients with an objective response to docetaxel continued to see a response at five years. The median duration of response was 19.9 months for Opdivo-treated patients and 5.6 months for patients treated with docetaxel.06:00ALNY Alnylam Pharma presents new clinical results for Givosiran -- Porphyria attack reductions observed in ENVISION Phase 3 study maintained with ongoing Givosiran dosing in open-label extension study (82.69 )ENVISION Phase 3 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of January 31, 2019, all eligible patients (N=93) from the ENVISION Phase 3 study of givosiran rolled over into the OLE phase of the study. Reduction in the composite porphyria attack rate with givosiran treatment, which had been observed in the ENVISION Phase 3 study as early as one month after dosing, was shown to be sustained with continued dosing in the OLE phase of the study. Sustained reduction in levels of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), an intermediate in the heme biosynthesis pathway believed to be the primary neurotoxic intermediate responsible for causing both porphyria attacks and ongoing symptoms in between attacks, was also observed with continued dosing. Rapid and sustained lowering of attack rate and ALA levels was also observed in placebo patients who crossed over after the six-month double blind phase of the ENVISION Phase 3 study to receive givosiran in the OLE phase of the study. Givosiran's safety profile in the OLE phase has remained consistent with the profile observed in the double blind phase of the ENVISION study.ENVISION Results of Select Patient Reported Outcomes -- A number of patient reported outcomes were collected as secondary and exploratory measures in the ENVISION study. Daily worst pain did not achieve statistical significance based on the prespecified ANCOVA analysis (p equals 0.0530), however, the data were found to not be normally distributed. A post-hoc analysis of daily worst pain was therefore performed using the non-parametric stratified Wilcoxon test. Based on the non-parametric test, patients on givosiran had a significant reduction in daily worst pain (nominal p equals 0.0455). In exploratory analyses, the reductions in pain were accompanied by fewer days of use of both opioid and non-opioid analgesics. Givosiran did not impact daily worst fatigue or daily worst nausea at six months, although these assessments will be repeated at twelve months to explore the effects of longer term dosing. Updated Phase 1/2 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of April 19, 2019, a robust treatment effect was maintained in givosiran-treated patients with continued dosing in the Phase 1/2 OLE study (N=16), with a mean time on treatment of 22.8 months and total time on treatment across the Phase 1 and OLE studies of up to 35 months. Substantial mean reductions in annualized attack rate (AAR) and in annualized hemin use of greater than 90 percent were observed, with evidence for sustained or potentially enhanced clinical activity with continued dosing. Five out of twelve patients (42 percent) who received givosiran during the Phase 1 study and continued with givosiran dosing in the OLE study and two out of four patients (50 percent) who had been in the placebo arm of the Phase 1 study and crossed over to givosiran treatment in the OLE study achieved an AAR of zero for a mean of 18.1 and 24.9 months, respectively.06:00ACN Accenture acquires Pragsis Bidoop; terms not disclosed (194.83 )Pragsis Bidoop, headquartered in Madrid with additional offices in Barcelona and the U.K., will add more than 200 employees with deep machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data engineering experience, along with its portfolio of end-to-end solutions, to Accenture's Applied Intelligence business.06:00ASX ASE Technology reports August net revenues +10.3% yr/yr to $1.28 bln (4.51 )06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets ease back; S&P Futures take out yesterday's lowThe global equity markets are under slight pressure to start the day.

The S&P 500 (-0.01%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) finished near their flat lines.The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%), which is home to many energy and financial stocks, outperformed the broader market.The market entered today on the heels of a two-week rally, with some investors beginning to feel less concerned about growth prospects and trade relations with China. For instance, data has shown the U.S. consumer to be resilient in the face of trade tensions, which could see a reprieve with trade talks coming up next month.This positive sentiment was manifested in the higher oil prices ($57.87/bbl, +$1.42, +2.5%) and the selling in the Treasury market on Monday. In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD16:20IMXI International Money Express announces secondary public offering of 5,217,392 shares of common stock by selling stockholders (13.60 -0.55)Shares will be offered by affiliates of Stella Point Capital and certain of the company's other stockholders.

American Realty Capital Properties, Inc., at a cost to the company of approximately $765.5 mln, comprised of a contribution of $738.5 mln toward the Class Action settlement and $27.0 mln toward the Opt Out Action settlements.On September 8, 2019, the company signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) providing for the settlement of the Class Action.

Additionally, the company has decided to discontinue the development of MRT5201, a liver-targeted treatment for OTC deficiency.The company's decision to discontinue the development of MRT5201 for OTC deficiency is based on data from recently completed preclinical studies that do not support the desired pharmacokinetic and safety profile for advancement of the program. These data are related to the first-generation lipid nanoparticle (LNP) designed to be delivered to the liver via intravenous administration for the OTC deficiency program. As such, this LNP is different than that used in the CF and other pulmonary development programs which are designed to deliver the LNP-encapsulated mRNA through nebulization. Additionally, ongoing discovery efforts have generated promising, novel next-generation LNPs supporting the further development of liver disease mRNA therapeutics with potentially favorable product profiles.The company's prioritization of pulmonary diseases is supported by the previously reported positive single-ascending dose Phase 1/2 data from the CF program, which utilizes its proprietary lung delivery platform. MRT5005 is a first-in-class mRNA therapeutic designed to address the underlying cause of CF regardless of genetic mutation by delivering mRNA encoding fully functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein to cells in the lung through nebulization. The multiple-ascending dose portion of the clinical trial is ongoing with data expected in 2020.16:08CASY Casey's General beats by $0.28, beats on revs; reaffirms guidance (167.30 -2.03)Reports Q1 (Jul) earnings of $2.31 per share, $0.28 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.03; revenues rose 1.5% year/year to $2.63 bln vs the $2.59 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Tuesday's action saw investors continuing to rotate out of this year's best-performing stocks for those perceived as having more potential value.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.3%) was lifted by its highest-priced component, Boeing (BA 369.49, +10.71, +3.0%), while the Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperformed amid big gains in energy stocks. The Nasdaq Composite (-0.04%) finished just below its flat line amid relative weakness in shares of technology companies.Value-oriented stocks, in this case those that have underperformed amid growth concerns, have come to life this week. Improved sentiment pertaining to growth and trade has contributed to this value trade, which was made most pronounced in the outperformance in the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.3%), SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.61, +1.18, +2.8%), and Dow Jones Transportation Average (+1.5%) on Tuesday.The gains in the transportation space further padded the S&P 500 industrials sector (+1.0%), while Dow Inc. (DOW 46.32, +1.87, +4.2%) boosted the materials sector (+1.0%).The same underlying sentiment boosting these stocks contributed to the selling in the Treasury market and in the S&P 500 information technology (-0.5%), consumer staples (-0.6%), and real estate (-1.4%) sectors. The tech and real estate sectors have been this year's best-performing sectors, largely due to their respective high-growth and defensive-oriented dispositions.Treasury yields finished noticeably higher, as the crowded Treasury market continued to see less demand. The 2-yr yield increased nine basis points to 1.66%, and the 10-yr yield increased eight basis points to 1.70%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.38.In corporate news, Apple (AAPL 216.70, +2.53, +1.2%) held its annual product event where it unveiled its latest iPhone. The $4.99/month pricing for its TV+ streaming service came as a surprise to some and contributed to weakness in Netflix (NFLX 287.99, -6.35, -2.2%).Wendy's (WEN 19.71, -2.24, -10.2%) was a part of the broader effort to sell momentum stocks, but shares were further pressured by the company cutting its EPS guidance. The lower guidance accounted for its plan to launch a breakfast menu in all locations in 2020.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August declined to 103.1 from 104.7 in July.

The company is in the process of activating clinical sites for its Phase 1/2 clinical trial in PD-GBA and is on track to initiate patient dosing this year. This ascending dose Phase 1/2 clinical trial will enroll up to sixteen PD-GBA patients. Two escalating dose cohorts are planned. The trial will investigate the safety and tolerability of PR001 and will also measure key biomarkers and exploratory efficacy endpoints.Prevail is also developing PR001 for pediatric nGD, a second indication with urgent unmet need. The company submitted an IND to the FDA for PR001 for the treatment of pediatric patients with nGD. Following discussions with the FDA, and based on preclinical studies that demonstrated increased efficacy at a higher dose, Prevail is modifying the design of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial in nGD to commence at a dose higher than originally proposed. Prevail's IND for PR001 for the treatment of pediatric nGD has been placed on clinical hold pending FDA review of an amendment to the nGD IND, which will detail this modification. No safety or adverse events have been observed in any of Prevail's studies of PR001. The start of the Phase 1/2 trial in nGD is anticipated to be delayed approximately one quarter and to begin enrollment in the first half of 2020. The modification to the nGD Phase 1/2 trial design is not anticipated to delay the overall timeline to trial completion.16:16GHM Graham wins three new international projects in crude oil refining market totaling $19 mln (18.50 +0.27)Co announces it was awarded orders for three projects totally $19 mln.

The higher cost of goods sold is attributed to higher mark downs on slow moving inventory, higher manufacturing costs driven by downtime associated with certain aging production infrastructure, higher coffee brewing equipment and labor costs, and unfavorable shift in customer mix. Margin impact was partially offset by lower green coffee prices. Net loss was $8.8 mln compared to net income of $0.1 mln in the prior year period.Adjusted EBITDA was $3.9 mln compared to $14.0 mln in the prior year period.Appoints new CEOCo announced the appointment of Deverl Maserang as President, Chief Executive Officer, and a member of the company's Board of Directors, effective September 13, 2019.

The cash session began with modest losses after the overnight affair saw a mixed showing from equity markets in Asia. It is worth noting that China reported its inflation figures for August, showing the largest decrease in producer prices in two years while consumer prices grew more than expected due to surging pork prices. Treasuries made a half-hearted attempt at a rebound during the initial hour of trade before embarking on a steady retreat that continued into the afternoon. The selling was partially supported by a report that the European Central Bank may announce a delayed resumption of asset purchases contingent on further weakness in the eurozone. The MNI report cited an anonymous ECB official, and noted that a disagreement among policymakers may prevent the ECB from announcing aggressive easing measures on Thursday. Treasuries hit session lows after the completion of today's $38 bln 3-yr note auction, which was received with lukewarm demand, as the high yield (1.573%) tailed the when-issued yield by 0.3 bps while the bid-to-cover ratio (2.42x) was below average (2.53x). The U.S. Dollar Index ticked up 0.1% to 98.38. Yield Check: 2-yr: +9 bps to 1.66% 3-yr: +8 bps to 1.60% 5-yr: +9 bps to 1.57% 10-yr: +8 bps to 1.70% 30-yr: +8 bps to 2.18%News: South China Morning Post reported that Chinese trade negotiators could offer to buy more agricultural products from the United States if the U.S. eases tariffs on imports from China. China is currently suffering from a severe pork shortage, meaning the country may have no choice but to increase its purchases of pork and feed (soybeans) from the U.S. President Trump issued an executive order, enhancing the Treasury Department's ability to sanction terrorist leaders. Bloomberg reported that China's Jilin Transportation Investment Group did not exercise a call option on a perpetual note and will instead pay a higher coupon, which is likely to invite concerns about the cash position of the local government financing vehicle. North Korea fired two projectiles into the East Sea, shortly after a DPRK official indicated that North Korea is ready for another round of talks with U.S. officials. China's August CPI increased 0.7% m/m (expected 0.5%; last 0.4%), rising 2.8% yr/yr (expected 2.6%; last 2.8%). August PPI decreased 0.8% yr/yr (expected -0.9%; last -0.3%).

The company raised EPS guidance to $2.65-2.72 from $2.33-2.47 and revenue to $696-699 mln from $681-688 mln.Q2 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.70 (+8% yr/yr) on revenue of $697.7 mln (+9% yr/yr). The company also raised guidance for fiscal 2020 to $9.08-9.52 from $8.76-9.27 and raised its FY20 guidance revenue guidance to $2.658-2.674 bln form $2.64-2.66 bln. Capital IQ consensus for FY20 calls for EPS of $9.46 (+10.7% yr/yr) on revenue of $2.67 bln (+6.5% yr/yr). Regarding China tariffs, the company said it has renegotiated product costs and selectively raised prices to mitigate the impact of the increase from 10 to 25%. Co is also moving certain production and new product development out of China, plus exploring new partnerships and expanding its own manufacturing facilities in the US. Long term, RH does not believe the current trade climate will impair its ability to achieve stated financial goals. In late August, the company announced that it expects no impact to FY19 or FY20 financial results from the tariffs imposed on current and new product categories imported from China effective September 1st, 2019, October 1st, 2019 and December 15th, 2019.Looking back, the company beat on EPS four out of the last four quarters and best on revenue three out of the last four quarters. Since its core customer base mainly comprises high-end consumers, its business is correlated to how the stock market is performing. From early December through late March, the market experienced sharp volatility as tariff-related headlines wildly swung the indices. During the Q1 earnings call, RH's CEO commented that the Dow plunged 800 points the day after it provided its FY20 guidance. This type of action plays into the psyche and sentiment of consumers who are considering making big-ticket purchases, such as expensive furniture.RH has a $2.7 bln market cap and trades at 16x earnings vs WSM at 14 times earnings.

The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperforms for the second straight day.Today's action has reflected much of yesterday's value trade that benefits underperforming areas of the stock market, most notably the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.8%) and SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.36, +0.93, +2.2%). An upturn in Boeing (BA 366.34, +7.56, +2.1%) and many of the transportation stocks has had a similar effect on the industrials sector (+0.5%).The gains in these areas, however, are coming at the expense of crowded groups like the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.9%), which is the S&P 500's most heavily-weighted sector. The real estate sector (-1.7%), which investors had piled into for its higher dividend yields and low-beta disposition, is today's worst performer.Allowing today's value trade to play out are the improved views on trade and growth, which have helped some money flow out of the Treasury market and drive yields higher. The 2-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.64%, and the 10-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.35.Separately, the market saw a sharp uptick on a report from the South China Morning Post indicating that China is ready to purchase more agricultural products from the U.S. The caveat, though, is that China would want the U.S. to agree to delay tariffs and ease its supply ban on Huawei. Nothing material has transpired, but the report likely triggered some algorithms.Some story stocks today include Wendy's (WEN 19.45, -2.50, -11.4%) and Ford Motor (F 9.28, -0.26, -2.9%).

The shaky start to the week has trimmed the sector's Q3 gain to 2.2%, but the group remains up almost 29.0% for the year, which leaves it well ahead of the remaining ten sectors.Momentum names lagged yesterday, and they are showing relative weakness again today on no news other than the price action itself. To that point, the likes of Synopsys (SNPS 135.61, -5.65, -4.0%), Visa (V 175.35, -6.20, -3.4%), MasterCard (MA 273.42, -9.94, -3.5%), Fiserv (FISV 103.26, -3.42, -3.2%), Global Payments (GPN 165.77, -5.03, -2.9%), and Automatic Data Processing (ADP 162.96, -5.09, -3.0%) show losses between 3.5% and 4.0% after hitting record highs in recent days.Top-weighted sector components have fared a bit better. For instance, Apple (AAPL 213.40, -0.77, -0.4%) is down just 0.4% ahead of an upcoming product reveal while Alphabet (GOOGL 1202.35, -2.93, -0.2%) shows a slimmer loss. Microsoft (MSFT 135.35, -2.15, -1.6%), however, is down more than 1.5%.The technology sector traded beneath its 50-day moving average at today's low point, but it is currently back above that level, which has acted as an area of congestion over the past month.12:02TALKX Market Briefing: Hold the trade deal enthusiasmThe stock market has gotten a nice pop following a South China Morning Post report indicating China is open to agreeing to buy more agricultural products from the U.S. in a lead up to the October trade meeting in Washington. Tucked inside the same article is a qualifier, however, that China would like to do this in exchange for the U.S. dialing back its restrictions on Huawei and delaying the tariff increases it has planned.In other words, it's a familiar page from the trade playbook, only this play hasn't really gained any yardage in the past.The market (or maybe the algorithms) reacted to the headline with a knee-jerk buying effort, but there isn't much of a basis to run with this news as a major breakthrough since it isn't one. That doesn't mean this market can't, or won't, make more out of the headline than it's worth since it has rallied of late on a sense of relief that neither China nor the U.S. seems intent at this juncture on escalating the trade war even further.Still, this shouldn't be construed as a material development.The Russell 2000 is up 0.8%; the Dow Jones industrial Average is flat; the S&P 500 is down 0.5%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.5%.11:51SCANX Stocks that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (49) outpacing new lows (15) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ABG, ACM, ACRE, AMBA, AN, APO, ARCC, ARNC, AY, AYR, BF.B, BRC, BRX, BX, CASH, CCRN, CE, CHH, CIO, CPRX, CY, DCOM, DRRX, GL, GNRC, HTH, HTLD, ITI, ITRI, KIM, KSU, LM, NVMI, NYCB, OKE, PFNX, PSXP, PTGX, SAH, SAIA, SFL, SITC, SSW, STNG, STWD, SUM, SYY, TROW, WUStocks that traded to 52 week lows: BERY, BMRN, ENTA, FVRR, ILMN, LGND, LVGO, LYFT, MMSI, PD, REGN, RUBY, TRXC, VAPO, WMGIThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AGM, ALG, CMBM, IMKTA, NNI, SAR, TIPTThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: ESTA, HSKA, KRTX11:30XERS Xeris Pharmaceuticals receives FDA approval for GVOKE injection for severe hypoglycemia (shares halted) (11.04 +0.10)Xeris Pharmaceuticals has received regulatory approval from the FDA for GVOKE (glucagon) injection, its ready-to-use, room-temperature stable liquid glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in pediatric and adult patients with diabetes ages 2 years and above. GVOKE is the first glucagon product approved that can be administered via a prefilled syringe (GVOKE PFS) or auto-injector (GVOKE HypoPen), reducing the steps to prepare and administer glucagon in the event of severe hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar levels. The FDA's approval is based on positive results from three Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy, safety, and utility of GVOKE in treating severe hypoglycemia when compared with conventional glucagon emergency kits among adults and children with type 1 diabetes.The company is preparing to introduce GVOKE in two different administration options to accommodate the community's preferences, starting with its pre-filled syringe in 4-6 weeks and the auto-injector in 2020.Xeris also has entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and Silicon Valley Bank. The agreement increases the borrowing base from $45 mln to up to $85 mln and extends the maturity date of the debt to as late as June 2024, if the second tranche is drawn.11:30BONDX New SupplyTreasury Auction Preview$38 bln 3-year Treasury note auction (results at 13:00 ET) Prior auction results: High yield: 1.562% Bid-to-cover: 2.41 Indirect bid: 46.7% Direct bid: 19.3% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.407% Bid-to-cover: 2.53 Indirect bid: 46.9% Direct bid: 14.2%11:17SPY Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary of State Pompeo and National Security Advisor Bolton will hold a media briefing at 13:30; topic unknown11:15SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Merit Medical (MMSI) sinks following downgrade -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersENDP (3.72 +21.01%): Continued volatility; the stock recovers yesterday's losses and proceeds to its new highest levels in almost two months.

Revenue is expected to decrease 18.7% yr/yr to $1.34 bln. The company reiterated its FY20 guidance on June 4, priming the market for revenue between $7.46 bln and $7.87 bln. The last three months saw just a handful of noteworthy game releases, which likely presented a headwind to overall store traffic in Q2. There are more big titles scheduled to be released in the fall and in early 2020, which should be a positive for the company's outlook.Shares of GME hit a fresh record low in mid-August amid dimming prospects for a meaningful turnaround. The stock recovered from that low over the past couple weeks, aided by comments from investor Michael Burry, who revealed that his fund owns 3% of outstanding shares of GME. Mr. Burry's view is based on the expectation that the next generation of consoles will not do away with physical Blu-ray drives. While the decision to keep physical drives would be a positive for GME, the company would still need to compete with large retailers like Best Buy (BBY 68.95, -0.27, -0.4%), Target (TGT 107.56, -0.39, -0.4%), and Walmart (WMT 116.02, -0.31, -0.3%) at a time when GME has been closing many of its locations.10:18AAPL Apple September product event previewApple is set to unveil new products today at 13:00 ET. Most of these products will have very incremental upgrades. Most of the attention for shareholders will be placed to the pricing of the company's Apple TV Plus and Apple Arcade services. Apple stock is up 35% year-to-date vs. a 22.5% gain in the Nasdaq 100. The stock remains near the high end of its recent range and less than 10% from its all-time high.iPhones: The company is expected to release three new iPhones. The first iPhone will likely be called the iPhone 11 and will feature a 6.1-inch LCD screen similar to the iPhone XR that is currently on sale. The other two phones will be called the iPhone 11 Pro and will feature organic light-emitting diode displays similar to the iPhone Xs and Xs Max. The iPhone 11 Pro will come in two sizes: 5.8 and 6.5 inches. The phones are expected to feature faster processors and better cameras. However, these phones will likely only have incremental improvements as Apple is expected to unveil its 5G iPhone in 2020. Analysts are expecting pricing similar to prior models between $749-1099.Services: Apple could confirm the pricing for its gaming and TV services and introduce additional content expected for those services. It has been reported by several sources that the gaming service will cost $4.99/month and the TV service will cost $9.99/month. Apple will have to compete with other streaming offerings from Disney (DIS) which will be priced lower.Apple Watch 5: The updated smartwatch is expected to feature a ceramic design, faster processors, and more health features such as sleep tracking.Mac: Apple is expected to introduce a 16-inch Mac Book Pro.iPads: There is some speculation that Apple will update its iPad Pro lineup with faster processors and larger screens. However, some analysts feel the iPad will get its own event in October.Other Products: Apple could introduce Apple "tracking tags" that will allow users to find lost items. Expectations are for another underwhelming iPhone cycle ahead of next year's 5G offering. Analysts note that there is a lot of pent up demand with many older iPhones in the installed base. Therefore, there is an expectation for a super cycle for the 5G handset next year. Still, the investment thesis has shifted from iPhone cycles to a more diversified set of hardware and services. Last quarter, iPhone sales fell to less than 50% of revenue for the first time as the success of services, iPads, AirPods, and the Apple Watch picked up the slack for falling iPhone sales. Apple's earnings are expected to grow 10% next year after falling 2% in fiscal 2019, which concludes this month. With a $943 bln market cap, the stock trades at ~17x earnings, or ~15x, backing out the cash.Suppliers to keep on note include: SSNLF, LPL (for displays) and LITE, FNSR and IIVI (for FaceID.) Other suppliers include: SWKS, CRUS, AVGO, QRVO, TSM, and QCOM, among others.

Patients 02002 and 02006 were treated with higher dose levels of RP-L102. Patients 02004 and 02005 received non-optimized and lower doses of RP-L102. Key highlights of the manuscript include:Follow-up data for the initial four patients 18-30 months post-infusion demonstrate progressively increased engraftment in peripheral blood leukocytes and in the bone marrow following administration of RP-L102 without the use of conditioning. In Patient 02002 at 30 months follow-up, approximately 44% of bone marrow CD34+ cells displayed gene marking, suggesting the engraftment of very primitive corrected hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Sequential increases in gene marking in peripheral blood and in the bone marrow for Patients 02004 and 02005 were also seen, but at more modest levels and after longer durations. The bone marrow resistance to MMC in Patient 02002 increased to 70% at 24 months, approaching the phenotype of a healthy donor.

NfL is a protein that provides structural support to nerve fibres in the brain. An increase in the amount of NfL may be associated with nerve cell damage, and detection of increased NfL levels in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may serve as a biomarker of nerve cell damage.In the Phase III OPERA I study in RMS and the ORATORIO study in PPMS, blood NfL levels were significantly lower after treatment with OCREVUS. In RMS, blood serum NfL levels were reduced by 43 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with a 31 percent reduction with interferon beta-1a (p<0.001). In PPMS, blood plasma NfL levels were reduced by 16 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with 0.2 percent reduction with placebo (p<0.001). Additionally, these analyses showed higher blood NfL levels at the start of the study were correlated with more disability progression in upper and lower limbs in PPMS and overall disability in the interferon beta-1a RMS treatment group at 96 weeks.06:03FTS Fortis announces five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 bln for the period 2020 to 2024, increases quarterly dividend to $0.4775/share from $0.45/share (42.08 )The co announced its five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 billion for the period 2020 to 2024, up $1.0 billion from the prior year's plan.

OS rates at five years were 13.4% for Opdivo and 2.6% for docetaxel. The OS benefit for Opdivo-treated patients was observed across all subgroups.The safety profile for patients treated with Opdivo was consistent with previously reported findings in second-line NSCLC and no new safety signals were seen with extended follow-up. Of patients still on study, only 2 of 70 experienced a new treatment-related select AE between years three and four and there were no new treatment-related select AE's reported between years four and five among the 55 patients still on study.Among patients with an objective response to Opdivo, 32.2% continued to see a response at five years. 0% of patients with an objective response to docetaxel continued to see a response at five years. The median duration of response was 19.9 months for Opdivo-treated patients and 5.6 months for patients treated with docetaxel.06:00ALNY Alnylam Pharma presents new clinical results for Givosiran -- Porphyria attack reductions observed in ENVISION Phase 3 study maintained with ongoing Givosiran dosing in open-label extension study (82.69 )ENVISION Phase 3 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of January 31, 2019, all eligible patients (N=93) from the ENVISION Phase 3 study of givosiran rolled over into the OLE phase of the study. Reduction in the composite porphyria attack rate with givosiran treatment, which had been observed in the ENVISION Phase 3 study as early as one month after dosing, was shown to be sustained with continued dosing in the OLE phase of the study. Sustained reduction in levels of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), an intermediate in the heme biosynthesis pathway believed to be the primary neurotoxic intermediate responsible for causing both porphyria attacks and ongoing symptoms in between attacks, was also observed with continued dosing. Rapid and sustained lowering of attack rate and ALA levels was also observed in placebo patients who crossed over after the six-month double blind phase of the ENVISION Phase 3 study to receive givosiran in the OLE phase of the study. Givosiran's safety profile in the OLE phase has remained consistent with the profile observed in the double blind phase of the ENVISION study.ENVISION Results of Select Patient Reported Outcomes -- A number of patient reported outcomes were collected as secondary and exploratory measures in the ENVISION study. Daily worst pain did not achieve statistical significance based on the prespecified ANCOVA analysis (p equals 0.0530), however, the data were found to not be normally distributed. A post-hoc analysis of daily worst pain was therefore performed using the non-parametric stratified Wilcoxon test. Based on the non-parametric test, patients on givosiran had a significant reduction in daily worst pain (nominal p equals 0.0455). In exploratory analyses, the reductions in pain were accompanied by fewer days of use of both opioid and non-opioid analgesics. Givosiran did not impact daily worst fatigue or daily worst nausea at six months, although these assessments will be repeated at twelve months to explore the effects of longer term dosing. Updated Phase 1/2 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of April 19, 2019, a robust treatment effect was maintained in givosiran-treated patients with continued dosing in the Phase 1/2 OLE study (N=16), with a mean time on treatment of 22.8 months and total time on treatment across the Phase 1 and OLE studies of up to 35 months. Substantial mean reductions in annualized attack rate (AAR) and in annualized hemin use of greater than 90 percent were observed, with evidence for sustained or potentially enhanced clinical activity with continued dosing. Five out of twelve patients (42 percent) who received givosiran during the Phase 1 study and continued with givosiran dosing in the OLE study and two out of four patients (50 percent) who had been in the placebo arm of the Phase 1 study and crossed over to givosiran treatment in the OLE study achieved an AAR of zero for a mean of 18.1 and 24.9 months, respectively.06:00ACN Accenture acquires Pragsis Bidoop; terms not disclosed (194.83 )Pragsis Bidoop, headquartered in Madrid with additional offices in Barcelona and the U.K., will add more than 200 employees with deep machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data engineering experience, along with its portfolio of end-to-end solutions, to Accenture's Applied Intelligence business.06:00ASX ASE Technology reports August net revenues +10.3% yr/yr to $1.28 bln (4.51 )06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets ease back; S&P Futures take out yesterday's lowThe global equity markets are under slight pressure to start the day.

The S&P 500 (-0.01%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) finished near their flat lines.The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%), which is home to many energy and financial stocks, outperformed the broader market.The market entered today on the heels of a two-week rally, with some investors beginning to feel less concerned about growth prospects and trade relations with China. For instance, data has shown the U.S. consumer to be resilient in the face of trade tensions, which could see a reprieve with trade talks coming up next month.This positive sentiment was manifested in the higher oil prices ($57.87/bbl, +$1.42, +2.5%) and the selling in the Treasury market on Monday. In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD16:20IMXI International Money Express announces secondary public offering of 5,217,392 shares of common stock by selling stockholders (13.60 -0.55)Shares will be offered by affiliates of Stella Point Capital and certain of the company's other stockholders.

American Realty Capital Properties, Inc., at a cost to the company of approximately $765.5 mln, comprised of a contribution of $738.5 mln toward the Class Action settlement and $27.0 mln toward the Opt Out Action settlements.On September 8, 2019, the company signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) providing for the settlement of the Class Action.

Additionally, the company has decided to discontinue the development of MRT5201, a liver-targeted treatment for OTC deficiency.The company's decision to discontinue the development of MRT5201 for OTC deficiency is based on data from recently completed preclinical studies that do not support the desired pharmacokinetic and safety profile for advancement of the program. These data are related to the first-generation lipid nanoparticle (LNP) designed to be delivered to the liver via intravenous administration for the OTC deficiency program. As such, this LNP is different than that used in the CF and other pulmonary development programs which are designed to deliver the LNP-encapsulated mRNA through nebulization. Additionally, ongoing discovery efforts have generated promising, novel next-generation LNPs supporting the further development of liver disease mRNA therapeutics with potentially favorable product profiles.The company's prioritization of pulmonary diseases is supported by the previously reported positive single-ascending dose Phase 1/2 data from the CF program, which utilizes its proprietary lung delivery platform. MRT5005 is a first-in-class mRNA therapeutic designed to address the underlying cause of CF regardless of genetic mutation by delivering mRNA encoding fully functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein to cells in the lung through nebulization. The multiple-ascending dose portion of the clinical trial is ongoing with data expected in 2020.16:08CASY Casey's General beats by $0.28, beats on revs; reaffirms guidance (167.30 -2.03)Reports Q1 (Jul) earnings of $2.31 per share, $0.28 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.03; revenues rose 1.5% year/year to $2.63 bln vs the $2.59 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Tuesday's action saw investors continuing to rotate out of this year's best-performing stocks for those perceived as having more potential value.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.3%) was lifted by its highest-priced component, Boeing (BA 369.49, +10.71, +3.0%), while the Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperformed amid big gains in energy stocks. The Nasdaq Composite (-0.04%) finished just below its flat line amid relative weakness in shares of technology companies.Value-oriented stocks, in this case those that have underperformed amid growth concerns, have come to life this week. Improved sentiment pertaining to growth and trade has contributed to this value trade, which was made most pronounced in the outperformance in the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.3%), SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.61, +1.18, +2.8%), and Dow Jones Transportation Average (+1.5%) on Tuesday.The gains in the transportation space further padded the S&P 500 industrials sector (+1.0%), while Dow Inc. (DOW 46.32, +1.87, +4.2%) boosted the materials sector (+1.0%).The same underlying sentiment boosting these stocks contributed to the selling in the Treasury market and in the S&P 500 information technology (-0.5%), consumer staples (-0.6%), and real estate (-1.4%) sectors. The tech and real estate sectors have been this year's best-performing sectors, largely due to their respective high-growth and defensive-oriented dispositions.Treasury yields finished noticeably higher, as the crowded Treasury market continued to see less demand. The 2-yr yield increased nine basis points to 1.66%, and the 10-yr yield increased eight basis points to 1.70%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.38.In corporate news, Apple (AAPL 216.70, +2.53, +1.2%) held its annual product event where it unveiled its latest iPhone. The $4.99/month pricing for its TV+ streaming service came as a surprise to some and contributed to weakness in Netflix (NFLX 287.99, -6.35, -2.2%).Wendy's (WEN 19.71, -2.24, -10.2%) was a part of the broader effort to sell momentum stocks, but shares were further pressured by the company cutting its EPS guidance. The lower guidance accounted for its plan to launch a breakfast menu in all locations in 2020.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August declined to 103.1 from 104.7 in July.

The company is in the process of activating clinical sites for its Phase 1/2 clinical trial in PD-GBA and is on track to initiate patient dosing this year. This ascending dose Phase 1/2 clinical trial will enroll up to sixteen PD-GBA patients. Two escalating dose cohorts are planned. The trial will investigate the safety and tolerability of PR001 and will also measure key biomarkers and exploratory efficacy endpoints.Prevail is also developing PR001 for pediatric nGD, a second indication with urgent unmet need. The company submitted an IND to the FDA for PR001 for the treatment of pediatric patients with nGD. Following discussions with the FDA, and based on preclinical studies that demonstrated increased efficacy at a higher dose, Prevail is modifying the design of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial in nGD to commence at a dose higher than originally proposed. Prevail's IND for PR001 for the treatment of pediatric nGD has been placed on clinical hold pending FDA review of an amendment to the nGD IND, which will detail this modification. No safety or adverse events have been observed in any of Prevail's studies of PR001. The start of the Phase 1/2 trial in nGD is anticipated to be delayed approximately one quarter and to begin enrollment in the first half of 2020. The modification to the nGD Phase 1/2 trial design is not anticipated to delay the overall timeline to trial completion.16:16GHM Graham wins three new international projects in crude oil refining market totaling $19 mln (18.50 +0.27)Co announces it was awarded orders for three projects totally $19 mln.

The higher cost of goods sold is attributed to higher mark downs on slow moving inventory, higher manufacturing costs driven by downtime associated with certain aging production infrastructure, higher coffee brewing equipment and labor costs, and unfavorable shift in customer mix. Margin impact was partially offset by lower green coffee prices. Net loss was $8.8 mln compared to net income of $0.1 mln in the prior year period.Adjusted EBITDA was $3.9 mln compared to $14.0 mln in the prior year period.Appoints new CEOCo announced the appointment of Deverl Maserang as President, Chief Executive Officer, and a member of the company's Board of Directors, effective September 13, 2019.

The cash session began with modest losses after the overnight affair saw a mixed showing from equity markets in Asia. It is worth noting that China reported its inflation figures for August, showing the largest decrease in producer prices in two years while consumer prices grew more than expected due to surging pork prices. Treasuries made a half-hearted attempt at a rebound during the initial hour of trade before embarking on a steady retreat that continued into the afternoon. The selling was partially supported by a report that the European Central Bank may announce a delayed resumption of asset purchases contingent on further weakness in the eurozone. The MNI report cited an anonymous ECB official, and noted that a disagreement among policymakers may prevent the ECB from announcing aggressive easing measures on Thursday. Treasuries hit session lows after the completion of today's $38 bln 3-yr note auction, which was received with lukewarm demand, as the high yield (1.573%) tailed the when-issued yield by 0.3 bps while the bid-to-cover ratio (2.42x) was below average (2.53x). The U.S. Dollar Index ticked up 0.1% to 98.38. Yield Check: 2-yr: +9 bps to 1.66% 3-yr: +8 bps to 1.60% 5-yr: +9 bps to 1.57% 10-yr: +8 bps to 1.70% 30-yr: +8 bps to 2.18%News: South China Morning Post reported that Chinese trade negotiators could offer to buy more agricultural products from the United States if the U.S. eases tariffs on imports from China. China is currently suffering from a severe pork shortage, meaning the country may have no choice but to increase its purchases of pork and feed (soybeans) from the U.S. President Trump issued an executive order, enhancing the Treasury Department's ability to sanction terrorist leaders. Bloomberg reported that China's Jilin Transportation Investment Group did not exercise a call option on a perpetual note and will instead pay a higher coupon, which is likely to invite concerns about the cash position of the local government financing vehicle. North Korea fired two projectiles into the East Sea, shortly after a DPRK official indicated that North Korea is ready for another round of talks with U.S. officials. China's August CPI increased 0.7% m/m (expected 0.5%; last 0.4%), rising 2.8% yr/yr (expected 2.6%; last 2.8%). August PPI decreased 0.8% yr/yr (expected -0.9%; last -0.3%).

The company raised EPS guidance to $2.65-2.72 from $2.33-2.47 and revenue to $696-699 mln from $681-688 mln.Q2 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.70 (+8% yr/yr) on revenue of $697.7 mln (+9% yr/yr). The company also raised guidance for fiscal 2020 to $9.08-9.52 from $8.76-9.27 and raised its FY20 guidance revenue guidance to $2.658-2.674 bln form $2.64-2.66 bln. Capital IQ consensus for FY20 calls for EPS of $9.46 (+10.7% yr/yr) on revenue of $2.67 bln (+6.5% yr/yr). Regarding China tariffs, the company said it has renegotiated product costs and selectively raised prices to mitigate the impact of the increase from 10 to 25%. Co is also moving certain production and new product development out of China, plus exploring new partnerships and expanding its own manufacturing facilities in the US. Long term, RH does not believe the current trade climate will impair its ability to achieve stated financial goals. In late August, the company announced that it expects no impact to FY19 or FY20 financial results from the tariffs imposed on current and new product categories imported from China effective September 1st, 2019, October 1st, 2019 and December 15th, 2019.Looking back, the company beat on EPS four out of the last four quarters and best on revenue three out of the last four quarters. Since its core customer base mainly comprises high-end consumers, its business is correlated to how the stock market is performing. From early December through late March, the market experienced sharp volatility as tariff-related headlines wildly swung the indices. During the Q1 earnings call, RH's CEO commented that the Dow plunged 800 points the day after it provided its FY20 guidance. This type of action plays into the psyche and sentiment of consumers who are considering making big-ticket purchases, such as expensive furniture.RH has a $2.7 bln market cap and trades at 16x earnings vs WSM at 14 times earnings.

The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperforms for the second straight day.Today's action has reflected much of yesterday's value trade that benefits underperforming areas of the stock market, most notably the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.8%) and SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.36, +0.93, +2.2%). An upturn in Boeing (BA 366.34, +7.56, +2.1%) and many of the transportation stocks has had a similar effect on the industrials sector (+0.5%).The gains in these areas, however, are coming at the expense of crowded groups like the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.9%), which is the S&P 500's most heavily-weighted sector. The real estate sector (-1.7%), which investors had piled into for its higher dividend yields and low-beta disposition, is today's worst performer.Allowing today's value trade to play out are the improved views on trade and growth, which have helped some money flow out of the Treasury market and drive yields higher. The 2-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.64%, and the 10-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.35.Separately, the market saw a sharp uptick on a report from the South China Morning Post indicating that China is ready to purchase more agricultural products from the U.S. The caveat, though, is that China would want the U.S. to agree to delay tariffs and ease its supply ban on Huawei. Nothing material has transpired, but the report likely triggered some algorithms.Some story stocks today include Wendy's (WEN 19.45, -2.50, -11.4%) and Ford Motor (F 9.28, -0.26, -2.9%).

The shaky start to the week has trimmed the sector's Q3 gain to 2.2%, but the group remains up almost 29.0% for the year, which leaves it well ahead of the remaining ten sectors.Momentum names lagged yesterday, and they are showing relative weakness again today on no news other than the price action itself. To that point, the likes of Synopsys (SNPS 135.61, -5.65, -4.0%), Visa (V 175.35, -6.20, -3.4%), MasterCard (MA 273.42, -9.94, -3.5%), Fiserv (FISV 103.26, -3.42, -3.2%), Global Payments (GPN 165.77, -5.03, -2.9%), and Automatic Data Processing (ADP 162.96, -5.09, -3.0%) show losses between 3.5% and 4.0% after hitting record highs in recent days.Top-weighted sector components have fared a bit better. For instance, Apple (AAPL 213.40, -0.77, -0.4%) is down just 0.4% ahead of an upcoming product reveal while Alphabet (GOOGL 1202.35, -2.93, -0.2%) shows a slimmer loss. Microsoft (MSFT 135.35, -2.15, -1.6%), however, is down more than 1.5%.The technology sector traded beneath its 50-day moving average at today's low point, but it is currently back above that level, which has acted as an area of congestion over the past month.12:02TALKX Market Briefing: Hold the trade deal enthusiasmThe stock market has gotten a nice pop following a South China Morning Post report indicating China is open to agreeing to buy more agricultural products from the U.S. in a lead up to the October trade meeting in Washington. Tucked inside the same article is a qualifier, however, that China would like to do this in exchange for the U.S. dialing back its restrictions on Huawei and delaying the tariff increases it has planned.In other words, it's a familiar page from the trade playbook, only this play hasn't really gained any yardage in the past.The market (or maybe the algorithms) reacted to the headline with a knee-jerk buying effort, but there isn't much of a basis to run with this news as a major breakthrough since it isn't one. That doesn't mean this market can't, or won't, make more out of the headline than it's worth since it has rallied of late on a sense of relief that neither China nor the U.S. seems intent at this juncture on escalating the trade war even further.Still, this shouldn't be construed as a material development.The Russell 2000 is up 0.8%; the Dow Jones industrial Average is flat; the S&P 500 is down 0.5%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.5%.11:51SCANX Stocks that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (49) outpacing new lows (15) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ABG, ACM, ACRE, AMBA, AN, APO, ARCC, ARNC, AY, AYR, BF.B, BRC, BRX, BX, CASH, CCRN, CE, CHH, CIO, CPRX, CY, DCOM, DRRX, GL, GNRC, HTH, HTLD, ITI, ITRI, KIM, KSU, LM, NVMI, NYCB, OKE, PFNX, PSXP, PTGX, SAH, SAIA, SFL, SITC, SSW, STNG, STWD, SUM, SYY, TROW, WUStocks that traded to 52 week lows: BERY, BMRN, ENTA, FVRR, ILMN, LGND, LVGO, LYFT, MMSI, PD, REGN, RUBY, TRXC, VAPO, WMGIThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AGM, ALG, CMBM, IMKTA, NNI, SAR, TIPTThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: ESTA, HSKA, KRTX11:30XERS Xeris Pharmaceuticals receives FDA approval for GVOKE injection for severe hypoglycemia (shares halted) (11.04 +0.10)Xeris Pharmaceuticals has received regulatory approval from the FDA for GVOKE (glucagon) injection, its ready-to-use, room-temperature stable liquid glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in pediatric and adult patients with diabetes ages 2 years and above. GVOKE is the first glucagon product approved that can be administered via a prefilled syringe (GVOKE PFS) or auto-injector (GVOKE HypoPen), reducing the steps to prepare and administer glucagon in the event of severe hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar levels. The FDA's approval is based on positive results from three Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy, safety, and utility of GVOKE in treating severe hypoglycemia when compared with conventional glucagon emergency kits among adults and children with type 1 diabetes.The company is preparing to introduce GVOKE in two different administration options to accommodate the community's preferences, starting with its pre-filled syringe in 4-6 weeks and the auto-injector in 2020.Xeris also has entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and Silicon Valley Bank. The agreement increases the borrowing base from $45 mln to up to $85 mln and extends the maturity date of the debt to as late as June 2024, if the second tranche is drawn.11:30BONDX New SupplyTreasury Auction Preview$38 bln 3-year Treasury note auction (results at 13:00 ET) Prior auction results: High yield: 1.562% Bid-to-cover: 2.41 Indirect bid: 46.7% Direct bid: 19.3% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.407% Bid-to-cover: 2.53 Indirect bid: 46.9% Direct bid: 14.2%11:17SPY Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary of State Pompeo and National Security Advisor Bolton will hold a media briefing at 13:30; topic unknown11:15SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Merit Medical (MMSI) sinks following downgrade -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersENDP (3.72 +21.01%): Continued volatility; the stock recovers yesterday's losses and proceeds to its new highest levels in almost two months.

Revenue is expected to decrease 18.7% yr/yr to $1.34 bln. The company reiterated its FY20 guidance on June 4, priming the market for revenue between $7.46 bln and $7.87 bln. The last three months saw just a handful of noteworthy game releases, which likely presented a headwind to overall store traffic in Q2. There are more big titles scheduled to be released in the fall and in early 2020, which should be a positive for the company's outlook.Shares of GME hit a fresh record low in mid-August amid dimming prospects for a meaningful turnaround. The stock recovered from that low over the past couple weeks, aided by comments from investor Michael Burry, who revealed that his fund owns 3% of outstanding shares of GME. Mr. Burry's view is based on the expectation that the next generation of consoles will not do away with physical Blu-ray drives. While the decision to keep physical drives would be a positive for GME, the company would still need to compete with large retailers like Best Buy (BBY 68.95, -0.27, -0.4%), Target (TGT 107.56, -0.39, -0.4%), and Walmart (WMT 116.02, -0.31, -0.3%) at a time when GME has been closing many of its locations.10:18AAPL Apple September product event previewApple is set to unveil new products today at 13:00 ET. Most of these products will have very incremental upgrades. Most of the attention for shareholders will be placed to the pricing of the company's Apple TV Plus and Apple Arcade services. Apple stock is up 35% year-to-date vs. a 22.5% gain in the Nasdaq 100. The stock remains near the high end of its recent range and less than 10% from its all-time high.iPhones: The company is expected to release three new iPhones. The first iPhone will likely be called the iPhone 11 and will feature a 6.1-inch LCD screen similar to the iPhone XR that is currently on sale. The other two phones will be called the iPhone 11 Pro and will feature organic light-emitting diode displays similar to the iPhone Xs and Xs Max. The iPhone 11 Pro will come in two sizes: 5.8 and 6.5 inches. The phones are expected to feature faster processors and better cameras. However, these phones will likely only have incremental improvements as Apple is expected to unveil its 5G iPhone in 2020. Analysts are expecting pricing similar to prior models between $749-1099.Services: Apple could confirm the pricing for its gaming and TV services and introduce additional content expected for those services. It has been reported by several sources that the gaming service will cost $4.99/month and the TV service will cost $9.99/month. Apple will have to compete with other streaming offerings from Disney (DIS) which will be priced lower.Apple Watch 5: The updated smartwatch is expected to feature a ceramic design, faster processors, and more health features such as sleep tracking.Mac: Apple is expected to introduce a 16-inch Mac Book Pro.iPads: There is some speculation that Apple will update its iPad Pro lineup with faster processors and larger screens. However, some analysts feel the iPad will get its own event in October.Other Products: Apple could introduce Apple "tracking tags" that will allow users to find lost items. Expectations are for another underwhelming iPhone cycle ahead of next year's 5G offering. Analysts note that there is a lot of pent up demand with many older iPhones in the installed base. Therefore, there is an expectation for a super cycle for the 5G handset next year. Still, the investment thesis has shifted from iPhone cycles to a more diversified set of hardware and services. Last quarter, iPhone sales fell to less than 50% of revenue for the first time as the success of services, iPads, AirPods, and the Apple Watch picked up the slack for falling iPhone sales. Apple's earnings are expected to grow 10% next year after falling 2% in fiscal 2019, which concludes this month. With a $943 bln market cap, the stock trades at ~17x earnings, or ~15x, backing out the cash.Suppliers to keep on note include: SSNLF, LPL (for displays) and LITE, FNSR and IIVI (for FaceID.) Other suppliers include: SWKS, CRUS, AVGO, QRVO, TSM, and QCOM, among others.

Patients 02002 and 02006 were treated with higher dose levels of RP-L102. Patients 02004 and 02005 received non-optimized and lower doses of RP-L102. Key highlights of the manuscript include:Follow-up data for the initial four patients 18-30 months post-infusion demonstrate progressively increased engraftment in peripheral blood leukocytes and in the bone marrow following administration of RP-L102 without the use of conditioning. In Patient 02002 at 30 months follow-up, approximately 44% of bone marrow CD34+ cells displayed gene marking, suggesting the engraftment of very primitive corrected hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Sequential increases in gene marking in peripheral blood and in the bone marrow for Patients 02004 and 02005 were also seen, but at more modest levels and after longer durations. The bone marrow resistance to MMC in Patient 02002 increased to 70% at 24 months, approaching the phenotype of a healthy donor.

NfL is a protein that provides structural support to nerve fibres in the brain. An increase in the amount of NfL may be associated with nerve cell damage, and detection of increased NfL levels in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may serve as a biomarker of nerve cell damage.In the Phase III OPERA I study in RMS and the ORATORIO study in PPMS, blood NfL levels were significantly lower after treatment with OCREVUS. In RMS, blood serum NfL levels were reduced by 43 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with a 31 percent reduction with interferon beta-1a (p<0.001). In PPMS, blood plasma NfL levels were reduced by 16 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with 0.2 percent reduction with placebo (p<0.001). Additionally, these analyses showed higher blood NfL levels at the start of the study were correlated with more disability progression in upper and lower limbs in PPMS and overall disability in the interferon beta-1a RMS treatment group at 96 weeks.06:03FTS Fortis announces five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 bln for the period 2020 to 2024, increases quarterly dividend to $0.4775/share from $0.45/share (42.08 )The co announced its five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 billion for the period 2020 to 2024, up $1.0 billion from the prior year's plan.

OS rates at five years were 13.4% for Opdivo and 2.6% for docetaxel. The OS benefit for Opdivo-treated patients was observed across all subgroups.The safety profile for patients treated with Opdivo was consistent with previously reported findings in second-line NSCLC and no new safety signals were seen with extended follow-up. Of patients still on study, only 2 of 70 experienced a new treatment-related select AE between years three and four and there were no new treatment-related select AE's reported between years four and five among the 55 patients still on study.Among patients with an objective response to Opdivo, 32.2% continued to see a response at five years. 0% of patients with an objective response to docetaxel continued to see a response at five years. The median duration of response was 19.9 months for Opdivo-treated patients and 5.6 months for patients treated with docetaxel.06:00ALNY Alnylam Pharma presents new clinical results for Givosiran -- Porphyria attack reductions observed in ENVISION Phase 3 study maintained with ongoing Givosiran dosing in open-label extension study (82.69 )ENVISION Phase 3 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of January 31, 2019, all eligible patients (N=93) from the ENVISION Phase 3 study of givosiran rolled over into the OLE phase of the study. Reduction in the composite porphyria attack rate with givosiran treatment, which had been observed in the ENVISION Phase 3 study as early as one month after dosing, was shown to be sustained with continued dosing in the OLE phase of the study. Sustained reduction in levels of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), an intermediate in the heme biosynthesis pathway believed to be the primary neurotoxic intermediate responsible for causing both porphyria attacks and ongoing symptoms in between attacks, was also observed with continued dosing. Rapid and sustained lowering of attack rate and ALA levels was also observed in placebo patients who crossed over after the six-month double blind phase of the ENVISION Phase 3 study to receive givosiran in the OLE phase of the study. Givosiran's safety profile in the OLE phase has remained consistent with the profile observed in the double blind phase of the ENVISION study.ENVISION Results of Select Patient Reported Outcomes -- A number of patient reported outcomes were collected as secondary and exploratory measures in the ENVISION study. Daily worst pain did not achieve statistical significance based on the prespecified ANCOVA analysis (p equals 0.0530), however, the data were found to not be normally distributed. A post-hoc analysis of daily worst pain was therefore performed using the non-parametric stratified Wilcoxon test. Based on the non-parametric test, patients on givosiran had a significant reduction in daily worst pain (nominal p equals 0.0455). In exploratory analyses, the reductions in pain were accompanied by fewer days of use of both opioid and non-opioid analgesics. Givosiran did not impact daily worst fatigue or daily worst nausea at six months, although these assessments will be repeated at twelve months to explore the effects of longer term dosing. Updated Phase 1/2 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of April 19, 2019, a robust treatment effect was maintained in givosiran-treated patients with continued dosing in the Phase 1/2 OLE study (N=16), with a mean time on treatment of 22.8 months and total time on treatment across the Phase 1 and OLE studies of up to 35 months. Substantial mean reductions in annualized attack rate (AAR) and in annualized hemin use of greater than 90 percent were observed, with evidence for sustained or potentially enhanced clinical activity with continued dosing. Five out of twelve patients (42 percent) who received givosiran during the Phase 1 study and continued with givosiran dosing in the OLE study and two out of four patients (50 percent) who had been in the placebo arm of the Phase 1 study and crossed over to givosiran treatment in the OLE study achieved an AAR of zero for a mean of 18.1 and 24.9 months, respectively.06:00ACN Accenture acquires Pragsis Bidoop; terms not disclosed (194.83 )Pragsis Bidoop, headquartered in Madrid with additional offices in Barcelona and the U.K., will add more than 200 employees with deep machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data engineering experience, along with its portfolio of end-to-end solutions, to Accenture's Applied Intelligence business.06:00ASX ASE Technology reports August net revenues +10.3% yr/yr to $1.28 bln (4.51 )06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets ease back; S&P Futures take out yesterday's lowThe global equity markets are under slight pressure to start the day.

The S&P 500 (-0.01%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) finished near their flat lines.The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%), which is home to many energy and financial stocks, outperformed the broader market.The market entered today on the heels of a two-week rally, with some investors beginning to feel less concerned about growth prospects and trade relations with China. For instance, data has shown the U.S. consumer to be resilient in the face of trade tensions, which could see a reprieve with trade talks coming up next month.This positive sentiment was manifested in the higher oil prices ($57.87/bbl, +$1.42, +2.5%) and the selling in the Treasury market on Monday. In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD16:20IMXI International Money Express announces secondary public offering of 5,217,392 shares of common stock by selling stockholders (13.60 -0.55)Shares will be offered by affiliates of Stella Point Capital and certain of the company's other stockholders.

American Realty Capital Properties, Inc., and Lakewood Capital Partners, LP v. American Realty Capital Properties, Inc., at a cost to the company of approximately $765.5 mln, comprised of a contribution of $738.5 mln toward the Class Action settlement and $27.0 mln toward the Opt Out Action settlements.On September 8, 2019, the company signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) providing for the settlement of the Class Action. The Class Action settlement will resolve the claims by class plaintiffs relating to the disclosures made by the company in October 2014 and March 2015 regarding its financial statements, which included the company's March 2015 restatement of certain of its previously issued financial statements.Pursuant to the terms of the Class Action MOU, certain defendants have agreed to pay in the aggregate $1.025 bln, comprised of contributions from the company's former external manager and its principals totaling $225.0 mln, $12.5 mln from the company's former chief financial officer, $49.0 mln from the company's former auditor, and the balance of $738.5 mln from the company. At the same time, in conjunction with the Class Action settlement, the company entered into an MOU providing for the settlement of the derivative action lawsuit currently pending in the Southern District of New York captioned Witchko v. Schorsch. The Derivative Action settlement will resolve the allegations brought by the derivative plaintiffs and is also subject to completing definitive documentation to be filed with the court. The Derivative Action settlement is subject to court approval and is conditioned on approval of the Class Action settlement.On September 6 and September 9, 2019, the company also entered into settlement agreements and releases to settle the Opt Out Actions for a total of $27.0 mln, which are not subject to court approval. Three additional derivative actions remain pending in courts other than the SDNY.

Additionally, the company has decided to discontinue the development of MRT5201, a liver-targeted treatment for OTC deficiency.The company's decision to discontinue the development of MRT5201 for OTC deficiency is based on data from recently completed preclinical studies that do not support the desired pharmacokinetic and safety profile for advancement of the program. These data are related to the first-generation lipid nanoparticle (LNP) designed to be delivered to the liver via intravenous administration for the OTC deficiency program. As such, this LNP is different than that used in the CF and other pulmonary development programs which are designed to deliver the LNP-encapsulated mRNA through nebulization. Additionally, ongoing discovery efforts have generated promising, novel next-generation LNPs supporting the further development of liver disease mRNA therapeutics with potentially favorable product profiles.The company's prioritization of pulmonary diseases is supported by the previously reported positive single-ascending dose Phase 1/2 data from the CF program, which utilizes its proprietary lung delivery platform. MRT5005 is a first-in-class mRNA therapeutic designed to address the underlying cause of CF regardless of genetic mutation by delivering mRNA encoding fully functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein to cells in the lung through nebulization. The multiple-ascending dose portion of the clinical trial is ongoing with data expected in 2020.16:08CASY Casey's General beats by $0.28, beats on revs; reaffirms guidance (167.30 -2.03)Reports Q1 (Jul) earnings of $2.31 per share, $0.28 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.03; revenues rose 1.5% year/year to $2.63 bln vs the $2.59 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

FIRST LOOK AT TIKTOK'S GAME PLAN; Leaked pitch deck reveals how the app is luring brands. Spoiler alert: There will be gummy bearsAdvertising AgeOctober 14, 2019Print VersionCopyright 2019 Crain Communications All Rights ReservedSection: Pg. 6; Vol. 90Length: 1499 wordsByline: Garett Sloane And Lindsay RittenhouseBodyScene: A close-up of a gummy bear standing alone on a cardboard-box stage singing Adele. "Never mind, I'll find ... " The camera slowly pans out to the audience, revealing a sea of gummy bears. The chorus rings out from the crowd: " ... someone like you."Welcome to TikTok (#haribo, #haribochallenge).Advertisers could be forgiven if they are not quite sure what to make of TikTok, or even what's going on there. Singing gummy bears? But the Chinese-based video app is trying its best to teach brands the fundamentals of the platform. A leaked pitch deck obtained by Ad Age shows that the company's priority is simply to explain how the app works. "TikTok enables everyone to be a creator," the pitch says, "and encourages users to share their passion and personal creative expression through their videos." (So long as the expression isn't political; the platform recently banned such advertising.)The sales presentation, which was circulated to agencies, provides a rare comprehensive look into the rising social-media company, which has been guarded about publicly disclosing key details about its community, including its size. Until now, the only number that has been revealed about the size of TikTok's user base is that the app has been downloaded more than a billion times. But that number doesn't suggest how many people visit the app on a regular basis. The pitch deck does: There are 30 million-plus monthly active users in the U.S., it says.To put that into perspective, Snapchat has 83 million daily active users in North America, according to its second-quarter financial report.What TikTok lacks in reach, it makes up for in its relevance with young viewers. According to the pitch deck, 69 percent of users are between the ages of 16 and 24, making it enticing for brands searching for cultural relevance with that young audience. "If I was working for GE or Allstate or AT&T, I wouldn't recommend advertising on the platform," says Benjamin Stops, strategist at Rauxa, a full-service agency recently acquired by Publicis Groupe. "But if you're Taco Bell, Burger King or Adidas, there's an opportunity there."TikTok did not respond to a request for comment.Brands lining upThe pitch deck says TikTok now offers five ad products: the hashtag challenge, a brand takeover, in-feed video, branded lenses and a "top-view" video. The campaigns can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a day, according to the pitch deck. A hashtag challenge, for instance, starts at $150,000 a day, the deck says.The gummy bear meme was the first example in the ad presentation to demonstrate how branded videos can inspire users to participate. In this case, TikTok creators made copycat videos using the same Adele song and same comedic format. Other videos featured a rubber ducky and a goldfish performing the song."We don't spark trends, we set them on fire," TikTok says in the presentation.While marketers don't always intuitively understand the language of new online platforms-they have had a hard time grasping the popularity of Snapchat for years-they know they want to be a part of it. So brands are lining up to work with TikTok: Guess Jeans linked with the app last year with the hashtag challenge "in my denim" that invited people to show off their jeans in videos. Walmart promoted a "savings shuffle" hashtag challenge with TikTok last month. The National Football League has a TikTok account, as does its star quarterback Tom Brady and many other players.The pitch deck gives brands an idea of what kind of performance they can expect from campaigns on the app. Guess Jeans, for instance, generated 10.4 million views from 6,000 people making videos with its hashtag. Universal Pictures promoted a hashtag for the movie "The House With a Clock in its Walls," generating 20,000 videos with "millions of views," the deck says. In that campaign, Universal worked with TikTok "influencers," internet stars who can lend their followings to brands.One advertising executive with a top entertainment studio, who spoke on condition of anonymity, says that TikTok is getting expensive for advertisers. "It would be better if it cost about half as much," the ad exec says. "But TikTok looks like they want to make some money. They've built the user base and now want to make money from it."The sales pitch provides a detailed road map for how TikTok plans to do that, too. There are the five ad formats, including the latest one, the "top-view" video, which takes over the whole screen. It's a "high-impact video ad unit," the deck says. "The first that the users see."The deck also shows how TikTok plans to build up its ad technology so that advertisers can automate their campaigns with the ability to target and measure them. TikTok is just now developing what it calls in the deck "interest-based" targeting, which serves ads to audiences based on their behavioral characteristics. The pitch deck uses an example of identifying people based on preferences and personalities learned from their activity on the app.TikTok is powered by technology developed by its Chinese parent company ByteDance, "all fed by key first-party behavioral cues on the platform," the pitch deck says.Most of TikTok's users are, in fact, Chinese. The deck says 500 million of the 800 million monthly active users worldwide are in China. Of the 30 million-plus U.S. users, however, the company gives a sense of how often they use the app. Americans open the app eight times a day, spending 46 minutes a day there, the deck claims. There are 37 billion U.S. video views a month, the deck says.Again, for perspective, Snapchat claims 10 billion video views a day, which adds up to around 300 billion a month.Counting the risksTikTok might be starting to catch on with brands, but there is still a lot of uncertainty around the platform. The app presents many of the same challenges of working with other social media networks. Advertisers are concerned about the accuracy of measuring videos and ensuring that followers are human, not bots."Just because something is starting to gain traction doesn't mean brands should leap at the chance to advertise on the platform," says Rauxa's Stops.TikTok is positioning itself as a platform for creators, a place where advertisers can piggyback on the fan base of popular users like they do on Instagram, YouTube and Snapchat, says Gil Eyal, CEO of HYPR, an influencer marketing platform. "One of the challenges brands will face is defining which metrics define success, because not many are available," Eyal says.Advertisers can see how many people use a hashtag and view their videos, but the question is how much is that worth in terms of sneaker and ticket sales?Also, there are brand safety considerations when dealing with TikTok. Since it is a Chinese company, U.S. brands might have to think about how working with the app could reflect on them. Just look what happened to the National Basketball Association after its recent missteps with China.An NBA executive tweeted support for the protesters in Hong Kong fighting the Chinese government, and now the league is engulfed in controversy in China where billions of dollars are at stake. Following the airing of a new episode that poked fun at Chinese censorship, the adult animated series "South Park" also was recently banned in the Communist country.TikTok is very much entangled in politics, no matter how much the app tries to avoid sensitive subjects. For instance, TikTok has been criticized for censoring videos about the Hong Kong protests, and there are concerns about how it will handle political subjects in the future.After recent reports that it stifled certain political subjects, TikTok reiterated its policy banning political ads. That was part of a broader policy to keep the app focused on more lighthearted subjects, like lip-syncing gummy bears, and away from hot- button issues. ?Brands seem to be OK with that position, for now. "It's not something we've been concerned about," says one ad executive who works closely with TikTok but spoke on condition of anonymity. "But maybe it is something we need to watch. It should be on our radar more.""This is a Chinese company collecting a great deal of information on young people around the world," says another ad agency executive, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. "It's something senior-level marketers are aware of and wary of."TikTok is making moves to become a bigger player on Madison Avenue by building out its ad team, which is based in Los Angeles. And a recent job posting on LinkedIn shows that TikTok wants help shaping the brand for American audiences; the company is in the market for a brand strategist. "We are looking for an innovative brand strategy manager to build and define TikTok's new image," the job listing says.The company also recently hired U.S.-based agencies Omnicom Group's PHD and independent shop RPA to handle the majority of its media and creative accounts, respectively. Neither would provide comment.Load-Date: October 17, 2019End of Document

US Cos. May Be Allowed To Sell Non-sensitive Goods To Huawei: ReportRTT News (United States)October 10, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 RTT News All Rights ReservedLength: 374 wordsByline: editorial@rttnews.com,  (RTT Staff Writer)Body       The U.S. government plans to soon issue licenses that will enable some American companies to supply non-sensitive goods to Chinese telecom giant Huawei, the New York Times reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  Huawei is the world's largest telecom equipment maker. The move by the Trump administration comes as the U.S. and China are set to resume their next round of high-level trade talks this week and could ease tensions between the two countries, according to the NYT report. A Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier Liu He is currently in Washington, DC for the trade talks. The Trump administration blacklisted Huawei in early May on national security grounds. The ban was primarily aimed at keeping equipment made by the Chinese company out of the next generation of wireless network, 5G. Huawei and another Chinese company ZTE are now major players in the 5G market as they manufacture and sell telecom equipment for 5G networks at competitive prices. The U.S. has serious concerns about the security risks posed by Chinese technology companies, including Huawei and ZTE. Intelligence agencies are concerned that Huawei and other Chinese companies may be beholden to the Chinese government or the ruling Communist Party, raising the risk of espionage. The blacklisting made it difficult for Huawei to sell products for which it relied on parts from U.S. suppliers.  However, the Trump administration later temporarily eased the restrictions on Huawei, allowing it to do business with American companies for three months. The move was aimed at helping support existing Huawei networks and devices around the world. At the G-20 summit in June, President Donald Trump said he would allow American companies to sell their products to Huawei that do not pose national security concerns. However, the New York Times reported that no licenses have since been issued, possibly indicating that the Trump administration was withholding them as leverage in trade talks. The ongoing trade war has dragged on for more than a year now.

All Rights ReservedLength: 1953 wordsByline: Timothy McLaughlinBodyHONG KONG-When reports of a possible law banning face masks at protests first surfaced this month, chat groups and online messaging boards popular with demonstrators lit up in fury over what seemed to be yet another (ultimately unsuccessful) attempt to quell unrest here.Attention quickly turned to a snippet of a by-election debate from 2016, specifically to the words of a young man standing with other hopefuls on a U-shaped stage, his bright-blue hoodie and khakis a marked sartorial departure from the formal attire of his older rivals. In the debate, Edward Leung, his right hand gripping a microphone and his left jabbing the air with an outstretched index finger, unleashed a tirade that three years later looks uncannily prescient."Ukraine passed the anti-mask law a few years ago. Do you know what happened to Ukraine after that?" Leung asked. "It resulted in a revolution. If you want to play this game, by all means, do it. I am all for that." The two candidates receiving the brunt of Leung's verbal lashing looked bowled over. "If you want to restrict our freedom of assembly, go do it. Let's see what Hong Kongers, what all of us, will do to you."When Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's leader, confirmed the rumors of the mask ban, days of spontaneous peaceful rallies, as well as some violent demonstrations, ensued across the city. Dozens were left injured after clashes between protesters and police, including a 14-year-old boy shot by an undercover officer, who was as a result left bloodied by demonstrators and attacked with petrol bombs.[           Read: From Asia's finest to Hong Kong's most hated]The developments have only served to reinforce the idea, particularly among younger, frontline protesters, that Leung is the spiritual guide of this otherwise leaderless movement. It is a status he has won despite-or perhaps because of-his incarceration: Leung, who has offered little commentary on these protests, which are now in their fifth month, is serving a six-year sentence for his part in demonstrations that turned violent in 2016.It is Leung's 2016 election slogan, "Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times," that            rings outtoday, one of the several chants that are now mantras for those who have taken to the streets. The phrase (or similar            translations of it) is printed on            flags and            banners and            spray-painted on walls. Detained protesters have looked into            TV cameras and            mouthed the words as they are taken away by the police. A            video game that pits protesters against police uses the slogan as a title. Leung's supporters, some of whom speak about him in hagiographic terms, say he foresaw the direction that Hong Kong would take as Beijing sought to wield greater influence here. This month, hundreds gathered outside a Hong Kong court for Leung's appeal hearing, waiting for hours to catch a glimpse of him and briefly blocking the van transporting him back to prison.Cast even by traditional pro-democracy champions here as radical just a few years ago, Leung's prognostications about the rapid erosion of Hong Kong's rights look to have been correct. The more confrontational, sometimes violent, means that Leung and Hong Kong Indigenous, the            pro-independence political party of which he was a member, advocated in countering encroachment from mainland China are consequently gaining mainstream approval. As protesters have            ramped up tactics, vandalizing businesses owned by mainland Chinese and tossing petrol bombs at police seen as loyal to Beijing, people are generally accepting of the violence, leveling blame at the            authorities for the escalation. Leung's willingness to risk arrest was once seen as extreme. Now many hard-core demonstrators no longer fear police tear gas, nor does the threat of arrest deter them-more than 2,700 protesters have been arrested since June-while the most fervent openly speak of the possibility of dying in the streets. "Edward Leung and Hong Kong Indigenous planted a seed in Hong Kong politics, and now it has started to grow," Ray Wong, who founded the party in 2015, told me. "It really took some time for those Hong Kongers, for those peaceful protesters, to understand why we took this approach."[           Read: Hong Kong's new reality]Leung is an unlikely oracle, having described himself in much less flattering terms than his supporters do today, often saying he was a loser, a nobody. The 28-year-old studied philosophy at Hong Kong University, where he was an intensely competitive lacrosse player and served as a residency-hall leader. In            Lost in the Fumes, a 2017 documentary about Leung, he spoke about feeling lost at the time, having failed to graduate or get a job, at times locking himself away in his room. Then, in September 2014, he joined the Umbrella Movement protests, finding camaraderie and direction among his fellow protesters. "It seemed suddenly my life was meaningful," Leung said in the film.Wong, 26, also participated in those protests, but over the course of the 79-day occupation grew disillusioned. When the protests ended, he founded Hong Kong Indigenous, a party championing "self-defense, more radical means of protest, and ... our unique identity as Hong Kongers," he told me. It fell into the "localist" movement, a group of political parties and activist groups holding a spectrum of ideas on Hong Kong's autonomy. The beliefs of some of these groups have at times veered into the xenophobic, with members demeaning mainland visitors as locusts invading Hong Kong.In the past, Leung has described his idea of localism as rooted in the safeguarding of a            Hong Kong identity distinct from that of            mainland China, to "preserve our own narrative on the past, present, and future of Hong Kong." This idea, of keeping Hong Kong from becoming just another Chinese city, protecting it from Beijing's control, has come to drive the current protests.            Polling from the Chinese University of Hong Kong in October showed that the number of people identifying as localists has more than doubled since March. Yet it is the most radical of Leung's beliefs, one that still remains fringe, for which he is most notorious: advocating for            independence. "It might be very unrealistic; it might be nearly impossible," he said, "but in terms of politics, in terms of rational calculation, independence is the only way to leave this authoritarian regime," a reference to the Chinese government.[           Read: Hong Kong's protesters are outfoxing Beijing worldwide]When Wong met Leung after the            Umbrella Movement ended, Leung was again struggling, even contemplating suicide. Then, in July 2015, Leung took the stage at an annual protest and delivered a speech that, Wong recalled, "impressed all of our members." Hong Kong Indigenous, which had focused on street-level activism that included haranguing mainland tourists and sometimes violent protests targeting small-scale day traders from China, made the decision to formally enter mainstream politics by contesting elections.The party's positions, as well as its youthful and at times boisterous members, put it at odds not just with pro-Beijing politicians. It also clashed with the traditional pro-democracy camp, who it felt was overly willing to compromise and did not take sufficient action. The feelings of dislike and distrust went both ways."I thought he was arrogant, full of himself," the pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo said of her first impressions of Leung. Her feelings, she told me, softened over time, and she has visited Leung in prison on multiple occasions, most recently in September. This summer, after protesters            stormed the building housing Hong Kong's legislative assembly, lawmakers were given a tour to see the damage. Inside, Mo said, was a spray-painted message calling for Leung's release. "I knew then he had become an icon," she said.Leung's fame rose precipitously during Chinese New Year in February 2016. In the cramped, hectic Mong Kok neighborhood, officials tried to crack down on unlicensed street sellers who for decades have hawked food like fish balls and egg waffles. The threat to            a deeply rooted Hong Kong tradition was exactly the sort of cultural erosion Leung had warned of. Hong Kong Indigenous rallied around the sellers, putting the call out online for their supporters to take to the streets to protect them. During the ensuing standoff with police, Leung commanded the crowd through a megaphone. As the night wore on, protesters and police continued to jostle, before erupting into clashes. Warning shots were fired, and though the violence looks subdued compared with recent protests, it was at the time some of the worst unrest in post-colonial Hong Kong.Leung was arrested along with dozens of others. While he gained a new level of celebrity, he later described the days as "like hell." He was charged with multiple counts of rioting and assaulting a police officer. Less than three weeks later, voters cast their ballots in the New Territories East by-election, during which Leung had unleashed the debate tirade. He finished third, but captured more than            15 percent of the vote, a remarkably strong showing for a political newcomer. Alvin Yeung, a pro-democracy lawmaker who won the election, told me that while he disagreed with Leung's politics, he found him to be strong competition, and nodded to his prescience. "People dig out what he said three years ago-against a brutal government, against the anti-mask law-and people think, Hey, he foresaw everything,'" Yeung said.Leung was later barred from contesting subsequent elections that year-officials cited his support for Hong Kong's independence as their reasoning. By then, Leung had disavowed that position, but it was too late. He was among a rash of invalidated nominees, and threw his support behind another young localist candidate who was later himself expelled from the legislature. Leung then left Hong Kong for the United States in 2017 to study at Harvard University.The following year, Leung admitted to assaulting an officer and apologized. Having returned to Hong Kong, he was            sentenced to six years in prison, a sentence widely decried as            overly harsh. Wong, who also faced charges over the Mong Kok unrest, skipped bail and fled to Germany, where he was            granted asylum. (Even from jail, Leung has frustrated election officials, who this month            questioned candidates running in next month's local elections, asking them to explain their understanding of his slogan after they posted it on social media.)Leung's only public comments on the current set of protests came in July, when a letter addressing the movement was posted            on social media. He wrote that he tried to keep up with the news from prison, but that the reports left him "filled with sorrow and pain." He urged protesters to avoid being driven by rage: "I earnestly call on you not to be dominated by hatred-one should always stay vigilant and keep thinking when in peril," he wrote.Wong, for his part, has watched the protests play out from afar. This summer, a friend recorded a crowd shouting Leung's slogan and sent it to him. "The first time I heard it, I cried immediately. I didn't expect that this slogan would be chanted again," he told me. "Before [Leung] was sent to prison, he had quite a lot of doubts as to whether he did something wrong or good for society."I think now when he sees people chanting this slogan and people kind of worshipping him," Wong continued, "he would feel better."Load-Date: November 5, 2019End of Document

Dow Futures are Up; Zuckerberg on Capitol Hill; Bank Reserve Shortage; Rise of Credit Unions;MORNINGS WITH MARIA MORNINGS WITH MARIA 6:00 AM ESTSeptember 20, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; InternationalLength: 7725 wordsByline: Lauren Simonetti, Cheryl Casone, Maria Bartiromo, Dagen McDowellGuests: Matt Schlapp, Alex Sanchez, Stephen Moore, Hugo GurdonBodyMARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR: In milliseconds and you can do that with thousands -- millions of people so that the computer keeps getting smarter and smarter and smarter.How much smarter do we want these computers to get? When you look out 50 years, 80 years, it's going to mean a different society.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN ANCHOR: Absolutely. And, Maria, as we all think about our own jobs and being replaced one day --BARTIROMO: Yes.SIMONETTI: If you're not doing science or engineering or -- or math, how do you prepare for a future when robots are in charge?BARTIROMO: Well, right now we're seeing the adoption of AI throughout corporate America. That's about to ramp up in a big way. And also ramping up is this new retraining program that's going on.I just have a new report from MIT, a report from IBM and a new report from PWC, and basically what they all agree on is that there's an incredible number of companies right now that are doing retraining. Amazon is going to be retraining an enormous amount of people to get them ready for the new -- this new age. So you are going to see people try to arm themselves with the right information to thrive in this environment, but no doubt about it, this is going to be changing our economy in the coming years. So I'm excited about this special.CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR: Maria, you thought -- I'm excited because I've been talking about this for a few days and I know you talked to some of the biggest heavy hitters in the industry. Can't wait to see it and I can't wait to see "MORNINGS WITH MARIA," which, obviously, is starting right now. Maria, have a great show. We'll see you soon.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much.This special will debut Sunday night at Fox News at 8:00.And this morning we are gearing up for another big news day. Thank you so much, ladies.Good morning, everyone, I'm Maria Bartiromo, coming to you live this morning from Washington. It is Friday, September 20, 2019.Your top stories right now, 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Mark Zuckerberg taking Washington. The FaceBook CEO met with President Trump and some lawmakers yesterday and he's headed back to The Hill today as he faces calls to sell Instagram and WhatsApp.Meanwhile, it is back to the negotiating table on China trade. Deputy-level resume -- deputy-level meetings resume today in Washington. This as President Trump prepares more tariff exemptions, exemptions on select goods from China to help with holiday shopping. Is there music in the air, as Larry Kudlow said yesterday?Futures are looking to end the week on a high note. Take a look. The Dow and the S&P 500 each just about less than a percent away from their all- time highs. We've got a rally underway this morning. The Dow Industrials up 57, the Nasdaq up 21.And the new iPhone goes on sale today. People are already lining up across the world. We are going to get you the latest on that new phone.MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.And we have a big show this morning, live from Washington, D.C.Joining the conversation this morning, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell is in New York. Here in D.C., the American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp. Also joining us shortly is the former "Wall Street Journal" editorial board member, the author of "Trumponomics," Stephen Moore, will be here.Great to see you this morning.MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION: Great to be here.BARTIROMO: Yes, Dagen, how about this new news this morning that the president is going to put more products on the exempt list? I wonder if this does mean, in fact, what Larry Kudlow told us yesterday, and that is that there's music in the air. Maybe we can expect some kind of agreement in the next couple of weeks when these China talks deepen.MCDOWELL: It's a show of good will and it will certainly help going into the holiday shopping season, ease up the pressure on some U.S. companies that import a lot of consumer goods from the United States.But, again, you've got to give a little to get a lot. And I think that that's part of it. It's as these talks really ramp up in the next several weeks.BARTIROMO: Yes, we've got minister-level meetings yesterday, today. And then, of course, the big meetings happen in early October.Matt, how do you see all this?SCHLAPP: You know, I think the Chinese government is finally realizing that Donald Trump is not going to buckle on some of the basic questions. I think for a while also they thought he was politically weak and that they'd be dealing with a different president. Now they're looking across the table and potentially seeing Elizabeth Warren and I think they're saying, maybe it's time to cut a deal. So I'm not -- I wouldn't say I'm optimistic, but I do see a shift in the dynamics from my point of view.BARTIROMO: We've got -- we've got so much to talk about this morning, from an economic standpoint, as well as foreign policy.Also on deck this morning, former Defense Secretary, CIA Director and White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta with us this morning, along with U.S. Treasury Department Public Affairs Assistant Secretary Monica Crowley back with us today. Assistant to the president for trade and manufacturing policy, Peter Navarro, will give us update there. And then we are talking with Mark Mobius. He is the Mobius Capital Partners founding partner. Mark Mobius is going to talk to us about global investing. And 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is here as well.We've got a big show coming up.I want to talk markets with Mark Mobius because I want to see what went on with that repo story this week.Dagen, you've been all over it in terms of the Federal Reserve stepping in two straight days?MCDOWELL: Yes, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and I think it's another intervention is expected today.BARTIROMO: Three days.MCDOWELL: So there's basically funding problems in the money markets, in the -- in the repurchase market.And what has gone on -- and I want to say this very clearly, President Trump has been right in terms of the Federal Reserve and how it's been managing its balance sheet. What happened was, it seems like the Fed misjudged how much spare capacity or liquidity was out there in reserves because, again, money -- the money supply -- or the liquidity got too tight. The Fed thought there was about $200 billion to $300 billion in reserves before overnight funding problems would appear. They misjudged that. So now the Fed is looking at growing its balance sheet once again. They're going to look at this.This is a story that's in "The Wall Street Journal" today. But they're going to look at growing the balance sheet.This is not going to be quantitative easing. It's not to basically juice the economy. But they're going to resume the balance sheet growth at the October meeting potentially. That's what they're going to be discussing.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: Because, again, money got too tight.BARTIROMO: All right.MCDOWELL: The federal government is borrowing a great deal of money, so selling treasuries, and then you had the buyer of the Federal Reserve shrinking how much it was buying. I think the balance sheet's about $3.8 billion right now.BARTIROMO: The fed's balance sheet.MCDOWELL: Yes.BRZEZINSKI: Trillion.MCDOWELL: Trillion. Thank you.BARTIROMO: $3.8 trillion on the fed's balance sheet. Absolutely.MCDOWELL: It's 6:06 in the morning.BARTIROMO: Look, we want to -- we want to talk -- of course. It's we -- look, everybody knew what you meant, obviously.We've got Mark Zuckerberg back on Capitol Hill, meanwhile, the FaceBook founder and CEO meeting with lawmakers again today after several meetings yesterday, including one with President Trump. Here's the picture. Zuckerberg on the receiving end of some harsh criticism. Missouri Senator Josh Hawley told Zuckerberg, if he was serious about reform, he would sell FaceBook properties, like Instagram and WhatsApp. Senator Hawley said that Zuckerberg was not receptive to those suggestions at all.What did you think from yesterday's meeting, Matt?SCHLAPP: I love Josh Hawley.BARTIROMO: Yes.SCHLAPP: He's one senator --BARTIROMO: He's got his own bill on privacy.SCHLAPP: That -- one senator can make a big difference. And I think what's happening with Amazon, what's happening with FaceBook is, as an alternative seems to pops up, they simply buy them. So, really, if you're -- if you're someone who needs to be on a social media platform, you know, you find yourself -- you're try to avoid a certain company with their policies because they hate you and they shame you and they take down your messages and you go somewhere else and then that gets bought up by the same company. It's a big problem.BARTIROMO: Well, listen, you're mentioning two separate issues here because you -- you're talking about Zuckerberg on The Hill saying, oh, well, maybe we need some modest regulation on privacy.SCHLAPP: Yes.BARTIROMO: You're talking about the censorship of conservatives, which is also an issue. I don't know what he said about that. But we know Devin Nunes is suing Twitter. We know that Tulsi Gabbard, who will be here today, is suing Google.SCHLAPP: But I do think it's all around the same problem, which is, a couple of hands in this country, whether you're talking Amazon or FaceBook or Google, they control -- and you just talked about AI in the previous segment -- they control more and more of our lives in ways we don't even understand it. Maybe it's legal, but every American ought to understand fully how much of their privacy, information they think is private, is in the hands of a couple of tech zillionaires.BARTIROMO: It's very important.SCHLAPP: Yes.BARTIROMO: You make a really important point.MCDOWELL: But what --BARTIROMO: And it was Dagen McDowell, years ago -- I feel like it was five years ago, Dagen, when you came out and said, these companies have to start policing themselves because if they don't they are going to see a different fate coming out of Washington. We talked about this so long ago. It's all coming to a head now.MCDOWELL: Right. And now Mark Zuckerberg is in D.C. smooching cheeks and trying to make nice-nice.They were -- he was -- one thing he was trying to explain is how they are complying with the $5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, which had made -- inked recently over privacy missteps.There are a couple lawmakers who cut out of town and didn't meet with Mark Zuckerberg, which, again, what are you in D.C. doing if you're an elected official? I just want to call them out. Jerry Moran, the senator from Kansas. He caught an early flight home instead rather than meeting with Zuckerberg. It's important because he heads the Senate Consumer Protection Subcommittee. And then Brian Schatz, senator from Hawaii, head of -- the top Democrat on the Senate's Technology an Internet Subcommittee, also was supposed to meet with him, didn't, although he did recently meet with Mark Zuckerberg in Honolulu in the senator's office there.But when the head of FaceBook, which is a -- this is a grave concern, this company's behavior, shows up in D.C., try to be there.BARTIROMO: Yes, yes, for sure.Well, we'll see what comes out of this.Do you think -- I mean even conservatives say we need boundaries for these social media companies.SCHLAPP: Yes, absolutely.BARTIROMO: And we need some regulatory boundaries out there. You usually don't hear, you know, conservatives want small government.SCHLAPP: This is what I -- this is what's crazy about many of these, like I said, tech zillionaires, whatever you want to call them, these masters of the universe.BARTIROMO: Yes.SCHLAPP: They -- they -- they -- they're hostile to Republicans, but at the end of the day, all the Democrats, including Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, they want to eviscerate them.BARTIROMO: Yes. I think so.SCHLAPP: Republicans are their only friends because we're deregulatory. We don't just turn to anti-trust immediately. But they've done everything they could politically to alienate us.BARTIROMO: Well, (INAUDIBLE), yes.SCHLAPP: If you have traditional views, if you're -- if you have pro-life views, if you have any view that's pro-Trump, you have had something taken down. You have been a victim of their censorship.And I know it's not government censorship, but it's still appalling in a Democracy to run your company this way and shut people down.BARTIROMO: Well, we'll see about that. We're going to talk about that this morning because the meetings are continuing. Zuckerberg's going to be meeting with more congressman today.Coming up, no deal yet. General Motors and the United Autoworkers Union still at odds. What GM has put on the table. That's next. What are unions saying about that?Then, Lexus luxury on the high seas. Check this out. We're going to take a look at Lexus' new yacht, coming up right after this.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.A state of emergency in Texas this morning as Imelda batters the state with catastrophic flash flooding.Cheryl Casone with all the headlines right now.Cheryl.CASONE: Yes, Maria, at least two people are confirmed dead, including a teenager who was electrocuted while he was trying to save his horse. Hundreds of car abandoned in Houston as floods from Imelda made roads impassable.You can see police using a rope to save a stranded family as well. The video, again, just incredible. Two young children were wearing their life vests. Officers waded through waist-deep waters. There's that video that we're showing you right now. Look at this. These poor children being rescued by those hero police.More than 600 flights have been canceled so far. More bad weather is on the way for the entire region. The National Hurricane Center says Lorena is now a hurricane. Now, Lorena is going to be bearing down on Mexico's Baja, California, peninsula. So another portion about to get hit with strong weather.Another headline this morning for you. the FDA has launched a criminal probe as we learn an eighth person has died from a vaping-related illness. The agency is now focusing on black market e-cigarette products.And a shocking new update from the CDC. There are now 530 confirmed and probable cases of vaping-related illnesses. That's up from 380 cases just a week ago.Well, we're learning more about GM's contract proposal to the United Autoworkers as the union's strike enters its fifth day. according to the "Detroit Free Press," GM is promising 5,400 jobs, half of them new, and a $7 billion investment in U.S. plants. But the pain from the strike is spreading as GM's suppliers are starting to lay off workers. "The Detroit Free Press" says that the list includes names like Nexteer Automotive, Lear Seating, and Automotive Component Carrier, Maria.And those are your headlines from here in New York. Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thanks so much.We will take a short break. When we come back, dipping into the reserves. Details behind the New York Federal Reserve's move to pump billions of dollars in money markets. What it means for you.Then Uber almost worthless. Oracle founder Larry Ellison with some harsh words for Uber. Wait until you hear this. All that when we come right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.A shortage of bank reserves this week causing the overnight repo rate to spike as high as 10 percent, leading the New York Federal Reserve to take action.Joining us right now is Florida Bankers Association President and CEO Alex Sanchez.And, Alex, great to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.ALEX SANCHEZ, PRESIDENT, FLORIDA BANKERS ASSOCIATION: Thanks for having me on, Maria.BARTIROMO: Yes.Dagen explained it earlier, but give us your take on what happened this week when rates went from 2 percent to 10 percent and the Fed had to step in and provide liquidity.SANCHEZ: Well, you know, Maria, look, I think this is an opportunity for the Fed to look at the liquidity rules that the banks have, that they have to hold a certain amount of liquidity over a 30-day period.But the banking industry is doing super great right now. Because of the great economy that we have in our nation, loan demand is high. So banks have a lot of loans out there because the demand is so high.Tax payments were due on Monday. Treasuries matured on Monday as well. So I think this is something the Fed has to monitor ongoing, and, obviously, we don't want to have any shortfalls into the future, especially if and when times get tougher down the road. So I think that will really become a more important issue then.BARTIROMO: So you think that the banking sector is real strong. That's what Steve Schwartzman said. We're going to hear from him in a minute. But credit unions purchasing 21 U.S. banks since 2018 according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.You want new legislation on credit union.SANCHEZ: That's right, Maria. Look, we need to end this charade. When Congress enacted the Credit Union Act in 1936, it was for the St. Mary's Catholic Church Credit Union, not a $100 billion financial institution, like Navy Federal that hides behind the military veil and they pay no state and federal corporate income taxes. And they're competing.You know, right now the -- they're competing against our banks. And right now -- especially our community banks. And, you know, that sector of our industry, the community banks, those ones who provide 50 percent of the small business loans in our country. So right now our country, through our tax policy, is picking winners and losers by exempting one sector of the credit unions and not the other.Now, for credit unions --BARTIROMO: Yes.SANCHEZ: What we're proposing to Congress, Maria, would exempt over 90 percent of the credit unions so they could keep their tax loophole. But these big ones, the charade needs to end.Look, you've got Golden One in California, a $10 billion credit union, paying $120 million to have the naming right of the Sacramento Kings new NBA arena.STEPHEN MOORE: That's amazing.SANCHEZ: That's not what a non-for-profit is supposed to be doing.BARTIROMO: Wow. Yes --MOORE: We tried. We tried to get rid of that in the tax bill, by the way, that loophole.SANCHEZ: Right. Exactly.MOORE: And we just ran in -- Maria, we just ran into a buzz saw network (ph). They have a powerful lobby in Washington, the credit unions.SANCHEZ: They do, but I think, you know, we face a trillion dollar budget shortfall this year. No need to talk about our national debt. You cannot have Navy Federal at $110 billion be tax exempt and pay no taxes at all. They to me says -- and they know it, Maria. They know their day is coming.BARTIROMO: How'd they -- how'd they -- how'd they get away with it?MOORE: It's -- they -- as you said, how long has this been going on? For decades now.SANCHEZ: Oh, since 1936.MOORE: And they -- they have a powerful lobby in Washington that protects that tax loophole.SANCHEZ: Right.MOORE: We made a run at it, but we just couldn't crack through it.BARTIROMO: Wow.SANCHEZ: And I want to emphasize, Maria, leave 90 percent of them alone. Leave the Tampa Longshoreman's Credit Union at the Port of Tampa alone. They are a real credit union. But these other ones, they're not.BARTIROMO: All right, let me switch gears and ask you really about the health of the banking system and what it means for the economy because back in 2006 and 2007 we saw the cracks before the largest selloff and upset for -- in a generation in the financial crisis through the banks and what they were selling. Today, even though if people are talking about a slowdown, potential recession beyond 2020, the banking sector apparently is quite strong given the capital levels.Steven Schwartzman was here earlier this week, the chairman and CEO of Blackstone Group. Here's what he had to say about the health of the U.S. banks right now.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEVEN SCHWARTZMAN, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, BLACKSTONE GROUP: The financial system is in good shape. The banking system in the United States is the best in the world. You know, I -- I almost feel guilty saying things -- somethings actually the best.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: How do you see? Is that just the large banks or do you see that throughout the banking sector?SANCHEZ: I think we're -- across the industry, Maria, regionals, community banks and our larger banks, you know, the stress testing that our larger banks get from the fed every year, under the worst of economic conditions, and they have passed that with, you know, capital in hand, I think puts the U.S. as the strongest banking system in the our -- in the world right now really. Now question about it.SCHLAPP: Alex, but looking at the next year big election year --SANCHEZ: Right.SCHLAPP: You hear the rhetoric coming out of too big, we have to break them up, we have to change our policies. You know, Washington does a lot to screw up the financial health of institutions like banks.When you look forward to next year, do you like what you're hearing from some of these Democrats running for president?SANCHEZ: You know, Matt, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, you know, they -- they -- I don't know that they understand the economy. But -- but I've got to tell you, Matt, the day that our largest corporations, Matt and Maria, have to go to the Bank of China for credit is the day this country's going to be in trouble. So we need --BARTIROMO: What are you talking about, they own all of our debt.SANCHEZ: Right. We need strong --BARTIROMO: Aren't we there?SANCHEZ: A strong banking sector at the large bank arena, also at our regional level and, of course, our community banks. So I think that breaking up any large corporation in a free enterprise system is not the right way to go.BARTIROMO: Alex, you are from Florida. You live in Florida, right, obviously.SANCHEZ: Yes. Yes.BARTIROMO: You are seeing this mass exodus from high state --SANCHEZ: Right.BARTIROMO: High-tax states, rather --SANCHEZ: Right.BARTIROMO: Like New York, California. They want to go to Florida. We just saw that two weeks ago with Carl Icahn. He's taking his hedge fund.SANCHEZ: Right.BARTIROMO: He's moving to Miami.SANCHEZ: Right.BARTIROMO: Can you characterize it, what are you seeing?SANCHEZ: Well, you know, I know Governor Cuomo blamed Florida for the budget shortfall earlier this year.BARTIROMO: That's right.SANCHEZ: And, you know --BARTIROMO: Florida busted the budget in New York.SANCHEZ: Our governors, Governor Bush, Governor Rick Scott, and now Governor DeSantis, are working very hard in going to these high-tax, high- regulated states to give our story.Maria, right now we have 900 people a day moving to Florida. It's amazing what's happening there. And did I say there was no personal income tax in Florida?MOORE: And other states.SANCHEZ: And so Florida's doing great. Our -- we've diversified our economy. I know Matt has strong ties to our state.SCHLAPP: I'm for it. I'm for it.SANCHEZ: And so I think our state is -- we're in the position to do really well into the future, Maria.BARTIROMO: Yes, well, the local sales tax in Florida is 8.1 percent, but you've got no income tax --SANCHEZ: Right.BARTIROMO: And you've got the estate tax is also some -- that -- no estate tax. That's why I think Carl Icahn took his whole fortune and moved there, right?SANCHEZ: Well, everybody's doing it.BARTIROMO: Otherwise -- I mean -- Steve -- I think it was Steve Schwartzman who said he's saving like hundreds of millions of dollars.SANCHEZ: Yes. Right.BARTIROMO: You're talking about serious money by leaving New York.SCHLAPP: Yes, by -- and this is a little bit like the Trump tax bill too, which is, you know, people were worried about the limitation on writing off your state and local taxes. But the good news of that, even though that caused trauma, is they're rewarding states that have low tax rates.BARTIROMO: And maybe it will push some of these high-tax states to change policies. I don't know.MCDOWELL: That's not what's going to happen.BARTIROMO: We'll see.SANCHEZ: Change your diet.BARTIROMO: You don't think so, Dagen? You don't think Cuomo could move on any of this?MCDOWELL: No. Because here it -- because, again, people down in Florida can brag about there being, oh, there's no state income tax. And I said when Alex said that, I said not yet because, again, all of the liberals, the big-money liberals, are moving down to Florida. So Andrew Gillum got very close to being elected the governor of that state.SANCHEZ: Right. Right.MCDOWELL: And so, again, that's what happens is these -- you're importing the people from the blue states --SANCHEZ: Right.MCDOWELL: So the blue states get redder and the red states get bluer.SANCHEZ: Dagen, great point. Great --BARTIROMO: Well, that's -- it's a really important point, Dagen. And didn't that happen in Texas, in Dallas. You're talking about Dallas being purple right now, right, Dagen?MCDOWELL: Yes, it -- yes, it is. It will be very interesting to watch the state of Texas in the presidential election.MOORE: Now, Texas is not -- Texas is not a purple state. Texas is a red state.MCDOWELL: Oh, you wait -- you just wait. You just wait, Stephen Moore.BARTIROMO: A red state, but I'm talking just Dallas. There are counties in Texas that --MOORE: I know, but, look, I mean I want the Democrats to spend all their money in Texas. We're going to win Texas big time. I mean --SCHLAPP: We're going to do OK. We're going to do OK in Texas.But I think the point that Dagen makes is positive (ph).BARTIROMO: Spot on.SCHLAPP: I just came out of Nevada, where people are fleeing California.MOORE: That's right.SCHLAPP: And these California voters are not necessarily hard-core conservatives. But it's positive that they're fleeing high taxes. So I wouldn't be -- if you're a Republican, I wouldn't be allergic to that kind of voter coming into your state.BARTIROMO: All right, we've got to jump. We've got --SANCHEZ: Maria, two things real quick.I agree with Dagen and it's hard to really comprehend how people can leave high-tax, high-regulated states, move to an area and then vote for the same candidates that will create that type of system.But the thing I want to say, when Hertz moved their corporate headquarters from New Jersey to the Naples area of Florida --BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes.SANCHEZ: You know, residents are still very affordable in the state of Florida, even though in our inner -- in our big cities, like Miami, that could be a question --MOORE: I don't know. I've been looking for a place in Florida and their prices are pretty high.BARTIROMO: Yes, well the weather's -- the weather's better too.Alex Sanchez, thank you so much, sir. We will see you soon.SANCHEZ: Thank you. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Coming up, under the microscope, questions surrounding a whistleblower hitting the White House. Inside the political battle right here, next.And then hitting the waves in luxury. We're taking a look at the new Lexus yacht. Yes, we're going to have it for you.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. We are coming to you live this morning from Washington, D.C. And it is Friday, September 20th.Your top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast.Futures are ending the week on a high note. Check this out. S&P 500 needing to end the week up just over 19 points to close at another all-time high. The Dow needs about 265 points. We are in record territory. Dow Industrials up 69 points this morning, S&P up 7 and the Nasdaq up 25.This after the market ended the day mixed yesterday. Take a look at the close yesterday on Wall Street where the Dow Industrials were down 52, but the S&P was up a fraction and the Nasdaq was up 5 points.Global market this morning look like this. European indices, right now, are higher across the board. FT 100 up 10 points, CAC quarante in Paris up 27 and the DAX index in Germany up 24.In Asia overnight, markets finished like this where we did have some weakness in Hong Kong, but most averages were fractionally moving and they were largely higher.All those stories coming up this Friday morning, but first our top story this half an hour. Top Democrats are threatening to sue the White House and the intel community over the refusal to release a secret whistleblower complaint.Now, "The Washington Post" was first to report this story. It says that the complaint involves the president of Ukraine. President Trump is standing his ground. He tweeted this yesterday. Another fake news story out there. It never ends. Virtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself. No problem, the president writes. Knowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough, he writes, to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially heavily populated call. I would only do what is right anyway and only do good for the USA.Joining us right now is "The Washington Examiner" editorial director Hugo Gurdon.And, Hugo, it is good to see you.HUGO GURDON, EDITORIAL DIRECTOR, "THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER": Good to see you too.BARTIROMO: What do you know about this whistleblower story?GURDON: You know, the thing about the phrase whistleblower is that it gives the idea that there's -- that somehow this is an impartial ref. And one doesn't know that. It may well be that the guy who -- or whoever it was who, you know, gave the information to the inspector general was impartial, just wanted to do a good job, saw something that they -- that he or she thought was terribly important.On the other hand, you know, the Democrats are being -- crying wolf about President Trump for the last three years, and, as we know from the Mueller report, you know, all of the story about the, you know, collusion and that sort of thing turned out to be complete dud. So we don't really know what is going on in here, but it was very interesting that yesterday Rudy Giuliani, very candidly said, yes, of course he asked for help from the Ukrainians to investigate what he says was a Joe Biden bribing the Ukrainians to -- over a prosecutor that the Trump administration wants the Ukrainians to look into corruption possibly involving Joe Biden's son.Now, all of this is legitimate for the Democrats to have a look at. But the -- the Democrats always overplay their hand and demand that things are done faster than protocol allows. And, you know, so I think that they've been crying wolf and the public is not very engaged in this.BARTIROMO: Is this going to blow up into something bigger?SCHLAPP: Yes, absolutely. The Democrats have one way to stop Donald Trump for getting a second term, and it's corruption. His policies are working. People feel good about the economy. The polls show they feel good about the direction of the country. It's all about getting him in a scandal. And this latest thing is another version of the deep state who tried to leak all those conversations with foreign policy leaders at the beginning of the administration. Now they're turning towards using this whistleblower statute, which, Maria, has nothing to do with getting the president in legal hot water. It's about management within that agency of which the president is not an employee.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, we know that for two years we talked about collusion with Russia, which was a -- completely, I don't know, made up.Yesterday, the inspector general, Michael Horowitz, testified before Congress. You would think that given the fact that Michael Horowitz is testimony and we're all waiting for this FISA IG report to come out, that there would be some coverage of that yesterday.SCHLAPP: Right.BARTIROMO: In fact we're talking all about Lewandowski and what happened the day before. No coverage of this.SCHLAPP: Right.BARTIROMO: There's an op-ed in "The Journal" this morning by Kim Strassel (ph), who does an excellent job, and she titled it, Mr. Horowitz speaks, never mind Nadler's impeachment circus, the real action was at a Wednesday hearing. In it she writes the following, Democrats talk a lot about their dedication to oversight and truth and the media keep promising not to let democracy die in darkness. This week's tale of two hearings proves otherwise.GURDON: Look, the -- you know, we know that the Russia collusion story was a hoax. We definitely know somebody made it up or a number of different people made it up.If you want to do really good oversight, you should be looking into who did that and how and exactly how this thing came about. But instead the Democrats have been interested in conducting what really amounted to a show trial of Lewandowski.What they're doing this for is they want to feed red meat to the blue base.BARTIROMO: Especially since, Dagen, in New York, we know that there are multiple investigations right now going on looking into the origins of the Russia probe. You've got John Durham, you've got Lindsey Graham, you've got William Barr. I mean all of this is happening right now and yet, crickets.MCDOWELL: Right. I was looking -- I always look at the front page of "The New York Times." Their number one story, which I always think is in the upper-right-hand corner of the paper above the fold front page is claim on Trump is said to involve a foreign leader about the whistleblower, the whistleblower issue.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: But, again, this will come out with Bill Barr running the Justice Department, this will come out. Once the IG report on the FISA abuse -- and we know it was abuse.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: When you get a warrant to spy on an American citizen who is working for a presidential campaign and that evidence that they presented was paid for by that said candidate's opponent, we know there was abuse.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: But, again, the question is, will heads roll? Will people get indicted?BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes.MCDOWELL: That's the -- that's the most -- you know, will people pay for what they did to the American people and of the abuse of basically our investigative powers?BARTIROMO: Yes. That's right, using our intel agencies, using the tools that we used against terrorists, right, informants, wiretapping.And, by the way, we know, and our viewers know this because they saw it on this program and on my "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" program where we're on Fox News, there's a piece of exculpatory evidence that's going to come out in this FISA report and it has to do with George Papadopoulos having a conversation with an informant, where the informant says to him, isn't this great, you have all these Russia e-mails of Hillary Clinton. Your team's going to be really happy about that, right? And George Papadopoulos answers him and says, no, I would never do something like that. That's treason. All of this is in a transcript because all informants are wired when they do -- when they, you know, are informants and they're doing their job. That -- that transcript was never given to the FISA court. That's going to come out in Horowitz's report. And we're going to get that report within a month. So we'll see.Do you think there's going to be accountability, very quickly?GURDON: Yes, I do.BARTIROMO: You do.GURDON: I think Barr -- I think Barr is going to hold people accountable.BARTIROMO: Hugo, good to see you.GURDON: Great to see you.BARTIROMO: Thanks for joining us. Hugo Gurdon from "The Washington Examiner."A power struggle, meanwhile, is brewing in Israel this morning.Cheryl Casone with the details there.Wow, what an election, Cheryl.CASONE: It's been fascinate to watch all of this, Maria, from our vantage point here. So former military general Benny Gantz is declaring victory over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Now, election results are not official, but Gantz is already rejecting Netanyahu's offer to share power. Gantz, who holds a slight lead in the election, is refusing to work with Netanyahu, sighting potential corruption charges against him. Final election results expected next week. So we'll keep you posted.Well, a federal judge has blocked a new California law that requires presidential candidates to release five years of tax returns to appear on the state's primary ballot. Now, the Trump campaign is arguing the law violates the U.S. Constitution by adding an additional requirement to run for president. California expected to appeal.And there's this. Lexus is making a splash on the water. The luxury automaker is showing off its new yacht. The LY650. Lexus, a division of Toyota, partnering with Marquis-Larson to create an 1800-horsepower, 65 foot boat. It's got three state rooms, several multi-purpose entertainment lounge areas. The price tag, Maria, just a little $3.7 million and it's all yours.Back to you.BARTIROMO: Looking good.CASONE: Yes, please.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Cheryl.Exactly.Coming up, Uber out of money. We are talking about all of the comments we're hearing about Uber right now. Oracle founder Larry Ellison had some harsh words for the company. So did Steve Schwarzman, meanwhile, in my interview. So we're going to bring that as well.Then, this. The wait is over. The new iPhone is on sale today across the world. But you may have to wait in line. We'll be right back with that.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Markets are higher. A lot of news this morning. In fact, it's been a really busy week here on the program. Take a look at some of the key moments from MORNINGS WITH MARIA this week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by a quarter point today. How would you characterize the economy right now?MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, the American economy is booming, everywhere you look. Jobs are up. Confidence is up. More than 6 million jobs created. And it's all as a result --We need China to come forward, to address the trade imbalance between our two countries and also to address the other structural issues to protect and defend the American economy.WILBUR ROSS, COMMERCE SECRETARY: What we need is to correct the big imbalances, the impediments to market access, disrespect for intellectual property, forced technology transfers. So it's more complicated than just buying a few more soybeans.STEPHEN SCHWARZMAN, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, BLACKSTONE: China keeps its markets pretty closed to technology and we've been quite open. And so now we're moving more into a position of reciprocity.LARRY KUDLOW, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: The fundamental nature of this deal is so pro-growth. I mean, look, Canada and Mexico are so important, our total trade with those two countries is twice what our total trade is with China, for example. And China may be a sexier global story, but for the American economy, various estimates, half a point of additional GDP per year may be 180,000 jobs per year.REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): China is no longer a top trader. Mexico is our number one. Canada is number two. If the USMCA would pass, and Mexico passed it months ago, we're about almost a year since all the three leaders signed the agreement, Canada is waiting on this. If we pass that prior to getting into the negotiations with China, we're only stronger.BARTIROMO: Do you see a recession on the horizon?EDWARD BASTIAN, CEO, DELTA AIR LINES: We don't. We don't. We watch the same information that everyone is looking for. I think there's caution that we don't talk ourselves into a -- into a recession because we're so -- so cautious about when the next -- the next shoe would drop.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The future is, there's some huge factor of more data coming because of all the sensors that are in the car and the human doesn't have to make all the decisions about what to do.BOB NARDELLI, FORMER HOME DEPOT CEO AND CHRYSLER CEO: I totally agree with you. And I think, you know, the aspiration is there. You heard Jim talk about it. I think that's top of mind for him. I think Ford is making big bets on it. But you've got to remember what got you here and, you know, they're struggling right now relative to current production, current features and appearances, reliability. So I think you've got to make sure you take care of the core business to be able to do the next business.BARTIROMO: Beautiful music made in America. Steinway and Sons promising customers the world's finest hand-crafted pianos since the late 1800's. Isn't it interesting that it's a requirement in Chinese schools to play the piano?RON LOSBY, CEO, STEINWAY: It's remarkable. Between 30 and 50 million children -- 30 and 50 million children are taking the piano in China.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's like when we grew up, we had to play the accordion, right?BARTIROMO: I played the accordion.CASONE: It definitely does not taste the same, you guys. So, here's the thing. You get to go to the website. You get to guess what it is. They won't say until the contest is over. There are lots of theories already on the Internet, but I smell cinnamon.BARTIROMO: I smell cinnamon too.CASONE: OK.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hints of graham cracker there.MCDOWELL: So I think it's Cinnamon Toast Crunch.BARTIROMO: You're not supposed to eat these cookies on TV, said Dagen.MCDOWELL: Right, because they get black in your teeth. Worse than eating spinach.CASONE: True.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.We have breaking news right now.The foreign minister of Iran is tweeting this morning. Here's what he just said. It is not Iran that wishes to fight to the last American, rather it is his b team hosts who seem to wish to fight Iran to the last American. Iran has no desire for war, but we will and always have defend our people and our nation, writes Javad Zarif from Iran this morning.A lot of conversation around Iran, obviously, after the Saudi oil attack, Steve.MOORE: Of course.BARTIROMO: What -- Pompeo called this an act of war.MOORE: Yes. You know, everything that's come out of the Iranians has been very tough talk and they're not backing down.By the way, the whole episode, though, is a great example of why it's so important the United States continue to produce domestic energy.BARTIROMO: It's true.MOORE: The Democrats all said, right, they want to -- they want to bring it to an end. But the price of oil probably would have spiked up to $80 a barrel had it not been for the U.S., you know, fracking and shale revolution.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, on the attack, it was up 15 percent. But, of course, that's come back.MOORE: Yes.BARTIROMO: Now we're looking at a rally this morning, up 1 percent on light sweet crude and up three quarters of a percent on Brent this morning.There is a lot of news out of Silicon Valley this morning, meanwhile. We are talking start-up valuations, IPO's and a lot more.Lauren Simonetti with all the details this morning.Lauren, good morning to you.SIMONETTI: Hey, Maria. It's like the unicorn stampede this year on Wall Street.Larry Ellison, the Oracle founder, now the chief technology officer, is slamming the new tech giants Uber and WeWork, calling them, quote, almost worthless. He added that SoftBank making a huge mistake taking a big stake in both of them. On Uber, this is what Ellison says. Where's the value. It's losing money just to gain market share. Customers are fickle in the end. It doesn't own its cars. It doesn't employ its drivers.And this is what he says on WeWork, the office rental company. It's one of those hybrid companies, so real estate and tech. But Ellison doesn't see how its business model justifies technology. It was once valued at $47 billion. Now that could be as little as $10 billion.And, Maria, you heard a similar sentiment from Blackstone Chairman and CEO Steve Schwarzman.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEVE SCHWARZMAN, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, BLACKSTONE: I -- so you look at things like Uber, you know, it's -- and you look at companies like a WeWork, you know, which is -- I don't know the company the way some people do, but the absolute value that people were talking about, you know, given what the company actually does, you know, sort of really surprised me, you know, just sort of like an Uber valuation would surprise me.(END VIDEO CLIP)SIMONETTI: Yes, surprised a lot of people. It's not all bad news, though, Maria. Stripe, that's a Fintech company, getting a valuation of $35 billion. It has a clear business model. It has a path for growth. Basically Stripe processes payments for online transactions. Revenues are tied to customers who are increasingly digital.They're also building out into financial services, like offering corporate credit cards. This is something some investors understand.And then there's Airbnb. They're planning to publically debut next year. Reportedly considering a direct listing. The latest valuation is around $30 billion for Airbnb.Again, investors want to see that path to profitability and you have road blocks like restrictions in cities like New York City and San Francisco that would be challenging for Airbnb. But, then again here's the solution, Airbnb is starting to build its own real estate for these short-term rentals.Back to you.BARTIROMO: Yes.You know it's interesting because when you hear Steve Schwarzman talk about a real estate play and say the valuation doesn't make sense, you listen --SIMONETTI: Yes.BARTIROMO: Because this is the largest owner of real estate across the world, the Blackstone Group. And, you know, he was answering the question that I asked him, where do you see bubbles? So, you know, there you go. He sees a bubble in the private market with some of these valuations. I mean I know that Stripe is doing well and you mentioned Airbnb, but both of those gentlemen mentioned both Uber and WeWork, Ellison and Schwarzman.MCDOWELL: Real quick, Maria, Stripe is very interesting because what it does is it let's online market place and Internet companies to collect money via credit cards and then pay out to customers. Just think of the RealReal, the consignment app. So when you buy Stripe, you get exposure to all of their customers because their business is based on the revenue of those underlying customers. So it's --SIMONETTI: And they process for Airbnb too.MCDOWELL: Right. Exactly.BARTIROMO: I like it. I like it.All right, ladies, we will take a short break.When we come back, we've got former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta sounding off on all of the global threats. It's a "Fox Business Exclusive" next hour right here.Load-Date: September 20, 2019End of Document

Beth Mooney exits, and the CEO boys' club goes onamericanbanker.comSeptember 21, 2019 SaturdayCopyright 2019 SourceMedia, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: Vol. 1; No. 1Length: 1306 wordsByline: Rachel WitkowskiBodyHeads upThe 2019 Most Powerful Women in Banking and Finance will be announced Monday. Go toAmerican Bankerto see the new rankings.A major milestone: KeyCorp Chairman and Chief Executive Beth Mooney, the first woman in history to lead a top-20 U.S. bank, is retiring next year.She will be succeeded by Chris Gorman, who had been president of banking, but will now serve as Key's president and chief operating officer before taking over for Mooney on May 1. Key had roughly $87 billion of assets when Mooney took the helm eight-and-a-half years ago and has nearly $145 billion of assets today. Mooney, 64, was named American Banker'sBanker of the Year in 2017and was our most Most Powerful Woman in Banking in2013,2014and2015, before becoming the inaugural inductee in theHall of Fame.The last boys' club: Thislongreadfrom Fortune asks why none of the largest banks in the country has ever had a female CEO. The myriad answers - from the cumulative impact of microaggressions to the lack of male sponsorship - hardly seem to be exclusive to banking. So where is this industry's Mary Barra? In one of the more interesting answers, some speculated that Wall Street firms have been slow to evolve because their customers are CEOs of other companies, who are for the most part also male, so there has historically been little pressure to add women to key teams. The troubled Wells Fargo had been considered a leading candidate to break the glass ceiling earlier this year, but the most recent rumblings are that it is likely to go with a retired CEO (a group that, by definition, consists of all-male options) as its next leader.A boon for stocks: Stock prices go up when companies in the tech and financial sectors disclose better-than-expected gender diversity figures, according toa new studyby the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Likewise, when companies share underwhelming diversity figures, their shares drop, the study found. The researchers first looked at big tech companies like Google and Apple, then reviewed 2017 data from 50 financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley. Considering the market benefits - for example, the study projects that if Google had reported that 31% of its workforce were women, instead of 30%, it could've added $375 million in market value - the researchers conclude that organizations are systematically under-investing in gender diversity.Not a bad start: Nubank's co-founder, Cristina Junqueira, said she started the Brazilian digital bank because she was fed up with abusive practices at traditional financial institutions. "I worked for the largest incumbent bank in Brazil for five years, and I was just done making rich people richer," she toldFortune. Junqueira, who previously worked at Itaú Unibanco and LuizaCred, said banks in Latin America are "hated" for their exorbitant fees and interest rates. NuBank, which Junqueira initially pitched to investors while seven months pregnant, has taken 12 million customers away from the incumbents in Brazil and more recently Mexico. It is now one of the largest digital banking startups in the world, valued at more than $10 billion.Role callAfter a new promotion, Suni Harford, who has been part of ourMost Powerful Womenrankings for years, appears to be among the potential candidates for the chief executive job at UBS Group. As of Oct. 1, Harford becomes president of the asset management group and joins the executive board, while Chief Operating Officer Sabine Keller-Busse takes on the additional role of president of Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Both women succeed a departing Ulrich Koerner in their new duties. The changes are part ofa broader management shufflethat puts more diverse candidates in line to potentially succeed Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti, who reportedly plans to leave in the coming year. UBS Chairman Axel Weber, who's also expected to leave, previously said that the company had started succession planning after several high-profile departures.Muneera Carr, Comerica's chief financial officer, has stepped down, andthe search is onfor her replacement. Carr had been chief accounting officer for seven years before being chosen as CFO in November 2017. Analysts interpreted her departure as a sign that Comerica's new CEO, Curtis Farmer, is ready to start building his own leadership team. Farmer, who had been president, succeeded longtime CEO Ralph Babb in April.MUFG's Ranjana Clark is once again proving her versatility in taking on multiple roles at the Tokyo-based banking giant. Clark was recently appointed asdeputy head of the transaction banking group, a newly created position in which she will manage the global aspects of the business, including strategy, product development and risk management. MUFG said her functional title in this new job is head of global transaction banking. In addition, Clark will continue as head of transaction banking for the Americas and Bay Area president. She had been one of ourWomen to Watchlast year, after being promoted to chief transformation officer.NBT Bancorp Inc. in Norwich, N.Y., has appointed Angela Wolfe Kelley as itsgeneral counsel. She most recently worked at Heartland Financial USA, where she was deputy general counsel and corporate secretary.Michelle Bowman will get to stay a while. TheSenate confirmed herfor a 14-year term as the community bank representative on the Federal Reserve Board, after having previously confirmed her to fill the role just through 2020. Bowman, a Republican, is one of only two females on the Fed board. Gov. Lael Brainard, a Democrat, has served on the board since 2014.

La Roche spent 22 years working her way up at Morgan Stanley at a time whenfewer than 10%of the partners and managing directors of top securities firms were women. "I am extremely sensitive about living in a glass box, that I recognize that issues of style with respect to women can unfortunately often be more important than issues of substance," La Roche told The New York Times in a1996 profilewhen she was 47 years old. She had a reputation for being brusque, impatient and, while working on the trading floor, given to profanity-laced tirades, but former Morgan Stanley CEO John Mack said in a Times interview that he doubted people would be saying negative things like that about her "if she was a man." Among her career accomplishments, La Roche orchestrated Morgan Stanley's 1995 joint venture with the government-run China Construction Bank, marking the first partnership between a U.S. investment bank and the Chinese government.Beyond bankingBaggage: Need a synonym for "woman"?

(AP) - Nearly half the states and some 2,000 local governments have agreed to a tentative settlement with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma over the toll of the nation's opioid crisis. Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich said the agreement reached Wednesday included more money from the family that owns Purdue than had been offered previously. Sources say that Stamford, Connecticut-based Purdue will pay up to $12 billion over time and that the Sackler family will give up control of the company.___Spokesman: Oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens dies at age 91OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - T. Boone Pickens, who amassed a fortune as an oil tycoon and corporate raider and gave much of it away as a philanthropist, has died. He was 91. Pickens was surrounded by friends and family when he died of natural causes under hospice care at his Dallas home, spokesman Jay Rosser said. Pickens suffered a series of strokes in 2017 and was hospitalized that July after what he called a "Texas-sized fall."___Government will propose banning flavors used in e-cigarettesWASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump says his administration will propose banning thousands of flavors used in e-cigarettes to curb a surge in underage vaping by US teenagers. Federal health officials say the government will develop guidelines to remove all e-cigarette flavors from the market except tobacco. A flavor ban would represent a huge blow to the vaping industry, including multibillion dollar companies like Juul, which sells fruit and dessert-flavored nicotine vapes.___UK govt: Businesses not ready for no-deal BrexitLONDON (AP) - The British government says U.K. citizens and businesses are not prepared for leaving the European Union without a divorce agreement, and a no-deal Brexit could see the number of trucks coming through a key Channel crossing fall by half within a day. A planning document dated Aug. 2 and published Wednesday says "public and business readiness for a no-deal will remain at a low level" ahead of Britain's scheduled Oct. 31 departure date from the EU.___Friendly fire: In trade fights, Trump targets US allies, tooWASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump has risked turmoil in the financial markets and damage to the U.S. economy in waging his trade war with China, America's top strategic rival. But Trump hasn't exactly gone easy on America's friends, either. From Europe to Japan, the president has stirred up under-the-radar trade disputes that potentially could erupt within weeks or months with damaging consequence.___China keeps penalties on US pork, soy, eases some othersBEIJING (AP) - China has exempted some U.S. industrial chemicals from tariff hikes but kept penalties on soybeans, pork and other farm goods. The announcement comes ahead of October talks on a U.S.-Chinese tariff war that threatens global economic growth. The first batch of exemptions includes industrial grease and some other chemicals. But penalties of up to 25% remain in place on soybeans and hundreds of other goods.___Hong Kong stock exchange swoops in for London rivalLONDON (AP) - The Hong Kong stock exchange wants to buy its London counterpart to create a $70 billion-company, a bold move that faces significant hurdles. There are doubts about the Chinese government's potential influence, and about a deal the London exchange is already involved in. The London Stock Exchange said Wednesday it would consider the cash-and-shares offer which values it at 29.6 billion pounds ($36.6 billion).___UK court rules Johnson's suspension of Parliament unlawfulLONDON (AP) - A Scottish court has dealt another blow to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit plans. In a surprise judgment, Scotland's highest civil court ruled that the prime minister's decision to suspend Parliament less than two months before the U.K. is due to leave the European Union was an unlawful attempt to avoid democratic scrutiny. The government immediately said it would appeal, and the political opposition is demanding Johnson reverse the suspension and recall lawmakers to Parliament.___Bill giving protections to Uber drivers, others moves aheadSACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - California lawmakers have sent the governor a bill that would give new wage and benefit protections to workers at so-called gig economy companies such as Uber and Lyft. The Assembly vote Wednesday marked a victory for labor unions and a defeat for tech companies that oppose it. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has already said he supports it. If signed, the proposal could have national implications as politicians and businesses confront the changing nature of work in the so-called gig economy.___US stocks notch solid gains as China eases trade tensionsNEW YORK (AP) - Stocks notched broad gains on Wall Street Wednesday as investors drew encouragement from China's move to exempt some U.S. products from a recent round of tariffs.

It's a new quarter. Markets are plagued by the same old problemsCNN WireOctober 1, 2019 Tuesday 11:30 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 825 wordsByline: By Julia Horowitz, CNN BusinessDateline: LONDON (CNN Business) BodyLONDON (CNN Business) --  Happy Tuesday. A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.The most recent quarter was not a great one for markets. Trade worries sparked volatility in both stocks and bonds. Ultimately, the Dow and S&P 500 rose just 1.2%. Nothing to phone home about, although both indexes remain near all-time highs.Unfortunately, the fourth quarter --- which kicks off today --- shows little potential for a change in tune. Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes perhaps put it best in his note to clients: The fourth quarter looks just like the third, but with darker mornings in the Northern Hemisphere. Trade tension will remain a dominant theme. Negotiations are set to continue in Washington next week, though there's been little indication of real progress. Chatter about further escalation, including reports that the Trump administration is considering limits on US investment in Chinese companies, poses a real risk.Absent a plunge in markets or the economy, or a political shock, "we maintain conviction in the view that the US and China are unlikely to find a path to tariff reduction," Morgan Stanley strategists wrote in a recent note.Tariffs on Chinese goods worth $250 billion are poised to rise to 30% from 25% on October 15. Another round of tariffs on products popular with American consumers is scheduled for December. For now, investors should price in both hikes, per Morgan Stanley.Couple trade uncertainty with the disappointing economic data of late, and the upside looks limited. Though the ISM Manufacturing Index, due later today, is expected to show a slight recovery in US manufacturing, data elsewhere still looks problematic. The final reading of PMI data for the eurozone puts manufacturing at its weakest level since October 2012."Before we become more positive on the outlook for stocks, we need to see progress in trade talks between the US and China, and an improvement in economic data," said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.Limiting any downside, Haefele points out, is the fact that central banks are in stimulus mode. The Fed cut interest rates twice in the third quarter, while the European Central Bank pushed rates further into negative territory and said it would restart bond purchases. That provides support as we move into year-end.Haefele's view: "Central bank easing led by the US Federal Reserve and ECB has helped put a floor under markets."PayPal finds a way into ChinaThe first foreign firm licensed to provide digital payment services in China isn't Mastercard or Visa, but PayPal.It clinched the license after China's central bank approved PayPal's acquisition of a 70% stake in GoPay, a Chinese payments company, my CNN Business colleague Clare Duffy reports.The scene: American payment and credit card companies have for years been trying to break into the world's second largest economy, where an expanding middle class means a growing market of consumers who require lending, credit and money transfer services.Since 2017, the Chinese government has allowed foreign firms to start applying for licenses to launch payment networks in the country. But the approval process has been sluggish, with the United States and China locked in a bitter trade war.The challenge for PayPal and other Western firms is that the Chinese payments market is already fairly saturated. Alibaba's AliPay and Tencent's WeChat Pay dominate the mobile payments market, while state-controlled China UnionPay has a hold on the bank card industry.Elon Musk is going as fast as he canMusk, a man of big promises, has a pledge for NASA: a capsule designed to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station will be ready to go in three to four months.The SpaceX CEO told CNN's Rachel Crane that SpaceX is going "as fast as [it] can" to get the overdue spacecraft ready for manned flights. The head of NASA, who last week chided Musk for giving a presentation on SpaceX's futuristic Mars rocket while the so-called Crew Dragon was still on the ground, has expressed skepticism about that timeline.The company was expected to launch astronauts in July, but the craft exploded earlier in the year during a ground test of its emergency abort system. So let's file the latest vow under "wait and see."P.S. Musk isn't the only industry leader talking to CNN Business right now. Also worth your time: sit-downs with Christine Lagarde, Disney CEO Bob Iger, Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol and Dallas Mavericks CEO Cynthia Marshall.Up nextStitch Fix reports earnings after US markets close.Also today:The ISM Manufacturing Index for September arrives at 10 a.m. ET. US construction spending data for August posts at the same time.Coming tomorrow: Bed Bath & Beyond reports earnings at a tough moment for retailers.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Blizzard suspends pro gamer from competition over Hong Kong commentsStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeOctober 9, 2019 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 652 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyVideo game producer Blizzard is facing a boycott after removing a Hearthstone player from its Grandmasters tournament who called for the "liberation" of Hong Kong in a post-game stream and zeroing out his prize money.A Hong Kong-based professional Hearthstone player has been banned from tournament play and had his winning's revoked after he expressed his support for protests in Hong Kong during an official Blizzard interview. It merely decided that Hong Kong activism was offensive, rather than using clear criteria such as a ban on political statements in matches.When he said that, the interviewers hid under the table for a moment and then they cut to a commercial."Effective immediately, Blitzchung is removed from Grandmasters and will receive no prizing for Grandmasters Season 2", Blizzard said in a statement. The two interviewers have also reportedly been fired.The rule in question involved "engaging" in an act that "in Blizzard's sole discretion" brings into "public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public or otherwise damages" Blizzard's image. There's a lot at stake for the company, which happens to be part-owned by Tencent, as it ventures deeper into China. We have yet to hear back.Several posts with tens of thousands of upvotes from veteran players are voicing their support for blitzchung, while noting that they plan to quit the game.The response has been so intense that Blizzard has even shut down r/Blizzard, the company's official fan subreddit, in an attempt to silence the overwhelming criticism.Great ideas can come from anywhere.The move highlights the complex politics that non-Chinese companies must navigate when operating in the country. These are normally worn to help resist the effects of tear gas being lobbed at protesters by the Hong Kong Police Force.Trump says USA not abandoning Kurds, still supporting with money and weaponsThe execution of that plan included dismantling some Kurdish defensive positions on the Syrian side of the border. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces became the main USA -backed force in Syria in the fight against IS.Blitzchung tells IGN that "I expected the decision by Blizzard, I think it's unfair, but I do respect their decision". Free speech vs censorship. I will not support Blizzard anymore'. (Tencent is also the NBA's rights holder in China.) And Blizzard has long had a partnership with NetEase, the Chinese Internet company.No wonder gamers are hopping mad. Additionally, the two casters who conducted the interview have both had their contracts terminated.Senator Ron Wyden of OR tweeted something similar, saying that Blizzard was willing to "willing to humiliate itself to please the Chinese Communist Party".Why would a United States company be so quick to crack down on public resistance to communist tyranny? Florida senator Marco Rubio accused Blizzard of knuckling under to Chinese authorities in order to retain access to the Chinese market. "People who don't live in China must either self censor or face dismissal & suspensions".Santa Monica-based Activision Blizzard joins a number of global companies finding themselves embroiled in controversy around free speech linked to China. "Implications of this will be felt long after everyone in USA politics today is gone".Blizzard made a decision to withhold Blitzchung's prize money and banned him for a year from participating in any tournaments.Now calls to boycott Blizzard are trending online. I bought most of its games. "While we stand by one's right to express individual thoughts and opinions, players and other participants that elect to participate in our esports competition must abide by the official competition rules".No one believes it. Blizzard is anxious about its good standing with the Chinese government. We will likely find out in a month's time when the company hosts its annual Blizzcon in California where virtual tickets are $50.Load-Date: October 9, 2019End of Document

"They have to ask themselves how much freedom are they willing to give in exchange for the access to the market in China? That's why we want to send this message to everyone."One man held a sign the read: "Thank you Morey," with a red heart after Morey's name. Another sign read: "No censorship in America" and a third declared: "Freedom is not FREE." Another man held a sign that said: "Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong," which are the exact words included in Morey's tweet.Tram Ho helped organize the group and said the reason for putting it together was simple."We wanted to support the pro-Democracy movement in Hong Kong," she said. "The NBA's Morey ... tweeted a benign tweet to support the (movement and) the Chinese government overreacted and tried to censor us and that's not right. So that brought me the idea that we would support ... the pro-democratic movement."Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta quickly rebuked his GM after his tweet with a tweet saying that Morey does not speak for the team, but the damage was done. The Chinese Basketball Association, headed by former Rockets star Yao Ming, suspended its ties to the Rockets over the tweet. Events in China promoting a Lakers-Nets series were canceled, NBA media partner Tencent said it was evaluating its plans to cover the league and some Chinese corporations have suspended relationships with the NBA.___More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and            https://twitter.com/AP_SportsLoad-Date: October 25, 2019End of Document

Soft falls on Wall Street awaiting China-US negotiationCE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 7, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 510 wordsBodyWall Street has recorded mild losses(Dow Jones: -0.36%; S&P; 500: -0.45%; Nasdaq: -0.33%as we await the new round of trade negotiations that will continue China and the United States from next Thursday, October 10. Following weak economic data published in recent days, investors expect that at least both sides will continue to negotiate and no new tariffs will be imposed.According to Bloomberg, Chinese officials who have visited the US recently have noted that the issues they are willing to discuss as part of a possible trade agreement have been significantly reduced. This news has reduced optimism about a broad pact on a visit led by Chinese Deputy Prime Minister Liu He,who will arrive in Washington on Thursday.Igor de Maack,Fund Manager of Natixis IM, calls Trump's policy "economic sabotage" and warns of the sharp "undervaluation" unleashed on a large number of European securities."The uncertainty generated by Trump's approaches makes all economic and financial scenarios a challenge," explains this expert, who has no hesitation in pointing out that Trump's policy has unleashed a"shock political-commercial"and that meetings with "various business leaders confirm that these are now concerned that recession is approaching,due to trade war."At the geopolitical level, another point of uncertainty for China lies in Hong Kong,as citizen protests continue to challenge the regime that governs this Special Administrative Region, which depends on the Chinese Communist government. The failure of Beijing-backed authorities to stop the protests is a cause for concern for Xi Jinping,China's all-powerful president.BUSINESS NEWSIn the business scene, General Motors (-0.4%) it still cannot reach an agreement with its workers in the US to end the strike in which they are calling for wage improvements. The labor dispute is now in its fourth week.In addition, Twitter (+1%) and Facebook (-0.4%) they face possible fines of billions of dollars after an investigation by the Irish Data Protection Commission, which plans to publish its findings by the end of the year.TECHNICAL ANALYSIS AND OTHER MARKETSAfter closing last week away from its lows, the Nasdaq 100,which usually acts as an early indicator of the rest of Wall Street indices, has drawn a bullish technical figure known as 'return on island',as suggested by Jose María Rodríguez,analyst at Bolsamania."In addition, we have extreme daily oversold readings, which would favor a short-term rebound. Now, we will place as the main support last week's lows at 7,463 points. And the truth is that as long as it is not punctured, we will not rule out a return to the annual and historical highs, at 8,027 points,"the expert notes.In other markets, West Texas oil rises 0.3 percent to $52.95. 'Black gold' has rebounded in recent days, despite weak global demand.In addition, the euro depreciates by 0.05%, to $1.0972. And in the debt market, the return on 10-year American bond stands at 1.54%, while the yield on the 2-year bond rebounds slightlyup to 1.43% and the 3-month bonus stays at 1.71%.Load-Date: October 9, 2019End of Document

ACTING SECRETARY MCALEENAN AT THE CISA CYBER SUMMITStates News ServiceSeptember 19, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1863 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Department of Homeland Security:Thank you, Director Krebs, for the kind introduction, and thank you for your leadership of our nation's newest government agency, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. The expertise and years of experience that you bring to the table, and the way you work with partners and stakeholders in and out of government, make you a tremendous asset to the agency and the Department of Homeland Security mission. Also, thank you to Secretary Esper for joining the Summit this afternoon, having our two Departments closely aligned in this effort is essential. We appreciate the Secretary's and General Paul Nakasone's leadership and commitment to our nation's diverse and essential cyber missions.I am excited to join you at the end of Day 2 for CISA's 2nd Annual National Cybersecurity Summit among our partners in the interagency, industry, and private sector. I am fortunate to have made it here via Laredo, San Diego, and New York since Tuesday, but I thought it would be important to join this group to talk about DHS and the Administration's cybersecurity efforts.I'd like to thank all of you in the audience, watching the live-stream, and of course CISA and DHS professionals for the work you do to protect our country and its critical infrastructure. Threats to the homeland and our national security are persistent and pervasive. As our world becomes increasingly networked, it has acute impacts on homeland securityresulting in a landscape where a siloed sector and asset-specific approach is insufficient to defend against the threats we face.Nation-state adversaries work to identify and exploit technological points of leverage for maximum injury to American critical infrastructure. Bad actors are using cyber as a means to disrupt and sow discord in our democratic institutions, even going so far as to incite violence in our nation's disaffected against their fellow Americans. And across industries and asset sectors, cyber attacks for financial gain are ever more common, requiring that we practice cyber hygiene at every level.That is where CISA comes in.Congress made the important move last year of recognizing the need in the U.S. Government for heightened efforts in cybersecurity, standing up CISA in November 2018. CISA has the unique and critical mission within the U.S. Government of protecting the Nation's critical infrastructure from physical and cyber threats.But CISA's mission success will not be possible without extensive collaboration across government, industry and academia, as evidenced in this room today. It is only by leveraging all available resources federal, state, and local governments, business, industry, academia and international partners that we will be able to counter and mitigate threats to our critical infrastructure.This summit provides us the opportunity to capitalize on our initiatives, explore new ideas, and unify our defenses against state and non-state, criminal, and domestic threats to our nation's cyber infrastructure. Our nation is stronger when we counter and mitigate threats with a collective defense.In closing out today, I want to provide you with a high-level perspective on the importance of what you have discussed here over the past two days, and will be finishing out tomorrow. CISA's mission and functions, as well as its partners' roles in cyber and infrastructure security, are vitally important to our national security.In less than a year, CISA has made noteworthy progress in their mission field as the Nation's risk advisor and they are gearing up to address increasingly dynamic threats in 2020.As the government agency responsible for building national resilience, the interagency community looks to CISA for strategic leadership in this arena. In August, CISA released its Strategic Intent to serve as the guide for CISA's leadership, workforce, and partners across government, industry, and academia in our unified effort of Defending Today and Securing Tomorrow.Its five operational areas of focus, outlined by Director Krebs, reflect the top priorities of CISA in its mission space. These focus areas are:China, Supply Chain and 5G wireless;Soft Target Security;Government Network Protection;Industrial Control Systems; andElection Security.DHS is committed to providing CISA with the support it needs to address these imminent risks facing our nation's critical infrastructure. CISA has already done a great deal in its short history to build our national resilience in these areas... and I want to briefly highlight a few of their efforts.In December of 2018, CISA announced that malicious actors working on behalf of the Chinese government had been carrying out a campaign of cyberattacks that targeted Managed Service Providers (MSP), fitting a trend of threat actors targeting supply chains and trusted relationships. These attacks not only targeted MSPs, but also their customers on every continent across sectors, from finance and banking, to automotive, to telecommunications.In response, CISA hosted a series of high-profile, public-facing webinars that addressed public concerns about Chinese malicious cyber activity that targeted MSPs. These substantive and informative webinars helped organizations manage their own risk, allowing us to take a step towards both defending today and securing tomorrow.Furthermore, in January, CISA issued an emergency directive to all civilian federal executive branch agencies, requiring immediate actions to protect federal information and information systems against recent Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure hijacking and tampering activities.CISA analysts observed attackers using compromised credentials to redirect and intercept web and mail traffic across multiple federal agency servers and networks. CISA's leadership made it clear that a decisive, urgent response was needed as the actions posed a significant opportunity for harm to our critical infrastructure. Their directive ensured that federal agencies were prepared and not vulnerable to DNS infrastructure hijacking and tampering.These are two examples among many of CISA's significant work in the last ten months. ButI'd like to hone in on one area of their ongoing work in particular that is highlighted by the Strategic Intent: election security.It is DHS's mission to safeguard the American people, our homeland, and our values and there are perhaps few more treasured national values than free and fair elections.As 2016 showed, adversaries, including Russia, are targeting our democracy, seeking to disrupt the institution and turn Americans against one another. That election was a wake-up call for our nation's election security mission. And we've learned that greater collective vigilance is needed.State and local election officials are standing on the front lines of a renewed conflict, defending our nation's election systems, against nation-states and criminal actors alike. I am committed to ensuring that that they do not stand alone.I'm proud of the work that CISA has led, partnering with state and local election officials and the private sector to ensure that they are supported with assessments, resources, training, penetration testing, intelligence and analysis ahead of the 2020 elections.CISA has taken an aggressive lead with "#Protect2020," a campaign to increase our partnership with state and local election officials, engage campaigns and political organizations, and enhance the general public's resilience against foreign disinformation campaigns designed to undermine our confidence in the elections process.By being here, you have a unique opportunity to be a part of the conversation and the solution through the Protect 2020 breakout sessions. From the state of election cybersecurity from the front lines, to delving into the complexities of disinformation, together we can better understand the challenges. Together we can build in better defense and resilience.CISA is currently working with all 50 states and thousands of local election jurisdictions to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of critical election systems and information. We've hosted extensive tabletop exercises, ranging from the Tabletop the Vote series that rivals the scale of a federal election to exercises hosted down at the county and jurisdiction level.We've developed and deployed new cybersecurity assessments to safeguard voting machines and secure e-pollbooks and election networks. We've developed guidance documents and established the Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center. And we host a security operations center during elections where we are in constant contact with election officials, partisan organizations, social media platforms, and election vendors.It's this type of support that gives us confidence in the security measures being undertakenconfidence in 2018 and confidence going into 2020.While we will continue our support to election officials we are also growing our support to the American public. We know that foreign actors will continue to attempt to undermine our democracy through disinformation campaigns. DHS is working with federal partners, industry, and non-government organizations to build national resilience to foreign influence through education and awareness. Some of you may have seen our pineapple product that challenged Americans to learn about disinformation campaigns while sharing their views on whether pineapple belongs on pizza... While I hesitate to take up an issue on the wrong side of Dwayne Johnsonthe Rocklet me be clear on my stance on thisit absolutely does not.DHS will continue to support the steps that CISA is taking to achieve their election security goals for 2020. At the end of the day, these goals should be collectively shared by us all an attack on our nation's free and fair elections is an attack on our democracy itself, and on the American way of life.In closing, I want to reemphasize how important CISA's efforts are within the Department of Homeland Security's mission. We value our partners across sectors who are working with us to defend our Nation's critical infrastructure. Because neither any level of government, industry, the private sector, or individuals alone can effectively defend against all threats. Instead, we must leverage the spectrum of resources available through CISA, industry sectors, and academia to reach our collective goals.I join CISA in calling for your continued vigilance and efforts in the cyber arena.If an organization hasn't invested in cybersecurity resources due to a lack of awareness, then let's work together to close that awareness gap and partner together. You will see measurable results from partnering with CISA.And if an organization has mature cybersecurity protections, then I'd encourage them to assist with less mature organizations in their sectors and supply chains, to improve the cyber hygiene around them.Cybersecurity is homeland security and I want to thank you, again, for the opportunity to join you today. DHS is grateful for your continued work and collaboration in protecting the Homeland.Load-Date: September 20, 2019End of Document

China develops app that promises to be the 'Auto Uber'CE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 5, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 552 wordsBodyThose who say "future" say "automatism". The advent of computers and their programs revolutionized (and accelerated) the workplace, smartphones revolutionized the way we communicate, and 5G technology promises to automate everything that works on public roads.In the same vein, the Chinese company responsible for the development of the "Didi" application, Shanghai's newest "Uber" using self-controlled vehicles, points to the Chinese company. The government has approved testing of these smart cars in Jiading District, and Didi already has 30 "robotaxis" available to meet this service which is intended to extend to other Chinese and foreign cities.This futuristic venture was presented at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference held in Shanghai, an event in which you could see how everything was as simple as opening the application on a cell phone, selecting the path you want to take , and wait for one of these automatic vehicles to pick us up to the site that marks our location by GPS.Robotaxis moves around and recognizes its environment thanks to a whole system of cameras and sensors and the system called lidar, a device that measures distances from objects by means of laser beam reflection. The "Didis" are able to recognize road signs, dodge pedestrians, and even respond quickly to unforeseen events. However, an inactive flesh-and-blood official decorates the driver's seat for doubts that something will go wrong."We believe that public transport is the best way to popularize autonomous vehicles, because the limitations they still have do not make them as attractive to the general public.There is no point in acquiring a car that can only be used in good weather and in specific areas," Zhang Bo, co-founder and chief technology officer of Didi, told THE COUNTRY of Madrid. "That's why we're going to experiment with a hybrid model in which our system will dispatch both conventional and autonomous taxis according to the circumstances of each trip."Didi's pilot project relies on the safety that this service can represent for the future of the operation of the public road of the cities of the future.Indeed, these smart cars are not subject to any kind of tiredness, they can receive and respond to a much greater number of stimuli than a human being, allows the consumption of alcohol and other drugs not to be a threat, and the efficiency of their functioning prevent bottlenecks. Still, robotaxis are far from being able to respond completely safely to the infinite uncertainty of human impulses.The Chinese company hopes to extend this technology outside its country's borders by 2021, in principle to Japan and Latin America.However, Didi is not the only undertaking pointing in this direction of automata transport. His partner Pony AI has been developing a similar service that he intends to export to the United States, which represents one more angle of the trade war between the two superpowers."Our advantage is in the amount of data we handle," said Ye Jieping, didi's vice president and director of his Artificial Intelligence lab. "Every day our vehicles make 30millions of trips that translate into a multitude of experiences from which we learn.The chinese entry develops application that promises to be the "Automatic Uber" was first published in Diario La República.Load-Date: September 6, 2019End of Document

Senate Appropriations Committee Issues Report on 2020 DHS Appropriations Bill (Part 1 of 7)Targeted News ServiceSeptember 28, 2019 Saturday 2:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 9307 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON, Sept. 28 -- The Senate Appropriations Committee issued a report (S.Rpt. 116-125) on legislation (S. 2582) making appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for the fiscal ending Sept. 30, 2020. The report was advanced by Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-West Virginia, on Sept. 26.Total obligational authority, fiscal year 2020Total of bill as reported to the Senate...$72,526,309,000Amount of 2019 appropriations...63,314,844,000Amount of 2020 budget estimate...67,545,748,000Bill as recommended to Senate compared to--2019 appropriations...+9,211,465,0002020 budget estimate...+4,980,561,000OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY OF THE BILLThe creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 brought together 22 different agencies from across the Federal Government under one management structure. As the youngest in the Federal Government, this is just the 17th annual appropriations cycle for the Department.While young, the Department is the third largest cabinet agency by personnel, with nearly 250,000 employees. The Department's most indispensable assets are the people it employs, and the Committee recognizes that the evolution and success of the Department is primarily due to the dedicated employees who tirelessly execute the Department's missions.The Committee acknowledges that the management and oversight challenges inherent to such a large and maturing government organization are compounded by a complex and volatile threat environment and an unprecedented demand on the services the Department provides. The Committee expects the Department to continue gaining management and cost efficiencies by consolidating cross-component efforts while allowing components the flexibility necessary to respond quickly to changing or emergent threats. The Committee remains frustrated that the Department is often unable to translate data, whether related to an internal activity or an external activity, into trends or metrics useful for critical decision-making. The Committee strongly encourages the Department to incorporate the use of analytics and modeling into its key decision-making processes to identify interdependencies across components and to use the results to develop integrated budget submissions for priority programs.The Committee has again included a provision prohibiting the Department from reorganizing without Congressional action. The Committee believes the Department could gain efficiencies through further reorganization but expects the Department to develop any proposal for reorganization in cooperation with the appropriate Congressional Committees. The Committee will consider, in conjunction with the authorizing committees of jurisdiction as appropriate, any proposal to reorganize the Department that is included as a part of a future budget request.The Committee recommends a total appropriation of $72,527,309,000 for the Department of Homeland Security for fiscal year 2020. Of this amount, $70,725,000,000 is for discretionary programs, including $190,000,000 for Coast Guard overseas contingency operations and $17,352,000,000 for the Disaster Relief Fund designated by the Congress as disaster relief pursuant to Public Law 112-25.Throughout the Department's history, the Committee has invested significant resources in personnel, technology systems, and infrastructure. While the Committee expects previous investments to continue to be leveraged to the fullest extent, it is paramount that the Department ensures future investments are informed by cost-effectiveness and trade-off analyses. Investments provided in this bill are designed to enable the Department to accomplish its missions in smarter and more resourceful ways.The Department again requested funding to increase the number of personnel in many of its components, a portion of which cannot feasibly be hired or retained in fiscal year 2020. The Committee recognizes that providing resources each year specifically for hiring additional personnel is not sustainable for the longevity of the Department. The Committee instead recommends funds necessary to robustly support all of the Department's missions through investments that improve the Department's ability to retain qualified personnel and that enable the Department's employees to operate more effectively and efficiently.The Committee recognizes that border security is of critical importance to the national security of the United States and continues significant funding for securing U.S. borders through investments in physical barriers and tactical infrastructure. The recommendation includes funding requested for physical barriers along the southwest border and acknowledges that physical impedance and denial of access is essential for effective border security in high traffic areas with short vanishing times. In an effort to layer security measures, the recommendation includes significant funding for the deployment of strategic technology systems with the ability to target perimeter threats to better ensure the safety of U.S. Border Patrol personnel when executing frontline law enforcement duties.Immigrations and Customs Enforcement [ICE] personnel are responsible for securing the Nation's borders and enforcing immigration and other Federal laws throughout the interior. The Committee recommendation sustains the fiscal year 2019 enacted level to address the ongoing volume increase of apprehensions, increase the number of attorneys to represent the Federal Government, and provide requested funds for infrastructure needed to house those apprehended. While this bill annualizes the previous fiscal year's Enforcement and Removal Operations [ERO] operational tempo, it does not provide unlimited resources for immigration enforcement activities. ERO must continue to work with interagency partners throughout the immigration enforcement continuum to use scarce resources more efficiently.Homeland Security Investigations [HSI], a component within ICE, has played a prominent role in the efforts to combat the national and global opioid epidemic and investigate domestic and international criminal activity on the Dark Web. This bill supports these continued efforts and provides additional funding for counter-proliferation investigations that protect the Nation's vulnerabilities.The Department's commitment to ensuring safety across the Nation's vast and varied transportation systems through the Transportation Security Administration [TSA] is critical for overall national security. Tasked with safeguarding the freedom of movement of people and commerce, TSA personnel utilize innovative technologies, local law enforcement, screening canines, and Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response teams to successfully combat emerging threats to our Nation's transportation systems. The Committee recommendation includes funding above the requested amount to support the resiliency of the transportation infrastructure network as passenger volumes continue to annually increase.The Committee's recommendation wholly supports the role of the Coast Guard to enforce Federal laws on the high seas, preserve life and property at sea, assist in navigation, protect the marine environment, coordinate and participate in search-and-rescue missions, and maintain a state of defense readiness. Due in large part to the Committee's efforts, the Coast Guard's surface and air fleets are in the midst of unprecedented modernization, resulting in more operational efficiency and enhanced performance in mission execution. The Committee additionally recognizes that modernization of these vessels and aircraft have significantly increased the Coast Guard's ability to effectively interdict drugs before they enter the United States and provides robust funding to continue this crucial effort.The recommendation supports the United States Secret Service request for funding for the protection of persons and facilities, presidential campaigns, and widely-attended national security special events. The Committee continues investments in cultivating and retaining a workforce that is prepared to meet the demands for future campaigns and protective missions.The Committee recommends significant resources above the fiscal year 2019 enacted level to protect and maintain the Nation's critical infrastructure and election infrastructure as cyber-related threats emerge. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency [CISA] facilitates these activities through information sharing with State, local, territorial, and tribal [SLTT] governments, maintaining the national cybersecurity protection system, and conducting vulnerability assessments to address emerging threats.The Committee notes the efforts of the men and women of the Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA] in their preparedness, protection, response, recovery, and mitigation efforts to natural and man-made disasters in fiscal year 2019. In the previous fiscal year, natural disasters such as wildfires, hurricanes, and flooding caused significant damage and destruction to infrastructure and property throughout the country. This bill provides resources necessary to fund previous major disaster declarations, while simultaneously considering future disaster preparedness and emergency response needs.The bill continues critical investments in the future of the Nation's security by recommending funding above the requested amount for research and development [R&#38;D] capabilities across the Department. The Science and Technology Directorate [S&#38;T] is at the center of the Department's R&#38;D activities, supporting advancements in opioid research, developing surveillance technologies, and partnering with universities to ensure innovation is considered in protecting the homeland. These R&#38;D capabilities ensure the Department is able to acknowledge and mitigate evolving risks, reduce interference with legitimate commerce, and maintain a technological advantage over those seeking to harm the United States of America.BILL FUNDING PRIORITIES[In thousands of dollars]View table at https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/116th-congress/senate-report/125/1?s=2&#38;r=3ReferencesThis report refers to several Public Laws by short title as follows: the Budget Control Act of 2011 (Public Law 112-25) is referenced as the BCA; Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-53) is referenced as the 9/11 Act; and the Robert T.

Of the total amount, the Committee recommends not to exceed $30,000 for official reception and representation expenses. The following table summarizes the Committee's recommendation as compared to fiscal year 2019 enacted and budget request levels:OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT[In thousands of dollars]View table at https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/116th-congress/senate-report/125/1?s=2&#38;r=3Quarterly Obligation Reports.--The Department shall continue to submit quarterly obligation reports to the Committee for all reception and representation expenses as required in prior years. The Department shall refrain from using funds available for reception and representation expenses to purchase unnecessary collectibles or memorabilia.Adequate Budget Justifications.--The Committee expects the Department to provide complete justification materials with the fiscal year 2021 budget request and to provide details for each office and program, clearly describing and accounting for current services, transfers, adjustments to base, and program changes.Joint Requirements Council [JRC].--The Department is directed to continue to provide quarterly briefings on the JRC and shall brief the Committee on any reorganization of headquarters organizational units not later than 60 days before any such reorganization takes place.Public Reporting of Operational Statistics.--The Committee continues its requirement that the Department submit quarterly Border Security Status reports and data on the deportation of the parents of U.S.-born children semiannually, as in prior years.Public Access to Federally Funded Research.--The Committee commends the Department for issuing its Plan to Support Increased Public Access to the Results of Research Funded by the Federal Government on December 27, 2016. The Committee urges the Department to continue its efforts toward full implementation of the plan and directs that the Department provide an update on progress made in materials accompanying its fiscal year 2021 budget request.DATA Act Reporting.--The Committee expects the Department to submit timely, accurate, and complete financial and award information under existing Department of the Treasury reporting obligations in accordance with established management guidance, reporting processes, and data standards established under the requirements of the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (Public Law 113-101).The Department's Mission in Rural Areas.--The Office of Partnership and Engagement is directed to provide a briefing to the Committee no later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this act on its continued outreach efforts to rural communities and Tribes in their efforts to support the homeland security mission.Cooperation with Central American Nations.--The Committee notes that illegal border crossings into the United States by Guatemalans, El Salvadorians, and Hondurans reached historic highs during fiscal year 2019. The Committee believes that the United States, in conjunction with the Government of Mexico, should continue efforts aimed at securing the southern border of Mexico while working with these Central American nations to improve their civil law enforcement capabilities to address criminal activities, which should have a net positive impact on crime in Central America as well as the United States. As part of these efforts, the United States should continue to facilitate information sharing among these nations regarding criminal history and prior orders of removal or immigration enforcement actions.State Police and Crime Labs.--The work of Customs and Border Protection [CBP], ICE, the Coast Guard, and the Secret Service includes investigations and operations in communities throughout the United States. As a result, the Department often shares capabilities and relies upon cooperation with SLTT and foreign law enforcement agencies, including State police crime labs. These labs provide the Department with a number of critical capabilities, including fingerprint, drug, and cellular telephone analysis. Likewise, these capabilities are the same services shared among SLTT and foreign law enforcement agencies. Coordination among these agencies not only ensures efficient use of resources, it also improves public safety outcomes. To that end, the Department should continue to work with State crime labs where available, particularly in areas not adequately served by Department labs or other Federal facilities. The Department should also continue to provide any assistance that is appropriate to State police crime labs to ensure Federal requirements do not burden State resources. Moreover, in areas where the Department frequently relies on State crime labs, additional support may be appropriate to prevent the accumulation of backlogs that can slow investigations. The Department shall report annually on its use of, and partnerships with, State crime labs, including funds associated with such partnerships, and should fully reimburse State crime labs for services they provide to the Department.Wildlife Trafficking.--As noted in prior reports, the Committee is concerned by the high level of illegal international trade in wildlife and wildlife products. The Committee expects the Department to work in partnership with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to improve cooperative efforts to better address wildlife trafficking. The Committee remains frustrated that the Department has failed to produce some specific reports on these activities, as required. Such reports should be provided to the Committee without delay. Further, as outlined in the explanatory statements accompanying Public Laws 114-113, 115-31, 115-141, and 116-6, a similar report shall be provided for fiscal year 2020 not later than 45 days after the end of fiscal year 2020.Biometric Exit.--The Committee considers implementation of biometric exit a priority and worked to provide dedicated funding for this purpose through Public Law 114-113. The Committee recognizes CBP's progress in expanding biometric exit capabilities at air ports of entry [POEs], adding 15 new locations in fiscal year 2019. In the land environment, facial comparison technology, as of August 2019, has identified 181 imposters, including 52 with genuine U.S. travel documents attempting to enter the United States. The Department is directed to provide a spend plan for H-1B and L-1 fee revenues and any other resources being applied to biometric exit implementation not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this act. The Committee encourages the Secretary to continue emphasizing the importance of joint U.S.-Mexico technology infrastructure that would support entry and exit data exchange with the Government of Mexico in the future. The Committee further directs the Department to brief the Committee within 180 days of the date of enactment of this act to detail ongoing efforts to address entry and exit data collection and exchange in the land border environment.Visa Overstays.--The Committee remains concerned that the large number of annual in-country alien overstays threatens national security and the integrity of legal immigration. Pursuant to section 1376 of title 8, United States Code, the Department is required to collect data on nonimmigrant aliens who have overstayed their visas and to report annual estimates to Congress. Biometric exit remains a top priority for the Committee, and the Committee recognizes the Department's progress to leverage investments to strengthen identification of overstays at POEs. From June 2017 to August 2019, through CBP's biometric exit program, over 22,000 overstays were identified. The Committee continues to make investments in immigration data improvements and in underlying IT capabilities that shall be applied to enhance information for operations, management needs, and the next overstay report. The Committee expects that the Department will provide the report on an annual basis. As previously required in the Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, the Department shall submit an updated report outlining its comprehensive strategy for overstay enforcement and deterrence not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this act. The report shall detail the steps being taken to identify aliens who have overstayed their visas, including those necessary to improve the capabilities to report such information; notify aliens of their required departure dates in advance; track such overstays for enforcement action; refuse or revoke current and future visas and travel authorization; and otherwise deter violations or take enforcement action. The report shall also outline the conditions under which an alien is admitted to the United States for "duration of status" and assess changes to such admission, since the required departure requirement. The Department is directed to provide the Committee with a monthly report, which will be made public on the Department's website, documenting when and where all family separations occur, the ages of all minors being separated from their family units, the nature of administrative or criminal charges filed against adult family members, as well as how often family units apprehended together are detained in ICE custody, referred to the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement [ORR], and/or deported separately. The report shall also detail plans on the reunification of family units.Immigration Reunification.--The Committee expects that the Department will, consistent with assessments that it is in the best interest of the child, and whenever possible, ensure that separated family units are reunited prior to removal, released from CBP or Bureau of Prisons custody, or transferred together upon transfer to ICE or ORR custody. The Committee understands that law enforcement officers will make decisions on a case-by- case basis and may opt for the use of the full spectrum of alternatives to detention, including release on parole or recognizance or, if needed, enrollment into a community-based alternative to detention program, over the detention of family members in separate facilities or in family detention facilities. The Committee expects the Department to ensure that individuals being transferred from CBP to ICE custody, currently in ICE custody, or under ICE supervision, have opportunities to report family separation incidents; to verify the status, location, and disposition of family members; and to regularly communicate by telephone with one another. The Department shall also ensure that agents and officers are properly trained in child welfare screening for child victims of trafficking, in accordance with the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-457).Ending Online Child Exploitation.--The Department is engaged in a number of commendable efforts to end human trafficking and child exploitation. The Committee directs the Department to brief the Committee semiannually on all of the required data pertaining to Department-wide efforts to combat human trafficking and child exploitation.Records Management.--The Committee expects the Department to maintain records and respond to records requests, consistent with the requirements of section 552 of title 5, United States Code, for information related to all detainees in the custody of the Department, regardless of whether such detainees are housed in a Federal or non-Federal detention facility. The Committee further notes that the Department should not withhold records from disclosure unless the Department reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption described in section 552(b) of title 5, United States Code or is otherwise prohibited by law.Executive Order 13780 Reports.--The Committee directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit to the Committee on Appropriations any report submitted to the President under section 4 of Presidential Proclamation 9645.Unintentional Firearm Discharges.--Unintentional firearm discharges present risks to officer safety and to the public, including death, injury, liability, and negative community relations. The Committee seeks to better understand unintentional firearm discharges Department-wide. The Department shall brief the Committee not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this act on the rate of unintentional firearm discharges across all components. The brief should provide details on how to mitigate the unintentional discharge of firearms, particularly standard- issue rifles, including physical means of protecting the trigger well of firearms in a way that does not impede the purposeful use of the weapon.Unified Immigration Portal [UIP].--Public Law 116-26 provided emergency supplemental appropriations for humanitarian assistance and security at the southern border, including $50,000,000 for mission support data systems and analysis, which includes funding for the interagency UIP. The Department is directed to provide, in consultation with the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services, a briefing to the Committee within 30 days of the date of enactment of this act on a spending plan for the UIP.OFFICE OF POLICYA total of $55,980,000 is provided for the Office of Policy, which is $20,300,000 above the budget request amount and $18,030,000 above the fiscal year 2019 enacted level. This amount includes funding for personnel which the budget request proposed be appropriated to the newly established Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction [CWMD] office. Under the recommendation, activities that are being carried out in the manner established during creation of the CWMD office are funded through their legacy appropriations structure. The recommendation includes $600,000 for the Immigration Data Initiative, instead of the $1,200,000 proposed, due to repricing of FTE personnel costs.Office for Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention [OTVTP].--On April 19, 2019, the Secretary announced the creation of OTVTP. The action purported to widen the scope of previous Departmental efforts to ensure that all forms of violence, regardless of the ideological motivation, are being addressed. The Secretary has stated DHS remains committed to preventing all forms of terrorism, including both international and domestic, as well as preventing acts of targeted violence such as those that are racially motivated. According to the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the majority of domestic terrorism cases are motivated by white supremacist extremism. The creation of the Office follows a February 14, 2019, study by Homeland Security Operation Analysis Center entitled, Practical Terrorism Prevention. The study found gaps in the sustainability of terrorism prevention and emphasized that prevention must include threat of ideological violence from all sources.The Committee recommendation includes a requested transfer of $2,800,000 from the Office of Terrorism Prevention Partnerships to support the newly established OTVTP and $17,500,000 above the request for targeted violence and terrorism prevention grants and to conduct a community awareness and training program at the State, local, tribal, and territorial level. Within 30 days of the date of the enactment of this act, the Department shall brief the Committee on its plans to carry out the local community awareness and training program and on plans to administer the grant program. The briefing shall include a description of all threats; how threats are communicated to SLTT governments, the public, and the private sector; what resources and training are available to combat threats; the terrorism prevention training materials; and the progress of implementing the recommendations made in the Homeland Security Operational Analysis Center's Practical Terrorism Prevention study.OFFICE OF PARTNERSHIPS AND ENGAGEMENTA total of $11,823,000 is provided for the Office of Partnerships and Engagement, which is $2,610,000 below the budget request amount and $2,743,000 below the fiscal year 2019 enacted level. The recommendation includes a transfer of $2,800,000 to the Office of Policy to support movement of OTVTP to the newly established Office for Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention.Blue Campaign.--The Blue Campaign, a Department-wide initiative to combat human trafficking, has historically been operated by personnel detailed from components and funded through end-of-year contributions from components, an approach that is not appropriate for the program's long-term sustainment. Public Law 116-6 included direct funding of $1,638,000 for the Blue Campaign to continue support of dedicated personnel and to begin transitioning the program away from reliance on component contributions. The fiscal year 2020 request proposed $1,600,000 for the program, which maintains fiscal year 2019 levels, but continues reliance on component contributions. This recommendation supports the request for the program. The Department is directed to sustain the program at not less than its total fiscal year 2019 level of $5,150,000 in fiscal year 2020 using component contributions to cover non- personnel program costs. Should the Department continue to propose less than full, direct funding for the program, a complete justification shall be included in future budget submissions, as directed in the Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019.OFFICE OF GENERAL COUNSELA total of $21,484,000 is provided for the Office of General Counsel [OGC], which is the same as the budget request amount and $2,105,000 above the fiscal year 2019 enacted level. No funding is provided for additional attorneys as proposed in the budget request.Budget and Impoundment Control Act.--The Committee directs the Chief Counsel to provide a briefing not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this act updating the Committee on violations of section 1012 or section 1013 of the Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 684 and 685) or Code of Federal Regulations Part 550, per prior year requirements.OFFICE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTIESA total of $25,312,000 is provided for the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties [OCRCL], which is $1,374,000 above the budget request amount and the same as the fiscal year 2019 enacted level. The funding above the budget request is to accommodate the increased workload expected in fiscal year 2020 resulting from recent executive orders and changes to immigration policies and programs. OCRCL shall maintain its independence and oversight functions, which are vital to monitoring and investigating complaints.PRIVACY OFFICEA total of $8,593,000 is provided for the Privacy Office, which is the same as the budget request amount and $71,000 below the fiscal year 2019 enacted level. Funding in the amount of $1,000,000 is provided, as requested, to accommodate an increased workload in fiscal year 2020 resulting from recent executive orders and changes to immigration policies and programs. The Committee encourages all components of the Department to work closely with the Privacy Office to help identify and solve issues related to violations of the Privacy Act in a timely manner.Management DirectorateThe Management Directorate has responsibility for oversight of the management and operations of the Department. The specific activities funded by this appropriation include the Immediate Office of the Under Secretary for Management [USM], the Office of the Chief Readiness Support Officer, the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer, the Office of the Chief Security Officer, the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer [OCPO], the Office of the Chief Financial Officer [OCFO], the Office of the Chief Information Officer, and the Office of Biometric Identity Management.COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONSThe Committee recommends $1,215,651,000 for the Management Directorate, which is $341,637,000 below the budget request amount and $40,651,000 below the fiscal year 2019 enacted level. The Committee continues to support the Department's efforts to bring greater transparency to the cost of management operations and to eliminate an inefficient, circular reimbursement process. Of the recommended amount, the Committee includes $2,000 for official reception and representation expenses.Each year, the Department floods the final days of the fiscal year with contracts to frenetically spend funds that are due to expire and be returned to the Department of the Treasury at the end of the fiscal year. These contracts have been used to address needs that were included in the upcoming fiscal year's budget request and creates a vicious cycle of double- funding projects yet to be considered by the Committee. In the interest of eliminating duplication and waste wherever practicable, a general provision is included requiring the Department to find savings, particularly those derived from contracts that used fiscal year 2019 appropriations, to fund activities planned for fiscal year 2020.The following table summarizes the Committee's recommendation as compared to the fiscal year 2019 enacted and budget request levels:OPERATIONS AND SUPPORTAppropriations, 2019...$1,083,837,000Budget estimate, 2020...1,175,990,000Committee recommendation...1,174,209,000COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONSThe Committee recommends $1,174,209,000 for Operations and Support [O&#38;S], which is $1,781,000 below the budget request amount and $90,372,000 above the fiscal year 2019 enacted level.The following table summarizes the Committee's recommendation as compared to the fiscal year 2019 enacted and budget request levels:OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT[In thousands of dollars]View table at https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/116th-congress/senate-report/125/1?s=2&#38;r=3Component Obligation Plans.--The Department shall continue submitting obligation plans to the Committee on a quarterly basis, consistent with direction provided in the explanatory statement accompanying Public Law 114-113, and shall ensure that the obligation plans are connected to activity-level details in the budget justification materials. The Committee expects these plans to be delivered in a timely manner.OFFICE OF THE CHIEF READINESS OFFICERThe Committee recommends $98,878,000 for the Office of the Chief Readiness Officer [OCRO], which is $1,781,000 below the budget request amount and $8,152,000 above the fiscal year 2019 enacted level. The amount provided above the request is to enable OCRO to keep pace with hiring expected in fiscal year 2020.Field Efficiency Program.--The Committee supports this initiative and remains encouraged by the Department's continued focus on enhancing the unity of effort through regional mission support that strengthens operational execution, fulfills common requirements, and reduces cost.OFFICE OF THE CHIEF HUMAN CAPITAL OFFICERA total of $115,296,000 is provided for the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer [OCHCO], which is the same as the budget request amount and $8,952,000 above the fiscal year 2019 enacted level. This amount does not include funding for personnel proposed by the budget request in the newly established CWMD office. Under the recommendation, activities that are being carried out in the manner established during creation of the CWMD office are funded through their legacy appropriations structure.Hiring in Rural Communities.--The components continue to face challenges with filling vacant positions and providing for public safety in non-contiguous and rural States. Challenges in recruiting and retaining Federal employees has exacerbated chronic staffing problems at U.S. POEs and other areas critical to public safety. The Department is urged to examine how small businesses, including Native American, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian small businesses, could help the Department fill its unmet needs in communities and encouraged to explore existing opportunities to fill vacancies where possible. Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this act, the Department is directed to provide a report to the Committee on the challenges it faces recruiting and retaining Federal employees in non-contiguous and rural States. The report shall include a clear description of the obstacles related to using small businesses, information about rates of attrition, the number of unfilled positions, and the duration of time those positions have remained vacant. The report shall also provide an assessment of the effect these vacancies have on the ability of components to accomplish their statutory and administrative responsibilities.DHS Cybersecurity Professionals.--The Committee notes the efforts the Department has made in identifying and hiring of cybersecurity professionals using the Cybersecurity Talent Management System. To continue the success of building a professional workforce, OCHCO, in coordination with OCIO and CISA, must ensure consistency when identifying and certifying the skills and talents of employees. Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this act, OCHCO, in coordination with OCIO and CISA, shall brief the Committee on hiring of cybersecurity professionals and proposed solutions to develop standardized metrics used to ensure consistency in identifying skills and talents of employees across the agency. The briefing should include recommendations on how the IT-focused jobs can be classified for qualification standards that could be updated to meet the Department's needs.OFFICE OF THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERThe Committee recommends $90,071,000 for the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, as requested, which is $22,730,000 above the fiscal year 2019 enacted level. The Chief Financial Officer is directed to ensure that fiscal year 2021 budget justification materials for classified and unclassified budgets of all components are submitted, concurrent with the President's budget submission to the Congress.The justifications shall include:--Detailed data and explanatory descriptions for each request and for each PPA, including offices that have been identified as PPAs, reflected in the table at the end of this report. Information should be presented in quantifiable terms with specific breakdowns of the funding.--Tables that compare prior year actual appropriations and obligations, estimates of current year appropriations and obligations, and the projected budget year appropriations and obligations for all PPAs, sub-PPAs, and FTE, including identifying each adjustment to base, transfer, program increase, program decrease, and staffing change proposed in fiscal year 2021.--Year-to-year changes described in terms that are clear and unambiguous, excluding nonspecific terms such as "technical adjustment" or "administrative change" unless accompanied by a detailed explanation. Explanations of adjustments to base funding, whether increases or decreases, should be specific and compared to prior year activity level, not just the entire PPA level. All requested increases shall be justified with measurable outcomes above the current baseline of activity. If the Department does not have a current measure of such baseline activity, the Department shall establish one before requesting an increase.--For each operations and support PPA or sub-PPA reflected in the table at the end of this report, a breakdown, for fiscal year 2020 enacted amounts and fiscal year 2021 requested amounts, of pay and non-pay amounts.--For investment end items with severable unit costs in excess of $250,000 or a lifecycle cost in excess of $300,000,000, the project description, justification, total cost, and scope; key acquisition milestones from the prior year, year of execution, and budget year; the funding history by fiscal year, to include prior enacted appropriations, obligations, and expenditures; contract information to include contract number, contractor, type, award date, start date, end date, earned value management potential in the contract, and total contract value; and significant changes to the prior year enacted budget, project schedule, and estimated time to completion.--For severable end items, the quantity of each item by prior years, current year, budget year, and out-year; the quantity of units delivered on contract, funded but not yet on contract, and planned but unfunded; and the delivery schedule by quarter for the end item, delineated by fiscal year funding.--Information by appropriation and PPA on all reimbursable agreements and significant uses of the Economy Act (Public Law 73-2) for each fiscal year.--An accurate, detailed table identifying the last year that authorizing legislation was enacted into law for each appropriation, including the amount of the authorization, when the authorization expires, and the appropriation in the last year of authorization.--The text and citation of all Department appropriations provisions enacted to date that are permanent law.--Explanations and justifications for all proposed legislative changes, whether they are new or amend existing law and whether they are substantive or technical in nature, with an annotated comparison of proposed versus existing language.--A report on the status of overdue Committee-required reports, plans, or briefings for each of fiscal years 2019 and 2020.Any significant new activity that has not been explicitly justified to the Committee or for which funds have not been provided in appropriations acts requires the submission of a reprogramming or transfer request.Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems.--The Committee is pleased that numerous components are undertaking efforts to mitigate the threat of hostile unmanned aerial systems [UAS] and directs the Department to include an estimate of Department-wide counter-UAS funding within the request, by PPA, in the justification materials accompanying the fiscal year 2021 budget request. In addition, within 60 days of the date of enactment of this act, the Department shall brief the Committee on its estimated funding needs, including those not addressed within the fiscal year 2021 budget request, for fiscal years 2021 through 2024 to research, test, acquire, and deploy counter-UAS capabilities.Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems [sUAS] Procurement.--The Committee remains concerned about the threat of foreign-made sUAS collecting intelligence on U.S. national security facilities and critical infrastructure. In May 2019, the Department, in coordination with other departments and agencies, issued an industry alert warning organizations about risks posed by Chinese-manufactured Unmanned Aircraft Systems [UAS] and UAS components used in safety and security operations. Specifically, the alert highlighted recent laws passed in China that may require companies, including manufacturers of UAS, to provide information to the Chinese government for intelligence gathering purposes. For the purposes of securing and protecting infrastructure critical to national security, requirements for purchases of American-made UAS should be implemented as soon as practicable. Until such requirements are in place, for any acquisition using funds in this act, including those by Federal grant recipients, the Department shall require certification of review of the industry alert, and any subsequent UAS guidance, and completion of a risk assessment that considers the proposed use of the foreign-made UAS. The Committee directs the Department to conduct a review of domestically produced alternatives and update guidance, as appropriate.OFFICE OF THE CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICERThe Office of the Chief Information Officer [OCIO] is responsible for oversight of information technology [IT] systems and infrastructure development and acquisitions oversight, including that at Data Center 1 [DC1] and Data Center 2 [DC2], to support the missions and activities of the Department. The Committee recommends $416,884,000 for OCIO O&#38;S, which is the same as the budget request amount and $19,654,000 above the fiscal year 2019 enacted level.Data Center Consolidation.--The Committee is pleased with OCIO's continued leadership in data center consolidation, which is enhancing the effectiveness, efficiency, and security of the Department's IT enterprise. Further, the Committee commends OCIO for its efforts to collaborate with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to gain efficiencies by establishing IT operations centers at DC1 and by encouraging other Federal partners to co-locate with the Department at its data centers. The Committee shares OCIO's concerns with attracting, developing, and maintaining a qualified IT and cybersecurity workforce and looks forward to collaborating to develop workforce pipelines and workforce retention incentives. However, the Committee is concerned about the speed by which the Department may be moving to shift data and applications to the cloud computing environment. In addition to budget justification materials and obligation plans, OCIO shall provide semiannual briefings to the Committee on the execution of its major initiatives and investment areas. Such briefings shall include details regarding cost, schedule, hybrid data center and cloud solutions, and the transfer of systems to or from Department data centers or external hosts.Joint Wireless Program Management Office.--The Committee supports the activities of the Joint Wireless Program Management Office and provides $879,000 for this purpose.OFFICE OF BIOMETRIC IDENTITY MANAGEMENTThe Committee recommends $254,062,000 for the Office of Biometric Identity Management [OBIM], which is the same as the budget request amount and $23,254,000 above the fiscal year 2019 enacted level. OBIM is an enterprise-level biometric identity service provider that has cross-cutting responsibility to serve and coordinate with the components and other Federal agencies.Semi-Annual Briefings.--OBIM is directed to continue briefing the Committee on a semiannual basis on its workload, service levels, staffing, modernization efforts, and other operations.PROCUREMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND IMPROVEMENTSAppropriations, 2019...$175,920,000Budget estimate, 2020...381,298,000Committee recommendation...41,442,000COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONSThe Committee recommends $41,442,000 for Procurement, Construction, and Improvements [PC&#38;I], which is $339,856,000 below the budget request amount and $134,478,000 below the fiscal year 2019 enacted level.The following table summarizes the Committee's recommendation as compared to the fiscal year 2019 enacted and fiscal year 2020 budget request levels:PROCUREMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND IMPROVEMENTS[In thousands of dollars]View table at https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/116th-congress/senate-report/125/1?s=2&#38;r=3DHS Headquarters Consolidation.--Within 30 days of the date of enactment of this act, the Department shall provide the Committee with an updated master plan for St. Elizabeths certified by the Secretary or with a report detailing the rationale for submitting a budget request for activities inconsistent with its current master plan. The Committee will not consider additional funding beyond those already appropriated until the GSA revised master plan is completed in fiscal year 2020.Financial Modernization.--The Department continues to pursue financial systems modernization [FSM] for which Congress has provided over $150,000,000 since 2003. The Committee continues to have concerns regarding the cost of this effort, as well as the potential for the Department to move forward in a manner other than conducting a competitive award process. The Committee directs the Department within 90 days of the date of enactment of this act to provide a strategy for the acquisition of software and services related to FSM, including an analysis of alternatives and a plan for how the Department will ensure full and open competition in the award of all related contracts.FEDERAL PROTECTIVE SERVICEAppropriations, 2019...$1,527,110,000Budget estimate, 2020...1,559,930,000Committee recommendation...1,559,930,000The Federal Protective Service [FPS] is responsible for: the security and protection of Federal property under the control of the General Services Administration [GSA]; the enforcement of laws pertaining to the protection of persons and designated property; the prevention of breaches of peace; and enforcement of any rules and regulations made and promulgated by the GSA Administrator or the Secretary. The FPS authority can also be extended by agreement to any area with a significant Federal interest. The FPS account provides funds for the salaries, benefits, travel, training, and other expenses of the program.COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONSThe Committee recommends $1,559,930,000 for FPS, as requested, and these amounts are offset by collections paid by GSA tenants and credited to the account.The Committee expects to receive the report regarding a method to assess and allocate costs for counter measures, as required in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, without delay.The following table summarizes the Committee's recommendation as compared to the fiscal year 2019 enacted and fiscal year 2020 budget request levels:FEDERAL PROTECTIVE SERVICE[In thousands of dollars]View table at https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/116th-congress/senate-report/125/1?s=2&#38;r=3 Analysis and OperationsThe Analysis and Operations appropriation supports activities to improve the analysis and sharing of threat information and includes activities of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis [I&#38;A] and the Office of Operations Coordination.OPERATIONS AND SUPPORTAppropriations, 2019...$253,253,000Budget estimate, 2020...276,641,000Committee recommendation...276,641,000Please reference the classified Analysis and Operations annex for further information.COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONSThe Committee recommends $276,641,000 for Operations and Support [O&#38;S], which is the same as the budget request amount and $23,388,000 above the fiscal year 2019 enacted level. The details of these recommendations are included in a classified annex accompanying this report.The following table summarizes the Committee's recommendation as compared to the fiscal year 2019 enacted and budget request levels:OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT[In thousands of dollars]View table at https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/116th-congress/senate-report/125/1?s=2&#38;r=3Annual Budget Justification Materials.--The Committee directs that the fiscal year 2021 budget justification materials for the classified budget shall include the same level of detail required for other appropriations and PPAs.Intelligence Expenditure Plan.--The Department's Chief Intelligence Officer is directed to brief the Committee on the I&#38;A expenditure plan for fiscal year 2020 within 180 days of the date of enactment of this act. The plan shall include the following:--fiscal year 2020 expenditures and staffing allotted for each program as compared to fiscal years 2017 through 2019;--all funded versus on-board positions, including FTE, contractors, and reimbursable and non-reimbursable detailees;--a plan for all programs and investments, including dates or timeframes for achieving key milestones;--allocation of funding within each PPA for individual programs and a description of the desired outcomes for fiscal year 2020; and--items outlined in the classified annex accompanying this report.State and Local Fusion Centers.--The Committee is encouraged by the Department's previous reporting that commended the outreach of the Kansas Intelligence Fusion Center [KIFC] to critical infrastructure operators and encourages the Department to continue collaboration with KIFC. However, the Committee remains concerned with the Department's guidance on the classification level of reporting generated by the KIFC and directs the Department to coordinate with KIFC leadership in order to facilitate publication of Intelligence Information Reports [IIR] related to cyber threats against critical infrastructure at the TS/SCI level. The Committee expects the Department to report on Intelligence Community agencies that utilize IIR's originating from the KIFC. The KIFC mission and unique partnerships should continue to be leveraged as a State- based Center of Excellence for multi-agency, multi-discipline public-private partnership that enhances threat information sharing and collaboration.Office of Inspector GeneralThe OIG conducts audits, inspections, investigations, and other reviews of the Department's programs and operations. OIG promotes economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of the Department, with the goal of preventing and detecting fraud, waste, and abuse.OPERATIONS AND SUPPORTAppropriations, 2019...$168,000,000Budget estimate, 2020...170,186,000Committee recommendation...170,186,000COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONSThe Committee recommends $170,186,000 for Operations and Support [O&#38;S], which is the same as the budget request and $2,186,000 above the fiscal year 2019 enacted level.

OIG estimates that its work to deter waste, fraud, and abuse saves the Department $10.80 for every $1.00 appropriated to support OIG operations.Expenditure Plan.--The Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 and previous reports required that OIG submit a detailed expenditure plan with its fiscal year 2020 budget justification documents. The Committee expects that the information accompanying OIG's fiscal year 2021 budget request shall include information that breaks down proposed expenditures by focus area and activity type.Acquisition Fraud.--The Committee shares OIG's concern with the increasing sophistication of those seeking to commit acquisition fraud. Advanced analytical capabilities are needed to carry out highly complex investigations into acquisition fraud, which could involve corruption within the Department. For these reasons, the Committee continues funding for combatting increased sophistication in acquisition fraud.Custody Operations Reporting.--OIG shall continue its program of unannounced inspections of immigration detention facilities. OIG shall publish its final report regarding the inspections within 180 days of the date of enactment of this act. The Secretary shall ensure that the results of the inspections, and other reports and notifications related to custody operations activities, are posted on a publicly available website.Continues with Part 2 of 7TARGETED NEWS SERVICE, Harwood Place, Springfield, Virginia, USA: Myron Struck, editor; 703/304-1897; editor@targetednews.com; https://targetednews.com-1409508Load-Date: September 28, 2019End of Document

Hong Kong protests spill into esports, HearthstoneThe Miscellany News: Vassar CollegeOctober 17, 2019 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: SPORTS; Pg. 1Length: 980 wordsByline: Jonas TrostleBodyThe California-based video game company Activision-Blizzard has waded into the same political thicket as the NBA by deciding to punish an esports player for speaking out in favor of the protests currently taking place in Hong Kong. Chung Ng Wai, known by his in-game name of Blitzchung, was forced to forfeit his winnings, around $10,000, and banned from playing Hearthstone competitively for one year. All of this because in his post-match interview on Sunday, Oct. 6, Blitzchung declared, "Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time!" (Vox, "One of America's biggest gaming companies is acting as China's censor," 10.08.2019)Blizzard immediately went into damage control mode to protect its business interests in the large Chinese video game market by quickly deleting the video of the interview from its own social media pages and anywhere else the company could find a copy of the video. These efforts have, for the most part, backfired. Blitzchung was punished for, according to Blizzard's own statement, "Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard's sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image." (Hearthstone Blog, "Hearthstone Grandmasters Asia-Pacific Ruling," 10.08.2019) However, it was Blizzard's own action of suppressing Blitzchung's message that damaged its image and prompted the hashtag "boycottBlizzard" to pick up steam.The video game community, which has a mixed history when it comes to large social movements, has banded around the Hong Kong protesters and taken a two-pronged approach to push back against Blizzard. The first is the aforementioned hashtag, encouraging players of Hearthstone, Overwatch and World of Warcraft to delete their accounts on Blizzard's website battle.net and to stop playing any games produced or made by Blizzard. At some point during the wave of civil disobedience, either due to maleficence or incompetence, it became impossible to delete one's Blizzard account because all four of Blizzard's functions that verify and confirm account deletion were unusable, leaving some remaining users trapped with accounts they no longer want (The Daily Dot, "Blizzard accused of blocking gamers from deleting accounts," 10.09.2019).The second prong is a concerted effort to damage Blizzard's business prospects in China. President of The People's Republic of China Xi Jinping is notorious for his inability to withstand ridicule or criticism and has previously banned all images of Winnie the Pooh in China after a pejorative comparison was made between him and the honey-loving bear (BBC News, "Why China censors banned Winnie the Pooh," 07.17.2017). With this in mind, gamers and meme producers have been editing pro-Hong Kong slogans onto images of the popular Overwatch character Mei with the hope that Mei will become so associated with the Hong Kong liberation movement that Blizzard will be forced to remove the character or game from the Chinese market.More than just esports fans and regular gamers are voicing support for Blitzchung and the Hong Kong protestors: Other esports professionals are also lending their voices to the shout against Blizzard. In another Hearthstone tournament, players from an American University team held up a sign that read "FREE HONG KONG, BOYCOTT BLIZZ." (Kotaku, "College Hearthstone Players Who Held Up 'Free Hong Kong' Sign Drop Out Of Tournament," 10.10.2019) Blizzard attempted damage control on the spot, killing the camera that was showing the team, but has been much more hesitant to act as China's cat's-paw in punishing American players in the way it did Blitzchung, who is from Taiwan. Brian Kibler, a well-regarded Hearthstone commentator, has also refused to associate himself with Blizzard. He released a nuanced and compelling statement, which accepted that Blitzchung should have been punished for making political statements, but also added that Blizzard had overshot the mark with its punishment: "I could understand a fine, or even a short suspension from competitive play, but removal from Grandmasters, clawing back the prizes he already earned, and banning him for a full year seems completely overboard to an extent that feels completely unwarranted and unfair ... The heavy-handedness of it feels like someone insisted that Blizzard make an example of Blitzchung" (BMKGaming, "Statement on Blitzchung," 10.09.2019).Some of Blizzard's employees have also expressed displeasure with their company's support for the authoritarian Chinese government. Around 30 Blizzard employees organized a walk-out in which they carried umbrellas, a symbol of the Hong Kong protests. Right outside its office, Blizzard has a statue of an Orc (yes, seriously) surrounded by inscriptions of the company's beliefs. In order to display how betrayed they felt, Blizzard's employees covered up the inscriptions that read "Think Globally" and "Every Voice Matters" (Twitter, @[lackofrealism], 10.08.2019).Blizzard has not been deaf to all of these actions, and has determined that the best course of action is not to double down on enforcing an authoritarian government's proclamations. Interestingly, Blizzard was not willing to fully support the Hong Kong protests, and instead opted to split the baby: Blitzchung's earned prize-money has been returned to him and his suspension has been cut in half, but Blizzard issued no apology nor gave any clear guidance on what would or would not count as a violation of its rules (Metro, "Blizzard gives back Blitzchung prize money, reduces ban to six months," 10.14.2019).Whether this will be enough to appease the mob of gamers who have gotten a glimpse of Blizzard's true colors is an open question, but taken altogether Blizzard's actions have certainly brought the company into public disrepute, offended a large portion of the public and otherwise damaged Blizzard's image.Load-Date: October 17, 2019End of Document

From afforestation to greening exportPR NewswireSeptember 28, 2019 Saturday 10:44 PM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 527 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Sept. 28, 2019 BodyPR NewswireA news report by China.org.cn on China's forestry:From afforestation to greening exporthttps://youtu.be/8z8R1TPGdpg Afforestation has been a Chinese tradition since ancient times. Some 2,300 years ago, governments then established special positions to take charge of the state's forests. Emperor Yang Guang of Sui Dynasty even issued a decree, stipulating "Each one who plants a willow tree would be awarded a piece of fine silk if the tree survives."In 1949, the Chinese government launched the initiative of "protecting forests and developing forestry in a planned way", marking the first step of the PRC in ecological conservation. For a time, forest planting became a national campaign.Since 1978, China has adopted sustainable development as a national strategy while vigorously developing the economy, and for the first time, environmental protection was written into the Constitution.The expansion in China's forest area over the past 40 years, if divided by its 1.3 billion population, is about one-fifteenth of a hectare per person. In 2017, the total forest area reached 208 million hectares, covering nearly 22% of the country's land area. Of this amount one third, or 69.3 million hectares, are planted forests, making up over half of the total planted forests in the world.The straw checkerboard technology has been widely used in China to fix sand dunes. In the early 1990s, China's desertified areas expanded at a rate of 2,000 square kilometers per year, encroaching on human habitat. But now they are shrinking annually at a same rate, with desert gradually turning green. It's a historic transformation.China's investment in environmental pollution control has grown rapidly, totaling almost 1 trillion yuan a year at the moment. Obviously initial progress has been made in tackling air pollution, and environmental quality improves steadily. The green space per capita now reaches 13.7 square meters. The rural living environments have also been improving. By 2016, about 80 percent of the rural households had access to sanitary toilets, up by 35.5 percentage points from the beginning of this century.The public awareness about environmental protection is also increasing, and their behaviors and habits are changing. In July 2019, Shanghai took the lead in fully implementing waste sorting. Major cities across the country are following suit. Today, China is the world's biggest consumer of new and renewable energies. Its investment in clean energy has ranked first in the world for many years.China's green technology is also benefiting other countries through various overseas cooperative projects. For instance, Sri Lanka's Colombo International Container Terminals has converted its diesel-operated rubber-tyred gantry cranes to electric.

US and Poland sign agreement to cooperate on 5G technologyAssociated Press Financial WireSeptember 2, 2019 Monday 6:06 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 480 wordsByline: By JILL COLVIN, Associated PressDateline: WARSAW, Poland BodyWARSAW, Poland (AP) - The U.S. and Poland signed an agreement Monday to cooperate on new 5G technology as concerns grow about Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei.Vice President Mike Pence and Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki signed the deal in Warsaw, where Pence is filling in for President Donald Trump, who scrapped his trip at the last minute because of Hurricane Dorian.The signing comes during a global battle between the U.S. and Huawei, the world's biggest maker of network infrastructure equipment, over network security and fears of Chinese access.The U.S.-Poland agreement states: "Protecting these next generation communications networks from disruption or manipulation and ensuring the privacy and individual liberties of the citizens of the United States, Poland, and other countries is of vital importance." Both countries pledged to endorse the principles developed by cybersecurity officials from dozens of countries at a summit in Prague this year to counter threats and ensure the safety of the next generation of mobile networks.Pence, speaking at a news conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda, said he hoped the declaration would set a "vital example for the rest of Europe on the broader question of 5G."The U.S. has been lobbying allies to ban Huawei from 5G networks over concerns the Chinese government could force the company to give it access to data for cyberespionage. Huawei has denied the allegation and states in Europe - where countries are gearing up to deploy the new networks, starting with the auction of radio frequencies this year - have balked at U.S. calls for an outright ban.Pence's chief staff, Marc Short, cited Huawei by name in a statement later Monday that called on other nations to "ensure that only trusted providers have access to their developing networks.""We recognize 5G networks will only be as strong as their weakest link," he said, adding, "We must stand together to prevent the Chinese Communist Party from using subsidiaries like Huawei to gather intelligence while supporting China's military and state security services - with our technology."At the news conference, Duda was asked whether the U.S. had ever provided Poland with evidence of Chinese spying using Huawei technology.He didn't mention the U.S. in his answer, but said, "Indeed, Poland's counterintelligence has detected activity that could be of espionage nature" and that prosecutors are investigating.A Chinese businessman who served as Huawei's sales director in Poland and a Pole who cooperated with the government on security measures were arrested in Poland in January on suspicion of espionage.During a visit to Sweden last week, Morawiecki said work was being done to have Swedish networking and telecommunications company Ericsson invest in 5G development in Poland.___Follow Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/colvinj .Load-Date: September 3, 2019End of Document

Esper Describes DOD's Increased Cyber Offensive StrategyTargeted News ServiceSeptember 20, 2019 Friday 8:10 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1068 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Department of Defense issued the following news story:Cyberspace is a warfighting domain, and the U.S. military must take an active role in defending the country and its allies from threats in that realm, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said yesterday.Speaking at the Department of Homeland Security Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's second annual Cybersecurity Summit near Washington, Esper said the National Defense Strategy sets the tone for the military's aggressive stance in the cyberworld.Cyber is the domain of choice for states and groups that wish to attack the United States, its interests and its allies. ''Strategic competitors such as Russia and China are asserting their military power and challenging the rules-based international order,'' he said.Esper said the U.S. military has been waging war on land and sea for more than 200 years and in the air for 100 years, and that it remains dominant in those domains. But only in the past decade have officials been figuring out what fighting in cyberspace entails, he said."Just as we do on land, at sea, and in the air, we must posture our forces in cyberspace where we can most effectively accomplish our mission."- Defense Secretary Dr. Mark T. EsperThe world is quickly becoming dependent on the capabilities that run through the cyber domain, from navigation to targeting to reconnaissance, the secretary noted.''While we are having success deterring conventional aggression against the United States, our adversaries are increasingly resorting to malign activity in less traditional areas to undermine our security,'' he said. ''There is perhaps no area where this is more true than in the cyber domain.''Cyber has been part and parcel of what many call hybrid war - a blurring of the lines between peace and war, Esper said. ''For nation-states such as China, Russia, North Korea and Iran, engaging America and our allies below the threshold of armed conflict is a logical choice.''Cyber allows adversaries to take on the United States and impose costs without confronting its traditional strengths, Esper said.Tracking down the perpetrators of a cyberattack is difficult, and attributing them is sometimes impossible, the secretary said, and opponents may conduct campaigns to steal sensitive DOD information in an effort to undermine military advantages.''When successful, this coordinated, malicious cyber activity puts us at risk by eroding our capabilities and disrupting our ability to operate once conflict ensues,'' he said.DOD must respond to these challenges and is hardening networks and systems to continue to execute missions even while under cyberattack.''Training to operate in a degraded environment is now regularly built into our exercises, and our service members are quickly becoming aware of our cyber vulnerabilities,'' the secretary said.But winning in cyberspace requires an offensive strategy, Esper told the summit audience. ''We need to do more than just play goal line defense,'' he said. ''As such, the department's 2018 Cyber Strategy articulates a proactive and assertive approach to defend forward of our own virtual boundaries.''Just as we do on land, at sea, and in the air, we must posture our forces in cyberspace where we can most effectively accomplish our mission,'' he continued. ''Defending forward allows us to disrupt threats at the initial source before they reach our networks and systems. To do this, we must be in a position to continuously compete with the ongoing campaigns being waged against the United States. Not only does this protect us day-to-day, but enacting this strategy builds the readiness of our cyber warriors so they have the tools, skills and experience needed to succeed in conflict.''The department is also working with other U.S. agencies to protect American prosperity and democratic institutions as foreign governments conduct operations aimed at 'influencing the American public at a scope and scale never before imagined,' Esper said.''The Department of Defense has an important role in defending the American people from this misinformation,'' he said, ''particularly as it pertains to preserving the integrity of our democratic elections.''DOD demonstrated that capability during last year's midterm elections, the secretary said, with U.S. Cyber Command and the National Security Agency forming an interagency group that shared information, expertise and resources to protect the elections from foreign interference.''We also expanded our cooperation to the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI and were prepared to provide direct support, if necessary,'' he said.DOD also developed capabilities and increased military capacity to detect, locate and exploit threats in the cyber domain with the same focus and energy as in the physical domains.Finally, DOD had the authorities needed to more fully employ cyber capabilities in an offensive manner, Esper said. ''This policy reflects a shared understanding across the government of the need to maximize the effectiveness of the department's cyber warriors,'' he added.The department will take the lessons learned from the 2018 experiences and apply them moving into 2020. ''I consider election security an enduring mission for the Department of Defense,'' the secretary said.DOD officials for years have spoken of using a network to defeat a network, and the U.S. military is reaching out to allies and partners around the world to take on the challenge of cyberattacks.''Our ability to share information and operate on common communications networks serves as a force multiplier - but, it also comes with increased risk,'' he said. ''To guard against this, we must help our allies develop their own cyber resiliency.''China is the greatest threat, Esper said, and the Chinese government is ''perpetrating the greatest intellectual property theft in human history.'' Chinese businesses are in thrall to the government, and any nation that partners with Chinese firms to build 5G networks put their own networks at risk.''This not only jeopardizes military interoperability and intelligence sharing, but can also compromise commercial institutions such as banks, hospitals and media outlets,'' Esper said. ''This is why it is so important that we work together from the very start to preserve the integrity of our cyber networks.''Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6864565 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: September 21, 2019End of Document

Esper said yesterday.Speaking at the Department of Homeland Security Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's second annual Cybersecurity Summit near Washington, Esper said the National Defense Strategy sets the tone for the military's aggressive stance in the cyberworld.Esper RemarksDefense Secretary Dr. Mark T. Esper speaks on cybersecurity and infrastructure at the National Cybersecurity Summit in National Harbor, Md., Sept. 19, 2019.Cyber is the domain of choice for states and groups that wish to attack the United States, its interests and its allies. ''Strategic competitors such as Russia and China are asserting their military power and challenging the rules-based international order,'' he said.Esper said the U.S. military has been waging war on land and sea for more than 200 years and in the air for 100 years, and that it remains dominant in those domains. But only in the past decade have officials been figuring out what fighting in cyberspace entails, he said.Just as we do on land, at sea, and in the air, we must posture our forces in cyberspace where we can most effectively accomplish our mission.''Defense Secretary Dr. Mark T. EsperThe world is quickly becoming dependent on the capabilities that run through the cyber domain, from navigation to targeting to reconnaissance, the secretary noted.''While we are having success deterring conventional aggression against the United States, our adversaries are increasingly resorting to malign activity in less traditional areas to undermine our security,'' he said. ''There is perhaps no area where this is more true than in the cyber domain.''Cyber has been part and parcel of what many call hybrid war a blurring of the lines between peace and war, Esper said. ''For nation-states such as China, Russia, North Korea and Iran, engaging America and our allies below the threshold of armed conflict is a logical choice.''Cyber allows adversaries to take on the United States and impose costs without confronting its traditional strengths, Esper said.Tracking down the perpetrators of a cyberattack is difficult, and attributing them is sometimes impossible, the secretary said, and opponents may conduct campaigns to steal sensitive DOD information in an effort to undermine military advantages.''When successful, this coordinated, malicious cyber activity puts us at risk by eroding our capabilities and disrupting our ability to operate once conflict ensues,'' he said.DOD must respond to these challenges and is hardening networks and systems to continue to execute missions even while under cyberattack.''Training to operate in a degraded environment is now regularly built into our exercises, and our service members are quickly becoming aware of our cyber vulnerabilities,'' the secretary said.Cyber SummitDefense Secretary Dr. Mark T.

''We need to do more than just play goal line defense,'' he said. ''As such, the department's 2018 Cyber Strategy articulates a proactive and assertive approach to defend forward of our own virtual boundaries.''Just as we do on land, at sea, and in the air, we must posture our forces in cyberspace where we can most effectively accomplish our mission,'' he continued. ''Defending forward allows us to disrupt threats at the initial source before they reach our networks and systems. To do this, we must be in a position to continuously compete with the ongoing campaigns being waged against the United States. Not only does this protect us day-to-day, but enacting this strategy builds the readiness of our cyber warriors so they have the tools, skills and experience needed to succeed in conflict.''The department is also working with other U.S. agencies to protect American prosperity and democratic institutions as foreign governments conduct operations aimed at 'influencing the American public at a scope and scale never before imagined,' Esper said.''The Department of Defense has an important role in defending the American people from this misinformation,'' he said, ''particularly as it pertains to preserving the integrity of our democratic elections.''DOD demonstrated that capability during last year's midterm elections, the secretary said, with U.S. Cyber Command and the National Security Agency forming an interagency group that shared information, expertise and resources to protect the elections from foreign interference.''We also expanded our cooperation to the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI and were prepared to provide direct support, if necessary,'' he said.DOD also developed capabilities and increased military capacity to detect, locate and exploit threats in the cyber domain with the same focus and energy as in the physical domains.Cyber ChatDefense Secretary Dr. Mark T.

''This policy reflects a shared understanding across the government of the need to maximize the effectiveness of the departments cyber warriors,'' he added.The department will take the lessons learned from the 2018 experiences and apply them moving into 2020. ''I consider election security an enduring mission for the Department of Defense,'' the secretary said.DOD officials for years have spoken of using a network to defeat a network, and the U.S. military is reaching out to allies and partners around the world to take on the challenge of cyberattacks.''Our ability to share information and operate on common communications networks serves as a force multiplier but, it also comes with increased risk,'' he said. ''To guard against this, we must help our allies develop their own cyber resiliency.''China is the greatest threat, Esper said, and the Chinese government is ''perpetrating the greatest intellectual property theft in human history.'' Chinese businesses are in thrall to the government, and any nation that partners with Chinese firms to build 5G networks put their own networks at risk.''This not only jeopardizes military interoperability and intelligence sharing, but can also compromise commercial institutions such as banks, hospitals and media outlets,'' Esper said. ''This is why it is so important that we work together from the very start to preserve the integrity of our cyber networks.''Load-Date: September 25, 2019End of Document

Independence movements in Hong Kong, Catalonia deserve acknowledgementFlat Hat: College of William and MaryOctober 21, 2019 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 811 wordsByline: Gavin Aquin-HernándezBody"Visca Catalunya lliure. Liberate Hong Kong." Over the past few months, and especially recently, I have seen these chants all over the internet. Surely, it would be easy to retreat to my American bubble and pretend that nothing outside the borders of our country exists. But I'm not here to do that. I am very lucky to have grown up in the United States of America - especially considering that Freedom House estimates that 55 percent of the world's 7.5 billion people live in "not-free" or only "part-free" conditions. Instead, I'm here to tell you that you, a student at the College of William and Mary, should be paying very close attention to the political developments in Hong Kong and Catalonia, especially in relation to the countries of the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Spain.  How did we get here? Great question.  In Hong Kong's case: once upon a time, the United Kingdom colonized an island at the mouth of the Pearl River and turned it into a prosperous - but still colonized - port city and a European gateway to China. That is at least while China was weak. By the 1990s, China was able to strong-arm the United Kingdom to hand over the territory in 1997 under the promise that it would not be integrated into the People's Republic in earnest for 50 years - and it would have its own political and economic systems during this half century.  Spoiler alert: this promise has been broken countless times. The result? Mass demonstrations - most notably in 2014 with the Umbrella Revolution over reforms to the electoral system and in 2019 with renewed outrage over a law that would allow extradition of political dissidents to the Mainland. Essentially, China is eating away at the freedoms agreed upon for Hong Kongers when Britain ceded the territory.  Why does this matter to us? I mean, we don't live in Hong Kong. That's a completely valid question to ask. The bigger issue that does actually concern a lot of students here that are American citizens is in terms of our already tenuous relationship with China. Let's face it - we all use Chinese products all the time. However, lately, American companies have been kowtowing to Chinese dictator Xi Jinping and sacrificing our First Amendment rights in order to appease a brutal totalitarian regime across the Pacific - and certainly Hong Kong isn't the only victim. Tibetans and Uyghurs know too much about the Chinese government's cruelty.  On the list of offending entities now include many American behemoths: Apple, the National Basketball Association, Activision Blizzard and even Google. China even got Italian fashion icon Donatella Versace to apologise for daring to break with Chinese political orthodoxy.  As distressing as Hong Kong's developments are, one must not delude themselves into thinking that freedom is even a given guarantee in the West. Spain is a beautiful country, one that possesses untold diversity and is plagued with economic problems. However, it's easy to forget that it suffered a military dictatorship until the 1970s, during which minority ethnolinguistic groups were repressed under the guise of Spanish popular unity under Francisco Franco's platform of "una, grande y libre."  Even though Spain now guarantees that the Catalans can govern themselves and speak in Catalan, Madrid's crackdown on any sort of independence is too reminiscent of what Catalans under the fascist Franco dictatorship can remember.  As a Mexican-American in the United States with Catalan descent, Catalan and Basque calls for independence remind me of the famed Grito de Dolores, the famous cry of Miguel Hidalgo in the pueblo of Dolores that called for the end of 300 years of colonialism in Mexico. This eventually sparked the Mexican War of Independence, during which indigenous and mixed Mexicans found it in them to take up the struggle and march to Mexico City. The Catalans, as a distinct people from rest of Spain, would like a similar divorce from Spain after a long history of being denied autonomy and having their language stripped of them.  For Hispanic/Latino/a/x identifying students at the College, this sentiment should be very familiar. Though Castile has changed its face and its name to Spain, it is still the entity responsible for in 1492 expelling the Jewish population from Iberia, for colonising the Americas, exploiting Amerindians and Africans and for imposing the Castilian language and culture on the Americas and the rest of Iberia, at the expense of languages such as Catalan, Basque, Nahuatl and Quechua.  So, back to us. What can we do? Consciously uncouple yourself from companies that don't respect freedom. If you can stomach it, don't buy the iPhone 11. Spread awareness. Do your research and think more closely about your actions. Are you supporting imperialism? Maybe you shouldn't.Email Gavin Aquin-Hernández at gaaquin@email.wm.eduLoad-Date: October 21, 2019End of Document

The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperforms for the second straight day.Today's action has reflected much of yesterday's value trade that benefits underperforming areas of the stock market, most notably the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.8%) and SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.36, +0.93, +2.2%). An upturn in Boeing (BA 366.34, +7.56, +2.1%) and many of the transportation stocks has had a similar effect on the industrials sector (+0.5%).The gains in these areas, however, are coming at the expense of crowded groups like the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.9%), which is the S&P 500's most heavily-weighted sector. The real estate sector (-1.7%), which investors had piled into for its higher dividend yields and low-beta disposition, is today's worst performer.Allowing today's value trade to play out are the improved views on trade and growth, which have helped some money flow out of the Treasury market and drive yields higher. The 2-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.64%, and the 10-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.35.Separately, the market saw a sharp uptick on a report from the South China Morning Post indicating that China is ready to purchase more agricultural products from the U.S. The caveat, though, is that China would want the U.S. to agree to delay tariffs and ease its supply ban on Huawei. Nothing material has transpired, but the report likely triggered some algorithms.Some story stocks today include Wendy's (WEN 19.45, -2.50, -11.4%) and Ford Motor (F 9.28, -0.26, -2.9%). Wendy's is down big after the company lowered its earnings guidance to reflect costs needed to expand its breakfast menu nationwide. Ford Motor is down after its senior unsecured debt was downgraded to "junk status" at Moody's.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August declined to 103.1 from 104.7 in July. The August reading was its lowest in five months, but the index remains running at elevated levels.The July Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed that job openings declined to 7.217 million from a revised 7.248 million in June (from 7.348 million).As a reminder, Apple's (AAPL 214.13, -0.10, -0.1%) annual product event is expected to start within the next few minutes.12:54SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: MNK (32.03 mln +62.86%), TEVA (25.92 mln +10.08%), PFE (17.35 mln +0.74%), ENDP (14.29 mln +31.38%)Materials: FCX (18.78 mln +3.56%)Industrials: GE (38.9 mln +1.67%)Consumer Discretionary: F (45.1 mln -2.99%), JCP (16.14 mln +19.76%), ROKU (15.89 mln -4.55%)Information Technology: AMD (26.95 mln -1.27%), MSFT (14.87 mln -1.32%), MU (13.96 mln -0.12%), Financials: BAC (36.95 mln +1.62%), Energy: CHK (71.72 mln +0.53%), SWN (24.77 mln +5.56%), DNR (19.19 mln +10.21%), RIG (18.03 mln +1.19%), ECA (15.04 mln +0.95%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: MNK (3.88x +62.86%), ITCI (3.59x -2.71%), MMSI (2.79x -9.64%), AUPH (2.62x +13.97%), ACAD (2.23x +7.21%)Materials: GSV (2.16x -7.33%)Industrials: MAXR (2.25x +12.52%), MRTN (2.19x +6.15%), HDS (2.07x -6.49%)Consumer Discretionary: WEN (3.6x -11.82%), LAUR (3.49x -6.21%), ASNA (2.58x +18.14%), NLS (2.23x +4.14%)Financials: HLNE (3.09x -5.17%), IGIB (3.07x -0.28%), STC (2.51x -0.99%), NAC (2.31x -1.45%)Consumer Staples: DF (2.53x +27.78%)12:53SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: MNK (3.42 +62.86%), ENDP (4.03 +31.38%), ADAP (2.07 +21.47%), ACOR (3.62 +14.92%), AUPH (6.61 +13.97%), AKBA (4.86 +13.43%), LXRX (1.6 +12.46%), AMRX (3.37 +12.33%), AKRX (3.03 +12.22%), IMMU (14.89 +12.12%), INO (2.44 +11.42%)Industrials: MAXR (7.91 +12.52%)Consumer Discretionary: JCP (1.02 +19.76%), ASNA (0.36 +18.14%), EXPR (2.98 +14.62%)Energy: SDRL (3.33 +16.84%)Consumer Staples: DF (1.5 +27.78%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: MMSI (27.95 -9.64%), NBIX (94.26 -5.74%), NEO (21.51 -5.65%)Materials: GSV (0.92 -7.33%)Industrials: HDS (38.17 -6.49%)Consumer Discretionary: WEN (19.36 -11.82%), LAUR (16.46 -6.21%), LOPE (107.5 -6.09%), SHAK (96.85 -5.66%), RACE (151.97 -5.46%)Information Technology: OLED (189.99 -9.94%), EPAM (180.44 -6.74%), EVTC (33.36 -6.53%), LSCC (19.53 -6.33%), BAH (69.07 -6.24%), FICO (327.82 -6.14%), PAYC (214.88 -6.05%)Financials: MKTX (343.31 -7.14%), QD (7.37 -6.52%)Consumer Staples: TPB (28.67 -5.88%)12:46OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:NLNK Sep 2 calls are seeing interest with the underlying stock up 10% (volume: 2080, open int: 0, implied vol: ~284%, prev day implied vol: 96%).

The shaky start to the week has trimmed the sector's Q3 gain to 2.2%, but the group remains up almost 29.0% for the year, which leaves it well ahead of the remaining ten sectors.Momentum names lagged yesterday, and they are showing relative weakness again today on no news other than the price action itself. To that point, the likes of Synopsys (SNPS 135.61, -5.65, -4.0%), Visa (V 175.35, -6.20, -3.4%), MasterCard (MA 273.42, -9.94, -3.5%), Fiserv (FISV 103.26, -3.42, -3.2%), Global Payments (GPN 165.77, -5.03, -2.9%), and Automatic Data Processing (ADP 162.96, -5.09, -3.0%) show losses between 3.5% and 4.0% after hitting record highs in recent days.Top-weighted sector components have fared a bit better. For instance, Apple (AAPL 213.40, -0.77, -0.4%) is down just 0.4% ahead of an upcoming product reveal while Alphabet (GOOGL 1202.35, -2.93, -0.2%) shows a slimmer loss. Microsoft (MSFT 135.35, -2.15, -1.6%), however, is down more than 1.5%.The technology sector traded beneath its 50-day moving average at today's low point, but it is currently back above that level, which has acted as an area of congestion over the past month.12:02TALKX Market Briefing: Hold the trade deal enthusiasmThe stock market has gotten a nice pop following a South China Morning Post report indicating China is open to agreeing to buy more agricultural products from the U.S. in a lead up to the October trade meeting in Washington. Tucked inside the same article is a qualifier, however, that China would like to do this in exchange for the U.S. dialing back its restrictions on Huawei and delaying the tariff increases it has planned.In other words, it's a familiar page from the trade playbook, only this play hasn't really gained any yardage in the past.The market (or maybe the algorithms) reacted to the headline with a knee-jerk buying effort, but there isn't much of a basis to run with this news as a major breakthrough since it isn't one. That doesn't mean this market can't, or won't, make more out of the headline than it's worth since it has rallied of late on a sense of relief that neither China nor the U.S. seems intent at this juncture on escalating the trade war even further.Still, this shouldn't be construed as a material development.The Russell 2000 is up 0.8%; the Dow Jones industrial Average is flat; the S&P 500 is down 0.5%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.5%.11:51SCANX Stocks that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (49) outpacing new lows (15) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ABG, ACM, ACRE, AMBA, AN, APO, ARCC, ARNC, AY, AYR, BF.B, BRC, BRX, BX, CASH, CCRN, CE, CHH, CIO, CPRX, CY, DCOM, DRRX, GL, GNRC, HTH, HTLD, ITI, ITRI, KIM, KSU, LM, NVMI, NYCB, OKE, PFNX, PSXP, PTGX, SAH, SAIA, SFL, SITC, SSW, STNG, STWD, SUM, SYY, TROW, WUStocks that traded to 52 week lows: BERY, BMRN, ENTA, FVRR, ILMN, LGND, LVGO, LYFT, MMSI, PD, REGN, RUBY, TRXC, VAPO, WMGIThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AGM, ALG, CMBM, IMKTA, NNI, SAR, TIPTThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: ESTA, HSKA, KRTX11:30XERS Xeris Pharmaceuticals receives FDA approval for GVOKE injection for severe hypoglycemia (shares halted) (11.04 +0.10)Xeris Pharmaceuticals has received regulatory approval from the FDA for GVOKE (glucagon) injection, its ready-to-use, room-temperature stable liquid glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in pediatric and adult patients with diabetes ages 2 years and above. GVOKE is the first glucagon product approved that can be administered via a prefilled syringe (GVOKE PFS) or auto-injector (GVOKE HypoPen), reducing the steps to prepare and administer glucagon in the event of severe hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar levels. The FDA's approval is based on positive results from three Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy, safety, and utility of GVOKE in treating severe hypoglycemia when compared with conventional glucagon emergency kits among adults and children with type 1 diabetes.The company is preparing to introduce GVOKE in two different administration options to accommodate the community's preferences, starting with its pre-filled syringe in 4-6 weeks and the auto-injector in 2020.Xeris also has entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and Silicon Valley Bank. The agreement increases the borrowing base from $45 mln to up to $85 mln and extends the maturity date of the debt to as late as June 2024, if the second tranche is drawn.11:30BONDX New SupplyTreasury Auction Preview$38 bln 3-year Treasury note auction (results at 13:00 ET) Prior auction results: High yield: 1.562% Bid-to-cover: 2.41 Indirect bid: 46.7% Direct bid: 19.3% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.407% Bid-to-cover: 2.53 Indirect bid: 46.9% Direct bid: 14.2%11:17SPY Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary of State Pompeo and National Security Advisor Bolton will hold a media briefing at 13:30; topic unknown11:15SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Merit Medical (MMSI) sinks following downgrade -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersENDP (3.72 +21.01%): Continued volatility; the stock recovers yesterday's losses and proceeds to its new highest levels in almost two months.

Revenue is expected to decrease 18.7% yr/yr to $1.34 bln. The company reiterated its FY20 guidance on June 4, priming the market for revenue between $7.46 bln and $7.87 bln. The last three months saw just a handful of noteworthy game releases, which likely presented a headwind to overall store traffic in Q2. There are more big titles scheduled to be released in the fall and in early 2020, which should be a positive for the company's outlook.Shares of GME hit a fresh record low in mid-August amid dimming prospects for a meaningful turnaround. The stock recovered from that low over the past couple weeks, aided by comments from investor Michael Burry, who revealed that his fund owns 3% of outstanding shares of GME. Mr. Burry's view is based on the expectation that the next generation of consoles will not do away with physical Blu-ray drives. While the decision to keep physical drives would be a positive for GME, the company would still need to compete with large retailers like Best Buy (BBY 68.95, -0.27, -0.4%), Target (TGT 107.56, -0.39, -0.4%), and Walmart (WMT 116.02, -0.31, -0.3%) at a time when GME has been closing many of its locations.10:18AAPL Apple September product event previewApple is set to unveil new products today at 13:00 ET. Most of these products will have very incremental upgrades. Most of the attention for shareholders will be placed to the pricing of the company's Apple TV Plus and Apple Arcade services. Apple stock is up 35% year-to-date vs. a 22.5% gain in the Nasdaq 100. The stock remains near the high end of its recent range and less than 10% from its all-time high.iPhones: The company is expected to release three new iPhones. The first iPhone will likely be called the iPhone 11 and will feature a 6.1-inch LCD screen similar to the iPhone XR that is currently on sale. The other two phones will be called the iPhone 11 Pro and will feature organic light-emitting diode displays similar to the iPhone Xs and Xs Max. The iPhone 11 Pro will come in two sizes: 5.8 and 6.5 inches. The phones are expected to feature faster processors and better cameras. However, these phones will likely only have incremental improvements as Apple is expected to unveil its 5G iPhone in 2020. Analysts are expecting pricing similar to prior models between $749-1099.Services: Apple could confirm the pricing for its gaming and TV services and introduce additional content expected for those services. It has been reported by several sources that the gaming service will cost $4.99/month and the TV service will cost $9.99/month. Apple will have to compete with other streaming offerings from Disney (DIS) which will be priced lower.Apple Watch 5: The updated smartwatch is expected to feature a ceramic design, faster processors, and more health features such as sleep tracking.Mac: Apple is expected to introduce a 16-inch Mac Book Pro.iPads: There is some speculation that Apple will update its iPad Pro lineup with faster processors and larger screens. However, some analysts feel the iPad will get its own event in October.Other Products: Apple could introduce Apple "tracking tags" that will allow users to find lost items. Expectations are for another underwhelming iPhone cycle ahead of next year's 5G offering. Analysts note that there is a lot of pent up demand with many older iPhones in the installed base. Therefore, there is an expectation for a super cycle for the 5G handset next year. Still, the investment thesis has shifted from iPhone cycles to a more diversified set of hardware and services. Last quarter, iPhone sales fell to less than 50% of revenue for the first time as the success of services, iPads, AirPods, and the Apple Watch picked up the slack for falling iPhone sales. Apple's earnings are expected to grow 10% next year after falling 2% in fiscal 2019, which concludes this month. With a $943 bln market cap, the stock trades at ~17x earnings, or ~15x, backing out the cash.Suppliers to keep on note include: SSNLF, LPL (for displays) and LITE, FNSR and IIVI (for FaceID.) Other suppliers include: SWKS, CRUS, AVGO, QRVO, TSM, and QCOM, among others.

Patients 02002 and 02006 were treated with higher dose levels of RP-L102. Patients 02004 and 02005 received non-optimized and lower doses of RP-L102. Key highlights of the manuscript include:Follow-up data for the initial four patients 18-30 months post-infusion demonstrate progressively increased engraftment in peripheral blood leukocytes and in the bone marrow following administration of RP-L102 without the use of conditioning. In Patient 02002 at 30 months follow-up, approximately 44% of bone marrow CD34+ cells displayed gene marking, suggesting the engraftment of very primitive corrected hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Sequential increases in gene marking in peripheral blood and in the bone marrow for Patients 02004 and 02005 were also seen, but at more modest levels and after longer durations. The bone marrow resistance to MMC in Patient 02002 increased to 70% at 24 months, approaching the phenotype of a healthy donor. Patients 02004, 02005 and 02006 also displayed progressive increases in MMC resistance. DEB exposure resulted in a lower proportion of cells with aberrant chromosomes in Patients 02002, 02004 and 02006. Patient 02002 demonstrated stabilized neutrophil counts and hemoglobin levels as early as six months post-administration of RP-L102. Similar trends were also seen in Patient 02006. Progressive increases in the total number of corrected leukocytes were observed shortly after the initial administration of RP-L102 in all treated patients. Favorable safety profile with no serious adverse events associated with infusion of the investigational product in these initial four patients.07:08STOR STORE Capital increases quarterly dividend to $0.35/share from $0.33/share (37.08 )07:07STC Stewart Info confirms termination of Fidelity National (FNF) merger, names new CEO (33.77 )In light of the FTC's decision, the Stewart Board has clearly determined that leveraging the company's strong brand, financial position, and valued employees to grow the organization as a standalone entity will create the greatest shareholder value.

NfL is a protein that provides structural support to nerve fibres in the brain. An increase in the amount of NfL may be associated with nerve cell damage, and detection of increased NfL levels in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may serve as a biomarker of nerve cell damage.In the Phase III OPERA I study in RMS and the ORATORIO study in PPMS, blood NfL levels were significantly lower after treatment with OCREVUS. In RMS, blood serum NfL levels were reduced by 43 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with a 31 percent reduction with interferon beta-1a (p<0.001). In PPMS, blood plasma NfL levels were reduced by 16 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with 0.2 percent reduction with placebo (p<0.001). Additionally, these analyses showed higher blood NfL levels at the start of the study were correlated with more disability progression in upper and lower limbs in PPMS and overall disability in the interferon beta-1a RMS treatment group at 96 weeks.06:03FTS Fortis announces five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 bln for the period 2020 to 2024, increases quarterly dividend to $0.4775/share from $0.45/share (42.08 )The co announced its five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 billion for the period 2020 to 2024, up $1.0 billion from the prior year's plan.

Reduction in the composite porphyria attack rate with givosiran treatment, which had been observed in the ENVISION Phase 3 study as early as one month after dosing, was shown to be sustained with continued dosing in the OLE phase of the study. Sustained reduction in levels of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), an intermediate in the heme biosynthesis pathway believed to be the primary neurotoxic intermediate responsible for causing both porphyria attacks and ongoing symptoms in between attacks, was also observed with continued dosing. Rapid and sustained lowering of attack rate and ALA levels was also observed in placebo patients who crossed over after the six-month double blind phase of the ENVISION Phase 3 study to receive givosiran in the OLE phase of the study. Givosiran's safety profile in the OLE phase has remained consistent with the profile observed in the double blind phase of the ENVISION study.ENVISION Results of Select Patient Reported Outcomes -- A number of patient reported outcomes were collected as secondary and exploratory measures in the ENVISION study. Daily worst pain did not achieve statistical significance based on the prespecified ANCOVA analysis (p equals 0.0530), however, the data were found to not be normally distributed. A post-hoc analysis of daily worst pain was therefore performed using the non-parametric stratified Wilcoxon test. Based on the non-parametric test, patients on givosiran had a significant reduction in daily worst pain (nominal p equals 0.0455). In exploratory analyses, the reductions in pain were accompanied by fewer days of use of both opioid and non-opioid analgesics. Givosiran did not impact daily worst fatigue or daily worst nausea at six months, although these assessments will be repeated at twelve months to explore the effects of longer term dosing. Updated Phase 1/2 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of April 19, 2019, a robust treatment effect was maintained in givosiran-treated patients with continued dosing in the Phase 1/2 OLE study (N=16), with a mean time on treatment of 22.8 months and total time on treatment across the Phase 1 and OLE studies of up to 35 months. Substantial mean reductions in annualized attack rate (AAR) and in annualized hemin use of greater than 90 percent were observed, with evidence for sustained or potentially enhanced clinical activity with continued dosing. Five out of twelve patients (42 percent) who received givosiran during the Phase 1 study and continued with givosiran dosing in the OLE study and two out of four patients (50 percent) who had been in the placebo arm of the Phase 1 study and crossed over to givosiran treatment in the OLE study achieved an AAR of zero for a mean of 18.1 and 24.9 months, respectively.06:00ACN Accenture acquires Pragsis Bidoop; terms not disclosed (194.83 )Pragsis Bidoop, headquartered in Madrid with additional offices in Barcelona and the U.K., will add more than 200 employees with deep machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data engineering experience, along with its portfolio of end-to-end solutions, to Accenture's Applied Intelligence business.06:00ASX ASE Technology reports August net revenues +10.3% yr/yr to $1.28 bln (4.51 )06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets ease back; S&P Futures take out yesterday's lowThe global equity markets are under slight pressure to start the day.

In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD16:20IMXI International Money Express announces secondary public offering of 5,217,392 shares of common stock by selling stockholders (13.60 -0.55)Shares will be offered by affiliates of Stella Point Capital and certain of the company's other stockholders.

American Realty Capital Properties, Inc., and Lakewood Capital Partners, LP v. American Realty Capital Properties, Inc., at a cost to the company of approximately $765.5 mln, comprised of a contribution of $738.5 mln toward the Class Action settlement and $27.0 mln toward the Opt Out Action settlements.On September 8, 2019, the company signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) providing for the settlement of the Class Action. The Class Action settlement will resolve the claims by class plaintiffs relating to the disclosures made by the company in October 2014 and March 2015 regarding its financial statements, which included the company's March 2015 restatement of certain of its previously issued financial statements.Pursuant to the terms of the Class Action MOU, certain defendants have agreed to pay in the aggregate $1.025 bln, comprised of contributions from the company's former external manager and its principals totaling $225.0 mln, $12.5 mln from the company's former chief financial officer, $49.0 mln from the company's former auditor, and the balance of $738.5 mln from the company. At the same time, in conjunction with the Class Action settlement, the company entered into an MOU providing for the settlement of the derivative action lawsuit currently pending in the Southern District of New York captioned Witchko v. Schorsch. The Derivative Action settlement will resolve the allegations brought by the derivative plaintiffs and is also subject to completing definitive documentation to be filed with the court. The Derivative Action settlement is subject to court approval and is conditioned on approval of the Class Action settlement.On September 6 and September 9, 2019, the company also entered into settlement agreements and releases to settle the Opt Out Actions for a total of $27.0 mln, which are not subject to court approval.

Additionally, the company has decided to discontinue the development of MRT5201, a liver-targeted treatment for OTC deficiency.The company's decision to discontinue the development of MRT5201 for OTC deficiency is based on data from recently completed preclinical studies that do not support the desired pharmacokinetic and safety profile for advancement of the program. These data are related to the first-generation lipid nanoparticle (LNP) designed to be delivered to the liver via intravenous administration for the OTC deficiency program. As such, this LNP is different than that used in the CF and other pulmonary development programs which are designed to deliver the LNP-encapsulated mRNA through nebulization. Additionally, ongoing discovery efforts have generated promising, novel next-generation LNPs supporting the further development of liver disease mRNA therapeutics with potentially favorable product profiles.The company's prioritization of pulmonary diseases is supported by the previously reported positive single-ascending dose Phase 1/2 data from the CF program, which utilizes its proprietary lung delivery platform. MRT5005 is a first-in-class mRNA therapeutic designed to address the underlying cause of CF regardless of genetic mutation by delivering mRNA encoding fully functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein to cells in the lung through nebulization. The multiple-ascending dose portion of the clinical trial is ongoing with data expected in 2020.16:08CASY Casey's General beats by $0.28, beats on revs; reaffirms guidance (167.30 -2.03)Reports Q1 (Jul) earnings of $2.31 per share, $0.28 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.03; revenues rose 1.5% year/year to $2.63 bln vs the $2.59 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperforms for the second straight day.Today's action has reflected much of yesterday's value trade that benefits underperforming areas of the stock market, most notably the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.8%) and SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.36, +0.93, +2.2%). An upturn in Boeing (BA 366.34, +7.56, +2.1%) and many of the transportation stocks has had a similar effect on the industrials sector (+0.5%).The gains in these areas, however, are coming at the expense of crowded groups like the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.9%), which is the S&P 500's most heavily-weighted sector. The real estate sector (-1.7%), which investors had piled into for its higher dividend yields and low-beta disposition, is today's worst performer.Allowing today's value trade to play out are the improved views on trade and growth, which have helped some money flow out of the Treasury market and drive yields higher. The 2-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.64%, and the 10-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.35.Separately, the market saw a sharp uptick on a report from the South China Morning Post indicating that China is ready to purchase more agricultural products from the U.S. The caveat, though, is that China would want the U.S. to agree to delay tariffs and ease its supply ban on Huawei. Nothing material has transpired, but the report likely triggered some algorithms.Some story stocks today include Wendy's (WEN 19.45, -2.50, -11.4%) and Ford Motor (F 9.28, -0.26, -2.9%). Wendy's is down big after the company lowered its earnings guidance to reflect costs needed to expand its breakfast menu nationwide. Ford Motor is down after its senior unsecured debt was downgraded to "junk status" at Moody's.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August declined to 103.1 from 104.7 in July. The August reading was its lowest in five months, but the index remains running at elevated levels.The July Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed that job openings declined to 7.217 million from a revised 7.248 million in June (from 7.348 million).As a reminder, Apple's (AAPL 214.13, -0.10, -0.1%) annual product event is expected to start within the next few minutes.12:54SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: MNK (32.03 mln +62.86%), TEVA (25.92 mln +10.08%), PFE (17.35 mln +0.74%), ENDP (14.29 mln +31.38%)Materials: FCX (18.78 mln +3.56%)Industrials: GE (38.9 mln +1.67%)Consumer Discretionary: F (45.1 mln -2.99%), JCP (16.14 mln +19.76%), ROKU (15.89 mln -4.55%)Information Technology: AMD (26.95 mln -1.27%), MSFT (14.87 mln -1.32%), MU (13.96 mln -0.12%), Financials: BAC (36.95 mln +1.62%), Energy: CHK (71.72 mln +0.53%), SWN (24.77 mln +5.56%), DNR (19.19 mln +10.21%), RIG (18.03 mln +1.19%), ECA (15.04 mln +0.95%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: MNK (3.88x +62.86%), ITCI (3.59x -2.71%), MMSI (2.79x -9.64%), AUPH (2.62x +13.97%), ACAD (2.23x +7.21%)Materials: GSV (2.16x -7.33%)Industrials: MAXR (2.25x +12.52%), MRTN (2.19x +6.15%), HDS (2.07x -6.49%)Consumer Discretionary: WEN (3.6x -11.82%), LAUR (3.49x -6.21%), ASNA (2.58x +18.14%), NLS (2.23x +4.14%)Financials: HLNE (3.09x -5.17%), IGIB (3.07x -0.28%), STC (2.51x -0.99%), NAC (2.31x -1.45%)Consumer Staples: DF (2.53x +27.78%)12:53SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: MNK (3.42 +62.86%), ENDP (4.03 +31.38%), ADAP (2.07 +21.47%), ACOR (3.62 +14.92%), AUPH (6.61 +13.97%), AKBA (4.86 +13.43%), LXRX (1.6 +12.46%), AMRX (3.37 +12.33%), AKRX (3.03 +12.22%), IMMU (14.89 +12.12%), INO (2.44 +11.42%)Industrials: MAXR (7.91 +12.52%)Consumer Discretionary: JCP (1.02 +19.76%), ASNA (0.36 +18.14%), EXPR (2.98 +14.62%)Energy: SDRL (3.33 +16.84%)Consumer Staples: DF (1.5 +27.78%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: MMSI (27.95 -9.64%), NBIX (94.26 -5.74%), NEO (21.51 -5.65%)Materials: GSV (0.92 -7.33%)Industrials: HDS (38.17 -6.49%)Consumer Discretionary: WEN (19.36 -11.82%), LAUR (16.46 -6.21%), LOPE (107.5 -6.09%), SHAK (96.85 -5.66%), RACE (151.97 -5.46%)Information Technology: OLED (189.99 -9.94%), EPAM (180.44 -6.74%), EVTC (33.36 -6.53%), LSCC (19.53 -6.33%), BAH (69.07 -6.24%), FICO (327.82 -6.14%), PAYC (214.88 -6.05%)Financials: MKTX (343.31 -7.14%), QD (7.37 -6.52%)Consumer Staples: TPB (28.67 -5.88%)12:46OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:NLNK Sep 2 calls are seeing interest with the underlying stock up 10% (volume: 2080, open int: 0, implied vol: ~284%, prev day implied vol: 96%).

The shaky start to the week has trimmed the sector's Q3 gain to 2.2%, but the group remains up almost 29.0% for the year, which leaves it well ahead of the remaining ten sectors.Momentum names lagged yesterday, and they are showing relative weakness again today on no news other than the price action itself. To that point, the likes of Synopsys (SNPS 135.61, -5.65, -4.0%), Visa (V 175.35, -6.20, -3.4%), MasterCard (MA 273.42, -9.94, -3.5%), Fiserv (FISV 103.26, -3.42, -3.2%), Global Payments (GPN 165.77, -5.03, -2.9%), and Automatic Data Processing (ADP 162.96, -5.09, -3.0%) show losses between 3.5% and 4.0% after hitting record highs in recent days.Top-weighted sector components have fared a bit better. For instance, Apple (AAPL 213.40, -0.77, -0.4%) is down just 0.4% ahead of an upcoming product reveal while Alphabet (GOOGL 1202.35, -2.93, -0.2%) shows a slimmer loss. Microsoft (MSFT 135.35, -2.15, -1.6%), however, is down more than 1.5%.The technology sector traded beneath its 50-day moving average at today's low point, but it is currently back above that level, which has acted as an area of congestion over the past month.12:02TALKX Market Briefing: Hold the trade deal enthusiasmThe stock market has gotten a nice pop following a South China Morning Post report indicating China is open to agreeing to buy more agricultural products from the U.S. in a lead up to the October trade meeting in Washington. Tucked inside the same article is a qualifier, however, that China would like to do this in exchange for the U.S. dialing back its restrictions on Huawei and delaying the tariff increases it has planned.In other words, it's a familiar page from the trade playbook, only this play hasn't really gained any yardage in the past.The market (or maybe the algorithms) reacted to the headline with a knee-jerk buying effort, but there isn't much of a basis to run with this news as a major breakthrough since it isn't one. That doesn't mean this market can't, or won't, make more out of the headline than it's worth since it has rallied of late on a sense of relief that neither China nor the U.S. seems intent at this juncture on escalating the trade war even further.Still, this shouldn't be construed as a material development.The Russell 2000 is up 0.8%; the Dow Jones industrial Average is flat; the S&P 500 is down 0.5%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.5%.11:51SCANX Stocks that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (49) outpacing new lows (15) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ABG, ACM, ACRE, AMBA, AN, APO, ARCC, ARNC, AY, AYR, BF.B, BRC, BRX, BX, CASH, CCRN, CE, CHH, CIO, CPRX, CY, DCOM, DRRX, GL, GNRC, HTH, HTLD, ITI, ITRI, KIM, KSU, LM, NVMI, NYCB, OKE, PFNX, PSXP, PTGX, SAH, SAIA, SFL, SITC, SSW, STNG, STWD, SUM, SYY, TROW, WUStocks that traded to 52 week lows: BERY, BMRN, ENTA, FVRR, ILMN, LGND, LVGO, LYFT, MMSI, PD, REGN, RUBY, TRXC, VAPO, WMGIThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AGM, ALG, CMBM, IMKTA, NNI, SAR, TIPTThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: ESTA, HSKA, KRTX11:30XERS Xeris Pharmaceuticals receives FDA approval for GVOKE injection for severe hypoglycemia (shares halted) (11.04 +0.10)Xeris Pharmaceuticals has received regulatory approval from the FDA for GVOKE (glucagon) injection, its ready-to-use, room-temperature stable liquid glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in pediatric and adult patients with diabetes ages 2 years and above. GVOKE is the first glucagon product approved that can be administered via a prefilled syringe (GVOKE PFS) or auto-injector (GVOKE HypoPen), reducing the steps to prepare and administer glucagon in the event of severe hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar levels. The FDA's approval is based on positive results from three Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy, safety, and utility of GVOKE in treating severe hypoglycemia when compared with conventional glucagon emergency kits among adults and children with type 1 diabetes.The company is preparing to introduce GVOKE in two different administration options to accommodate the community's preferences, starting with its pre-filled syringe in 4-6 weeks and the auto-injector in 2020.Xeris also has entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and Silicon Valley Bank. The agreement increases the borrowing base from $45 mln to up to $85 mln and extends the maturity date of the debt to as late as June 2024, if the second tranche is drawn.11:30BONDX New SupplyTreasury Auction Preview$38 bln 3-year Treasury note auction (results at 13:00 ET) Prior auction results: High yield: 1.562% Bid-to-cover: 2.41 Indirect bid: 46.7% Direct bid: 19.3% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.407% Bid-to-cover: 2.53 Indirect bid: 46.9% Direct bid: 14.2%11:17SPY Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary of State Pompeo and National Security Advisor Bolton will hold a media briefing at 13:30; topic unknown11:15SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Merit Medical (MMSI) sinks following downgrade -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersENDP (3.72 +21.01%): Continued volatility; the stock recovers yesterday's losses and proceeds to its new highest levels in almost two months.

Revenue is expected to decrease 18.7% yr/yr to $1.34 bln. The company reiterated its FY20 guidance on June 4, priming the market for revenue between $7.46 bln and $7.87 bln. The last three months saw just a handful of noteworthy game releases, which likely presented a headwind to overall store traffic in Q2. There are more big titles scheduled to be released in the fall and in early 2020, which should be a positive for the company's outlook.Shares of GME hit a fresh record low in mid-August amid dimming prospects for a meaningful turnaround. The stock recovered from that low over the past couple weeks, aided by comments from investor Michael Burry, who revealed that his fund owns 3% of outstanding shares of GME. Mr. Burry's view is based on the expectation that the next generation of consoles will not do away with physical Blu-ray drives. While the decision to keep physical drives would be a positive for GME, the company would still need to compete with large retailers like Best Buy (BBY 68.95, -0.27, -0.4%), Target (TGT 107.56, -0.39, -0.4%), and Walmart (WMT 116.02, -0.31, -0.3%) at a time when GME has been closing many of its locations.10:18AAPL Apple September product event previewApple is set to unveil new products today at 13:00 ET. Most of these products will have very incremental upgrades. Most of the attention for shareholders will be placed to the pricing of the company's Apple TV Plus and Apple Arcade services. Apple stock is up 35% year-to-date vs. a 22.5% gain in the Nasdaq 100. The stock remains near the high end of its recent range and less than 10% from its all-time high.iPhones: The company is expected to release three new iPhones. The first iPhone will likely be called the iPhone 11 and will feature a 6.1-inch LCD screen similar to the iPhone XR that is currently on sale. The other two phones will be called the iPhone 11 Pro and will feature organic light-emitting diode displays similar to the iPhone Xs and Xs Max. The iPhone 11 Pro will come in two sizes: 5.8 and 6.5 inches. The phones are expected to feature faster processors and better cameras. However, these phones will likely only have incremental improvements as Apple is expected to unveil its 5G iPhone in 2020. Analysts are expecting pricing similar to prior models between $749-1099.Services: Apple could confirm the pricing for its gaming and TV services and introduce additional content expected for those services. It has been reported by several sources that the gaming service will cost $4.99/month and the TV service will cost $9.99/month. Apple will have to compete with other streaming offerings from Disney (DIS) which will be priced lower.Apple Watch 5: The updated smartwatch is expected to feature a ceramic design, faster processors, and more health features such as sleep tracking.Mac: Apple is expected to introduce a 16-inch Mac Book Pro.iPads: There is some speculation that Apple will update its iPad Pro lineup with faster processors and larger screens. However, some analysts feel the iPad will get its own event in October.Other Products: Apple could introduce Apple "tracking tags" that will allow users to find lost items. Expectations are for another underwhelming iPhone cycle ahead of next year's 5G offering. Analysts note that there is a lot of pent up demand with many older iPhones in the installed base. Therefore, there is an expectation for a super cycle for the 5G handset next year. Still, the investment thesis has shifted from iPhone cycles to a more diversified set of hardware and services. Last quarter, iPhone sales fell to less than 50% of revenue for the first time as the success of services, iPads, AirPods, and the Apple Watch picked up the slack for falling iPhone sales. Apple's earnings are expected to grow 10% next year after falling 2% in fiscal 2019, which concludes this month. With a $943 bln market cap, the stock trades at ~17x earnings, or ~15x, backing out the cash.Suppliers to keep on note include: SSNLF, LPL (for displays) and LITE, FNSR and IIVI (for FaceID.) Other suppliers include: SWKS, CRUS, AVGO, QRVO, TSM, and QCOM, among others.

Patients 02002 and 02006 were treated with higher dose levels of RP-L102. Patients 02004 and 02005 received non-optimized and lower doses of RP-L102. Key highlights of the manuscript include:Follow-up data for the initial four patients 18-30 months post-infusion demonstrate progressively increased engraftment in peripheral blood leukocytes and in the bone marrow following administration of RP-L102 without the use of conditioning. In Patient 02002 at 30 months follow-up, approximately 44% of bone marrow CD34+ cells displayed gene marking, suggesting the engraftment of very primitive corrected hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Sequential increases in gene marking in peripheral blood and in the bone marrow for Patients 02004 and 02005 were also seen, but at more modest levels and after longer durations. The bone marrow resistance to MMC in Patient 02002 increased to 70% at 24 months, approaching the phenotype of a healthy donor. Patients 02004, 02005 and 02006 also displayed progressive increases in MMC resistance. DEB exposure resulted in a lower proportion of cells with aberrant chromosomes in Patients 02002, 02004 and 02006. Patient 02002 demonstrated stabilized neutrophil counts and hemoglobin levels as early as six months post-administration of RP-L102. Similar trends were also seen in Patient 02006. Progressive increases in the total number of corrected leukocytes were observed shortly after the initial administration of RP-L102 in all treated patients. Favorable safety profile with no serious adverse events associated with infusion of the investigational product in these initial four patients.07:08STOR STORE Capital increases quarterly dividend to $0.35/share from $0.33/share (37.08 )07:07STC Stewart Info confirms termination of Fidelity National (FNF) merger, names new CEO (33.77 )In light of the FTC's decision, the Stewart Board has clearly determined that leveraging the company's strong brand, financial position, and valued employees to grow the organization as a standalone entity will create the greatest shareholder value.

NfL is a protein that provides structural support to nerve fibres in the brain. An increase in the amount of NfL may be associated with nerve cell damage, and detection of increased NfL levels in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may serve as a biomarker of nerve cell damage.In the Phase III OPERA I study in RMS and the ORATORIO study in PPMS, blood NfL levels were significantly lower after treatment with OCREVUS. In RMS, blood serum NfL levels were reduced by 43 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with a 31 percent reduction with interferon beta-1a (p<0.001). In PPMS, blood plasma NfL levels were reduced by 16 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with 0.2 percent reduction with placebo (p<0.001). Additionally, these analyses showed higher blood NfL levels at the start of the study were correlated with more disability progression in upper and lower limbs in PPMS and overall disability in the interferon beta-1a RMS treatment group at 96 weeks.06:03FTS Fortis announces five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 bln for the period 2020 to 2024, increases quarterly dividend to $0.4775/share from $0.45/share (42.08 )The co announced its five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 billion for the period 2020 to 2024, up $1.0 billion from the prior year's plan.

Reduction in the composite porphyria attack rate with givosiran treatment, which had been observed in the ENVISION Phase 3 study as early as one month after dosing, was shown to be sustained with continued dosing in the OLE phase of the study. Sustained reduction in levels of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), an intermediate in the heme biosynthesis pathway believed to be the primary neurotoxic intermediate responsible for causing both porphyria attacks and ongoing symptoms in between attacks, was also observed with continued dosing. Rapid and sustained lowering of attack rate and ALA levels was also observed in placebo patients who crossed over after the six-month double blind phase of the ENVISION Phase 3 study to receive givosiran in the OLE phase of the study. Givosiran's safety profile in the OLE phase has remained consistent with the profile observed in the double blind phase of the ENVISION study.ENVISION Results of Select Patient Reported Outcomes -- A number of patient reported outcomes were collected as secondary and exploratory measures in the ENVISION study. Daily worst pain did not achieve statistical significance based on the prespecified ANCOVA analysis (p equals 0.0530), however, the data were found to not be normally distributed. A post-hoc analysis of daily worst pain was therefore performed using the non-parametric stratified Wilcoxon test. Based on the non-parametric test, patients on givosiran had a significant reduction in daily worst pain (nominal p equals 0.0455). In exploratory analyses, the reductions in pain were accompanied by fewer days of use of both opioid and non-opioid analgesics. Givosiran did not impact daily worst fatigue or daily worst nausea at six months, although these assessments will be repeated at twelve months to explore the effects of longer term dosing. Updated Phase 1/2 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of April 19, 2019, a robust treatment effect was maintained in givosiran-treated patients with continued dosing in the Phase 1/2 OLE study (N=16), with a mean time on treatment of 22.8 months and total time on treatment across the Phase 1 and OLE studies of up to 35 months. Substantial mean reductions in annualized attack rate (AAR) and in annualized hemin use of greater than 90 percent were observed, with evidence for sustained or potentially enhanced clinical activity with continued dosing. Five out of twelve patients (42 percent) who received givosiran during the Phase 1 study and continued with givosiran dosing in the OLE study and two out of four patients (50 percent) who had been in the placebo arm of the Phase 1 study and crossed over to givosiran treatment in the OLE study achieved an AAR of zero for a mean of 18.1 and 24.9 months, respectively.06:00ACN Accenture acquires Pragsis Bidoop; terms not disclosed (194.83 )Pragsis Bidoop, headquartered in Madrid with additional offices in Barcelona and the U.K., will add more than 200 employees with deep machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data engineering experience, along with its portfolio of end-to-end solutions, to Accenture's Applied Intelligence business.06:00ASX ASE Technology reports August net revenues +10.3% yr/yr to $1.28 bln (4.51 )06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets ease back; S&P Futures take out yesterday's lowThe global equity markets are under slight pressure to start the day.

In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD16:20IMXI International Money Express announces secondary public offering of 5,217,392 shares of common stock by selling stockholders (13.60 -0.55)Shares will be offered by affiliates of Stella Point Capital and certain of the company's other stockholders.

Additionally, the company has decided to discontinue the development of MRT5201, a liver-targeted treatment for OTC deficiency.The company's decision to discontinue the development of MRT5201 for OTC deficiency is based on data from recently completed preclinical studies that do not support the desired pharmacokinetic and safety profile for advancement of the program. These data are related to the first-generation lipid nanoparticle (LNP) designed to be delivered to the liver via intravenous administration for the OTC deficiency program. As such, this LNP is different than that used in the CF and other pulmonary development programs which are designed to deliver the LNP-encapsulated mRNA through nebulization. Additionally, ongoing discovery efforts have generated promising, novel next-generation LNPs supporting the further development of liver disease mRNA therapeutics with potentially favorable product profiles.The company's prioritization of pulmonary diseases is supported by the previously reported positive single-ascending dose Phase 1/2 data from the CF program, which utilizes its proprietary lung delivery platform. MRT5005 is a first-in-class mRNA therapeutic designed to address the underlying cause of CF regardless of genetic mutation by delivering mRNA encoding fully functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein to cells in the lung through nebulization. The multiple-ascending dose portion of the clinical trial is ongoing with data expected in 2020.16:08CASY Casey's General beats by $0.28, beats on revs; reaffirms guidance (167.30 -2.03)Reports Q1 (Jul) earnings of $2.31 per share, $0.28 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.03; revenues rose 1.5% year/year to $2.63 bln vs the $2.59 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Co also disclosed a recent insider purchase from its Chief Scientific Officer, who bought 15,000 shares worth circa $260K. (Related: IMMU, MRNA, AGIO...)ACAD (41.02 +5.59%): Continued strength following interim efficacy analysis updates from its Phase 3 HARMONY trial for pimavanserin (NUPLAZID). Upgraded to Buy from Hold and price target raised to $50 at Canaccord Genuity, citing a belief that co, in light of the DRP indication results, presents scarcity value for strategic interests in the neuro space.FSLY (28.71 +5.45%): Continued volatility; the stock had pulled back circa 19% in the prior two sessions after reaching a new all-time high.Mid Cap LosersWEN (19.57 -10.87%): Announced that it will launch its breakfast menu across its US system in 2020; the menu is currently available in 300+ restaurants. Owing to upfront investment expenses amounting to approx. $20 mln associated with the national breakfast daypart entry, co updated certain aspects of its 2019 outlook, lowering its view for adj. EBITDA and adj. EPS, now calling for losses vs previous guidance for growth, as well as for cash flows from operations and free cash flow. Co is also removing its standing 2020 goals; it intends to update its long-term guidance during its Investor Day in October.OLED (189.15 -10.33%): The stock pulls back on more than 2x average volume from all-time highs established above $230 on Friday.

The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperforms for the second straight day.Today's action has reflected much of yesterday's value trade that benefits underperforming areas of the stock market, most notably the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.8%) and SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.36, +0.93, +2.2%). An upturn in Boeing (BA 366.34, +7.56, +2.1%) and many of the transportation stocks has had a similar effect on the industrials sector (+0.5%).The gains in these areas, however, are coming at the expense of crowded groups like the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.9%), which is the S&P 500's most heavily-weighted sector. The real estate sector (-1.7%), which investors had piled into for its higher dividend yields and low-beta disposition, is today's worst performer.Allowing today's value trade to play out are the improved views on trade and growth, which have helped some money flow out of the Treasury market and drive yields higher. The 2-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.64%, and the 10-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.35.Separately, the market saw a sharp uptick on a report from the South China Morning Post indicating that China is ready to purchase more agricultural products from the U.S. The caveat, though, is that China would want the U.S. to agree to delay tariffs and ease its supply ban on Huawei. Nothing material has transpired, but the report likely triggered some algorithms.Some story stocks today include Wendy's (WEN 19.45, -2.50, -11.4%) and Ford Motor (F 9.28, -0.26, -2.9%). Wendy's is down big after the company lowered its earnings guidance to reflect costs needed to expand its breakfast menu nationwide. Ford Motor is down after its senior unsecured debt was downgraded to "junk status" at Moody's.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August declined to 103.1 from 104.7 in July. The August reading was its lowest in five months, but the index remains running at elevated levels.The July Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed that job openings declined to 7.217 million from a revised 7.248 million in June (from 7.348 million).As a reminder, Apple's (AAPL 214.13, -0.10, -0.1%) annual product event is expected to start within the next few minutes.12:54SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: MNK (32.03 mln +62.86%), TEVA (25.92 mln +10.08%), PFE (17.35 mln +0.74%), ENDP (14.29 mln +31.38%)Materials: FCX (18.78 mln +3.56%)Industrials: GE (38.9 mln +1.67%)Consumer Discretionary: F (45.1 mln -2.99%), JCP (16.14 mln +19.76%), ROKU (15.89 mln -4.55%)Information Technology: AMD (26.95 mln -1.27%), MSFT (14.87 mln -1.32%), MU (13.96 mln -0.12%), Financials: BAC (36.95 mln +1.62%), Energy: CHK (71.72 mln +0.53%), SWN (24.77 mln +5.56%), DNR (19.19 mln +10.21%), RIG (18.03 mln +1.19%), ECA (15.04 mln +0.95%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: MNK (3.88x +62.86%), ITCI (3.59x -2.71%), MMSI (2.79x -9.64%), AUPH (2.62x +13.97%), ACAD (2.23x +7.21%)Materials: GSV (2.16x -7.33%)Industrials: MAXR (2.25x +12.52%), MRTN (2.19x +6.15%), HDS (2.07x -6.49%)Consumer Discretionary: WEN (3.6x -11.82%), LAUR (3.49x -6.21%), ASNA (2.58x +18.14%), NLS (2.23x +4.14%)Financials: HLNE (3.09x -5.17%), IGIB (3.07x -0.28%), STC (2.51x -0.99%), NAC (2.31x -1.45%)Consumer Staples: DF (2.53x +27.78%)12:53SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: MNK (3.42 +62.86%), ENDP (4.03 +31.38%), ADAP (2.07 +21.47%), ACOR (3.62 +14.92%), AUPH (6.61 +13.97%), AKBA (4.86 +13.43%), LXRX (1.6 +12.46%), AMRX (3.37 +12.33%), AKRX (3.03 +12.22%), IMMU (14.89 +12.12%), INO (2.44 +11.42%)Industrials: MAXR (7.91 +12.52%)Consumer Discretionary: JCP (1.02 +19.76%), ASNA (0.36 +18.14%), EXPR (2.98 +14.62%)Energy: SDRL (3.33 +16.84%)Consumer Staples: DF (1.5 +27.78%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: MMSI (27.95 -9.64%), NBIX (94.26 -5.74%), NEO (21.51 -5.65%)Materials: GSV (0.92 -7.33%)Industrials: HDS (38.17 -6.49%)Consumer Discretionary: WEN (19.36 -11.82%), LAUR (16.46 -6.21%), LOPE (107.5 -6.09%), SHAK (96.85 -5.66%), RACE (151.97 -5.46%)Information Technology: OLED (189.99 -9.94%), EPAM (180.44 -6.74%), EVTC (33.36 -6.53%), LSCC (19.53 -6.33%), BAH (69.07 -6.24%), FICO (327.82 -6.14%), PAYC (214.88 -6.05%)Financials: MKTX (343.31 -7.14%), QD (7.37 -6.52%)Consumer Staples: TPB (28.67 -5.88%)12:46OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:NLNK Sep 2 calls are seeing interest with the underlying stock up 10% (volume: 2080, open int: 0, implied vol: ~284%, prev day implied vol: 96%).

The shaky start to the week has trimmed the sector's Q3 gain to 2.2%, but the group remains up almost 29.0% for the year, which leaves it well ahead of the remaining ten sectors.Momentum names lagged yesterday, and they are showing relative weakness again today on no news other than the price action itself. To that point, the likes of Synopsys (SNPS 135.61, -5.65, -4.0%), Visa (V 175.35, -6.20, -3.4%), MasterCard (MA 273.42, -9.94, -3.5%), Fiserv (FISV 103.26, -3.42, -3.2%), Global Payments (GPN 165.77, -5.03, -2.9%), and Automatic Data Processing (ADP 162.96, -5.09, -3.0%) show losses between 3.5% and 4.0% after hitting record highs in recent days.Top-weighted sector components have fared a bit better. For instance, Apple (AAPL 213.40, -0.77, -0.4%) is down just 0.4% ahead of an upcoming product reveal while Alphabet (GOOGL 1202.35, -2.93, -0.2%) shows a slimmer loss. Microsoft (MSFT 135.35, -2.15, -1.6%), however, is down more than 1.5%.The technology sector traded beneath its 50-day moving average at today's low point, but it is currently back above that level, which has acted as an area of congestion over the past month.12:02TALKX Market Briefing: Hold the trade deal enthusiasmThe stock market has gotten a nice pop following a South China Morning Post report indicating China is open to agreeing to buy more agricultural products from the U.S. in a lead up to the October trade meeting in Washington. Tucked inside the same article is a qualifier, however, that China would like to do this in exchange for the U.S. dialing back its restrictions on Huawei and delaying the tariff increases it has planned.In other words, it's a familiar page from the trade playbook, only this play hasn't really gained any yardage in the past.The market (or maybe the algorithms) reacted to the headline with a knee-jerk buying effort, but there isn't much of a basis to run with this news as a major breakthrough since it isn't one. That doesn't mean this market can't, or won't, make more out of the headline than it's worth since it has rallied of late on a sense of relief that neither China nor the U.S. seems intent at this juncture on escalating the trade war even further.Still, this shouldn't be construed as a material development.The Russell 2000 is up 0.8%; the Dow Jones industrial Average is flat; the S&P 500 is down 0.5%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.5%.11:51SCANX Stocks that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (49) outpacing new lows (15) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ABG, ACM, ACRE, AMBA, AN, APO, ARCC, ARNC, AY, AYR, BF.B, BRC, BRX, BX, CASH, CCRN, CE, CHH, CIO, CPRX, CY, DCOM, DRRX, GL, GNRC, HTH, HTLD, ITI, ITRI, KIM, KSU, LM, NVMI, NYCB, OKE, PFNX, PSXP, PTGX, SAH, SAIA, SFL, SITC, SSW, STNG, STWD, SUM, SYY, TROW, WUStocks that traded to 52 week lows: BERY, BMRN, ENTA, FVRR, ILMN, LGND, LVGO, LYFT, MMSI, PD, REGN, RUBY, TRXC, VAPO, WMGIThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AGM, ALG, CMBM, IMKTA, NNI, SAR, TIPTThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: ESTA, HSKA, KRTX11:30XERS Xeris Pharmaceuticals receives FDA approval for GVOKE injection for severe hypoglycemia (shares halted) (11.04 +0.10)Xeris Pharmaceuticals has received regulatory approval from the FDA for GVOKE (glucagon) injection, its ready-to-use, room-temperature stable liquid glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in pediatric and adult patients with diabetes ages 2 years and above. GVOKE is the first glucagon product approved that can be administered via a prefilled syringe (GVOKE PFS) or auto-injector (GVOKE HypoPen), reducing the steps to prepare and administer glucagon in the event of severe hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar levels. The FDA's approval is based on positive results from three Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy, safety, and utility of GVOKE in treating severe hypoglycemia when compared with conventional glucagon emergency kits among adults and children with type 1 diabetes.The company is preparing to introduce GVOKE in two different administration options to accommodate the community's preferences, starting with its pre-filled syringe in 4-6 weeks and the auto-injector in 2020.Xeris also has entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and Silicon Valley Bank.

Revenue is expected to decrease 18.7% yr/yr to $1.34 bln. The company reiterated its FY20 guidance on June 4, priming the market for revenue between $7.46 bln and $7.87 bln. The last three months saw just a handful of noteworthy game releases, which likely presented a headwind to overall store traffic in Q2. There are more big titles scheduled to be released in the fall and in early 2020, which should be a positive for the company's outlook.Shares of GME hit a fresh record low in mid-August amid dimming prospects for a meaningful turnaround. The stock recovered from that low over the past couple weeks, aided by comments from investor Michael Burry, who revealed that his fund owns 3% of outstanding shares of GME. Mr. Burry's view is based on the expectation that the next generation of consoles will not do away with physical Blu-ray drives. While the decision to keep physical drives would be a positive for GME, the company would still need to compete with large retailers like Best Buy (BBY 68.95, -0.27, -0.4%), Target (TGT 107.56, -0.39, -0.4%), and Walmart (WMT 116.02, -0.31, -0.3%) at a time when GME has been closing many of its locations.10:18AAPL Apple September product event previewApple is set to unveil new products today at 13:00 ET. Most of these products will have very incremental upgrades. Most of the attention for shareholders will be placed to the pricing of the company's Apple TV Plus and Apple Arcade services. Apple stock is up 35% year-to-date vs. a 22.5% gain in the Nasdaq 100. The stock remains near the high end of its recent range and less than 10% from its all-time high.iPhones: The company is expected to release three new iPhones. The first iPhone will likely be called the iPhone 11 and will feature a 6.1-inch LCD screen similar to the iPhone XR that is currently on sale. The other two phones will be called the iPhone 11 Pro and will feature organic light-emitting diode displays similar to the iPhone Xs and Xs Max. The iPhone 11 Pro will come in two sizes: 5.8 and 6.5 inches. The phones are expected to feature faster processors and better cameras. However, these phones will likely only have incremental improvements as Apple is expected to unveil its 5G iPhone in 2020. Analysts are expecting pricing similar to prior models between $749-1099.Services: Apple could confirm the pricing for its gaming and TV services and introduce additional content expected for those services. It has been reported by several sources that the gaming service will cost $4.99/month and the TV service will cost $9.99/month. Apple will have to compete with other streaming offerings from Disney (DIS) which will be priced lower.Apple Watch 5: The updated smartwatch is expected to feature a ceramic design, faster processors, and more health features such as sleep tracking.Mac: Apple is expected to introduce a 16-inch Mac Book Pro.iPads: There is some speculation that Apple will update its iPad Pro lineup with faster processors and larger screens. However, some analysts feel the iPad will get its own event in October.Other Products: Apple could introduce Apple "tracking tags" that will allow users to find lost items. Expectations are for another underwhelming iPhone cycle ahead of next year's 5G offering. Analysts note that there is a lot of pent up demand with many older iPhones in the installed base. Therefore, there is an expectation for a super cycle for the 5G handset next year. Still, the investment thesis has shifted from iPhone cycles to a more diversified set of hardware and services. Last quarter, iPhone sales fell to less than 50% of revenue for the first time as the success of services, iPads, AirPods, and the Apple Watch picked up the slack for falling iPhone sales. Apple's earnings are expected to grow 10% next year after falling 2% in fiscal 2019, which concludes this month. With a $943 bln market cap, the stock trades at ~17x earnings, or ~15x, backing out the cash.Suppliers to keep on note include: SSNLF, LPL (for displays) and LITE, FNSR and IIVI (for FaceID.) Other suppliers include: SWKS, CRUS, AVGO, QRVO, TSM, and QCOM, among others.

Patients 02002 and 02006 were treated with higher dose levels of RP-L102. Patients 02004 and 02005 received non-optimized and lower doses of RP-L102. Key highlights of the manuscript include:Follow-up data for the initial four patients 18-30 months post-infusion demonstrate progressively increased engraftment in peripheral blood leukocytes and in the bone marrow following administration of RP-L102 without the use of conditioning. In Patient 02002 at 30 months follow-up, approximately 44% of bone marrow CD34+ cells displayed gene marking, suggesting the engraftment of very primitive corrected hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Sequential increases in gene marking in peripheral blood and in the bone marrow for Patients 02004 and 02005 were also seen, but at more modest levels and after longer durations. The bone marrow resistance to MMC in Patient 02002 increased to 70% at 24 months, approaching the phenotype of a healthy donor. Patients 02004, 02005 and 02006 also displayed progressive increases in MMC resistance. DEB exposure resulted in a lower proportion of cells with aberrant chromosomes in Patients 02002, 02004 and 02006. Patient 02002 demonstrated stabilized neutrophil counts and hemoglobin levels as early as six months post-administration of RP-L102. Similar trends were also seen in Patient 02006. Progressive increases in the total number of corrected leukocytes were observed shortly after the initial administration of RP-L102 in all treated patients. Favorable safety profile with no serious adverse events associated with infusion of the investigational product in these initial four patients.07:08STOR STORE Capital increases quarterly dividend to $0.35/share from $0.33/share (37.08 )07:07STC Stewart Info confirms termination of Fidelity National (FNF) merger, names new CEO (33.77 )In light of the FTC's decision, the Stewart Board has clearly determined that leveraging the company's strong brand, financial position, and valued employees to grow the organization as a standalone entity will create the greatest shareholder value.

NfL is a protein that provides structural support to nerve fibres in the brain. An increase in the amount of NfL may be associated with nerve cell damage, and detection of increased NfL levels in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may serve as a biomarker of nerve cell damage.In the Phase III OPERA I study in RMS and the ORATORIO study in PPMS, blood NfL levels were significantly lower after treatment with OCREVUS. In RMS, blood serum NfL levels were reduced by 43 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with a 31 percent reduction with interferon beta-1a (p<0.001). In PPMS, blood plasma NfL levels were reduced by 16 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with 0.2 percent reduction with placebo (p<0.001). Additionally, these analyses showed higher blood NfL levels at the start of the study were correlated with more disability progression in upper and lower limbs in PPMS and overall disability in the interferon beta-1a RMS treatment group at 96 weeks.06:03FTS Fortis announces five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 bln for the period 2020 to 2024, increases quarterly dividend to $0.4775/share from $0.45/share (42.08 )The co announced its five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 billion for the period 2020 to 2024, up $1.0 billion from the prior year's plan.

Reduction in the composite porphyria attack rate with givosiran treatment, which had been observed in the ENVISION Phase 3 study as early as one month after dosing, was shown to be sustained with continued dosing in the OLE phase of the study. Sustained reduction in levels of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), an intermediate in the heme biosynthesis pathway believed to be the primary neurotoxic intermediate responsible for causing both porphyria attacks and ongoing symptoms in between attacks, was also observed with continued dosing. Rapid and sustained lowering of attack rate and ALA levels was also observed in placebo patients who crossed over after the six-month double blind phase of the ENVISION Phase 3 study to receive givosiran in the OLE phase of the study. Givosiran's safety profile in the OLE phase has remained consistent with the profile observed in the double blind phase of the ENVISION study.ENVISION Results of Select Patient Reported Outcomes -- A number of patient reported outcomes were collected as secondary and exploratory measures in the ENVISION study. Daily worst pain did not achieve statistical significance based on the prespecified ANCOVA analysis (p equals 0.0530), however, the data were found to not be normally distributed. A post-hoc analysis of daily worst pain was therefore performed using the non-parametric stratified Wilcoxon test. Based on the non-parametric test, patients on givosiran had a significant reduction in daily worst pain (nominal p equals 0.0455). In exploratory analyses, the reductions in pain were accompanied by fewer days of use of both opioid and non-opioid analgesics. Givosiran did not impact daily worst fatigue or daily worst nausea at six months, although these assessments will be repeated at twelve months to explore the effects of longer term dosing. Updated Phase 1/2 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of April 19, 2019, a robust treatment effect was maintained in givosiran-treated patients with continued dosing in the Phase 1/2 OLE study (N=16), with a mean time on treatment of 22.8 months and total time on treatment across the Phase 1 and OLE studies of up to 35 months. Substantial mean reductions in annualized attack rate (AAR) and in annualized hemin use of greater than 90 percent were observed, with evidence for sustained or potentially enhanced clinical activity with continued dosing. Five out of twelve patients (42 percent) who received givosiran during the Phase 1 study and continued with givosiran dosing in the OLE study and two out of four patients (50 percent) who had been in the placebo arm of the Phase 1 study and crossed over to givosiran treatment in the OLE study achieved an AAR of zero for a mean of 18.1 and 24.9 months, respectively.06:00ACN Accenture acquires Pragsis Bidoop; terms not disclosed (194.83 )Pragsis Bidoop, headquartered in Madrid with additional offices in Barcelona and the U.K., will add more than 200 employees with deep machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data engineering experience, along with its portfolio of end-to-end solutions, to Accenture's Applied Intelligence business.06:00ASX ASE Technology reports August net revenues +10.3% yr/yr to $1.28 bln (4.51 )06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets ease back; S&P Futures take out yesterday's lowThe global equity markets are under slight pressure to start the day.

In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD16:20IMXI International Money Express announces secondary public offering of 5,217,392 shares of common stock by selling stockholders (13.60 -0.55)Shares will be offered by affiliates of Stella Point Capital and certain of the company's other stockholders.

Additionally, the company has decided to discontinue the development of MRT5201, a liver-targeted treatment for OTC deficiency.The company's decision to discontinue the development of MRT5201 for OTC deficiency is based on data from recently completed preclinical studies that do not support the desired pharmacokinetic and safety profile for advancement of the program. These data are related to the first-generation lipid nanoparticle (LNP) designed to be delivered to the liver via intravenous administration for the OTC deficiency program. As such, this LNP is different than that used in the CF and other pulmonary development programs which are designed to deliver the LNP-encapsulated mRNA through nebulization. Additionally, ongoing discovery efforts have generated promising, novel next-generation LNPs supporting the further development of liver disease mRNA therapeutics with potentially favorable product profiles.The company's prioritization of pulmonary diseases is supported by the previously reported positive single-ascending dose Phase 1/2 data from the CF program, which utilizes its proprietary lung delivery platform. MRT5005 is a first-in-class mRNA therapeutic designed to address the underlying cause of CF regardless of genetic mutation by delivering mRNA encoding fully functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein to cells in the lung through nebulization. The multiple-ascending dose portion of the clinical trial is ongoing with data expected in 2020.16:08CASY Casey's General beats by $0.28, beats on revs; reaffirms guidance (167.30 -2.03)Reports Q1 (Jul) earnings of $2.31 per share, $0.28 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.03; revenues rose 1.5% year/year to $2.63 bln vs the $2.59 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Co also disclosed a recent insider purchase from its Chief Scientific Officer, who bought 15,000 shares worth circa $260K. (Related: IMMU, MRNA, AGIO...)ACAD (41.02 +5.59%): Continued strength following interim efficacy analysis updates from its Phase 3 HARMONY trial for pimavanserin (NUPLAZID). Upgraded to Buy from Hold and price target raised to $50 at Canaccord Genuity, citing a belief that co, in light of the DRP indication results, presents scarcity value for strategic interests in the neuro space.FSLY (28.71 +5.45%): Continued volatility; the stock had pulled back circa 19% in the prior two sessions after reaching a new all-time high.Mid Cap LosersWEN (19.57 -10.87%): Announced that it will launch its breakfast menu across its US system in 2020; the menu is currently available in 300+ restaurants. Owing to upfront investment expenses amounting to approx. $20 mln associated with the national breakfast daypart entry, co updated certain aspects of its 2019 outlook, lowering its view for adj. EBITDA and adj. EPS, now calling for losses vs previous guidance for growth, as well as for cash flows from operations and free cash flow. Co is also removing its standing 2020 goals; it intends to update its long-term guidance during its Investor Day in October.OLED (189.15 -10.33%): The stock pulls back on more than 2x average volume from all-time highs established above $230 on Friday.

The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperforms for the second straight day.Today's action has reflected much of yesterday's value trade that benefits underperforming areas of the stock market, most notably the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.8%) and SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.36, +0.93, +2.2%). An upturn in Boeing (BA 366.34, +7.56, +2.1%) and many of the transportation stocks has had a similar effect on the industrials sector (+0.5%).The gains in these areas, however, are coming at the expense of crowded groups like the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.9%), which is the S&P 500's most heavily-weighted sector. The real estate sector (-1.7%), which investors had piled into for its higher dividend yields and low-beta disposition, is today's worst performer.Allowing today's value trade to play out are the improved views on trade and growth, which have helped some money flow out of the Treasury market and drive yields higher. The 2-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.64%, and the 10-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.35.Separately, the market saw a sharp uptick on a report from the South China Morning Post indicating that China is ready to purchase more agricultural products from the U.S. The caveat, though, is that China would want the U.S. to agree to delay tariffs and ease its supply ban on Huawei. Nothing material has transpired, but the report likely triggered some algorithms.Some story stocks today include Wendy's (WEN 19.45, -2.50, -11.4%) and Ford Motor (F 9.28, -0.26, -2.9%). Wendy's is down big after the company lowered its earnings guidance to reflect costs needed to expand its breakfast menu nationwide. Ford Motor is down after its senior unsecured debt was downgraded to "junk status" at Moody's.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August declined to 103.1 from 104.7 in July. The August reading was its lowest in five months, but the index remains running at elevated levels.The July Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed that job openings declined to 7.217 million from a revised 7.248 million in June (from 7.348 million).As a reminder, Apple's (AAPL 214.13, -0.10, -0.1%) annual product event is expected to start within the next few minutes.12:54SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: MNK (32.03 mln +62.86%), TEVA (25.92 mln +10.08%), PFE (17.35 mln +0.74%), ENDP (14.29 mln +31.38%)Materials: FCX (18.78 mln +3.56%)Industrials: GE (38.9 mln +1.67%)Consumer Discretionary: F (45.1 mln -2.99%), JCP (16.14 mln +19.76%), ROKU (15.89 mln -4.55%)Information Technology: AMD (26.95 mln -1.27%), MSFT (14.87 mln -1.32%), MU (13.96 mln -0.12%), Financials: BAC (36.95 mln +1.62%), Energy: CHK (71.72 mln +0.53%), SWN (24.77 mln +5.56%), DNR (19.19 mln +10.21%), RIG (18.03 mln +1.19%), ECA (15.04 mln +0.95%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: MNK (3.88x +62.86%), ITCI (3.59x -2.71%), MMSI (2.79x -9.64%), AUPH (2.62x +13.97%), ACAD (2.23x +7.21%)Materials: GSV (2.16x -7.33%)Industrials: MAXR (2.25x +12.52%), MRTN (2.19x +6.15%), HDS (2.07x -6.49%)Consumer Discretionary: WEN (3.6x -11.82%), LAUR (3.49x -6.21%), ASNA (2.58x +18.14%), NLS (2.23x +4.14%)Financials: HLNE (3.09x -5.17%), IGIB (3.07x -0.28%), STC (2.51x -0.99%), NAC (2.31x -1.45%)Consumer Staples: DF (2.53x +27.78%)12:53SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: MNK (3.42 +62.86%), ENDP (4.03 +31.38%), ADAP (2.07 +21.47%), ACOR (3.62 +14.92%), AUPH (6.61 +13.97%), AKBA (4.86 +13.43%), LXRX (1.6 +12.46%), AMRX (3.37 +12.33%), AKRX (3.03 +12.22%), IMMU (14.89 +12.12%), INO (2.44 +11.42%)Industrials: MAXR (7.91 +12.52%)Consumer Discretionary: JCP (1.02 +19.76%), ASNA (0.36 +18.14%), EXPR (2.98 +14.62%)Energy: SDRL (3.33 +16.84%)Consumer Staples: DF (1.5 +27.78%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: MMSI (27.95 -9.64%), NBIX (94.26 -5.74%), NEO (21.51 -5.65%)Materials: GSV (0.92 -7.33%)Industrials: HDS (38.17 -6.49%)Consumer Discretionary: WEN (19.36 -11.82%), LAUR (16.46 -6.21%), LOPE (107.5 -6.09%), SHAK (96.85 -5.66%), RACE (151.97 -5.46%)Information Technology: OLED (189.99 -9.94%), EPAM (180.44 -6.74%), EVTC (33.36 -6.53%), LSCC (19.53 -6.33%), BAH (69.07 -6.24%), FICO (327.82 -6.14%), PAYC (214.88 -6.05%)Financials: MKTX (343.31 -7.14%), QD (7.37 -6.52%)Consumer Staples: TPB (28.67 -5.88%)12:46OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:NLNK Sep 2 calls are seeing interest with the underlying stock up 10% (volume: 2080, open int: 0, implied vol: ~284%, prev day implied vol: 96%).

The shaky start to the week has trimmed the sector's Q3 gain to 2.2%, but the group remains up almost 29.0% for the year, which leaves it well ahead of the remaining ten sectors.Momentum names lagged yesterday, and they are showing relative weakness again today on no news other than the price action itself. To that point, the likes of Synopsys (SNPS 135.61, -5.65, -4.0%), Visa (V 175.35, -6.20, -3.4%), MasterCard (MA 273.42, -9.94, -3.5%), Fiserv (FISV 103.26, -3.42, -3.2%), Global Payments (GPN 165.77, -5.03, -2.9%), and Automatic Data Processing (ADP 162.96, -5.09, -3.0%) show losses between 3.5% and 4.0% after hitting record highs in recent days.Top-weighted sector components have fared a bit better. For instance, Apple (AAPL 213.40, -0.77, -0.4%) is down just 0.4% ahead of an upcoming product reveal while Alphabet (GOOGL 1202.35, -2.93, -0.2%) shows a slimmer loss. Microsoft (MSFT 135.35, -2.15, -1.6%), however, is down more than 1.5%.The technology sector traded beneath its 50-day moving average at today's low point, but it is currently back above that level, which has acted as an area of congestion over the past month.12:02TALKX Market Briefing: Hold the trade deal enthusiasmThe stock market has gotten a nice pop following a South China Morning Post report indicating China is open to agreeing to buy more agricultural products from the U.S. in a lead up to the October trade meeting in Washington. Tucked inside the same article is a qualifier, however, that China would like to do this in exchange for the U.S. dialing back its restrictions on Huawei and delaying the tariff increases it has planned.In other words, it's a familiar page from the trade playbook, only this play hasn't really gained any yardage in the past.The market (or maybe the algorithms) reacted to the headline with a knee-jerk buying effort, but there isn't much of a basis to run with this news as a major breakthrough since it isn't one. That doesn't mean this market can't, or won't, make more out of the headline than it's worth since it has rallied of late on a sense of relief that neither China nor the U.S. seems intent at this juncture on escalating the trade war even further.Still, this shouldn't be construed as a material development.The Russell 2000 is up 0.8%; the Dow Jones industrial Average is flat; the S&P 500 is down 0.5%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.5%.11:51SCANX Stocks that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (49) outpacing new lows (15) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ABG, ACM, ACRE, AMBA, AN, APO, ARCC, ARNC, AY, AYR, BF.B, BRC, BRX, BX, CASH, CCRN, CE, CHH, CIO, CPRX, CY, DCOM, DRRX, GL, GNRC, HTH, HTLD, ITI, ITRI, KIM, KSU, LM, NVMI, NYCB, OKE, PFNX, PSXP, PTGX, SAH, SAIA, SFL, SITC, SSW, STNG, STWD, SUM, SYY, TROW, WUStocks that traded to 52 week lows: BERY, BMRN, ENTA, FVRR, ILMN, LGND, LVGO, LYFT, MMSI, PD, REGN, RUBY, TRXC, VAPO, WMGIThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AGM, ALG, CMBM, IMKTA, NNI, SAR, TIPTThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: ESTA, HSKA, KRTX11:30XERS Xeris Pharmaceuticals receives FDA approval for GVOKE injection for severe hypoglycemia (shares halted) (11.04 +0.10)Xeris Pharmaceuticals has received regulatory approval from the FDA for GVOKE (glucagon) injection, its ready-to-use, room-temperature stable liquid glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in pediatric and adult patients with diabetes ages 2 years and above. GVOKE is the first glucagon product approved that can be administered via a prefilled syringe (GVOKE PFS) or auto-injector (GVOKE HypoPen), reducing the steps to prepare and administer glucagon in the event of severe hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar levels. The FDA's approval is based on positive results from three Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy, safety, and utility of GVOKE in treating severe hypoglycemia when compared with conventional glucagon emergency kits among adults and children with type 1 diabetes.The company is preparing to introduce GVOKE in two different administration options to accommodate the community's preferences, starting with its pre-filled syringe in 4-6 weeks and the auto-injector in 2020.Xeris also has entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and Silicon Valley Bank.

Revenue is expected to decrease 18.7% yr/yr to $1.34 bln. The company reiterated its FY20 guidance on June 4, priming the market for revenue between $7.46 bln and $7.87 bln. The last three months saw just a handful of noteworthy game releases, which likely presented a headwind to overall store traffic in Q2. There are more big titles scheduled to be released in the fall and in early 2020, which should be a positive for the company's outlook.Shares of GME hit a fresh record low in mid-August amid dimming prospects for a meaningful turnaround. The stock recovered from that low over the past couple weeks, aided by comments from investor Michael Burry, who revealed that his fund owns 3% of outstanding shares of GME. Mr. Burry's view is based on the expectation that the next generation of consoles will not do away with physical Blu-ray drives. While the decision to keep physical drives would be a positive for GME, the company would still need to compete with large retailers like Best Buy (BBY 68.95, -0.27, -0.4%), Target (TGT 107.56, -0.39, -0.4%), and Walmart (WMT 116.02, -0.31, -0.3%) at a time when GME has been closing many of its locations.10:18AAPL Apple September product event previewApple is set to unveil new products today at 13:00 ET. Most of these products will have very incremental upgrades. Most of the attention for shareholders will be placed to the pricing of the company's Apple TV Plus and Apple Arcade services. Apple stock is up 35% year-to-date vs. a 22.5% gain in the Nasdaq 100. The stock remains near the high end of its recent range and less than 10% from its all-time high.iPhones: The company is expected to release three new iPhones. The first iPhone will likely be called the iPhone 11 and will feature a 6.1-inch LCD screen similar to the iPhone XR that is currently on sale. The other two phones will be called the iPhone 11 Pro and will feature organic light-emitting diode displays similar to the iPhone Xs and Xs Max. The iPhone 11 Pro will come in two sizes: 5.8 and 6.5 inches. The phones are expected to feature faster processors and better cameras. However, these phones will likely only have incremental improvements as Apple is expected to unveil its 5G iPhone in 2020. Analysts are expecting pricing similar to prior models between $749-1099.Services: Apple could confirm the pricing for its gaming and TV services and introduce additional content expected for those services. It has been reported by several sources that the gaming service will cost $4.99/month and the TV service will cost $9.99/month. Apple will have to compete with other streaming offerings from Disney (DIS) which will be priced lower.Apple Watch 5: The updated smartwatch is expected to feature a ceramic design, faster processors, and more health features such as sleep tracking.Mac: Apple is expected to introduce a 16-inch Mac Book Pro.iPads: There is some speculation that Apple will update its iPad Pro lineup with faster processors and larger screens. However, some analysts feel the iPad will get its own event in October.Other Products: Apple could introduce Apple "tracking tags" that will allow users to find lost items. Expectations are for another underwhelming iPhone cycle ahead of next year's 5G offering. Analysts note that there is a lot of pent up demand with many older iPhones in the installed base. Therefore, there is an expectation for a super cycle for the 5G handset next year. Still, the investment thesis has shifted from iPhone cycles to a more diversified set of hardware and services. Last quarter, iPhone sales fell to less than 50% of revenue for the first time as the success of services, iPads, AirPods, and the Apple Watch picked up the slack for falling iPhone sales. Apple's earnings are expected to grow 10% next year after falling 2% in fiscal 2019, which concludes this month. With a $943 bln market cap, the stock trades at ~17x earnings, or ~15x, backing out the cash.Suppliers to keep on note include: SSNLF, LPL (for displays) and LITE, FNSR and IIVI (for FaceID.) Other suppliers include: SWKS, CRUS, AVGO, QRVO, TSM, and QCOM, among others.

Patients 02002 and 02006 were treated with higher dose levels of RP-L102. Patients 02004 and 02005 received non-optimized and lower doses of RP-L102. Key highlights of the manuscript include:Follow-up data for the initial four patients 18-30 months post-infusion demonstrate progressively increased engraftment in peripheral blood leukocytes and in the bone marrow following administration of RP-L102 without the use of conditioning. In Patient 02002 at 30 months follow-up, approximately 44% of bone marrow CD34+ cells displayed gene marking, suggesting the engraftment of very primitive corrected hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Sequential increases in gene marking in peripheral blood and in the bone marrow for Patients 02004 and 02005 were also seen, but at more modest levels and after longer durations. The bone marrow resistance to MMC in Patient 02002 increased to 70% at 24 months, approaching the phenotype of a healthy donor. Patients 02004, 02005 and 02006 also displayed progressive increases in MMC resistance. DEB exposure resulted in a lower proportion of cells with aberrant chromosomes in Patients 02002, 02004 and 02006. Patient 02002 demonstrated stabilized neutrophil counts and hemoglobin levels as early as six months post-administration of RP-L102. Similar trends were also seen in Patient 02006. Progressive increases in the total number of corrected leukocytes were observed shortly after the initial administration of RP-L102 in all treated patients. Favorable safety profile with no serious adverse events associated with infusion of the investigational product in these initial four patients.07:08STOR STORE Capital increases quarterly dividend to $0.35/share from $0.33/share (37.08 )07:07STC Stewart Info confirms termination of Fidelity National (FNF) merger, names new CEO (33.77 )In light of the FTC's decision, the Stewart Board has clearly determined that leveraging the company's strong brand, financial position, and valued employees to grow the organization as a standalone entity will create the greatest shareholder value.

NfL is a protein that provides structural support to nerve fibres in the brain. An increase in the amount of NfL may be associated with nerve cell damage, and detection of increased NfL levels in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may serve as a biomarker of nerve cell damage.In the Phase III OPERA I study in RMS and the ORATORIO study in PPMS, blood NfL levels were significantly lower after treatment with OCREVUS. In RMS, blood serum NfL levels were reduced by 43 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with a 31 percent reduction with interferon beta-1a (p<0.001). In PPMS, blood plasma NfL levels were reduced by 16 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with 0.2 percent reduction with placebo (p<0.001). Additionally, these analyses showed higher blood NfL levels at the start of the study were correlated with more disability progression in upper and lower limbs in PPMS and overall disability in the interferon beta-1a RMS treatment group at 96 weeks.06:03FTS Fortis announces five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 bln for the period 2020 to 2024, increases quarterly dividend to $0.4775/share from $0.45/share (42.08 )The co announced its five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 billion for the period 2020 to 2024, up $1.0 billion from the prior year's plan.

Reduction in the composite porphyria attack rate with givosiran treatment, which had been observed in the ENVISION Phase 3 study as early as one month after dosing, was shown to be sustained with continued dosing in the OLE phase of the study. Sustained reduction in levels of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), an intermediate in the heme biosynthesis pathway believed to be the primary neurotoxic intermediate responsible for causing both porphyria attacks and ongoing symptoms in between attacks, was also observed with continued dosing. Rapid and sustained lowering of attack rate and ALA levels was also observed in placebo patients who crossed over after the six-month double blind phase of the ENVISION Phase 3 study to receive givosiran in the OLE phase of the study. Givosiran's safety profile in the OLE phase has remained consistent with the profile observed in the double blind phase of the ENVISION study.ENVISION Results of Select Patient Reported Outcomes -- A number of patient reported outcomes were collected as secondary and exploratory measures in the ENVISION study. Daily worst pain did not achieve statistical significance based on the prespecified ANCOVA analysis (p equals 0.0530), however, the data were found to not be normally distributed. A post-hoc analysis of daily worst pain was therefore performed using the non-parametric stratified Wilcoxon test. Based on the non-parametric test, patients on givosiran had a significant reduction in daily worst pain (nominal p equals 0.0455). In exploratory analyses, the reductions in pain were accompanied by fewer days of use of both opioid and non-opioid analgesics. Givosiran did not impact daily worst fatigue or daily worst nausea at six months, although these assessments will be repeated at twelve months to explore the effects of longer term dosing. Updated Phase 1/2 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of April 19, 2019, a robust treatment effect was maintained in givosiran-treated patients with continued dosing in the Phase 1/2 OLE study (N=16), with a mean time on treatment of 22.8 months and total time on treatment across the Phase 1 and OLE studies of up to 35 months. Substantial mean reductions in annualized attack rate (AAR) and in annualized hemin use of greater than 90 percent were observed, with evidence for sustained or potentially enhanced clinical activity with continued dosing. Five out of twelve patients (42 percent) who received givosiran during the Phase 1 study and continued with givosiran dosing in the OLE study and two out of four patients (50 percent) who had been in the placebo arm of the Phase 1 study and crossed over to givosiran treatment in the OLE study achieved an AAR of zero for a mean of 18.1 and 24.9 months, respectively.06:00ACN Accenture acquires Pragsis Bidoop; terms not disclosed (194.83 )Pragsis Bidoop, headquartered in Madrid with additional offices in Barcelona and the U.K., will add more than 200 employees with deep machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data engineering experience, along with its portfolio of end-to-end solutions, to Accenture's Applied Intelligence business.06:00ASX ASE Technology reports August net revenues +10.3% yr/yr to $1.28 bln (4.51 )06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets ease back; S&P Futures take out yesterday's lowThe global equity markets are under slight pressure to start the day.

In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD16:20IMXI International Money Express announces secondary public offering of 5,217,392 shares of common stock by selling stockholders (13.60 -0.55)Shares will be offered by affiliates of Stella Point Capital and certain of the company's other stockholders.

Additionally, the company has decided to discontinue the development of MRT5201, a liver-targeted treatment for OTC deficiency.The company's decision to discontinue the development of MRT5201 for OTC deficiency is based on data from recently completed preclinical studies that do not support the desired pharmacokinetic and safety profile for advancement of the program. These data are related to the first-generation lipid nanoparticle (LNP) designed to be delivered to the liver via intravenous administration for the OTC deficiency program. As such, this LNP is different than that used in the CF and other pulmonary development programs which are designed to deliver the LNP-encapsulated mRNA through nebulization. Additionally, ongoing discovery efforts have generated promising, novel next-generation LNPs supporting the further development of liver disease mRNA therapeutics with potentially favorable product profiles.The company's prioritization of pulmonary diseases is supported by the previously reported positive single-ascending dose Phase 1/2 data from the CF program, which utilizes its proprietary lung delivery platform. MRT5005 is a first-in-class mRNA therapeutic designed to address the underlying cause of CF regardless of genetic mutation by delivering mRNA encoding fully functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein to cells in the lung through nebulization. The multiple-ascending dose portion of the clinical trial is ongoing with data expected in 2020.16:08CASY Casey's General beats by $0.28, beats on revs; reaffirms guidance (167.30 -2.03)Reports Q1 (Jul) earnings of $2.31 per share, $0.28 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.03; revenues rose 1.5% year/year to $2.63 bln vs the $2.59 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperforms for the second straight day.Today's action has reflected much of yesterday's value trade that benefits underperforming areas of the stock market, most notably the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.8%) and SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.36, +0.93, +2.2%). An upturn in Boeing (BA 366.34, +7.56, +2.1%) and many of the transportation stocks has had a similar effect on the industrials sector (+0.5%).The gains in these areas, however, are coming at the expense of crowded groups like the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.9%), which is the S&P 500's most heavily-weighted sector. The real estate sector (-1.7%), which investors had piled into for its higher dividend yields and low-beta disposition, is today's worst performer.Allowing today's value trade to play out are the improved views on trade and growth, which have helped some money flow out of the Treasury market and drive yields higher. The 2-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.64%, and the 10-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.35.Separately, the market saw a sharp uptick on a report from the South China Morning Post indicating that China is ready to purchase more agricultural products from the U.S. The caveat, though, is that China would want the U.S. to agree to delay tariffs and ease its supply ban on Huawei. Nothing material has transpired, but the report likely triggered some algorithms.Some story stocks today include Wendy's (WEN 19.45, -2.50, -11.4%) and Ford Motor (F 9.28, -0.26, -2.9%). Wendy's is down big after the company lowered its earnings guidance to reflect costs needed to expand its breakfast menu nationwide. Ford Motor is down after its senior unsecured debt was downgraded to "junk status" at Moody's.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August declined to 103.1 from 104.7 in July. The August reading was its lowest in five months, but the index remains running at elevated levels.The July Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed that job openings declined to 7.217 million from a revised 7.248 million in June (from 7.348 million).As a reminder, Apple's (AAPL 214.13, -0.10, -0.1%) annual product event is expected to start within the next few minutes.12:54SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: MNK (32.03 mln +62.86%), TEVA (25.92 mln +10.08%), PFE (17.35 mln +0.74%), ENDP (14.29 mln +31.38%)Materials: FCX (18.78 mln +3.56%)Industrials: GE (38.9 mln +1.67%)Consumer Discretionary: F (45.1 mln -2.99%), JCP (16.14 mln +19.76%), ROKU (15.89 mln -4.55%)Information Technology: AMD (26.95 mln -1.27%), MSFT (14.87 mln -1.32%), MU (13.96 mln -0.12%), Financials: BAC (36.95 mln +1.62%), Energy: CHK (71.72 mln +0.53%), SWN (24.77 mln +5.56%), DNR (19.19 mln +10.21%), RIG (18.03 mln +1.19%), ECA (15.04 mln +0.95%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: MNK (3.88x +62.86%), ITCI (3.59x -2.71%), MMSI (2.79x -9.64%), AUPH (2.62x +13.97%), ACAD (2.23x +7.21%)Materials: GSV (2.16x -7.33%)Industrials: MAXR (2.25x +12.52%), MRTN (2.19x +6.15%), HDS (2.07x -6.49%)Consumer Discretionary: WEN (3.6x -11.82%), LAUR (3.49x -6.21%), ASNA (2.58x +18.14%), NLS (2.23x +4.14%)Financials: HLNE (3.09x -5.17%), IGIB (3.07x -0.28%), STC (2.51x -0.99%), NAC (2.31x -1.45%)Consumer Staples: DF (2.53x +27.78%)12:53SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: MNK (3.42 +62.86%), ENDP (4.03 +31.38%), ADAP (2.07 +21.47%), ACOR (3.62 +14.92%), AUPH (6.61 +13.97%), AKBA (4.86 +13.43%), LXRX (1.6 +12.46%), AMRX (3.37 +12.33%), AKRX (3.03 +12.22%), IMMU (14.89 +12.12%), INO (2.44 +11.42%)Industrials: MAXR (7.91 +12.52%)Consumer Discretionary: JCP (1.02 +19.76%), ASNA (0.36 +18.14%), EXPR (2.98 +14.62%)Energy: SDRL (3.33 +16.84%)Consumer Staples: DF (1.5 +27.78%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: MMSI (27.95 -9.64%), NBIX (94.26 -5.74%), NEO (21.51 -5.65%)Materials: GSV (0.92 -7.33%)Industrials: HDS (38.17 -6.49%)Consumer Discretionary: WEN (19.36 -11.82%), LAUR (16.46 -6.21%), LOPE (107.5 -6.09%), SHAK (96.85 -5.66%), RACE (151.97 -5.46%)Information Technology: OLED (189.99 -9.94%), EPAM (180.44 -6.74%), EVTC (33.36 -6.53%), LSCC (19.53 -6.33%), BAH (69.07 -6.24%), FICO (327.82 -6.14%), PAYC (214.88 -6.05%)Financials: MKTX (343.31 -7.14%), QD (7.37 -6.52%)Consumer Staples: TPB (28.67 -5.88%)12:46OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:NLNK Sep 2 calls are seeing interest with the underlying stock up 10% (volume: 2080, open int: 0, implied vol: ~284%, prev day implied vol: 96%).

The shaky start to the week has trimmed the sector's Q3 gain to 2.2%, but the group remains up almost 29.0% for the year, which leaves it well ahead of the remaining ten sectors.Momentum names lagged yesterday, and they are showing relative weakness again today on no news other than the price action itself. To that point, the likes of Synopsys (SNPS 135.61, -5.65, -4.0%), Visa (V 175.35, -6.20, -3.4%), MasterCard (MA 273.42, -9.94, -3.5%), Fiserv (FISV 103.26, -3.42, -3.2%), Global Payments (GPN 165.77, -5.03, -2.9%), and Automatic Data Processing (ADP 162.96, -5.09, -3.0%) show losses between 3.5% and 4.0% after hitting record highs in recent days.Top-weighted sector components have fared a bit better. For instance, Apple (AAPL 213.40, -0.77, -0.4%) is down just 0.4% ahead of an upcoming product reveal while Alphabet (GOOGL 1202.35, -2.93, -0.2%) shows a slimmer loss. Microsoft (MSFT 135.35, -2.15, -1.6%), however, is down more than 1.5%.The technology sector traded beneath its 50-day moving average at today's low point, but it is currently back above that level, which has acted as an area of congestion over the past month.12:02TALKX Market Briefing: Hold the trade deal enthusiasmThe stock market has gotten a nice pop following a South China Morning Post report indicating China is open to agreeing to buy more agricultural products from the U.S. in a lead up to the October trade meeting in Washington. Tucked inside the same article is a qualifier, however, that China would like to do this in exchange for the U.S. dialing back its restrictions on Huawei and delaying the tariff increases it has planned.In other words, it's a familiar page from the trade playbook, only this play hasn't really gained any yardage in the past.The market (or maybe the algorithms) reacted to the headline with a knee-jerk buying effort, but there isn't much of a basis to run with this news as a major breakthrough since it isn't one. That doesn't mean this market can't, or won't, make more out of the headline than it's worth since it has rallied of late on a sense of relief that neither China nor the U.S. seems intent at this juncture on escalating the trade war even further.Still, this shouldn't be construed as a material development.The Russell 2000 is up 0.8%; the Dow Jones industrial Average is flat; the S&P 500 is down 0.5%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.5%.11:51SCANX Stocks that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (49) outpacing new lows (15) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ABG, ACM, ACRE, AMBA, AN, APO, ARCC, ARNC, AY, AYR, BF.B, BRC, BRX, BX, CASH, CCRN, CE, CHH, CIO, CPRX, CY, DCOM, DRRX, GL, GNRC, HTH, HTLD, ITI, ITRI, KIM, KSU, LM, NVMI, NYCB, OKE, PFNX, PSXP, PTGX, SAH, SAIA, SFL, SITC, SSW, STNG, STWD, SUM, SYY, TROW, WUStocks that traded to 52 week lows: BERY, BMRN, ENTA, FVRR, ILMN, LGND, LVGO, LYFT, MMSI, PD, REGN, RUBY, TRXC, VAPO, WMGIThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AGM, ALG, CMBM, IMKTA, NNI, SAR, TIPTThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: ESTA, HSKA, KRTX11:30XERS Xeris Pharmaceuticals receives FDA approval for GVOKE injection for severe hypoglycemia (shares halted) (11.04 +0.10)Xeris Pharmaceuticals has received regulatory approval from the FDA for GVOKE (glucagon) injection, its ready-to-use, room-temperature stable liquid glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in pediatric and adult patients with diabetes ages 2 years and above.

The FDA's approval is based on positive results from three Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy, safety, and utility of GVOKE in treating severe hypoglycemia when compared with conventional glucagon emergency kits among adults and children with type 1 diabetes.The company is preparing to introduce GVOKE in two different administration options to accommodate the community's preferences, starting with its pre-filled syringe in 4-6 weeks and the auto-injector in 2020.Xeris also has entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and Silicon Valley Bank.

Revenue is expected to decrease 18.7% yr/yr to $1.34 bln. The company reiterated its FY20 guidance on June 4, priming the market for revenue between $7.46 bln and $7.87 bln. The last three months saw just a handful of noteworthy game releases, which likely presented a headwind to overall store traffic in Q2. There are more big titles scheduled to be released in the fall and in early 2020, which should be a positive for the company's outlook.Shares of GME hit a fresh record low in mid-August amid dimming prospects for a meaningful turnaround. The stock recovered from that low over the past couple weeks, aided by comments from investor Michael Burry, who revealed that his fund owns 3% of outstanding shares of GME. Mr. Burry's view is based on the expectation that the next generation of consoles will not do away with physical Blu-ray drives. While the decision to keep physical drives would be a positive for GME, the company would still need to compete with large retailers like Best Buy (BBY 68.95, -0.27, -0.4%), Target (TGT 107.56, -0.39, -0.4%), and Walmart (WMT 116.02, -0.31, -0.3%) at a time when GME has been closing many of its locations.10:18AAPL Apple September product event previewApple is set to unveil new products today at 13:00 ET. Most of these products will have very incremental upgrades. Most of the attention for shareholders will be placed to the pricing of the company's Apple TV Plus and Apple Arcade services. Apple stock is up 35% year-to-date vs. a 22.5% gain in the Nasdaq 100. The stock remains near the high end of its recent range and less than 10% from its all-time high.iPhones: The company is expected to release three new iPhones. The first iPhone will likely be called the iPhone 11 and will feature a 6.1-inch LCD screen similar to the iPhone XR that is currently on sale. The other two phones will be called the iPhone 11 Pro and will feature organic light-emitting diode displays similar to the iPhone Xs and Xs Max. The iPhone 11 Pro will come in two sizes: 5.8 and 6.5 inches. The phones are expected to feature faster processors and better cameras. However, these phones will likely only have incremental improvements as Apple is expected to unveil its 5G iPhone in 2020. Analysts are expecting pricing similar to prior models between $749-1099.Services: Apple could confirm the pricing for its gaming and TV services and introduce additional content expected for those services. It has been reported by several sources that the gaming service will cost $4.99/month and the TV service will cost $9.99/month. Apple will have to compete with other streaming offerings from Disney (DIS) which will be priced lower.Apple Watch 5: The updated smartwatch is expected to feature a ceramic design, faster processors, and more health features such as sleep tracking.Mac: Apple is expected to introduce a 16-inch Mac Book Pro.iPads: There is some speculation that Apple will update its iPad Pro lineup with faster processors and larger screens. However, some analysts feel the iPad will get its own event in October.Other Products: Apple could introduce Apple "tracking tags" that will allow users to find lost items. Expectations are for another underwhelming iPhone cycle ahead of next year's 5G offering. Analysts note that there is a lot of pent up demand with many older iPhones in the installed base. Therefore, there is an expectation for a super cycle for the 5G handset next year. Still, the investment thesis has shifted from iPhone cycles to a more diversified set of hardware and services. Last quarter, iPhone sales fell to less than 50% of revenue for the first time as the success of services, iPads, AirPods, and the Apple Watch picked up the slack for falling iPhone sales. Apple's earnings are expected to grow 10% next year after falling 2% in fiscal 2019, which concludes this month. With a $943 bln market cap, the stock trades at ~17x earnings, or ~15x, backing out the cash.Suppliers to keep on note include: SSNLF, LPL (for displays) and LITE, FNSR and IIVI (for FaceID.) Other suppliers include: SWKS, CRUS, AVGO, QRVO, TSM, and QCOM, among others.

Patients 02002 and 02006 were treated with higher dose levels of RP-L102. Patients 02004 and 02005 received non-optimized and lower doses of RP-L102. Key highlights of the manuscript include:Follow-up data for the initial four patients 18-30 months post-infusion demonstrate progressively increased engraftment in peripheral blood leukocytes and in the bone marrow following administration of RP-L102 without the use of conditioning. In Patient 02002 at 30 months follow-up, approximately 44% of bone marrow CD34+ cells displayed gene marking, suggesting the engraftment of very primitive corrected hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Sequential increases in gene marking in peripheral blood and in the bone marrow for Patients 02004 and 02005 were also seen, but at more modest levels and after longer durations. The bone marrow resistance to MMC in Patient 02002 increased to 70% at 24 months, approaching the phenotype of a healthy donor. Patients 02004, 02005 and 02006 also displayed progressive increases in MMC resistance. DEB exposure resulted in a lower proportion of cells with aberrant chromosomes in Patients 02002, 02004 and 02006. Patient 02002 demonstrated stabilized neutrophil counts and hemoglobin levels as early as six months post-administration of RP-L102. Similar trends were also seen in Patient 02006. Progressive increases in the total number of corrected leukocytes were observed shortly after the initial administration of RP-L102 in all treated patients. Favorable safety profile with no serious adverse events associated with infusion of the investigational product in these initial four patients.07:08STOR STORE Capital increases quarterly dividend to $0.35/share from $0.33/share (37.08 )07:07STC Stewart Info confirms termination of Fidelity National (FNF) merger, names new CEO (33.77 )In light of the FTC's decision, the Stewart Board has clearly determined that leveraging the company's strong brand, financial position, and valued employees to grow the organization as a standalone entity will create the greatest shareholder value.

NfL is a protein that provides structural support to nerve fibres in the brain. An increase in the amount of NfL may be associated with nerve cell damage, and detection of increased NfL levels in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may serve as a biomarker of nerve cell damage.In the Phase III OPERA I study in RMS and the ORATORIO study in PPMS, blood NfL levels were significantly lower after treatment with OCREVUS. In RMS, blood serum NfL levels were reduced by 43 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with a 31 percent reduction with interferon beta-1a (p<0.001). In PPMS, blood plasma NfL levels were reduced by 16 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with 0.2 percent reduction with placebo (p<0.001). Additionally, these analyses showed higher blood NfL levels at the start of the study were correlated with more disability progression in upper and lower limbs in PPMS and overall disability in the interferon beta-1a RMS treatment group at 96 weeks.06:03FTS Fortis announces five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 bln for the period 2020 to 2024, increases quarterly dividend to $0.4775/share from $0.45/share (42.08 )The co announced its five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 billion for the period 2020 to 2024, up $1.0 billion from the prior year's plan.

Reduction in the composite porphyria attack rate with givosiran treatment, which had been observed in the ENVISION Phase 3 study as early as one month after dosing, was shown to be sustained with continued dosing in the OLE phase of the study. Sustained reduction in levels of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), an intermediate in the heme biosynthesis pathway believed to be the primary neurotoxic intermediate responsible for causing both porphyria attacks and ongoing symptoms in between attacks, was also observed with continued dosing. Rapid and sustained lowering of attack rate and ALA levels was also observed in placebo patients who crossed over after the six-month double blind phase of the ENVISION Phase 3 study to receive givosiran in the OLE phase of the study. Givosiran's safety profile in the OLE phase has remained consistent with the profile observed in the double blind phase of the ENVISION study.ENVISION Results of Select Patient Reported Outcomes -- A number of patient reported outcomes were collected as secondary and exploratory measures in the ENVISION study. Daily worst pain did not achieve statistical significance based on the prespecified ANCOVA analysis (p equals 0.0530), however, the data were found to not be normally distributed. A post-hoc analysis of daily worst pain was therefore performed using the non-parametric stratified Wilcoxon test. Based on the non-parametric test, patients on givosiran had a significant reduction in daily worst pain (nominal p equals 0.0455). In exploratory analyses, the reductions in pain were accompanied by fewer days of use of both opioid and non-opioid analgesics. Givosiran did not impact daily worst fatigue or daily worst nausea at six months, although these assessments will be repeated at twelve months to explore the effects of longer term dosing. Updated Phase 1/2 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of April 19, 2019, a robust treatment effect was maintained in givosiran-treated patients with continued dosing in the Phase 1/2 OLE study (N=16), with a mean time on treatment of 22.8 months and total time on treatment across the Phase 1 and OLE studies of up to 35 months. Substantial mean reductions in annualized attack rate (AAR) and in annualized hemin use of greater than 90 percent were observed, with evidence for sustained or potentially enhanced clinical activity with continued dosing. Five out of twelve patients (42 percent) who received givosiran during the Phase 1 study and continued with givosiran dosing in the OLE study and two out of four patients (50 percent) who had been in the placebo arm of the Phase 1 study and crossed over to givosiran treatment in the OLE study achieved an AAR of zero for a mean of 18.1 and 24.9 months, respectively.06:00ACN Accenture acquires Pragsis Bidoop; terms not disclosed (194.83 )Pragsis Bidoop, headquartered in Madrid with additional offices in Barcelona and the U.K., will add more than 200 employees with deep machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data engineering experience, along with its portfolio of end-to-end solutions, to Accenture's Applied Intelligence business.06:00ASX ASE Technology reports August net revenues +10.3% yr/yr to $1.28 bln (4.51 )06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets ease back; S&P Futures take out yesterday's lowThe global equity markets are under slight pressure to start the day.

In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD16:20IMXI International Money Express announces secondary public offering of 5,217,392 shares of common stock by selling stockholders (13.60 -0.55)Shares will be offered by affiliates of Stella Point Capital and certain of the company's other stockholders.

Additionally, the company has decided to discontinue the development of MRT5201, a liver-targeted treatment for OTC deficiency.The company's decision to discontinue the development of MRT5201 for OTC deficiency is based on data from recently completed preclinical studies that do not support the desired pharmacokinetic and safety profile for advancement of the program. These data are related to the first-generation lipid nanoparticle (LNP) designed to be delivered to the liver via intravenous administration for the OTC deficiency program. As such, this LNP is different than that used in the CF and other pulmonary development programs which are designed to deliver the LNP-encapsulated mRNA through nebulization. Additionally, ongoing discovery efforts have generated promising, novel next-generation LNPs supporting the further development of liver disease mRNA therapeutics with potentially favorable product profiles.The company's prioritization of pulmonary diseases is supported by the previously reported positive single-ascending dose Phase 1/2 data from the CF program, which utilizes its proprietary lung delivery platform. MRT5005 is a first-in-class mRNA therapeutic designed to address the underlying cause of CF regardless of genetic mutation by delivering mRNA encoding fully functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein to cells in the lung through nebulization. The multiple-ascending dose portion of the clinical trial is ongoing with data expected in 2020.16:08CASY Casey's General beats by $0.28, beats on revs; reaffirms guidance (167.30 -2.03)Reports Q1 (Jul) earnings of $2.31 per share, $0.28 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.03; revenues rose 1.5% year/year to $2.63 bln vs the $2.59 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperforms for the second straight day.Today's action has reflected much of yesterday's value trade that benefits underperforming areas of the stock market, most notably the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.8%) and SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.36, +0.93, +2.2%). An upturn in Boeing (BA 366.34, +7.56, +2.1%) and many of the transportation stocks has had a similar effect on the industrials sector (+0.5%).The gains in these areas, however, are coming at the expense of crowded groups like the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.9%), which is the S&P 500's most heavily-weighted sector. The real estate sector (-1.7%), which investors had piled into for its higher dividend yields and low-beta disposition, is today's worst performer.Allowing today's value trade to play out are the improved views on trade and growth, which have helped some money flow out of the Treasury market and drive yields higher. The 2-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.64%, and the 10-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.35.Separately, the market saw a sharp uptick on a report from the South China Morning Post indicating that China is ready to purchase more agricultural products from the U.S. The caveat, though, is that China would want the U.S. to agree to delay tariffs and ease its supply ban on Huawei. Nothing material has transpired, but the report likely triggered some algorithms.Some story stocks today include Wendy's (WEN 19.45, -2.50, -11.4%) and Ford Motor (F 9.28, -0.26, -2.9%). Wendy's is down big after the company lowered its earnings guidance to reflect costs needed to expand its breakfast menu nationwide. Ford Motor is down after its senior unsecured debt was downgraded to "junk status" at Moody's.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August declined to 103.1 from 104.7 in July. The August reading was its lowest in five months, but the index remains running at elevated levels.The July Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed that job openings declined to 7.217 million from a revised 7.248 million in June (from 7.348 million).As a reminder, Apple's (AAPL 214.13, -0.10, -0.1%) annual product event is expected to start within the next few minutes.12:54SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: MNK (32.03 mln +62.86%), TEVA (25.92 mln +10.08%), PFE (17.35 mln +0.74%), ENDP (14.29 mln +31.38%)Materials: FCX (18.78 mln +3.56%)Industrials: GE (38.9 mln +1.67%)Consumer Discretionary: F (45.1 mln -2.99%), JCP (16.14 mln +19.76%), ROKU (15.89 mln -4.55%)Information Technology: AMD (26.95 mln -1.27%), MSFT (14.87 mln -1.32%), MU (13.96 mln -0.12%), Financials: BAC (36.95 mln +1.62%), Energy: CHK (71.72 mln +0.53%), SWN (24.77 mln +5.56%), DNR (19.19 mln +10.21%), RIG (18.03 mln +1.19%), ECA (15.04 mln +0.95%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: MNK (3.88x +62.86%), ITCI (3.59x -2.71%), MMSI (2.79x -9.64%), AUPH (2.62x +13.97%), ACAD (2.23x +7.21%)Materials: GSV (2.16x -7.33%)Industrials: MAXR (2.25x +12.52%), MRTN (2.19x +6.15%), HDS (2.07x -6.49%)Consumer Discretionary: WEN (3.6x -11.82%), LAUR (3.49x -6.21%), ASNA (2.58x +18.14%), NLS (2.23x +4.14%)Financials: HLNE (3.09x -5.17%), IGIB (3.07x -0.28%), STC (2.51x -0.99%), NAC (2.31x -1.45%)Consumer Staples: DF (2.53x +27.78%)12:53SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: MNK (3.42 +62.86%), ENDP (4.03 +31.38%), ADAP (2.07 +21.47%), ACOR (3.62 +14.92%), AUPH (6.61 +13.97%), AKBA (4.86 +13.43%), LXRX (1.6 +12.46%), AMRX (3.37 +12.33%), AKRX (3.03 +12.22%), IMMU (14.89 +12.12%), INO (2.44 +11.42%)Industrials: MAXR (7.91 +12.52%)Consumer Discretionary: JCP (1.02 +19.76%), ASNA (0.36 +18.14%), EXPR (2.98 +14.62%)Energy: SDRL (3.33 +16.84%)Consumer Staples: DF (1.5 +27.78%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: MMSI (27.95 -9.64%), NBIX (94.26 -5.74%), NEO (21.51 -5.65%)Materials: GSV (0.92 -7.33%)Industrials: HDS (38.17 -6.49%)Consumer Discretionary: WEN (19.36 -11.82%), LAUR (16.46 -6.21%), LOPE (107.5 -6.09%), SHAK (96.85 -5.66%), RACE (151.97 -5.46%)Information Technology: OLED (189.99 -9.94%), EPAM (180.44 -6.74%), EVTC (33.36 -6.53%), LSCC (19.53 -6.33%), BAH (69.07 -6.24%), FICO (327.82 -6.14%), PAYC (214.88 -6.05%)Financials: MKTX (343.31 -7.14%), QD (7.37 -6.52%)Consumer Staples: TPB (28.67 -5.88%)12:46OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:NLNK Sep 2 calls are seeing interest with the underlying stock up 10% (volume: 2080, open int: 0, implied vol: ~284%, prev day implied vol: 96%).

The shaky start to the week has trimmed the sector's Q3 gain to 2.2%, but the group remains up almost 29.0% for the year, which leaves it well ahead of the remaining ten sectors.Momentum names lagged yesterday, and they are showing relative weakness again today on no news other than the price action itself. To that point, the likes of Synopsys (SNPS 135.61, -5.65, -4.0%), Visa (V 175.35, -6.20, -3.4%), MasterCard (MA 273.42, -9.94, -3.5%), Fiserv (FISV 103.26, -3.42, -3.2%), Global Payments (GPN 165.77, -5.03, -2.9%), and Automatic Data Processing (ADP 162.96, -5.09, -3.0%) show losses between 3.5% and 4.0% after hitting record highs in recent days.Top-weighted sector components have fared a bit better. For instance, Apple (AAPL 213.40, -0.77, -0.4%) is down just 0.4% ahead of an upcoming product reveal while Alphabet (GOOGL 1202.35, -2.93, -0.2%) shows a slimmer loss. Microsoft (MSFT 135.35, -2.15, -1.6%), however, is down more than 1.5%.The technology sector traded beneath its 50-day moving average at today's low point, but it is currently back above that level, which has acted as an area of congestion over the past month.12:02TALKX Market Briefing: Hold the trade deal enthusiasmThe stock market has gotten a nice pop following a South China Morning Post report indicating China is open to agreeing to buy more agricultural products from the U.S. in a lead up to the October trade meeting in Washington. Tucked inside the same article is a qualifier, however, that China would like to do this in exchange for the U.S. dialing back its restrictions on Huawei and delaying the tariff increases it has planned.In other words, it's a familiar page from the trade playbook, only this play hasn't really gained any yardage in the past.The market (or maybe the algorithms) reacted to the headline with a knee-jerk buying effort, but there isn't much of a basis to run with this news as a major breakthrough since it isn't one. That doesn't mean this market can't, or won't, make more out of the headline than it's worth since it has rallied of late on a sense of relief that neither China nor the U.S. seems intent at this juncture on escalating the trade war even further.Still, this shouldn't be construed as a material development.The Russell 2000 is up 0.8%; the Dow Jones industrial Average is flat; the S&P 500 is down 0.5%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.5%.11:51SCANX Stocks that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (49) outpacing new lows (15) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ABG, ACM, ACRE, AMBA, AN, APO, ARCC, ARNC, AY, AYR, BF.B, BRC, BRX, BX, CASH, CCRN, CE, CHH, CIO, CPRX, CY, DCOM, DRRX, GL, GNRC, HTH, HTLD, ITI, ITRI, KIM, KSU, LM, NVMI, NYCB, OKE, PFNX, PSXP, PTGX, SAH, SAIA, SFL, SITC, SSW, STNG, STWD, SUM, SYY, TROW, WUStocks that traded to 52 week lows: BERY, BMRN, ENTA, FVRR, ILMN, LGND, LVGO, LYFT, MMSI, PD, REGN, RUBY, TRXC, VAPO, WMGIThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AGM, ALG, CMBM, IMKTA, NNI, SAR, TIPTThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: ESTA, HSKA, KRTX11:30XERS Xeris Pharmaceuticals receives FDA approval for GVOKE injection for severe hypoglycemia (shares halted) (11.04 +0.10)Xeris Pharmaceuticals has received regulatory approval from the FDA for GVOKE (glucagon) injection, its ready-to-use, room-temperature stable liquid glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in pediatric and adult patients with diabetes ages 2 years and above.

The FDA's approval is based on positive results from three Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy, safety, and utility of GVOKE in treating severe hypoglycemia when compared with conventional glucagon emergency kits among adults and children with type 1 diabetes.The company is preparing to introduce GVOKE in two different administration options to accommodate the community's preferences, starting with its pre-filled syringe in 4-6 weeks and the auto-injector in 2020.Xeris also has entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and Silicon Valley Bank.

Revenue is expected to decrease 18.7% yr/yr to $1.34 bln. The company reiterated its FY20 guidance on June 4, priming the market for revenue between $7.46 bln and $7.87 bln. The last three months saw just a handful of noteworthy game releases, which likely presented a headwind to overall store traffic in Q2. There are more big titles scheduled to be released in the fall and in early 2020, which should be a positive for the company's outlook.Shares of GME hit a fresh record low in mid-August amid dimming prospects for a meaningful turnaround. The stock recovered from that low over the past couple weeks, aided by comments from investor Michael Burry, who revealed that his fund owns 3% of outstanding shares of GME. Mr. Burry's view is based on the expectation that the next generation of consoles will not do away with physical Blu-ray drives. While the decision to keep physical drives would be a positive for GME, the company would still need to compete with large retailers like Best Buy (BBY 68.95, -0.27, -0.4%), Target (TGT 107.56, -0.39, -0.4%), and Walmart (WMT 116.02, -0.31, -0.3%) at a time when GME has been closing many of its locations.10:18AAPL Apple September product event previewApple is set to unveil new products today at 13:00 ET. Most of these products will have very incremental upgrades. Most of the attention for shareholders will be placed to the pricing of the company's Apple TV Plus and Apple Arcade services. Apple stock is up 35% year-to-date vs. a 22.5% gain in the Nasdaq 100. The stock remains near the high end of its recent range and less than 10% from its all-time high.iPhones: The company is expected to release three new iPhones. The first iPhone will likely be called the iPhone 11 and will feature a 6.1-inch LCD screen similar to the iPhone XR that is currently on sale. The other two phones will be called the iPhone 11 Pro and will feature organic light-emitting diode displays similar to the iPhone Xs and Xs Max. The iPhone 11 Pro will come in two sizes: 5.8 and 6.5 inches. The phones are expected to feature faster processors and better cameras. However, these phones will likely only have incremental improvements as Apple is expected to unveil its 5G iPhone in 2020. Analysts are expecting pricing similar to prior models between $749-1099.Services: Apple could confirm the pricing for its gaming and TV services and introduce additional content expected for those services. It has been reported by several sources that the gaming service will cost $4.99/month and the TV service will cost $9.99/month. Apple will have to compete with other streaming offerings from Disney (DIS) which will be priced lower.Apple Watch 5: The updated smartwatch is expected to feature a ceramic design, faster processors, and more health features such as sleep tracking.Mac: Apple is expected to introduce a 16-inch Mac Book Pro.iPads: There is some speculation that Apple will update its iPad Pro lineup with faster processors and larger screens. However, some analysts feel the iPad will get its own event in October.Other Products: Apple could introduce Apple "tracking tags" that will allow users to find lost items. Expectations are for another underwhelming iPhone cycle ahead of next year's 5G offering. Analysts note that there is a lot of pent up demand with many older iPhones in the installed base. Therefore, there is an expectation for a super cycle for the 5G handset next year. Still, the investment thesis has shifted from iPhone cycles to a more diversified set of hardware and services. Last quarter, iPhone sales fell to less than 50% of revenue for the first time as the success of services, iPads, AirPods, and the Apple Watch picked up the slack for falling iPhone sales. Apple's earnings are expected to grow 10% next year after falling 2% in fiscal 2019, which concludes this month. With a $943 bln market cap, the stock trades at ~17x earnings, or ~15x, backing out the cash.Suppliers to keep on note include: SSNLF, LPL (for displays) and LITE, FNSR and IIVI (for FaceID.) Other suppliers include: SWKS, CRUS, AVGO, QRVO, TSM, and QCOM, among others.

Patients 02002 and 02006 were treated with higher dose levels of RP-L102. Patients 02004 and 02005 received non-optimized and lower doses of RP-L102. Key highlights of the manuscript include:Follow-up data for the initial four patients 18-30 months post-infusion demonstrate progressively increased engraftment in peripheral blood leukocytes and in the bone marrow following administration of RP-L102 without the use of conditioning. In Patient 02002 at 30 months follow-up, approximately 44% of bone marrow CD34+ cells displayed gene marking, suggesting the engraftment of very primitive corrected hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Sequential increases in gene marking in peripheral blood and in the bone marrow for Patients 02004 and 02005 were also seen, but at more modest levels and after longer durations. The bone marrow resistance to MMC in Patient 02002 increased to 70% at 24 months, approaching the phenotype of a healthy donor. Patients 02004, 02005 and 02006 also displayed progressive increases in MMC resistance. DEB exposure resulted in a lower proportion of cells with aberrant chromosomes in Patients 02002, 02004 and 02006. Patient 02002 demonstrated stabilized neutrophil counts and hemoglobin levels as early as six months post-administration of RP-L102. Similar trends were also seen in Patient 02006. Progressive increases in the total number of corrected leukocytes were observed shortly after the initial administration of RP-L102 in all treated patients. Favorable safety profile with no serious adverse events associated with infusion of the investigational product in these initial four patients.07:08STOR STORE Capital increases quarterly dividend to $0.35/share from $0.33/share (37.08 )07:07STC Stewart Info confirms termination of Fidelity National (FNF) merger, names new CEO (33.77 )In light of the FTC's decision, the Stewart Board has clearly determined that leveraging the company's strong brand, financial position, and valued employees to grow the organization as a standalone entity will create the greatest shareholder value.

NfL is a protein that provides structural support to nerve fibres in the brain. An increase in the amount of NfL may be associated with nerve cell damage, and detection of increased NfL levels in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may serve as a biomarker of nerve cell damage.In the Phase III OPERA I study in RMS and the ORATORIO study in PPMS, blood NfL levels were significantly lower after treatment with OCREVUS. In RMS, blood serum NfL levels were reduced by 43 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with a 31 percent reduction with interferon beta-1a (p<0.001). In PPMS, blood plasma NfL levels were reduced by 16 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with 0.2 percent reduction with placebo (p<0.001). Additionally, these analyses showed higher blood NfL levels at the start of the study were correlated with more disability progression in upper and lower limbs in PPMS and overall disability in the interferon beta-1a RMS treatment group at 96 weeks.06:03FTS Fortis announces five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 bln for the period 2020 to 2024, increases quarterly dividend to $0.4775/share from $0.45/share (42.08 )The co announced its five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 billion for the period 2020 to 2024, up $1.0 billion from the prior year's plan.

Reduction in the composite porphyria attack rate with givosiran treatment, which had been observed in the ENVISION Phase 3 study as early as one month after dosing, was shown to be sustained with continued dosing in the OLE phase of the study. Sustained reduction in levels of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), an intermediate in the heme biosynthesis pathway believed to be the primary neurotoxic intermediate responsible for causing both porphyria attacks and ongoing symptoms in between attacks, was also observed with continued dosing. Rapid and sustained lowering of attack rate and ALA levels was also observed in placebo patients who crossed over after the six-month double blind phase of the ENVISION Phase 3 study to receive givosiran in the OLE phase of the study. Givosiran's safety profile in the OLE phase has remained consistent with the profile observed in the double blind phase of the ENVISION study.ENVISION Results of Select Patient Reported Outcomes -- A number of patient reported outcomes were collected as secondary and exploratory measures in the ENVISION study. Daily worst pain did not achieve statistical significance based on the prespecified ANCOVA analysis (p equals 0.0530), however, the data were found to not be normally distributed. A post-hoc analysis of daily worst pain was therefore performed using the non-parametric stratified Wilcoxon test. Based on the non-parametric test, patients on givosiran had a significant reduction in daily worst pain (nominal p equals 0.0455). In exploratory analyses, the reductions in pain were accompanied by fewer days of use of both opioid and non-opioid analgesics. Givosiran did not impact daily worst fatigue or daily worst nausea at six months, although these assessments will be repeated at twelve months to explore the effects of longer term dosing. Updated Phase 1/2 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of April 19, 2019, a robust treatment effect was maintained in givosiran-treated patients with continued dosing in the Phase 1/2 OLE study (N=16), with a mean time on treatment of 22.8 months and total time on treatment across the Phase 1 and OLE studies of up to 35 months. Substantial mean reductions in annualized attack rate (AAR) and in annualized hemin use of greater than 90 percent were observed, with evidence for sustained or potentially enhanced clinical activity with continued dosing. Five out of twelve patients (42 percent) who received givosiran during the Phase 1 study and continued with givosiran dosing in the OLE study and two out of four patients (50 percent) who had been in the placebo arm of the Phase 1 study and crossed over to givosiran treatment in the OLE study achieved an AAR of zero for a mean of 18.1 and 24.9 months, respectively.06:00ACN Accenture acquires Pragsis Bidoop; terms not disclosed (194.83 )Pragsis Bidoop, headquartered in Madrid with additional offices in Barcelona and the U.K., will add more than 200 employees with deep machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data engineering experience, along with its portfolio of end-to-end solutions, to Accenture's Applied Intelligence business.06:00ASX ASE Technology reports August net revenues +10.3% yr/yr to $1.28 bln (4.51 )06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets ease back; S&P Futures take out yesterday's lowThe global equity markets are under slight pressure to start the day.

In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD16:20IMXI International Money Express announces secondary public offering of 5,217,392 shares of common stock by selling stockholders (13.60 -0.55)Shares will be offered by affiliates of Stella Point Capital and certain of the company's other stockholders.

Additionally, the company has decided to discontinue the development of MRT5201, a liver-targeted treatment for OTC deficiency.The company's decision to discontinue the development of MRT5201 for OTC deficiency is based on data from recently completed preclinical studies that do not support the desired pharmacokinetic and safety profile for advancement of the program. These data are related to the first-generation lipid nanoparticle (LNP) designed to be delivered to the liver via intravenous administration for the OTC deficiency program. As such, this LNP is different than that used in the CF and other pulmonary development programs which are designed to deliver the LNP-encapsulated mRNA through nebulization. Additionally, ongoing discovery efforts have generated promising, novel next-generation LNPs supporting the further development of liver disease mRNA therapeutics with potentially favorable product profiles.The company's prioritization of pulmonary diseases is supported by the previously reported positive single-ascending dose Phase 1/2 data from the CF program, which utilizes its proprietary lung delivery platform. MRT5005 is a first-in-class mRNA therapeutic designed to address the underlying cause of CF regardless of genetic mutation by delivering mRNA encoding fully functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein to cells in the lung through nebulization.

INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION REQUIRED TO SOLVE WORLD'S SEVEREST PROBLEMSIPS - Inter Press ServiceSeptember 19, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 IPS - Inter Press Service/Global Information NetworkLength: 668 wordsByline: Sven LilienstromDateline: STOCKHOLM, Sep 19 2019 BodyIn an interview with Dan Smith, Director of the renowned Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) and Professor of Peace and Conflict at the University of Manchester. The native Londoner, he has been researching conflicts and peace for decades and served in the UN Peacebuilding Fund Advisory Group, which he chaired for two years.LilienstrÃ¶m: What does "peace" mean for you personally?Smith: Peace is the situation in which it is possible to pursue conflicts and disagreements - between states, between individuals and at every level in between - without damage to those involved in the conflict, to others, or to others' ability to live in peace with each other.LilienstrÃ¶m: After the demise of the INF Treaty, the USA has announced that it intends to deploy intermediate-range missiles in the Indo-Pacific region. The Chinese government is responding with threats of its own. How dangerous are the power games with China?Smith: The difficult US-China relationship holds many risks including the trade war and confrontations at sea as well as a potential arms rivalry.LilienstrÃ¶m: China was never part of the INF Treaty. As a result, the People's Republic is now believed to have 2,000 ballistic missiles. Do we need a new treaty that includes the Chinese?Smith: There are various estimates of how many missiles China has of the ranges covered by the INF Treaty (500-5500 km); the highest estimate is about 1,700, plus a maximum estimate of some 300 cruise missiles. The total includes both nuclear and conventional warheads. In total, China is widely estimate to have about 300 nuclear warheads. The US and Russia have over 6,000 nuclear warheads each.A new treaty that includes China would be a positive development!Accordingly, including China in a future arms control treaty would probably exert a downward pressure on US and Russian warhead numbers, as it is hard to see why China would otherwise agree to sign up. A new treaty that includes China would therefore be a positive development. It is, however, unclear whether China will find the proposal of joining a new treaty credible when the old has just been abandoned.LilienstrÃ¶m: The Strait of Hormuz, a chokepoint for international trade, has become the stage for an international conflict. What do you think of a US-led mission to protect oil tankers in the Persian Gulf?Smith: Safe passage by sea should be secured by agreement, subject to international law; neither a US-led military mission nor any other military deployment will contribute this aim.LilienstrÃ¶m: Cyber-attacks, propaganda, and disinformation are means of conducting a hybrid conflict. How vulnerable are Germany, the EU and the NATO countries to becoming targets of hybrid threats and campaigns?Smith: All European countries are already subject to cyber incidents of various scales from a wide variety of sources. What is called "hybrid warfare" normally also involves the use of armed force; currently, NATO and EU countries face a relatively low risk of experiencing that kind of conflict.LilienstrÃ¶m: Regarding climate conflicts: The drought in the region around the drying Lake Chad demonstrates the effects of global warming. Is climate change a global security risk?Smith: Climate change leads to violent conflict in a context of poor governance. Unfortunately, many areas that will face the strongest direct impact of global warming lack the structures and capacities in government needed to adapt to it. In these locations there are and will be severe climate-related security risks.LilienstrÃ¶m: Mr. Smith, our seventh question is always the same: What three trouble spots are in your opinion currently the most dangerous and what measures do you suggest to de-escalate conflict and stabilize peace?Dan Smith: Northeast Asia, the Gulf, the wider Sahel. The great need is for dialogue, respect for the rule of international law and a clear recognition that international cooperation is required to solve any and all of the world's severest problems.Load-Date: September 20, 2019End of Document

Huawei is trying to sell all its 5G patents to a Western buyer in a bid to placate Trump and dodge national-security concernsBusiness Insider USSeptember 12, 2019 Thursday 06:36 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 533 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Isobel Asher Hamilton)Highlight: The US has urged allied nations to reject Huawei's 5G kit on national security grounds, claiming that Huawei is a conduit for Chinese state spying.BodyREUTERS/Aly Song• Huawei is offering to sell its 5G technology patents to a Western company in a bid to quell fears about security.• The US has urged allied nations to reject Huawei's 5G kit on national security grounds, claiming that Huawei is a conduit for Chinese state spying. Huawei denies this.• CEO Ren Zhengfei told The Economist that the one-off sale of its 5G patents could create a viable competitor for Huawei.• Ren said he had "no idea" of who might want to take the offer.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.Huawei is trying an unusual tactic to try and break its deadlock with the US government. It's offering to sell the rights to all its 5G patents in a one-time-only offer.Huawei's CEO Ren Zhengfei told the Economist's Hal Hodson that the company is offering to bundle up its 5G patents, licenses, code, and technical blueprints in a one-off transaction.The idea is to create a rival for the Chinese tech giant. "A balanced distribution of interests is conducive to Huawei's survival," Ren told Hodson.Ren said he had "no idea" who might be interested in buying, and did not put a figure on how much Huawei's 5G "stack" might be worth. Hodson said it could run to tens of billions of dollars given the amount of money Huawei has poured into research.The move is designed to placate concerns in the West about Huawei's 5G dominance, coupled with the national security concerns from the Trump administration, which claims that Huawei acts as a proxy for the Chinese government to spy. Huawei denies this.Huawei's rollout of 5G has been actively targeted by the Trump administration, which has been advising allies to reject Huawei's kit or risk damaging their relationship with the US.Read more: The Trump administration is warning allies to stay away from Huawei - but not everyone's listeningAt the same time the US has hamstrung Huawei by placing it on a trade blacklist, although Huawei has now received two 90-day licenses to give American firms time to disentangle themselves from the company.The major threat from the blacklisting is cutting Huawei off from Google. Huawei phones all run Google's Android operating system, and come with Google's bundle of apps including the Google Play Store, which allows users to download other popular apps such as Instagram and WhatsApp.Although Huawei has developed its own operating system as a plan B, being cut off from the world's most popula apps would put Huawei phones at a major disadvantage.It is unclear whether strategy floated by Ren will do anything to appease the US, whether China would approve the sale, or even whether Huawei will find a buyer.NOW WATCH: The incredible story behind Slack, the app that's taken over offices everywhereSee Also:• The FCC's long-awaited mid-band auction could accelerate 5G rollouts in the US• Huawei is on the verge of releasing its first major smartphone since being blacklisted by the US.

The smart lighting market is expected to register a CAGR of over 27.1% during the forecast period, 2019PR NewswireSeptember 11, 2019 Wednesday 7:10 PM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1438 wordsDateline: NEW YORK, Sept. 11, 2019 BodyPR NewswireMarket OverviewThe smart lighting market is expected to register a CAGR of over 27.1% during the forecast period, 2019 - 2024. With the increase in sustainable green building initiatives, owing to environmental concerns and penetration of technology in day to day life, there is rise in the growth of adoption rate. Green buildings are the buildings which majorly focus on efficiency, effective lifecycle, and performance of the buildings. The rising trend of integrating the technology with the lighting system is gaining momentum.Read the full report:https://www.reportlinker.com/p05815031/?utm_source=PRN- The development of smart buildings and increase in government initiatives for smart city projects are boosting the adoption of smart lighting, thereby impacting the market's growth positively. For instance, the Chinese government has begun to adopt and implement various smart city initiatives. There is a robust financial and institutional support from the central and local government for making smart city initiative. The country aims to encourage 100 new smart cities from 2016 to 2020 to lead the country's urban planning and development. Over 1,000 smart city pilot projects, across the world, are ready for and are under construction, and China is home to about 500 of them, covering small and big cities.- The increasing adoption and decreasing cost of LEDs are driving the market. The high luminous efficacy, reduced energy use, greater lifespan, and decreasing average selling price (ASP) of the LED lighting products compel the consumers to switch to LED technology. As smart lighting is expected to be the future of lighting, various companies, such as Philips, Magiclight, and Xiaom are investing in the technology to reduce the producing cost.- Higher cost of installation is restraining the market to grow. The initial cost required to integrate or replace the lighting system into industrial facilities is a costly affair, especially for small and medium industries. The preference traditionally has been given to compact fluorescent lamps (CFL), LFL, and HIDs as certain end-users prefer the use of traditional lighting sources over new and emerging LEDs, as they have a lower initial cost.Scope of the ReportSmart lighting is energy-efficient lighting, with light control adjusted to the user's needs and the applicable regulations. The market is highly influenced by the increasing concerns for the well being of the environment. With the developing trend of Internet of Things (IoT), it is expected to brighten the development of lighting market through smart bulbs, LED technology, etc, in indoor and outdoor application.Key Market TrendsIndoor Segment is Expected to Witness a Significant Growth through LED penetration- The indoor application has seen significant growth in the smart lighting market and is estimated to have substantial growth over the forecast period. The indoor use of smart lighting includes residential, commercial, and industrial uses. The high adoption of connected lighting systems for residential and commercial purposes resulted in a significant share for indoor application.- The increasing growth in the use of LED lamps inside building premises for lighting provides enormous opportunities for smart lighting-based applications by using the functions of high-speed wireless data communication and indoor lighting infrastructure, which is very cost-effective to be widely utilized across smart buildings.- The power consumption of lights is expected to account for nearly 40% of the total energy consumption of cities. As an important part of smart cites, smart lighting has advantages in terms of access point number in the Internet of Things. The governments are also actively supporting the construction of smart cities. The changing lifestyle and increasing disposal income of people are boosting the demand for interior lighting, especially in hotels, restaurants, and office buildings. The availability of LEDs in various shapes, colors, and brightness is an opening way for new lighting designs.- Since buildings can consume up to one-third of the global energy, they offer one of the most significant opportunities for emission reduction activities. Organizations, like The Capital Group and Philips, are collaborating for seeking to drive primary goals for indoor smart lights after achieving considerable success in replacing all outdoor lights with LED smart lightings by 2025.- Moreover, the growing adoption of smart LEDs in offices is driving the commercial segment in a cost-effective manner, where installing an energy management system is costly, harnessing the intelligence in every LED fixture unit can create smart, and tunable endpoints.Asia-Pacific Witnessed to Hold the Fastest Growing Market- In recent years, the Asia-Pacific region saw significant growth in the smart lighting market, and over the forecast period, it is expected to have the highest growth. Creating and developing smart infrastructure in the region, scaled establishment of smart lighting framework over the private and commercial sectors, and increasing investments by the government on public infrastructure are increasing the growth of the market in the region.- GSMA estimates that China may account for approximately 4.1 billion IoT connections, which is almost one-third of the global IoT connections, by 2025. Smart lighting systems are expected to be the biggest beneficiary of the trend, during the forecast period. Technology giants in the country, like Tencent, Baidu, JD, and Alibaba, are introducing their smart system solutions. Majority of the Chinese market share is distributed among these giants. These domestic brands are trendy and are expected to drive the market growth.- The Indian housing industry is one of the quickest growing sectors of India. Smart City Mission for 100 cities in the country is driving the market for smart lightings. With a new initiative undertaken in Chandigarh, India plans to convert 3,800 street lights into sensor-based intelligent lighting system, under the Smart City Mission. Initiatives like these, taken by other states as well, could drive the market growth during the forecast period.- The Indian government has launched UJALA program, with a target to distribute 770 million LEDs by March 2019. This program aims to rectify the high cost of electrification and the increased emissions from inefficient lighting in the country, amidst the backdrop of electricity demand witnessing a five-fold increase, over the years.Competitive LandscapeThe smart lighting market is highly competitive and consists of several major players. In terms of market share, few of the major players currently dominate the market. However, with smart lightings, many of the companies are increasing their market presence by securing new contracts and acquiring other companies. Key players are Koninklijke Philips NV, Cree Inc., Eaton Corporation, etc. Recent developments in the market are -- May 2019 - Signify and Silicon Labs announced collaboration on an extension of the Friends of Hue program, enabling ecosystem partners to develop smart light switches for Philips Hue systems. Silicon Labs is offering the Zigbee cluster libraries, software tools, reference application, and technical expertise to help participating companies certified by the Friends of Hue program quickly design and produce light switch products guaranteed to work flawlessly with the Philips Hue smart lighting system.- May 2019 - Eaton Corporation introduced an advanced connected lighting platform designed to drive efficient, effective decision-making for building operations called "Trellix". The platform is designed to cater the consumers in healthcare, manufacturing, commercial offices, education, hospitality, and retail industry to improve operational efficiency and occupant experience.Reasons to Purchase this report:- The market estimate (ME) sheet in Excel format- Report customization as per the client's requirements- 3 months of analyst supportRead the full report:           https://www.reportlinker.com/p05815031/?utm_source=PRNAboutReportlinkerReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

The tweet that caused an international crisisCE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 10, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 489 wordsBodyOn demonstrations, last Friday, Daryl Morey, the manager of the Houston Rockets, NBA basketball team, tweeted: "Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong." (Fight for freedom. On the Hong Kong side.) His tweet refers to the violent demonstrations that have been taking place in Hong Kong against the extradition to China of a Hong Kong citizen on suspicion of a murder in Taiwan.At first glance it may seem like an innocuous subject, but it's actually extremely complicated. Let's start because China is a market of immense importance to the NBA, just the TV rights contract with Tencent, the Chinese internet communications giant, estimates to contribute up to 5% of the league's revenue. Consider that the revenue is equally divided between the owners and players, that means that each team receives 8 million dollars for the owners and another 8 for the players, the Chinese government already announced that it would cancel the contract for that not so harmless tweet.It's a complicated situation for the NBA. On the one hand, they have taken the banner of free speech as part of their intrinsic brand, players and managers frequently comment on topics such as gun ownership, elections and racism in the United States and the league publicly supports them. One might speculate that this contrasting mechanics of how the AMERICAN football league, the NFL, which has contributed to the rise of basketball against the most popular sport in the United States.It's not just the TV contract, the NBA participates in its pre-season in China, many players and former players have business in that country, their huge population buys a lot of league merchandise and they have expansion plans. It is easy to defend the emblem of free speech when it is cheap, but this posture is very expensive, besides, it is not necessarily the right one...Unsurprisingly, when the league, the rockets' owner and Morey himself essentially apologized to China and circulated rumors that the manager's work was at stake, the US media jumped up to condemn the league's actions as cowardice and Greed. However, public policy experts have advised caution on the issue.For protesters in Hong Kong, extradition poses a threat against the rights they enjoy with their independence, and in the rest of China demonstrations are seen as an effort to separate Hong Kong from the rest of the country, when the Chinese prevail the d to keep China together. This is an extreme over-simplification of the subject, but it is important to understand that it is not black and white and frightening the power of a tweet that, being honest, the rockets manager surely never imagined causing anything more of people admiring his defense of the rights and freedoms of the Chinese.Meanwhile, this issue has weighed heavily on financial markets and affected china-U.S. trade pact negotiations. All for a few likes and the appearance of being politically correct.juanmaria7@gmail.comLoad-Date: October 11, 2019End of Document

HONG KONG FORMER STUDENT LEADER BARRED FROM RUNNING IN DISTRICT COUNCIL POLLSStates News ServiceOctober 29, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 913 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Officials in Hong Kong have barred 2014 student leader and democracy activist Joshua Wong from running in forthcoming district elections, in a move that Wong slammed as "politically driven.""I have become the ONLY candidate banned from running in November's District Council Election," Wong wrote in a statement on his Facebook page on Tuesday. "The decision to ban me from running office is clearly politically-driven."He said the decision, which came after a civil servant in charge of ruling on his application mysteriously went on sick leave, was based on the subjective interpretation of his intention to uphold the city's mini-constitution, the Basic Law."But everyone [knows] that the true reason is my identity, Joshua Wong, a crime in their mind," he said.He said the "disappearance" of Dorothy Ma, a returning officer in charge of administering elections for the executive branch of government, had made it clear that the ruling Chinese Communist Party in Beijing had "exerted extremely strong pressure" on Hong Kong officials charged with processing his application.Wong's application for candidacy was ruled "invalid" by returning officer Laura Aron, "based on my political affiliation with Demosisto," Wong said, in reference to the political party he formed along with former student leaders of the 2014 Occupy Central movement for fully democratic elections.Wong's manifesto for the 2019 District Council Election had been based on the recognition that street protests weren't enough to bring about true democracy in Hong Kong."The problems we face on a community level go hand in hand with systematic problems that the whole of Hong Kong faces," Wong wrote in the online document. "The foundation of genuine democracy is a care and understanding of people's daily needs."'A chilling effect'The Sept. 28 statement also speaks of the effects of Chinese government influence in Hong Kong since the anti-extradition movement escalated in early June, gripping the city with ongoing mass marches, human chains, clashes with riot police, and political vandalism.Clashes left many of Hong Kong's neighborhoods frequently fighting off tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon wielded by police, as well as widespread arrests and allegations of police violence and sexual abuse in custody."A chilling effect has slowly spread to the workplace, schools, families and communities in the past few months," Wong wrote. "But in spite of that, many friends in this district still come out to show their defiance against an unaccountable government.""Many Hongkongers still give their blood and sweat in defence of democratic values."Wong's barring came as the U.K.'s Anglia Ruskin University (ARU) stripped pro-China lawmaker Junius Ho, who has referred to protesters as cockroaches, and who has been accused of collusion with brutal pro-China mob attacks on train passengers in Yuen Long district on July 21, of his honorary doctorate."ARU's honorands must be positive role models to our students, alumni and staff, and to the communities we serve," the university said in a statement."Mr Ho's conduct since he was honoured has caused increasing concern. Following an investigation, the university has withdrawn Mr Ho's honorary degree," it said.Ho was seen greeting a white-clothed group of assailants in widely circulated video clips from July 21, shaking their hands, and calling the suspected gangsters "heroes", giving them thumbs-up and saying to them "thank you for your hard work."At least one of the white-clothed men who shook hands with Ho has been shown to have been inside Yuen Long Station during the attacks, social media footage indicated.Another candidate disqualifiedWong's disqualification comes after his Demosisto colleague and fellow 2014 student protest leader Agnes Chow was disqualified from running in a LegCo by-election in March 2018 because her political views were judged to be pro-independence.An electoral officer for Hong Kong Island ruled that she wasn't fit to stand in a byelection to fill the seat left empty by the earlier disqualification of Demosisto lawmaker Nathan Law, one of six pro-democracy LegCo members to be disqualified because of the way they took their oaths of allegiance.Chow launched a legal challenge to her disqualification, and won her appeal in Hong Kong's High Court last month.Prospective candidates can now only run in elections to LegCo or Hong Kong's district councils if they sign a letter pledging allegiance to the Hong Kong government and the city's mini-constitution, the Basic Law.Anyone who is believed to support independence or "democratic autonomy" for Hong Kong, which was handed back to the People's Republic of China in 1997, is also prevented from standing,The barring of certain candidates because of their political views has sparked widespread criticism among barristers, rights groups and pro-democracy politicians, as well as among former British and Hong Kong officials, who say the move is a blow to democracy and freedom of expression in the former British colony.And a proposed extension of the ban to include calls for a democratic China would make it much harder for pro-democracy politicians and rights activists who have made such comments in the past to stand for election, regardless of their views on independence.Reported by Lau Siu-fung and Man Hoi-tsan for RFA's Cantonese Service.

Patients 02002 and 02006 were treated with higher dose levels of RP-L102. Patients 02004 and 02005 received non-optimized and lower doses of RP-L102. Key highlights of the manuscript include:Follow-up data for the initial four patients 18-30 months post-infusion demonstrate progressively increased engraftment in peripheral blood leukocytes and in the bone marrow following administration of RP-L102 without the use of conditioning. In Patient 02002 at 30 months follow-up, approximately 44% of bone marrow CD34+ cells displayed gene marking, suggesting the engraftment of very primitive corrected hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Sequential increases in gene marking in peripheral blood and in the bone marrow for Patients 02004 and 02005 were also seen, but at more modest levels and after longer durations. The bone marrow resistance to MMC in Patient 02002 increased to 70% at 24 months, approaching the phenotype of a healthy donor. Patients 02004, 02005 and 02006 also displayed progressive increases in MMC resistance. DEB exposure resulted in a lower proportion of cells with aberrant chromosomes in Patients 02002, 02004 and 02006. Patient 02002 demonstrated stabilized neutrophil counts and hemoglobin levels as early as six months post-administration of RP-L102. Similar trends were also seen in Patient 02006. Progressive increases in the total number of corrected leukocytes were observed shortly after the initial administration of RP-L102 in all treated patients. Favorable safety profile with no serious adverse events associated with infusion of the investigational product in these initial four patients.07:08STOR STORE Capital increases quarterly dividend to $0.35/share from $0.33/share (37.08 )07:07STC Stewart Info confirms termination of Fidelity National (FNF) merger, names new CEO (33.77 )In light of the FTC's decision, the Stewart Board has clearly determined that leveraging the company's strong brand, financial position, and valued employees to grow the organization as a standalone entity will create the greatest shareholder value.

NfL is a protein that provides structural support to nerve fibres in the brain. An increase in the amount of NfL may be associated with nerve cell damage, and detection of increased NfL levels in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may serve as a biomarker of nerve cell damage.In the Phase III OPERA I study in RMS and the ORATORIO study in PPMS, blood NfL levels were significantly lower after treatment with OCREVUS. In RMS, blood serum NfL levels were reduced by 43 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with a 31 percent reduction with interferon beta-1a (p<0.001). In PPMS, blood plasma NfL levels were reduced by 16 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with 0.2 percent reduction with placebo (p<0.001).

OS rates at five years were 13.4% for Opdivo and 2.6% for docetaxel. The OS benefit for Opdivo-treated patients was observed across all subgroups.The safety profile for patients treated with Opdivo was consistent with previously reported findings in second-line NSCLC and no new safety signals were seen with extended follow-up. Of patients still on study, only 2 of 70 experienced a new treatment-related select AE between years three and four and there were no new treatment-related select AE's reported between years four and five among the 55 patients still on study.Among patients with an objective response to Opdivo, 32.2% continued to see a response at five years. 0% of patients with an objective response to docetaxel continued to see a response at five years. The median duration of response was 19.9 months for Opdivo-treated patients and 5.6 months for patients treated with docetaxel.06:00ALNY Alnylam Pharma presents new clinical results for Givosiran -- Porphyria attack reductions observed in ENVISION Phase 3 study maintained with ongoing Givosiran dosing in open-label extension study (82.69 )ENVISION Phase 3 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of January 31, 2019, all eligible patients (N=93) from the ENVISION Phase 3 study of givosiran rolled over into the OLE phase of the study. Reduction in the composite porphyria attack rate with givosiran treatment, which had been observed in the ENVISION Phase 3 study as early as one month after dosing, was shown to be sustained with continued dosing in the OLE phase of the study. Sustained reduction in levels of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), an intermediate in the heme biosynthesis pathway believed to be the primary neurotoxic intermediate responsible for causing both porphyria attacks and ongoing symptoms in between attacks, was also observed with continued dosing. Rapid and sustained lowering of attack rate and ALA levels was also observed in placebo patients who crossed over after the six-month double blind phase of the ENVISION Phase 3 study to receive givosiran in the OLE phase of the study. Givosiran's safety profile in the OLE phase has remained consistent with the profile observed in the double blind phase of the ENVISION study.ENVISION Results of Select Patient Reported Outcomes -- A number of patient reported outcomes were collected as secondary and exploratory measures in the ENVISION study. Daily worst pain did not achieve statistical significance based on the prespecified ANCOVA analysis (p equals 0.0530), however, the data were found to not be normally distributed. A post-hoc analysis of daily worst pain was therefore performed using the non-parametric stratified Wilcoxon test. Based on the non-parametric test, patients on givosiran had a significant reduction in daily worst pain (nominal p equals 0.0455). In exploratory analyses, the reductions in pain were accompanied by fewer days of use of both opioid and non-opioid analgesics. Givosiran did not impact daily worst fatigue or daily worst nausea at six months, although these assessments will be repeated at twelve months to explore the effects of longer term dosing. Updated Phase 1/2 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of April 19, 2019, a robust treatment effect was maintained in givosiran-treated patients with continued dosing in the Phase 1/2 OLE study (N=16), with a mean time on treatment of 22.8 months and total time on treatment across the Phase 1 and OLE studies of up to 35 months. Substantial mean reductions in annualized attack rate (AAR) and in annualized hemin use of greater than 90 percent were observed, with evidence for sustained or potentially enhanced clinical activity with continued dosing. Five out of twelve patients (42 percent) who received givosiran during the Phase 1 study and continued with givosiran dosing in the OLE study and two out of four patients (50 percent) who had been in the placebo arm of the Phase 1 study and crossed over to givosiran treatment in the OLE study achieved an AAR of zero for a mean of 18.1 and 24.9 months, respectively.06:00ACN Accenture acquires Pragsis Bidoop; terms not disclosed (194.83 )Pragsis Bidoop, headquartered in Madrid with additional offices in Barcelona and the U.K., will add more than 200 employees with deep machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data engineering experience, along with its portfolio of end-to-end solutions, to Accenture's Applied Intelligence business.06:00ASX ASE Technology reports August net revenues +10.3% yr/yr to $1.28 bln (4.51 )06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets ease back; S&P Futures take out yesterday's lowThe global equity markets are under slight pressure to start the day.

The S&P 500 (-0.01%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) finished near their flat lines.The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%), which is home to many energy and financial stocks, outperformed the broader market.The market entered today on the heels of a two-week rally, with some investors beginning to feel less concerned about growth prospects and trade relations with China. For instance, data has shown the U.S. consumer to be resilient in the face of trade tensions, which could see a reprieve with trade talks coming up next month.This positive sentiment was manifested in the higher oil prices ($57.87/bbl, +$1.42, +2.5%) and the selling in the Treasury market on Monday. In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD16:20IMXI International Money Express announces secondary public offering of 5,217,392 shares of common stock by selling stockholders (13.60 -0.55)Shares will be offered by affiliates of Stella Point Capital and certain of the company's other stockholders.

American Realty Capital Properties, Inc., at a cost to the company of approximately $765.5 mln, comprised of a contribution of $738.5 mln toward the Class Action settlement and $27.0 mln toward the Opt Out Action settlements.On September 8, 2019, the company signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) providing for the settlement of the Class Action.

Additionally, the company has decided to discontinue the development of MRT5201, a liver-targeted treatment for OTC deficiency.The company's decision to discontinue the development of MRT5201 for OTC deficiency is based on data from recently completed preclinical studies that do not support the desired pharmacokinetic and safety profile for advancement of the program. These data are related to the first-generation lipid nanoparticle (LNP) designed to be delivered to the liver via intravenous administration for the OTC deficiency program. As such, this LNP is different than that used in the CF and other pulmonary development programs which are designed to deliver the LNP-encapsulated mRNA through nebulization. Additionally, ongoing discovery efforts have generated promising, novel next-generation LNPs supporting the further development of liver disease mRNA therapeutics with potentially favorable product profiles.The company's prioritization of pulmonary diseases is supported by the previously reported positive single-ascending dose Phase 1/2 data from the CF program, which utilizes its proprietary lung delivery platform. MRT5005 is a first-in-class mRNA therapeutic designed to address the underlying cause of CF regardless of genetic mutation by delivering mRNA encoding fully functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein to cells in the lung through nebulization. The multiple-ascending dose portion of the clinical trial is ongoing with data expected in 2020.16:08CASY Casey's General beats by $0.28, beats on revs; reaffirms guidance (167.30 -2.03)Reports Q1 (Jul) earnings of $2.31 per share, $0.28 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.03; revenues rose 1.5% year/year to $2.63 bln vs the $2.59 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Revenue is expected to decrease 18.7% yr/yr to $1.34 bln. The company reiterated its FY20 guidance on June 4, priming the market for revenue between $7.46 bln and $7.87 bln. The last three months saw just a handful of noteworthy game releases, which likely presented a headwind to overall store traffic in Q2. There are more big titles scheduled to be released in the fall and in early 2020, which should be a positive for the company's outlookShares of GME hit a fresh record low in mid-August amid dimming prospects for a meaningful turnaround. The stock recovered from that low over the past couple weeks, aided by comments from investor Michael Burry, who revealed that his fund owns 3% of outstanding shares of GME. Mr. Burry's view is based on the expectation that the next generation of consoles will not do away with physical Blu-ray drives. While the decision to keep physical drives would be a positive for GME, the company would still need to compete with large retailers like Best Buy (BBY 68.95, -0.27, -0.4%), Target (TGT 107.56, -0.39, -0.4%), and Walmart (WMT 116.02, -0.31, -0.3%) at a time when GME has been closing many of its locations.10:18AAPL Apple September product event previewApple is set to unveil new products today at 13:00 ET. Most of these products will have very incremental upgrades. Most of the attention for shareholders will be placed to the pricing of the company's Apple TV Plus and Apple Arcade services. Apple stock is up 35% year-to-date vs. a 22.5% gain in the Nasdaq 100. The stock remains near the high end of its recent range and less than 10% from its all-time high.iPhones: The company is expected to release three new iPhones. The first iPhone will likely be called the iPhone 11 and will feature a 6.1-inch LCD screen similar to the iPhone XR that is currently on sale. The other two phones will be called the iPhone 11 Pro and will feature organic light-emitting diode displays similar to the iPhone Xs and Xs Max. The iPhone 11 Pro will come in two sizes: 5.8 and 6.5 inches. The phones are expected to feature faster processors and better cameras. However, these phones will likely only have incremental improvements as Apple is expected to unveil its 5G iPhone in 2020. Analysts are expecting pricing similar to prior models between $749-1099.Services: Apple could confirm the pricing for its gaming and TV services and introduce additional content expected for those services. It has been reported by several sources that the gaming service will cost $4.99/month and the TV service will cost $9.99/month. Apple will have to compete with other streaming offerings from Disney (DIS) which will be priced lower.Apple Watch 5: The updated smartwatch is expected to feature a ceramic design, faster processors, and more health features such as sleep tracking.Mac: Apple is expected to introduce a 16-inch Mac Book Pro.iPads: There is some speculation that Apple will update its iPad Pro lineup with faster processors and larger screens. However, some analysts feel the iPad will get its own event in October.Other Products: Apple could introduce Apple "tracking tags" that will allow users to find lost items. Expectations are for another underwhelming iPhone cycle ahead of next year's 5G offering. Analysts note that there is a lot of pent up demand with many older iPhones in the installed base. Therefore, there is an expectation for a super cycle for the 5G handset next year. Still, the investment thesis has shifted from iPhone cycles to a more diversified set of hardware and services. Last quarter, iPhone sales fell to less than 50% of revenue for the first time as the success of services, iPads, AirPods, and the Apple Watch picked up the slack for falling iPhone sales. Apple's earnings are expected to grow 10% next year after falling 2% in fiscal 2019, which concludes this month. With a $943 bln market cap, the stock trades at ~17x earnings, or ~15x, backing out the cash.Suppliers to keep on note include: SSNLF, LPL (for displays) and LITE, FNSR and IIVI (for FaceID.) Other suppliers include: SWKS, CRUS, AVGO, QRVO, TSM, and QCOM, among others.

Patients 02002 and 02006 were treated with higher dose levels of RP-L102. Patients 02004 and 02005 received non-optimized and lower doses of RP-L102. Key highlights of the manuscript include:Follow-up data for the initial four patients 18-30 months post-infusion demonstrate progressively increased engraftment in peripheral blood leukocytes and in the bone marrow following administration of RP-L102 without the use of conditioning. In Patient 02002 at 30 months follow-up, approximately 44% of bone marrow CD34+ cells displayed gene marking, suggesting the engraftment of very primitive corrected hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Sequential increases in gene marking in peripheral blood and in the bone marrow for Patients 02004 and 02005 were also seen, but at more modest levels and after longer durations. The bone marrow resistance to MMC in Patient 02002 increased to 70% at 24 months, approaching the phenotype of a healthy donor. Patients 02004, 02005 and 02006 also displayed progressive increases in MMC resistance. DEB exposure resulted in a lower proportion of cells with aberrant chromosomes in Patients 02002, 02004 and 02006. Patient 02002 demonstrated stabilized neutrophil counts and hemoglobin levels as early as six months post-administration of RP-L102. Similar trends were also seen in Patient 02006. Progressive increases in the total number of corrected leukocytes were observed shortly after the initial administration of RP-L102 in all treated patients. Favorable safety profile with no serious adverse events associated with infusion of the investigational product in these initial four patients.07:08STOR STORE Capital increases quarterly dividend to $0.35/share from $0.33/share (37.08 )07:07STC Stewart Info confirms termination of Fidelity National (FNF) merger, names new CEO (33.77 )In light of the FTC's decision, the Stewart Board has clearly determined that leveraging the company's strong brand, financial position, and valued employees to grow the organization as a standalone entity will create the greatest shareholder value.

NfL is a protein that provides structural support to nerve fibres in the brain. An increase in the amount of NfL may be associated with nerve cell damage, and detection of increased NfL levels in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may serve as a biomarker of nerve cell damage.In the Phase III OPERA I study in RMS and the ORATORIO study in PPMS, blood NfL levels were significantly lower after treatment with OCREVUS. In RMS, blood serum NfL levels were reduced by 43 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with a 31 percent reduction with interferon beta-1a (p<0.001). In PPMS, blood plasma NfL levels were reduced by 16 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with 0.2 percent reduction with placebo (p<0.001). Additionally, these analyses showed higher blood NfL levels at the start of the study were correlated with more disability progression in upper and lower limbs in PPMS and overall disability in the interferon beta-1a RMS treatment group at 96 weeks.06:03FTS Fortis announces five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 bln for the period 2020 to 2024, increases quarterly dividend to $0.4775/share from $0.45/share (42.08 )The co announced its five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 billion for the period 2020 to 2024, up $1.0 billion from the prior year's plan.

Reduction in the composite porphyria attack rate with givosiran treatment, which had been observed in the ENVISION Phase 3 study as early as one month after dosing, was shown to be sustained with continued dosing in the OLE phase of the study. Sustained reduction in levels of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), an intermediate in the heme biosynthesis pathway believed to be the primary neurotoxic intermediate responsible for causing both porphyria attacks and ongoing symptoms in between attacks, was also observed with continued dosing. Rapid and sustained lowering of attack rate and ALA levels was also observed in placebo patients who crossed over after the six-month double blind phase of the ENVISION Phase 3 study to receive givosiran in the OLE phase of the study. Givosiran's safety profile in the OLE phase has remained consistent with the profile observed in the double blind phase of the ENVISION study.ENVISION Results of Select Patient Reported Outcomes -- A number of patient reported outcomes were collected as secondary and exploratory measures in the ENVISION study. Daily worst pain did not achieve statistical significance based on the prespecified ANCOVA analysis (p equals 0.0530), however, the data were found to not be normally distributed. A post-hoc analysis of daily worst pain was therefore performed using the non-parametric stratified Wilcoxon test. Based on the non-parametric test, patients on givosiran had a significant reduction in daily worst pain (nominal p equals 0.0455). In exploratory analyses, the reductions in pain were accompanied by fewer days of use of both opioid and non-opioid analgesics. Givosiran did not impact daily worst fatigue or daily worst nausea at six months, although these assessments will be repeated at twelve months to explore the effects of longer term dosing. Updated Phase 1/2 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of April 19, 2019, a robust treatment effect was maintained in givosiran-treated patients with continued dosing in the Phase 1/2 OLE study (N=16), with a mean time on treatment of 22.8 months and total time on treatment across the Phase 1 and OLE studies of up to 35 months. Substantial mean reductions in annualized attack rate (AAR) and in annualized hemin use of greater than 90 percent were observed, with evidence for sustained or potentially enhanced clinical activity with continued dosing. Five out of twelve patients (42 percent) who received givosiran during the Phase 1 study and continued with givosiran dosing in the OLE study and two out of four patients (50 percent) who had been in the placebo arm of the Phase 1 study and crossed over to givosiran treatment in the OLE study achieved an AAR of zero for a mean of 18.1 and 24.9 months, respectively.06:00ACN Accenture acquires Pragsis Bidoop; terms not disclosed (194.83 )Pragsis Bidoop, headquartered in Madrid with additional offices in Barcelona and the U.K., will add more than 200 employees with deep machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data engineering experience, along with its portfolio of end-to-end solutions, to Accenture's Applied Intelligence business.06:00ASX ASE Technology reports August net revenues +10.3% yr/yr to $1.28 bln (4.51 )06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets ease back; S&P Futures take out yesterday's lowThe global equity markets are under slight pressure to start the day.

In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD16:20IMXI International Money Express announces secondary public offering of 5,217,392 shares of common stock by selling stockholders (13.60 -0.55)Shares will be offered by affiliates of Stella Point Capital and certain of the company's other stockholders.

Additionally, the company has decided to discontinue the development of MRT5201, a liver-targeted treatment for OTC deficiency.The company's decision to discontinue the development of MRT5201 for OTC deficiency is based on data from recently completed preclinical studies that do not support the desired pharmacokinetic and safety profile for advancement of the program. These data are related to the first-generation lipid nanoparticle (LNP) designed to be delivered to the liver via intravenous administration for the OTC deficiency program. As such, this LNP is different than that used in the CF and other pulmonary development programs which are designed to deliver the LNP-encapsulated mRNA through nebulization. Additionally, ongoing discovery efforts have generated promising, novel next-generation LNPs supporting the further development of liver disease mRNA therapeutics with potentially favorable product profiles.The company's prioritization of pulmonary diseases is supported by the previously reported positive single-ascending dose Phase 1/2 data from the CF program, which utilizes its proprietary lung delivery platform. MRT5005 is a first-in-class mRNA therapeutic designed to address the underlying cause of CF regardless of genetic mutation by delivering mRNA encoding fully functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein to cells in the lung through nebulization. The multiple-ascending dose portion of the clinical trial is ongoing with data expected in 2020.16:08CASY Casey's General beats by $0.28, beats on revs; reaffirms guidance (167.30 -2.03)Reports Q1 (Jul) earnings of $2.31 per share, $0.28 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.03; revenues rose 1.5% year/year to $2.63 bln vs the $2.59 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Its depressed outlook fueled fears that President Donald Trump's trade war with China is sapping demand for technology products and services."The chipmaker is a clear drag today on sentiment," Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, said in a morning note.Wider weakness in corporate earnings has raised concerns of a slowing US economy. Following the release of third-quarter earnings from a fifth of companies in the S&P 500, FactSet expects overall earnings to drop for a third consecutive quarter, by 4.7%, the Wall Street Journal reported.Britain's parliament voted in favor of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit deal on Tuesday, but rejected his plan to rush legislation and pull the UK out of the European Union by the end of this month. The government has requested a three-month extension to the departure deadline."Uncertainty prevails for the time being, but Parliament has backed a deal and that feels like a key moment," Wilson added.Meanwhile, the Chinese government is drafting a plan to replace Carrie Lam - Hong Kong's chief executive - with an interim leader, according to the Financial Times.

Forever 21 declares bankruptcyThe Hillsdale Collegian: Hillsdale CollegeOctober 17, 2019 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: CULTURE; Pg. 1Length: 1049 wordsByline: Carmel KookogeyBodyForever 21 filed for bank­ruptcy two weeks ago. | Wiki­media CommonsWhile the media rushed to explain the eco­nomic causes when Forever 21 declared bank­ruptcy two weeks ago, there's one issue they didn't mention: fast fashion.The Wall Street Journal reported that until the late 1970s, the U.S. pro­duced at least 70% of the apparel that Amer­icans pur­chased, according to the Bureau of Labor Sta­tistics. In the late 1980s, "fast fashion" broke out, and con­sumers could pur­chase "trendy, inex­pensive gar­ments mass pro­duced at lightning speed in sub­con­tracted fac­tories and hawked in thou­sands of chain stores world-wide."Pro­fessor of Political Economy Gary Wolfram explained that the rise of online retail and the U.S. tariffs on China were probably the leading causes of Forever 21's col­lapse."A rea­sonable amount of their material came from China," Wolfram said. "If they're cheap fashions, that means they're trying to sell a lot at a low margin. When you have a tariff, that means your margin is already low. I don't know this, but I would guess the tariffs have a sig­nif­icant effect on Forever 21's business. Had they been selling high-end fashion, I'm going to bet they would have done better."But while fast fashion wasn't the leading cause of Forever 21's bank­ruptcy, over the past several years, con­scious fashion-lovers have called out Forever 21 and other similar clothing stores for selling "fast fashion" - mass-pro­duced, impos­sibly-cheap clothing, only made pos­sible by foreign laborers working 14 - 16 hour days to satisfy quotas. These com­panies are able to sell extra­or­di­narily cheap products by man­u­fac­turing in coun­tries where laborers making as little as 14 cents an hour, or in some cases, are gov­ernment-forced.Many coun­tries such as Bangladesh, Uzbek­istan, and China - the global leader in clothing pro­duction - also hire child laborers to work in the dan­gerous machinery from as young as 5 years old.Mar­keting Coor­di­nator William Persson, co-host of Hillsdale's "Green Is The New Black" podcast, said the fast fashion industry also pro­duces a lot of waste, both in extra clip­pings and in leftover clothes at the end of each season - for a store like Forever 21, that can be as many as 52 of these "seasons" in one year."In order to protect the brand, whatever isn't sold a lot of com­panies will burn or get rid of somehow, to maintain brand integrity," Persson said. "This is dan­gerous because a lot of the mate­rials are syn­thetic, and so burning them releases a lot of chem­icals into the atmos­phere."Senior Lillian Schmitz, who designs cos­tumes for the theatre department and plans to be a costume designer after she grad­uates, explained the time-cost of making just one piece of clothing."It took me probably five or six hours to make this skirt," Schmitz said. "Making a little clutch or some­thing, that can take two hours, but I've done ball­gowns and those can take any­where from 40 to 60 hours. It depends on the design."Schmitz explained that while a factory is much more effi­cient at pro­ducing these things than one person, the clothes-making process is arduous. Most fac­tories break down the labor process, with each person sewing one side seam or a hem, she said. Because clothes have to be pro­duced extremely quickly to keep up with the trends, they are not made with much care."I think it has stemmed from our necessity to always have new things, our mate­ri­alism," Schmitz said. "Yves Saint Laurent has this quote about how trends change, but style is eternal. It's really easy to go online and if you want that dress for $10 in two days, you can have that. It's instant grat­i­fi­cation. I think it's important to invest in pieces you really love, and think about the quality of your clothing more than the quantity of it."Because the overseas fac­tories are run by a third party, whether the gov­ernment or another company, they are not ulti­mately respon­sible for ensuring good labor con­di­tions. If con­sumers don't want to support the man­u­fac­turing methods, that's their choice, Wolfram said."The con­sumers are the ones," Wolfram said. "If they didn't want to buy the clothing from the Chinese slave company, than the Chinese gov­ernment wouldn't be able to sell it."But Wolfram said the extent to which American con­sumers can change these hor­rible con­di­tions is limited."Slavery's a bad thing, and if we want to say as con­sumers we shouldn't be buying that product, we can say that," Wolfram said. "There's a dif­ference between being forced - that we shouldn't have - but how can we enforce anti-slavery in another country? That's a hard thing to do. We can boycott slave labor, but who knows what the gov­ernment would do if we did? They may just keep low­ering the price, and keep doing it."Senior Reagan Cool said she used to shop at Forever 21, but because of the cheap quality of clothing now shops at other stores, looking for quality over quantity."A lot of times it's just for the budget," Cool said. "You look at stores like Forever 21 and is the material as good? No. Am I going to wear it in six weeks? Probably not. But then you look at the store model, and that's what makes money: The fashion are fast and it's okay that they're cheap because they're going to go out of style so quickly. It's rewarding to see that that's not even prof­itable, because it's wrong in so many other ways."Cool explained that the problem with fast fashion is it cul­ti­vates an attitude of needing the trends right when they come out."The whole allure of fast fashion is, 'Wow, oh my gosh, that's so cute and look who has it, I need to look like that,'" Cool said. "'Oh my gosh, look, she's already dis­posed of that, and now I look at that thing that she has, I need that.' The attitude of inad­e­quacy that it per­pet­uates is extremely unhealthy men­tally."Cool said instead of shopping for "the sweater of the season," we should use this as an oppor­tunity to shop for pieces that last us much longer - quality over quantity."Obvi­ously, the ideal would be cheap and available and ethical, but you can't really have all three," Cool said. "H&M was starting down the track of Forever 21, but they realized that wasn't popular, so now they have H&M Con­scious, which is fairly well-made."Load-Date: October 17, 2019End of Document

Chairman Thompson Issues Statement at Hearing on Public-Private Initiatives to Secure Supply ChainTargeted News ServiceOctober 16, 2019 Wednesday 7:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 499 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe House Homeland Security Committee issued the following statement by Chairman Bennie G. Thompson, D-Mississippi, at a hearing entitled "Public-Private Initiatives to Secure the Supply Chain":"We are here today to discuss an issue critical to our national security: the information and communications technology (ICT) supply chain. Concerns about the origin components embedded in our ICT devices, such as cell phones, computers, and satellites, are nothing new. We have known that such technology produced by our adversaries could be exploited for espionage or cyberattacks for a long time. In 2012, the Senate Intelligence Committee released a damning report about the threats products from Chinese telecom companies ZTE and Huawei pose to U.S. national security interests."Government officials had acknowledged concerns about the use of Kaspersky anti-virus software for years before the Department of Homeland Security finally directed all Federal agencies to remove it from their systems in 2017. But the rapid evolution of the global economy coupled with our increasing reliance on technology and anticipation of a new 5G cell network has resulted in much-needed momentum to address risks to our ICT supply chain."Developing sound supply chain risk management policy is not just a whole-of-Government effort - it's an all hands on deck effort. That is why I am pleased that CISA is spearheading a critical public-private initiative to provide recommendations for assessing and managing ICT supply chain risks. Last month, the Task Force issued its Interim Report, and I congratulate the Task Force co-chairs on that accomplishment. The Interim Report identified practices and policies related to supply chain threat information sharing, whitelisting, and threat evaluation, along with associated challenges. I am eager to discuss those issues today. More importantly, I want to know how Congress can help advance the recommendations of the Task Force."I am also interested to learn about how the work of the Task Force is being leveraged by the Federal Acquisition Security Council and by the Department of Commerce as it executes its authorities under Executive Order 13873, which was seemingly targeted at China. On that note, I want to commend the Administration finally taking a concrete step to mitigate the threat Chinese firms pose to the supply chain. The Chinese government has spent years strategically investing in and promoting Chinese information and communications technology to advance its national agenda - at our expense. So I was disturbed last year when the President directed the Department of Commerce to lift the ban on ZTE buying U.S. parts, apparently to advance his trade agenda."Our national security is not a bargaining chip, and the President cannot negotiate away policies that will secure our supply chain. Toward that end, I will continue to monitor the implementation of the Executive Order closely."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6894043 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: October 17, 2019End of Document

Tim Cook defends Apple's removal of Hong Kong map appStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeOctober 12, 2019 SaturdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 687 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBodyPerhaps the strongest voice in opposition to Cook's reasoning comes from Hong Kong's IT Legislator, Charles Mok, who posted an open letter to Cook on Twitter on Thursday."It is no secret that technology can be used for good or for ill".Long-time Apple commentator John Gruber wrote of Mr Cook's email: "I can't recall an Apple memo or statement that crumbles so quickly under scrutiny".After censure from USA lawmakers and the press, Tim Cook defended the app's removal on Thursday in a memo sent toApple employees.Hundreds of mask-wearing pro-democracy protesters yesterday marched through Hong Kong's central business district at lunchtime, occupying a main thoroughfare and disrupting traffic as the territory braced for another weekend of turmoil.The move came one day after Chinese state media berated the company for aiding Hong Kong protesters by approving the "toxic" app."National and global debates will outlive us all, and, while important they do not govern the facts", said Cook in defense ofApple's decision.They tweeted: "We once believed the App rejection is simply a bureaucratic f up, but now it is clearlya political decision to suppress freedom and human right in #HongKong".Just last week,Apple reversed an earlier decision to reject HKmap.live from its App Store - only to be harshly rebuked by the People's Daily, China's flagship state newspaper.The app was only available for less than a week after going live on the App Store on Oct 5.Dog owners have reduced risk of dying from heart problems, says researcherOwning a dog may not only enable you to have companionship and live a happier life but could also help you live longer. Merely petting a dog - notably a neatly-diagnosed one - lowers a individual's blood stress."The app displays police locations and we have verified with [Hong Kong authorities] that the app has been used to target andambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement",Apple said in an emailed response to CNN Business."She seems to misunderstand how free speech operates, and also how freedom of the press operates", said Mr Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas and a vocal critic of China who was stopping in Hong Kong for two days as part of a regional tour. The app's developer did not immediately respond to requests for further comment.The app that causedApple such a headache was called HKmap.Live, which offered real-time updates of where Hong Kong police units were stationed.We built the App Store to be a safe and trusted place for every user.Most of the content on the app is user-generated, but allows users to downvote and enables moderators to crack down on content that "solicit, promote, or encourage criminal activity". Thursday's removal of the app drew immediate reprimands from Washington.Hong Kong's metro has borne the brunt of protests, with stations torched and trashed, and only returned to normal operations on Friday after being completely shut down.Apple has in the past removed thousands of apps from the App Store to meet local regulations and please the Chinese government.Quartz Chief Executive Zach Seward told technology publication The Verge in a statement: "We abhor this kind of government censorship of the internet, and have great coverage of how to get around such bans around the world". For some people in Hong Kong, the app was a handy tool that helped steer them away from possible baton charges, volleys of tear gas and police ID checks.The Trump regime recently blacklisted 28 tech companies in China for their participation in the system of concentration camps that hold an estimated 1 million Uyghur people.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has allegedly scrapped a meeting with U.S. senator Ted Cruz, the highest-profile American politician to visit the city since anti-government protests broke out more than four months ago. According to the app's developers, pro-democracy protestors, journalists, and even Hong Kong government supporters have been using HKmap.live to navigate the city as large-scale political protests continue.Load-Date: October 13, 2019End of Document

Patients 02002 and 02006 were treated with higher dose levels of RP-L102. Patients 02004 and 02005 received non-optimized and lower doses of RP-L102. Key highlights of the manuscript include:Follow-up data for the initial four patients 18-30 months post-infusion demonstrate progressively increased engraftment in peripheral blood leukocytes and in the bone marrow following administration of RP-L102 without the use of conditioning. In Patient 02002 at 30 months follow-up, approximately 44% of bone marrow CD34+ cells displayed gene marking, suggesting the engraftment of very primitive corrected hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Sequential increases in gene marking in peripheral blood and in the bone marrow for Patients 02004 and 02005 were also seen, but at more modest levels and after longer durations. The bone marrow resistance to MMC in Patient 02002 increased to 70% at 24 months, approaching the phenotype of a healthy donor. Patients 02004, 02005 and 02006 also displayed progressive increases in MMC resistance. DEB exposure resulted in a lower proportion of cells with aberrant chromosomes in Patients 02002, 02004 and 02006. Patient 02002 demonstrated stabilized neutrophil counts and hemoglobin levels as early as six months post-administration of RP-L102. Similar trends were also seen in Patient 02006. Progressive increases in the total number of corrected leukocytes were observed shortly after the initial administration of RP-L102 in all treated patients. Favorable safety profile with no serious adverse events associated with infusion of the investigational product in these initial four patients.07:08STOR STORE Capital increases quarterly dividend to $0.35/share from $0.33/share (37.08 )07:07STC Stewart Info confirms termination of Fidelity National (FNF) merger, names new CEO (33.77 )In light of the FTC's decision, the Stewart Board has clearly determined that leveraging the company's strong brand, financial position, and valued employees to grow the organization as a standalone entity will create the greatest shareholder value.

NfL is a protein that provides structural support to nerve fibres in the brain. An increase in the amount of NfL may be associated with nerve cell damage, and detection of increased NfL levels in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may serve as a biomarker of nerve cell damage.In the Phase III OPERA I study in RMS and the ORATORIO study in PPMS, blood NfL levels were significantly lower after treatment with OCREVUS. In RMS, blood serum NfL levels were reduced by 43 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with a 31 percent reduction with interferon beta-1a (p<0.001). In PPMS, blood plasma NfL levels were reduced by 16 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with 0.2 percent reduction with placebo (p<0.001). Additionally, these analyses showed higher blood NfL levels at the start of the study were correlated with more disability progression in upper and lower limbs in PPMS and overall disability in the interferon beta-1a RMS treatment group at 96 weeks.06:03FTS Fortis announces five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 bln for the period 2020 to 2024, increases quarterly dividend to $0.4775/share from $0.45/share (42.08 )The co announced its five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 billion for the period 2020 to 2024, up $1.0 billion from the prior year's plan.

OS rates at five years were 13.4% for Opdivo and 2.6% for docetaxel. The OS benefit for Opdivo-treated patients was observed across all subgroups.The safety profile for patients treated with Opdivo was consistent with previously reported findings in second-line NSCLC and no new safety signals were seen with extended follow-up. Of patients still on study, only 2 of 70 experienced a new treatment-related select AE between years three and four and there were no new treatment-related select AE's reported between years four and five among the 55 patients still on study.Among patients with an objective response to Opdivo, 32.2% continued to see a response at five years. 0% of patients with an objective response to docetaxel continued to see a response at five years. The median duration of response was 19.9 months for Opdivo-treated patients and 5.6 months for patients treated with docetaxel.06:00ALNY Alnylam Pharma presents new clinical results for Givosiran -- Porphyria attack reductions observed in ENVISION Phase 3 study maintained with ongoing Givosiran dosing in open-label extension study (82.69 )ENVISION Phase 3 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of January 31, 2019, all eligible patients (N=93) from the ENVISION Phase 3 study of givosiran rolled over into the OLE phase of the study. Reduction in the composite porphyria attack rate with givosiran treatment, which had been observed in the ENVISION Phase 3 study as early as one month after dosing, was shown to be sustained with continued dosing in the OLE phase of the study. Sustained reduction in levels of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), an intermediate in the heme biosynthesis pathway believed to be the primary neurotoxic intermediate responsible for causing both porphyria attacks and ongoing symptoms in between attacks, was also observed with continued dosing. Rapid and sustained lowering of attack rate and ALA levels was also observed in placebo patients who crossed over after the six-month double blind phase of the ENVISION Phase 3 study to receive givosiran in the OLE phase of the study. Givosiran's safety profile in the OLE phase has remained consistent with the profile observed in the double blind phase of the ENVISION study.ENVISION Results of Select Patient Reported Outcomes -- A number of patient reported outcomes were collected as secondary and exploratory measures in the ENVISION study. Daily worst pain did not achieve statistical significance based on the prespecified ANCOVA analysis (p equals 0.0530), however, the data were found to not be normally distributed. A post-hoc analysis of daily worst pain was therefore performed using the non-parametric stratified Wilcoxon test. Based on the non-parametric test, patients on givosiran had a significant reduction in daily worst pain (nominal p equals 0.0455). In exploratory analyses, the reductions in pain were accompanied by fewer days of use of both opioid and non-opioid analgesics. Givosiran did not impact daily worst fatigue or daily worst nausea at six months, although these assessments will be repeated at twelve months to explore the effects of longer term dosing. Updated Phase 1/2 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of April 19, 2019, a robust treatment effect was maintained in givosiran-treated patients with continued dosing in the Phase 1/2 OLE study (N=16), with a mean time on treatment of 22.8 months and total time on treatment across the Phase 1 and OLE studies of up to 35 months. Substantial mean reductions in annualized attack rate (AAR) and in annualized hemin use of greater than 90 percent were observed, with evidence for sustained or potentially enhanced clinical activity with continued dosing. Five out of twelve patients (42 percent) who received givosiran during the Phase 1 study and continued with givosiran dosing in the OLE study and two out of four patients (50 percent) who had been in the placebo arm of the Phase 1 study and crossed over to givosiran treatment in the OLE study achieved an AAR of zero for a mean of 18.1 and 24.9 months, respectively.06:00ACN Accenture acquires Pragsis Bidoop; terms not disclosed (194.83 )Pragsis Bidoop, headquartered in Madrid with additional offices in Barcelona and the U.K., will add more than 200 employees with deep machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data engineering experience, along with its portfolio of end-to-end solutions, to Accenture's Applied Intelligence business.06:00ASX ASE Technology reports August net revenues +10.3% yr/yr to $1.28 bln (4.51 )06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets ease back; S&P Futures take out yesterday's lowThe global equity markets are under slight pressure to start the day.

We have not replaced those lost revenues as new project starts have taken longer to occur than anticipated. We expect this trend to reverse over the coming quarters as GPS has received a full notice to proceed ("FNTP") on the largest project in its history. For the three months ended July 31, 2019, the majority of consolidated revenues were contributed by our separate businesses of The Roberts Company ("TRC"), which reported record quarterly revenues during the current quarter, and Atlantic Project Company ("APC"). Together, TRC and APC contributed 94% of consolidated revenues for the three months ended July 31, 2019.Backlog $1.37 bln.16:41FNV Franco-Nevada details additional succession plans; promotes Paul Brink to President/CEO; Pierre Lassonde to step down as Chair during 2020 (93.84 -2.69)Effective as of the May 6th, 2020 AGM, the board intends to appoint David Harquail as the non-executive Chair.

The S&P 500 (-0.01%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) finished near their flat lines.The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%), which is home to many energy and financial stocks, outperformed the broader market.The market entered today on the heels of a two-week rally, with some investors beginning to feel less concerned about growth prospects and trade relations with China. For instance, data has shown the U.S. consumer to be resilient in the face of trade tensions, which could see a reprieve with trade talks coming up next month.This positive sentiment was manifested in the higher oil prices ($57.87/bbl, +$1.42, +2.5%) and the selling in the Treasury market on Monday. In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD16:20IMXI International Money Express announces secondary public offering of 5,217,392 shares of common stock by selling stockholders (13.60 -0.55)Shares will be offered by affiliates of Stella Point Capital and certain of the company's other stockholders.

American Realty Capital Properties, Inc., and Lakewood Capital Partners, LP v. American Realty Capital Properties, Inc., at a cost to the company of approximately $765.5 mln, comprised of a contribution of $738.5 mln toward the Class Action settlement and $27.0 mln toward the Opt Out Action settlements.On September 8, 2019, the company signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) providing for the settlement of the Class Action. The Class Action settlement will resolve the claims by class plaintiffs relating to the disclosures made by the company in October 2014 and March 2015 regarding its financial statements, which included the company's March 2015 restatement of certain of its previously issued financial statements.Pursuant to the terms of the Class Action MOU, certain defendants have agreed to pay in the aggregate $1.025 bln, comprised of contributions from the company's former external manager and its principals totaling $225.0 mln, $12.5 mln from the company's former chief financial officer, $49.0 mln from the company's former auditor, and the balance of $738.5 mln from the company. At the same time, in conjunction with the Class Action settlement, the company entered into an MOU providing for the settlement of the derivative action lawsuit currently pending in the Southern District of New York captioned Witchko v. Schorsch. The Derivative Action settlement will resolve the allegations brought by the derivative plaintiffs and is also subject to completing definitive documentation to be filed with the court. The Derivative Action settlement is subject to court approval and is conditioned on approval of the Class Action settlement.On September 6 and September 9, 2019, the company also entered into settlement agreements and releases to settle the Opt Out Actions for a total of $27.0 mln, which are not subject to court approval. Three additional derivative actions remain pending in courts other than the SDNY.

Additionally, the company has decided to discontinue the development of MRT5201, a liver-targeted treatment for OTC deficiency.The company's decision to discontinue the development of MRT5201 for OTC deficiency is based on data from recently completed preclinical studies that do not support the desired pharmacokinetic and safety profile for advancement of the program. These data are related to the first-generation lipid nanoparticle (LNP) designed to be delivered to the liver via intravenous administration for the OTC deficiency program. As such, this LNP is different than that used in the CF and other pulmonary development programs which are designed to deliver the LNP-encapsulated mRNA through nebulization. Additionally, ongoing discovery efforts have generated promising, novel next-generation LNPs supporting the further development of liver disease mRNA therapeutics with potentially favorable product profiles.The company's prioritization of pulmonary diseases is supported by the previously reported positive single-ascending dose Phase 1/2 data from the CF program, which utilizes its proprietary lung delivery platform. MRT5005 is a first-in-class mRNA therapeutic designed to address the underlying cause of CF regardless of genetic mutation by delivering mRNA encoding fully functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein to cells in the lung through nebulization. The multiple-ascending dose portion of the clinical trial is ongoing with data expected in 2020.16:08CASY Casey's General beats by $0.28, beats on revs; reaffirms guidance (167.30 -2.03)Reports Q1 (Jul) earnings of $2.31 per share, $0.28 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.03; revenues rose 1.5% year/year to $2.63 bln vs the $2.59 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Jack Ma delivers Alibaba in a velvet successionCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 11, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 659 wordsBodyAlibaba, China's most valuable public technology company, marked its 20th anniversary on Tuesday with a rite of succession: its founder, Jack Ma, retired as chief executive and will hand over the helm to CEO Daniel Zhang.It is the first transition at the highest level of a large Chinese technology company—its peers Tencent and Baidu are still managed by its founders, Pony Ma and Robin Li—and in many ways is the most difficult to make.Ma, 55, the richest man in China, is a charismatic leader who built Alibaba from a shared apartment into a $462 billion company. His successor is a low-profile former accountant.But Alibaba's investors don't flare up. The company's share price rose 9.4 percent in the year since it announced it would retire and Alibaba is intertwined in the fabric of the daily lives of hundreds of millions of Chinese as a means of buying and selling products, making payments and as a source of entret entation.The company functions as a machine, its supporters say, mixes Ma's idealism and optimistic thinking with his successor's pragmatic and results-based approach. In addition, as a lifelong member of the association that controls Alibaba, Ma will stay close."Jack left a very deep mark on every corner of Alibaba," said Alan Hellawell, a partner at The Jakarta-based Alpha JWC Ventures, who as an analyst has been following up with the company from its earliest days.The succession was carefully planned and Alibaba often talks about his great source of talent.But Ma also leaves his successor with some ambitious goals: by 2036, Alibaba's "economy" will create 100 million jobs, support 10 million profitable businesses, and serve 2 billion customers worldwide, compared to the current figure of 654 Million.In the short term, it aims at $1 trillion in gross merchandise value, the value of goods sold on its platforms, this year, compared to $853,000 mdd last year.Ma's long-term commitments are increasingly heroic in today's climate. The US-China trade war is souring globalization, and already had another Alibaba commitment to create a million jobs in the US by giving small firms a route to sell their products in China.Alibaba's own globalization efforts closer to home, in Southeast Asia and India, still do not bear fruit; the Lazada e-commerce platform has already been through several versions since Alibaba acquired it. Foreign markets are key to Alibaba meeting its 2 billion customer target."I think all these promises are going to fade," said Duncan Clark, author of Alibaba, the house that Jack built (Alibaba, the house Jack built). Ma's own approach, he points out, increasingly turned to Africa, where he launched a series of philanthropic initiatives.Philanthropy is where the founder of the technology sector plans his next act: in areas such as education and rural poverty, sectors that may not fit the Chinese government's goals.But then, as Clark points out, Ma's talent has always been an astonishing ability to read the runes several steps ahead. It did so with e-commerce, now a $2 trillion market in China, and in mobile payments, in a country where even beggars accept handouts through Alipay.Then, with his retirement, just at maturity by Chinese standards, 55 years old. "Others have been caught up in not realizing that the guard had changed, " stressedClark. "Your antennas are well tuned."Ma's scope remains broad. Last month, in a debate with Tesla's founder Elon Musk, he showed a more optimistic and solid streak than his counterpart. "We need heroes like you (who want to go to Mars), but we need heroes like us (who are the ones who are going to fix the Earth)," he said.But in a farewell video posted on the company's website, he returned to a more uplifting way. Many companies, he said, grow and then fail. "Many companies, I learned why they fail. Because they want the next quarter. They want the income, they want the profits. They forget dreams. It's important that Alibaba dream."Load-Date: September 12, 2019End of Document

The market for chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is anticipated to register a CAGR of 9.74%, during the forecast period (2019PR NewswireOctober 8, 2019 Tuesday 1:05 PM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1072 wordsDateline: NEW YORK, Oct. 8, 2019 BodyPR NewswireMarket OverviewThe market for chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is anticipated to register a CAGR of 9.74%, during the forecast period (2019-2024). Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a deposition method, which is used to produce high quality and high-performance solid materials, typically under vacuum. The process is often used in the semiconductor industry for producing thin films and goes into various segments, such as smartphones, PC's, tablets, and other medical electronics.Read the full report:https://www.reportlinker.com/p05821490/?utm_source=PRN- Metals, such as aluminum, copper, etc., which go into the manufacturing of microelectronics, are often deposited by CVD methods. Copper CVD is generally used as a substitute in integrated circuits. The Indian semiconductor industry offers high potential growth areas, as industries sourcing semiconductor in the country are witnessing high demand. India is considered to have a rapidly growing electronics system design manufacturing (ESDM) industry, thereby driving the market.- High capital investment for CVD technology is likely to hinder the market growth.- Development of the initiated chemical vapor deposition technology is projected to act as an opportunity for the market, in the future.Key Market TrendsIncreasing Demand from the Electronics Industry- CVD is a major process in the production of thin films of all three categories of electronic materials: semiconductors, conductors, and insulators.- CVD plays an important role in the designing and processing of advanced electronic conductors and insulators, as well as related structures, such as diffusion barriers and high thermal conductivity substrates (heat-sinks). Various materials, such as titanium nitride, silicon nitride, silicon oxide, diamond, and aluminum nitride are used in conductors and insulators that are produced by CVD.- Aluminum has long been the metal of choice for electrical conductors in semiconductor devices. It is readily evaporated and can be processed by CVD at a low temperature.- Copper is intrinsically a better metal than aluminum for the metallization of ICs. The development of CVD copper for semiconductor metallization is on a considerable scale in recent time.- Researchers in Japan have determined that copper interconnects deposited by metallo-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), then followed by chemical mechanical polishing, provides sub-quarter-micron interconnects and can be achieved on a production basis.- CVD copper is competing directly with sputtering, which, at this stage, is still the preferred production process. The most likely CVD applications of superconductors to reach the practical stage are coatings for semiconductor and other electronic-related applications. The semiconductor industry is shifting massively from aluminum to copper for chip metallization.- Additionally, thin films of electrical insulators are essential elements in the design and fabrication of electronic components. The most widely used insulator materials (dielectrics) are silicon oxide (SiO2) and silicon nitride (Si3N4). These materials are extensively produced by CVD.- Therefore, the demand for CVD in for electronic applications is expected to grow in the coming years.Asia- Pacific Region to Dominate the Market- In Asia-Pacific, China is the largest economy in terms of GDP. The annual growth rate of Chinese GDP was 6.7% in 2017 and 6.6%, in 2018. This growth is expected to be stable despite the trade disturbance in early 2019. The economic growth in the country remains high due to the increasing interest of investors to invest in China.- The country's reliance on coal to meet its energy needs has started to wear off and now the government has started to close mines and restrict the construction of new coal power plants in the recent years, particularly in heavily populated areas. Nevertheless, the coal sector still accounts for 59% of the total electricity consumption of the country.- The solar energy sector of the country is mainly driven by the huge-scale production and learning curve effects. The government is focused on mitigating urban air pollution and enhancing energy security and resilience by positioning the nation as the world's leading supplier of clean energy technologies of the future.- The top three global solar PV manufacturing companies-JinkoSolar, JA Solar, and Trina Solar-are all headquartered in China. On May 31, 2018, the Chinese government announced subsidy reductions for photovoltaic power generation, widely known as the "531 Policy".- India's solar capacity reached 26,154 MW as on 31 March 2019. The capacity addition fell to 4,810MW in the year 2019, down a steep by 47% over the previous year, as the sector is currently struggling with financing and execution challenges, including land and transmission bottlenecks and increase in financial costs.- The electronics industry in India is mainly driven by macro-economic factors, such as growing middle-class families and rising disposable incomes. In addition to this, high preference of high-end technological devices and the declining electronics prices are also fueling the demand.- Thus, all such factors are expected to increase the demand for CVD from these above-mentioned sectors in the region during the forecast period.Competitive LandscapeThe chemical vapor deposition (CVD) market is partially consolidated.

Treasuries started the cash session on a lower note after another quiet overnight affair. Markets in China and Hong Kong were closed for holidays while the overnight news flow was limited. There was some renewed focus on the next round of U.S.-China trade talks, which are expected to take place on Thursday and Friday in Washington. Bloomberg reported over the weekend that Chinese officials have narrowed the range of subjects that will be discussed during these meetings. However, it remains to be seen how much leeway U.S. negotiators will allow on key issues like intellectual property protections and state subsidies. Midday action saw Treasuries slip to fresh lows, but longer tenors stopped their retreat above Friday's lows while the 2-yr note finished near its low from Thursday. Tomorrow's session will feature a $38 bln 3-yr Treasury note auction. The sale will be followed by a 10-yr note reopening on Wednesday and a 30-yr bond reopening on Thursday. The U.S. Dollar Index climbed 0.2% to 98.97.• Yield Check: 2-yr: +7 bps to 1.46% 3-yr: +7 bps to 1.42% 5-yr: +6 bps to 1.39% 10-yr: +4 bps to 1.55% 30-yr: +3 bps to 2.05%• News: Fed Chairman, Jay Powell, delivered opening remarks at the premiere of a documentary about Marriner Eccles in Salt Lake City, Utah. Mr. Powell did not comment on monetary policy, though he highlighted the importance of an independent central bank. President Trump tweeted this morning that he will "totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey" if Turkey does anything in Syria that President Trump considers to be "off limits." The tweet was published after a Sunday announcement from the White House, which indicated that U.S. forces would not stop Turkey from conducting a military operation in Northern Syria. Kansas City Fed President, Esther George, spoke over the weekend, reiterating her opposition to the rate cut in September, according to Bloomberg. Ms. George said that she would support a rate reduction if she sees evidence of a sharper slowdown in growth. The European Commission is reportedly calling for "pre-emptive" fiscal stimulus in the eurozone. British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, will challenge the Benn Bill, which blocks a no-deal Brexit, in the Supreme Court. Protests across Hong Kong continued during the weekend and there were multiple reports of bank ATMs running out of cash. Australia's Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, is reportedly facing pressure from lawmakers to increase fiscal spending. China's September FX Reserves decreased to $3.092 trln from $3.107 trln. Japan's August Leading Index decreased to 91.7 from 93.7 while Coincident Indicator decreased 0.4% m/m (last 0.2%). September FX Reserves dipped to $1.32 trln from $1.33 trln. Australia's September AIG Construction Index decreased to 42.6 from 44.6. Eurozone's October Sentix Investor Confidence decreased to -16.8 (expected -13.0) from -11.1, hitting its lowest level in more than six years. Germany's August Factory Orders decreased 0.6% m/m (expected -0.3%; last -2.1%).• Today's Data: Consumer credit increased by $17.9 bln in August (Briefing.com consensus $13.3 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $23.0 bln (from $23.3 bln) in July. Nonrevolving credit increased by $19.9 bln in August to $3.062 trln. Revolving credit decreased by $2.0 bln in August to $1.079 trln. Consumer credit increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.25%, with revolving credit decreasing at an annual rate of 2.25% and nonrevolving credit increasing at an annual rate of 7.75%. The key takeaway from the report is that nonrevolving credit accounted for the entire expansion in consumer credit in August. Nonrevolving credit decreased on the heels of an increase in July that had marked the fastest pace of expansion since November 2017.• Commodities: WTI crude: UNCH at $52.79/bbl Gold: -0.6% to $1504.30/ozt Copper: +0.6% to $2.578/lb• Currencies: EUR/USD: UNCH at 1.0973 GBP/USD: -0.3% to 1.2295 USD/CNH: +0.3% to 7.1321 USD/JPY: +0.4% to 107.29• The Day Ahead: 6:00 ET: September NFIB Small Business Optimism Index (prior 103.1) 8:30 ET: September PPI (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%; prior 0.1%) and core PPI (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%; prior 0.3%)• Treasury Auctions: 13:00 ET: $38 bln 3-yr Treasury note auction results• Fed Speakers: 13:35 ET: Chicago Fed President (FOMC voter) Charles Evans 13:50 ET: Chairman (FOMC voter) Jay PowellEUR/USD 1.0986USD/JPY 106.8710-Year - 1.524 - +9/32Treasuries Climb as Trade Concerns Resurface• U.S. Treasuries are on track to reclaim a portion of yesterday's losses after Treasury futures rallied in overnight trade. The early part of the overnight session saw some selling, but futures notched their lows around midnight, and rallied from there. China's Commerce Ministry indicated that China is prepared to sign a partial trade deal and leave "the harder issues" to be negotiated next year, but that offer may no longer be valid after the U.S. added 28 Chinese companies, including Hikvision, to a trade blacklist over China's treatment of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. Futures hit pre-market highs during the past hour after Bloomberg reported that the White House is focusing on limiting exposure to Chinese stocks in government pension funds. Keep in mind that a similar report circulated on September 27. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% at 98.91.• Yield Check: 2-yr: -3 bps to 1.43% 3-yr: -5 bps to 1.37% 5-yr: -4 bps to 1.35% 10-yr: -3 bps to 1.52% 30-yr: -3 bps to 2.02%• News: China's September Caixin Services PMI decreased to 51.3 (expected 52.1) from 52.1.

South Korea's August Current Account surplus narrowed to $5.27 bln from $6.95 bln. Australia's September NAB Business Confidence dipped to 0 from 1. German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, said that a Brexit deal is "overwhelmingly unlikely" if Northern Ireland doesn't stay in the customs union. UBS reportedly expects the Swiss National Bank to cut its policy rate deeper into negative territory in early 2020. The Federation of German Wholesale, Foreign Trade, and Services lowered its 2019 export forecast to just 0.5% from 1.5%. The Federation does not expect an improvement until the second half of 2020. Germany's August Industrial Production increased 0.3% m/m (expected -0.2%; last -0.4%). France's August trade deficit totaled EUR5.00 bln (expected deficit of EUR4.20 bln; last deficit of EUR4.50 bln) while August Current Account deficit totaled EUR2.50 bln (expected deficit of EUR400 mln; last deficit of EUR200 mln). Italy's August Retail Sales decreased 0.6% m/m (expected -0.1%; last -0.6%) but rose 0.7% yr/yr (expected 3.1%; last 2.4%). Spain's August Industrial Production increased 1.7% yr/yr (expected 0.1%; last 1.2%).

The index for final demand declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%), as did the index for final demand less food and energy (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%).• The key takeaway from the report is that the price declines were broad based, and not just energy-related, which is indicative of an environment characterized by weaker demand. On a year-over-year basis, the index for final demand was up 1.4%, versus up 1.8% in August, and the index for final demand less food and energy was up 2.0%, versus up 2.3% in August. The index for final demand services decreased 0.2%, with nearly half of that decline owed to the index for machinery and vehicle wholesaling, which fell 2.7%. The index for final demand goods was down 0.4% due primarily to a 2.5% decline in prices for final demand energy. The index for processed goods for intermediate demand decreased 0.4%. The index for unprocessed goods for intermediate demand declined 1.4%.• Yield check:2-yr: -3 bps to 1.43%3-yr: -5 bps to 1.37%5-yr: -4 bps to 1.35%10-yr: -3 bps to 1.52%30-yr: -3 bps to 2.02%EUR/USD 1.0968USD/JPY 106.9110-Year - 1.517 - +11/32Hovering Near Highs• U.S. Treasuries hover near their best levels of the session with longer tenors returning to their closing levels from Friday. Treasuries started the day with solid gains after the market was reminded that the conflict with China cuts deeper than just "trade issues." Treasuries followed their higher start with some light backtracking, but that pullback was short-circuited by a much cooler than expected PPI report for September. The following 90 minutes saw Treasuries edge to fresh highs while equities have faced selling pressure since the open, sending the S&P 500 lower by 1.3%.• Yield Check: 2-yr: -4 bps to 1.42% 3-yr: -5 bps to 1.37% 5-yr: -4 bps to 1.35% 10-yr: -4 bps to 1.52% 30-yr: -3 bps to 2.01%EUR/USD 1.0950USD/JPY 107.0810-Year - 1.519 - +9/32Treasury Auction Preview • $38 bln 3-year Treasury note auction (results at 13:00 ET) Prior auction results: High yield: 1.573% Bid-to-cover: 2.42 Indirect bid: 46.2% Direct bid: 16.6% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.303% Bid-to-cover: 2.50 Indirect bid: 46.9% Direct bid: 14.7%EUR/USD 1.0954USD/JPY 107.1310-Year - 1.531 - +6/32Auction on Deck• U.S. Treasuries have backed off their mid-morning highs in recent trade. The 10-yr note and the 30-yr bond have returned to their opening levels while shorter tenors trade at fresh intraday lows. The pullback from highs took place as stocks rebounded from their lows, suggesting some improvement in risk tolerance. However, the S&P 500 is still down more than 1.0% amid losses in all eleven sectors. Elsewhere, the greenback has shown some strength, helping the U.S. Dollar Index climb 0.2% to 99.18. The Index has already reclaimed its loss from last week as it works on its second consecutive advance. The results of today's $38 bln 3-yr note auction will be released at the top of the hour.• Yield Check: 2-yr: -2 bps to 1.44% 3-yr: -3 bps to 1.39% 5-yr: -2 bps to 1.37% 10-yr: -2 bps to 1.53% 30-yr: -2 bps to 2.02%EUR/USD 1.0954USD/JPY 107.1510-Year - 1.537 - +3/32Treasury Auction Results • $38 bln 3-year Treasury note auction: Auction results: High yield: 1.413% (When-Issued: 1.409%) Bid-to-cover: 2.43 Indirect bid: 45.8% Direct bid: 16.9% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.303% Bid-to-cover: 2.50 Indirect bid: 46.9% Direct bid: 14.7%EUR/USD 1.0955USD/JPY 107.1210-Year - 1.537 - +6/32Treasuries Endure Volatile Session as China Remains in Focus• U.S. Treasuries ended Tuesday on a higher note after a volatile finish to the session. Treasuries started the cash session on a firmly higher note after yesterday's announcement from the White House about the blacklisting of 28 Chinese companies was viewed as a negative sign ahead of trade talks scheduled for the end of this week in Washington. On a related note, South China Morning Post reported that the Chinese delegation might return home a day earlier than originally planned. The renewed sense of caution provided an opening boost, but the market only saw limited follow-through buying. Treasuries edged to highs in mid-morning trade, but backed off those levels going into the afternoon, aided in part by a rebound in equities. The pullback deepened shortly after the completion of today's $38 bln 3-yr Treasury note auction, which was met with tepid demand. The offering drew a high yield of 1.413%, which tailed the when-issued yield by 0.4 bps while the bid-to-cover ratio (2.43x) and indirect takedown (45.8%) were below average. The market endured a volatile finish to the day. A dip to fresh lows took place after Fed Chairman, Jay Powell, indicated once again that the Federal Reserve plans to increase the size of its balance sheet, but Treasuries lurched off their lows in response to a Bloomberg report that the U.S. imposed visa bans on Chinese officials linked to detention centers in Xinjiang. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.2% to 99.18.• Yield Check: 2-yr: -4 bps to 1.42% 3-yr: -5 bps to 1.37% 5-yr: -3 bps to 1.36% 10-yr: -2 bps to 1.54% 30-yr: UNCH at 2.04%• News: The New York Fed accepted total bids of $37.50 bln in today's repurchase operation, below the $75 bln maximum. The New York Fed also conducted a 14-day term repurchase operation, accepting total bids of $38.85 bln, below the $45 bln limit. Newly minted IMF Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, said that a "synchronized policy response" may be needed if global economic growth continued decelerating. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said he expects 2.0% GDP growth in 2020. The FOMC voter added that downside risks to the economy are stronger than upside risks, observing that business investment has been on the weak side. Bloomberg reported that the White House is focusing on limiting exposure to Chinese stocks in government pension funds. A similar report made the rounds on September 27. German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, said that a Brexit deal is "overwhelmingly unlikely" if Northern Ireland doesn't stay in the customs union.

Optimism in the commercial front animates Wall Street. And Apple back to being a trillion-dollar babyCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 12, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 467 wordsBody       The U.S. scholarships ended in high, driven by the prospect of a trade agreement between the US and China and also by the new round of economic stimuli announced by the European Central Bank.                                                The Dow Jones ended up adding 0.17% to 27,182.45 points and the Standard &Poor;'s 500 advanced 0.29% to 3,009.57 points. For its part, the Nasdaq Composite technology valued 0.30% to 8,194.47 points. In particular, the prospect of a trade agreement between Washington and Beijing at the beginning of October came back to the negotiating table to try to reach an understanding. The U.S. president announced on Wednesday evening (early Thursday morning in Lisbon) that additional customs tariffs on products imported from China intended to enter into force on 1 October will only begin to be imposed 15 days later. Donald Trump says he has taken the decision as a gesture of goodwill, and at the request of Liu He, Deputy Prime Minister Chinese, since on October 1 the country will be celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China (with the Revolution of 1949). China liked Trump's gesture and the answer was not expected, with the media advancing that Beijing has already given the order for Chinese companies to return to buy soy and pork from the United States. On the eve the Chinese government had already published a list where it exempted several U.S. products tariffs. However today it was advanced that those responsible on the American side are considering offering a trade agreement limited to China, which further encouraged the sentiment of investors. The technology sector has once again had one of the best performances on the other side of the Atlantic (the Alphabet and Microsoft rose more than 1%), since the quoted from this industry depend on China for much of its revenues. Featured was the Apple company, led by Tim Cook, who played in highs of almost a year and returned to be a trillion-dollar baby (the first time it happened was in August of last year). Apple, which on Tuesday presented new products that pleased the technology community, has been gaining ground in the last sessions and today played in October Maxima of 2018 – becoming the second most valuable asset in the U.S. market, with a Capitalisation of 1.02 billion dollars), just behind Microsoft (valued at 1.05 billion dollars). The technology headquartered in Cupertino (California) eventually reversed near the end of the session and gave 0.23% to 223.08 dollars (with a market value of 1.008 billion dollars), but in "after hours" it follows already again in green. Contributing to the good time today on Wall Street was also the announcement of a new round of economic stimulus by the ECB – with a new asset purchase programme.Load-Date: September 13, 2019End of Document

Detroit police approve use of facial recognition technologyMichigan Daily: University of Michigan-Ann ArborOctober 6, 2019 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1238 wordsByline: Sonia LeeBodyThe Detroit Board of Police Commissioners approved a policy Sept. 19 outlining the use of facial recognition technology for the police department. The policy includes guidelines for how officers who abuse the policy will be punished and a prohibition from sharing the photos with private companies. The software has been used by Detroit police since July 2017, when the Detroit City Council approved the software purchase. In June 2019, Detroit Police Chief James Craig asked the City Council to approve its permanent use. Controversy surrounds the technology because of issues with the systems misidentifying people with darker skin. In a test done by the ACLU, Amazon's facial recognition tool Rekognition falsely matched 28 members of Congress, disproportionately identifying them as people who had committed crimes. The false matches were disproportionately people of color, misidentifying six members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Craig told The Detroit News after the approval the decision has been discussed for long enough and its purpose is to help the police department protect the community. "This is about the victims," Craig said. "We took the community's concerns to heart. I know some have felt we were not transparent during this process, but when we purchased this $1 million software, we had a conversation with City Council ... so there was nothing secret about it."LSA senior Hannah Agnew, president of the Student Executive Committee of the Prison Creative Arts Project, said the continued use of facial recognition technology will only increase the divide between civilians and police."With a study the ACLU did, there were many issues with misidentifying Black folks and women," Agnew said. "And with the way we already over-police people of color, adding more surveillance is not going to help ... People fear it and it creates distrust in the police system. We could be investing that money in services that let people prosper and that raises them up instead." U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-District 13 told The Detroit News she believed the software should be analyzed by only African Americans to avoid further misidentification of people of color.  "Analysts need to be African Americans, not people that are not," Tlaib said in a Detroit News video. "It happens all the time, it's true - I think non-African Americans think African Americans all look the same. I've seen it even on the House floor, people calling Elijah Cummings 'John Lewis,' and John Lewis 'Elijah Cummings,' and they're totally different people." Craig told the Detroit News he believes Tlaib's comments were insulting, adding all department officers and civilian employees receive bias training and should not be barred from jobs involving the software. "That's something we train for, and it's valuable training, but to say people should be barred from working somewhere because of their skin color?" Craig said. "That's racist."Law student Michael Goodyear, who is editor-in-chief of the Michigan Technology Law Review, said though the controversy surrounding the technology is valid, focus should be put on the software itself as opposed to those analyzing its results. "I think she (Tlaib) has a valid point, for sure, that visualization technology can be helpful, but it does have shortcomings that are particularly related to recognizing people of color," Goodyear said. "That said, it is from a more technical standpoint, so it should mean reworking the algorithm, making sure the algorithm correctly identifies individuals, which obviously can have some biases from the coders themselves. But I think it is a maybe another separate move from what Representative Tlaib had said in those comments. So it's not necessarily the person who's using the algorithm, but the algorithm itself." Facial recognition technology is used in everyday life through Facebook photo tagging, airport security and even in online dating applications. Goodyear pointed out it is also being used by other governments for more surveillance purposes but emphasized a need for regulation similar to Detroit's in these situations. "The Chinese government has been using facial recognition technology to track the movements of certain Uighur groups in western China ... that's kind of the far, not great side of this technology," Goodyear said. "The Chinese and Hong Kong governments have been using it in Hong Kong to actually track jaywalking in Hong Kong, which is maybe a little bit 'big brother'. So it is important to - kind of like in what this ordinance is doing now - to draw boundaries of what's acceptable behavior and what's not acceptable."If facial recognition technology were to be implemented in Ann Arbor, Agnew said it would have similarly detrimental effects on the community."Anywhere you implement this it won't have a good outcome because of over-policing and over-surveilling," Agnew said. "Ann Arbor likes to think of itself as a very liberal city, and this would be a way to police the already small numbers of people of color we have here."If the software were to be implemented in Ann Arbor, Goodyear said he hoped it would be with clear regulations and limitations in part produced through community engagement. He pointed out Ann Arbor's smaller size and said the roles of the Ann Arbor Police Department and the University police would change how such technology could be implemented compared to in Detroit. "I think they'd definitely implement it in a different way," Goodyear said. "But hopefully they'd do it in a similar way to Detroit, where they have public forums that allow things to be discussed publicly and actually create regulations to limit any sort of things might be going on like in China, or Hong Kong for example."Deputy Chief of Police Melissa Overton of the University's Division of Public Safety & Security said the department has not discussed using facial recognition technology yet."We are always reviewing the latest technology that would assist law enforcement in solving crime, however, we have not discussed facial recognition at this time," she wrote in an email to the Daily.The Ann Arbor Police Department did not respond to requests for comment in time for publication.With regards to the primary controversy surrounding the software, Goodyear believes the technology still needs improvement. However, he emphasized the facial recognition technology would not be able to solely be used to indict or imprison a suspect. "They should be going through and making sure that it's absolutely accurate," Goodyear said. "But ... no one's going to be arrested and thrown in jail, indicted, based purely on their picture. Facial recognition technology so far is one factor. So under standard evidence, you need to have a variety of different things that kind of show that someone did something. In this case, it would be good evidence, but in and of itself, it's not enough."Agnew argued there would be no positive outcomes from the continued use of the technology for both victims and those incarcerated. "With the criminal justice system we tend to disproportionately target people of color," she said. "And that often doesn't happen in a way that helps victims. They're saying, 'We're going to use this system of surveillance to help victims.' But how is it going to help victims? It's not providing support or help to victims to deal with what happened, it's just another way to police people."Load-Date: October 8, 2019End of Document

(EFEUSA).- The country reduced its trade deficit with China by 1.33% in July to $29.6 billion, mainly because of tariff measures from Washington, but increased it with some of its historic trade partners, such as the European Union (EU) ) and Mexico.In total, the deficit in international trade in goods and services fell by 2.7% in July to $54 billion, Commerce reported Wednesday.The data is slightly higher than the forecasts of analysts, who had anticipated a $53.4 billion deficit.Imports of Chinese products fell 1.9% in July, while exports to China also fell by 2.7%.Trade between the two countries could be further reduced in the coming months after both the U.S. and China implemented new reciprocal tariffs on September 1.President Donald Trump's government imposed a 15% levy on imports of clothing, tools, electronics and other products from the Asian giant, while Beijing retaliated with new tariffs on soybeans, oil and products American pharmaceuticals.In principle, a delegation from the Chinese Government will travel to Washington this month to try to bring positions closer to a possible trade treaty between the two powers, although the latest round of levies has shown that the pact is still far from being achieved.Meanwhile, the negative trade balance with Mexico amounted to $8.9 billion, and the deficit with the European Union, another of America's historical partners, rose in July to 15.9 billion, the highest record.The trade relationship with Mexico is theoretically living at a good time since Washington agreed with Mexico and Canada on the T-MEC trade treaty, although it still has to be approved in Congress and in Canada.The T-MEC was signed last December to replace the current North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), in force since 1994, but so far only Mexico has ratified the new pact.On the other hand, the trade relationship with the EU is at a time of uncertainty, after Trump recently threatened to impose tariffs on French wine.The representative has threatened to tax imports of French broths in response to the "GAFA rate" (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon), the tax that France has created on the tech giants that do not tax in the country where they do business.The EU responded by claiming to be ready to respond to these warnings from Washington and not shying away from confrontation if Trump seeks to use the levies as a political weapon.Exports worldwide grew by 0.6% in July to $207.4 billion, while imports fell by 0.1% to $261.4 billion.According to the report, the country exported more pharmaceutical drugs, new cars, oil, drilling rigs and soybeans.On the other hand, it bought more petroleum products, mobile phones and furniture.However, imports of capital goods, such as computers, semiconductors, telecommunications equipment and other industrial machines, fell to the lowest level since October 2017.In the cumulative year, the deficit rose by 8.2% compared to the first seven months last year.Load-Date: September 6, 2019End of Document

Many analysts believe growth will slow further in coming quarters as global weakness and rising trade tensions exert a toll.___GM reverses course, says strikers will keep health coverageDETROIT (AP) - General Motors now says striking workers will get company-paid health insurance, nine days after saying coverage would be cut off. The company says in an email to the United Auto Workers union that it will keep benefits in place due to significant confusion among members. Workers howled and politicians criticized GM after the company said it would end benefits the day after the strike began Sept. 16.___McDonald's takes a nibble of the plant-based burgerCHICAGO (AP) - McDonald's is finally taking a nibble of the plant-based burger. In a very limited test in Canada, McDonald's said Thursday that it's introducing the PLT, or the plant, lettuce and tomato burger. It will be available for 12 weeks in 28 restaurants in Southwestern Ontario by the end of the month. The limited test is rolling out about six months after rival Burger King began testing the plant-based Impossible burger.___Walmart's Sam's Club launches health care pilot to membersNEW YORK (AP) - Walmart's Sam's Club is teaming up with several health care companies to offer discounts on everyday care its customers might delay or skip because of the cost.

Previously, users had to go into Alexa's settings and delete recordings manually. Users can now ask Amazon to automatically delete recordings after three months or 18 months. But users need to specify that in the settings, as recordings are kept indefinitely by default. Tech companies have been reviewing their practices in light of privacy concerns.___Spokesman: China buying US soybeans, porkBEIJING (AP) - China's government says importers have agreed to buy more American soybeans and pork.

Dunkin' Brands, Inc. says there's "absolutely no basis for these claims."___LinkedIn asks users to think beyond professional networksDALLAS (AP) - LinkedIn wants users to step outside their professional silos to boost someone else's career. The company wants to narrow a "network gap" that disadvantages people who don't have access to strong professional or alumni networks. The service says it's not reversing its guidance that LinkedIn users accept connections only from people they know and trust. Instead, it's nudging people to reach outside their traditional networks - such as someone they share a ride with or sit next to on a plane.___US stocks fall, bond prices rise as investors turn cautiousNEW YORK (AP) - Stocks ended modestly lower and bond prices rose on Wall Street Thursday as investors turned cautious, shifting money into lower-risk holdings. The selling came as traders weighed the implications of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump and government data showing slower U.S. economic growth.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 79.59 points, or 0.3%, to 26,891.12. The Nasdaq dropped 46.72 points, or 0.6%, to 8,030.66.

SEN. CRUZ FROM HONG KONG: 'I'M HERE, I'M DRESSED IN ALL BLACK STANDING IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE PROTESTORS'States News ServiceOctober 13, 2019 SundayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 627 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: HONG KONG BodyThe following information was released by Texas Senator Ted Cruz:U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today appeared on CBS's 'Face the Nation' with Margaret Brennan from Hong Kong, where he discussed his weeklong 'Friends and Allies' tour through the Indo-Pacific to meet with government officials and business leaders about democracy, freedom, and human rights, as well as how to combat China's growing influence coercion throughout the region and the world. Watch the full interview here.When asked about his trip to Hong Kong, Sen. Cruz discussed his meetings with protest leaders:"I'll tell you what's happening here in Hong Kong is inspiring," Sen. Cruz said. "We've seen over two million people come to the streets standing up for freedom, standing up for democracy, and standing up against the oppression of the Chinese Communist regime. I think it is very much in the United States interests to support the people of Hong Kong. I'm here, I'm dressed in all black standing in solidarity with the protesters."On the NBA's bowing to Communist Chinese Party censorship after the Houston Rockets' General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted in support of the Hong Kong protests, Sen. Cruz discussed leading a bipartisan effort calling on the NBA to defend free speech this week:"Daryl Morey, the General Manager of the Rockets -- my hometown team, I'm a diehard Houston Rockets fan -- he tweeted a very benign tweet where he said 'Stand for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.' The Chinese Communist government, they just about lost it. They got so upset, they ended up boycotting the Rockets. They ended up pulling them off TV in China, they ended up pulling them off the internet, they ended up canceling all of their sponsorships. And sadly what ended up happening is the NBA as a league began this series of apologies, and it was really sad to see an American company and indeed a global sports league like the NBA being dragooned into censoring the free speech of American citizens in the interests of big bucks. It's not complicated why the NBA did that, television and the Chinese market is worth a whole lot of money, but thankfully a whole lot of us across the ideological spectrum -- indeed I helped lead a group, a bipartisan group of members of Congress, calling on the NBA to do better, to defend free speech...and I'm proud to say I think the NBA is doing a better job of defending those free speech rights."As the NBA kowtows to the Chinese Communist Party, Apple and Google pull Hong Kongers' protest apps, and Nike removes Rockets merchandise from Chinese stores, Sen. Cruz will host a series of hearings on corporate America enabling Chinese censorship later this month.Sen. Cruz also applauded the Trump administration's decision earlier this week to blacklist specific Chinese technology companies that have helped the People's Republic of China spy on and oppress innocent people. Sen. Cruz had introduced legislation directing such a move."I introduced legislation called the TIANANMEN Act, that would direct blacklisting the technology companies, the Chinese technology companies that China is using to engage in surveillance, to engage in repression, and imprisonment and torture and murder of up to a million Uighurs or religious minorities, and as you noted just this week the Trump administration announced they were implementing what is the core of my legislation, which is blacklisting those Chinese technology companies that are being used to suppress religious minorities. I think that is a really good step...it's a positive step by the administration."This week, Sen. Cruz traveled to Pearl Harbor, Tokyo, Taiwan, New Delhi, and Hong Kong. While in Taiwan, Sen. Cruz called into CNBC's 'Squawk Box.'Load-Date: October 14, 2019End of Document

In the wake of injustice in Hong Kong, Lebron James serves as a worthy scapegoatThe Main Campus: University of MaineOctober 21, 2019 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 683 wordsByline: Nate PooleBodyOver the past weeks, the political protests in Hong Kong have generated sympathy in the American public. But the American media seems content to lob its attacks at Lebron James rather than criticising China itself. It all began on Oct. 4, when the general manager for the Houston Rockets, Daryl Morey, posted a tweet, since deleted, which conveyed support for anti-communist Hong Kong protestors. In reaction, before the preseason match between the Golden State Warriors and the Los Angeles Lakers, James asserted of Morey that "I just think that when you're misinformed or you're not educated about something, and I'm just talking about the tweet itself, you never know the ramifications." The backlash to James's dissent was swift but the fact of the matter is that rage has been woefully misdirected.These tensions between Hong Kong and China are nothing new; the former British colony fell under the communist regime's umbrella in 1997, and since then, the country has been operating under a "one country, two systems" government where the people of Hong Kong are granted specific rights found nowhere else in China, such as free speech, uncensored internet access, and free assembly. China promised to maintain this system until 2047, but there has always been a contingent of Hong Kongers that have bristled under what they perceive to be a steady encroachment upon their rights by Beijing, especially under Carrie Lam, the chief executive of Hong Kong who is widely believed to have pro-Beijing sympathies.This tension hit a breaking point in February when a bill was introduced that would allow Hong Kongers to be extradited and tried for crimes in mainland China. Peaceful protests began on June 9, but since then, demands and altercations with police forces have escalated dramatically. According to a New York Times profile on the events surrounding the protests, "China has started to turn public opinion against the protesters," and the Daryl Morey's tweet served as a fine opportunity for the Chinese government to further propagate their characterization of the protesters as violent rebels. With this knowledge of China's messaging campaign, it's easy to frame Lebron James and his statements on the Morey tweet as "selling out," as ESPN sports debate show host Max Kellerman dubbed it on the show "First Take." The Lakers star has also received relentless criticism on Twitter, and was even parodied on the Comedy Central show "South Park." The fact of the matter is that James, for all his fame and athleticism, is really just the face for the NBA business. He is a player, and as he later clarified on Twitter, he did not appreciate being thrust into the role of political commentator in a country which generates 15%  of the NBA's total revenue, possibly compromising his future business opportunities in the process. While James suffers the brunt of the criticism for the NBA, the commissioner for the association, Adam Silver, gets away with putting out seemingly pro-Hong Kong statements like, "the values of the NBA - the American values, we are an American business - travel with us wherever we go. And one of those values is free expression." While James may admit to not feeling secure enough in his business interests to support Hong Kong's protesters, Adam Silver has the gall to pretend as though American values somehow weigh upon the decisions of a multibillion-dollar business. The situation seems like a dull echo of bipartisan efforts to pass bills condemning supporting Hong Kong protesters and condemning China's interference, which, according to Bloomberg, will "have limited impact."It's hard to believe the NBA's posturing when they rely on income from China, and the situation is just the same with our own government's reliance on trade with the nation. It is easy to criticize the idols that stand front and center, but far harder to recognize the hypocrisy of the machine behind that idol. The sad reality that Lebron James may be more resigned to before most of the public is that while actions speak louder than words, money speaks louder than actions. Load-Date: August 24, 2020End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 25 of 1102Equities End Lower on Report Chinese Officials Doubt Long-Term Trade Deal Possible  Page 28 of 1102Want to Stop Russia From Messing With Our Democracy?
