Industry Voices—Mun: Today's magic number appears to be 4FierceWirelessJune 12, 2019Copyright 2019 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 730 wordsByline: Kyung MunHighlight: In light of recent press around the U.S. Department of Justice's desire to push for four facilities-based mobile carriers, it appears that the easily explainable business theory needs to be revised to“Rule of Three and Four.”BodyAbout a year ago, I wrote a piece about the “Rule of Three and Four”,a business theory that hypothesizes that a competitive industry finds an equilibrium when the market shares of three competitors reach a ratio of 4:2:1.I wrote the article in the context of the T-Mobile and Sprint merger announcement over a year ago to put a theoretical framework around it, and to explain competitive industry dynamics that drove the seemingly inevitable fate for Sprint.A year later, I am humbled by a complex web of political and economic realities that make our forecasting difficult.I realize that the market isn't always rational, and one can apply business theories to a certain extent, especially for a heavily regulated industry like telecom.In light of recent press around the U.S. Department of Justice's desire to push for four facilities-based mobile carriers, it appears that the easily explainable business theory needs to be revised to the“Rule of Four.”Based on regulatory postures here and abroad, it looks like the industry modus operandi is having four facilities-based mobile operators.The “Rule of Four” can be found in other developed markets as well.The Japanese regulator has incentivized Rakuten, a mobile virtual network operator, to build its own network by granting 5G spectrum licenses to more effectively compete against the three incumbent operators: NTT, KDDI, and Softbank.While the fate of Rakuten's mobile business is too early to call, it has been innovative in bringing new network design approaches like fully virtualized RAN to the marketplace.The latest incarnation of the Rule of Four is exemplified in the Chinese regulator's issuance of 5G spectrum licenses to the three incumbent telecom carriers including China Mobile, China Unicom, and China Telecom, and a fourth new entrant, China Broadcast Network, a state-owned cable operator.The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) announcement is seen as a form of Chinese government's fiscal policy to expand the domestic market opportunity for Huawei, ZTE, and other domestic electronics suppliers amid the international trade tensions around the 5G supply chain.While it seems reasonable to expect the four-player market to be possibly sustainable in high-ARPU markets like those in the USA and Japan, I am not certain about low-ARPU markets where operators are pressured to keep up heavy capital expenditures that characterize the mobile industry.The telecom industry is capital-intensive, and the name of the game is scale.While it is reasonable to expect all players to be able to find meaningful success in the early days of 5G, each will have to conquer new business opportunities in both consumer and business segments for the long term.Long-term success will ultimately depend on how quickly and big they can get and how much profit expectation that they are willing to live with.The efficient utilization of 5G and            Edge Computing infrastructure resources will certainly impact the cost side of their businesses.While the magic number appears to be four today,we ultimately feel that three is the right number in an industry where continuous heavy capital investments are needed.However, the government regulators control this market through spectrum licenses and consumer protection, so we may be stuck with four for a while.That's good news for the telecom infrastructure suppliers.Let's keep on building!Kyung Mun is a senior analyst at Mobile Experts LLC, a network of market and technology experts that provides market analysis on the mobile infrastructure and mobile handset markets.

Russian girls in costume presented him with bread and salt - a traditional welcome for an honored guest.• Kim and Putin are expected to discuss North Korea's nuclear program after similar talks with US President Donald Trump broke down in March.• Kim told Russian officials, according to The Associated Press: "I have heard a lot about your country and have long dreamt of visiting it."• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un arrived in Russia in his personal train on Wednesday, ahead of his first-ever meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Kim's bulletproof, armored train pulled into eastern Russia on Wednesday. While it's not clear where in North Korea Kim departed from, the journey was likely hundreds of miles.Google Maps; Business InsiderKim typically travels in and out of the country by his family's train, which according to past footage is filled with plush pink leather seats, Apple computers, and fine French wine.The one time Kim traveled out of the country by plane - to meet US President Donald Trump in Singapore last June - he was ridiculed for his apparent reliance on China, since he borrowed it from the Chinese government.Read more: Inside Kim Jong Un's personal train - which is bulletproof, has all-white conference rooms, and its own red carpet rampTweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1120937381132161024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw Kim Jong-un's departure for Russia has just aired on North Korean TV pic.twitter.com/BPjTH3Y38TNorth Korean state media on Wednesday aired footage of Kim boarding at an undisclosed train station. South Korea's Yonhap news agency speculated that Kim left from a rural area, rather than the capital city of Pyongyang, according to The Associated Press.At the train station Kim walked down a red carpet to board his train. It pulled away as dozens of soldiers, government officials, and civilians saluted, clapped, and waved flowers to bid him goodbye. Kim's departures from and arrivals to North Korea are typically full of this kind of pomp.KCNA via ReutersIt's not clear what time Kim left North Korea on Wednesday. The dark sky in the video suggests that he started his journey early in the morning, as he has done in previous train journeys.KCNA via ReutersWhile Kim's route was largely kept secret - as they are for all his foreign travels - he likely traveled across the Druzhny Bridge ("Bridge of Friendship"), which links Russia and North Korea. The bridge is reportedly closed to tourists.Read more: Only one road in the world leads from Russia to North Korea - and you can take a trip down it on Google MapsIgor Onuchin/ReutersLater on Wednesday Russia's state-run Rossiya-24 TV channel also aired footage of Kim's arrival in Khasan, eastern Russia. Upon leaving his train Kim took off his black fedora hat and was welcomed by Russian girls in traditional clothing.Primorsky Regional Administration Press Service via APThe North Korean leader was also presented with a loaf of round bread with salt on a tray - a traditional Russian welcome for a respected guest.The recipient is supposed to eat the bread immediately, but Kim had the girls give the bread to the North Korea's consul general in the region instead, Rossiya-24 news channel reported.Primorsky Regional Administration Press Service via APTweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1120939758023319553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw Meanwhile Russian TV is leading with Kim's arrival, where he received a traditional welcome of bread and salt. 2/ pic.twitter.com/1gFHd75h1BKim also answered questions from Russia's state-owned Rossiya 24 news channel - a rare move from the reclusive leader who previously never spoke to media other than those run by the North Korean state.Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1120993242709884928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw If you've ever wondered what Kim Jong-un's everyday speaking voice is like, here you go. We only usually hear him giving a speech over a public address. pic.twitter.com/0zxKHpS2IGLater on Wednesday Kim met with Russian officials before setting off for the southeastern port city of Vladivostok, where he is due to meet Putin on Thursday.According to The Associated Press, Kim told Russian government officials on Wednesday: "I have heard a lot about your country and have long dreamt of visiting it.""It's been seven years since I took the helm, and I've only just managed to visit," he added.He also paid tribute to his late father and predecessor, Kim Jong Il, by mentioning his "great love for Russia" and displaying a photo of him on the table during a meeting.Press Service of Administration of Primorsky Krai/Alexander Safronov/Handout via Reuters; Business InsiderNotably absent from the train trip is Kim Jong Un's sister, Kim Yo Jong, who had accompanied Kim to both his summits with Trump and held a position in the country's top decision-making body.North Korea experts speculated that she was removed from her high-ranking position after she was left out of an important gathering earlier this month.Read more: Kim Jong Un's 'princess' sister may have been kicked out of North Korea's ruling body, suggesting a fall from favorREUTERS/Jorge Silva/PoolAt Vladivostok on Thursday, Kim and Putin are expected to focus on North Korea's nuclear program and denuclearization, according to the Kremlin, after Kim's nuclear talks with Trump broke down in March.Kim will likely also court broader Russian investment into North Korea's infrastructure, and persuade Putin to side with him in the easing of international sanctions, Business Insider Rosie Perper's reported.Putin, through this summit, is likely seeking to exert more influence in North Korean affairs, which could be seen as a move to rile the US.Read more: Here's a basic rundown of what Kim and Putin are expecting in their first summitAP Photo/Dmitri Lovetsky, Evan Vucci, FileKim will likely stay in Vladivostok until Friday, Yonhap reported.

Pompeo revels in US-UK 'special relationship' despite cracksAssociated Press InternationalMay 8, 2019 Wednesday 4:06 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 874 wordsByline: By MATTHEW LEE, AP Diplomatic WriterDateline: LONDON BodyLONDON (AP) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged Britain and America on Wednesday not to waver in their friendship as the two nations confront a series of global and trans-Atlantic challenges that have exposed some cracks in their historically close ties."It is now exactly the opposite of the time for either of us to go wobbly," Pompeo said in a speech extolling the virtues of the "special relationship" between the United States and the U.K. "Let's stand together to address the challenges of our time."Pompeo had earlier dismissed as unfounded the idea that British-U.S. ties were on the decline."The special relationship doesn't simply endure, it's thriving, despite what you might read in the papers," he told reporters at a news conference after talks with British Prime Minister Theresa May and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt.He noted the two nations' strong defense and intelligence cooperation dating back more than a century, and common values that will be at the forefront of President Donald Trump's state visit to Britain in June.But in those same comments and in his speech to the Center for Policy Studies, a conservative British think tank, Pompeo touched on differences that have caused irritation in both Washington and London.Among those are Britain's potential use, despite dire U.S. warnings, of advanced Chinese telecommunications technology and its reluctance to repatriate British foreign fighters captured in Syria and Iraq fighting for the Islamic State.Britain continues to contemplate using 5G technology from China's telecoms giants Huawei and ZTE despite the U.S. saying that it would threaten personal and commercial privacy and could compromise allied intelligence efforts. Pompeo and other officials have said the U.S. may suspend intelligence sharing or remove American equipment and personnel from places where Chinese 5G is deployed."I know it's a sensitive topic, but we have to talk about sensitive things, as friends," Pompeo said of the Huawei issue, which led to May's firing her defense minister last week. "As a matter of Chinese law, the Chinese government can rightfully demand access to data flowing through Huawei and ZTE systems.""Why would anyone grant such power to a regime that has already grossly violated cyberspace? What can Her Majesty's Government do to make sure sensitive technologies don't become open doors for Beijing's spymasters?"As Pompeo spoke, Robert Strayer, the top U.S. cybersecurity diplomat, told reporters there would likely be consequences if Britain lets Huawei into their 5G network."We have very closely integrated information sharing relationships with the U.K. and a range of other countries around the world," he said. "In all those relationships, we rely on trust and protection of information. We would, if a country had Huawei in its 5G network, have to reassess how we are sharing information with those countries, to ensure we are protecting the information that we are sharing."On foreign fighters, Pompeo repeated that the U.S. expects countries to accept their citizens captured on Mideast battlefields."We have an expectation that every nation will work to take back their foreign fighters and continue to hold those foreign fighters," he said. "We've rounded them up, they are now detained and they need to be continued to be detained so they cannot present additional risk to anyone."Britain and the U.S. also have sharp differences over the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, from which Trump withdrew last year and re-imposed sanctions on Tehran.Those differences took on new significance Wednesday as Iran threatened to halt full compliance with deal unless Britain, France and Germany take steps to ensure the U.S. sanctions do not cut into the sanctions relief it was promised in the deal.Britain, France and Germany all reacted negatively to Iran's announcement but said Iran remained in compliance they would continue to fulfill their end of the deal.Pompeo downplayed the differences, saying that while they disagreed on the nuclear deal, all four countries agreed on the need to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons."We're working together to push back on that threat," he said when asked if the allies were on the same side on Iran.Yet he and other Trump administration officials have repeatedly warned Europe against any actions that could impede or evade the crippling impact of U.S. sanctions on Iran's economy. The three European nations, which remain parties to the Iran nuclear deal, have worked together to salvage the accord.Pompeo also appeared to express frustration with the chaotic delays over Britain's departure from the European Union. He noted that Trump was eager to start negotiating on a free trade pact with Britain once Brexit is complete."We've filed all the papers we can at this point. We're ready to go," he said. "But we can't make progress on a new agreement until Brexit gets resolved. How it turns out is your sovereign choice, and whatever happens, we will honor your choice. Our relationship was strong before Brexit, and it will be strong after it.""Ultimately, when all is settled, you'll be first in line for a new trade deal, not at the end of the queue," he added.___Kelvin Chan contributed to this report.Load-Date: May 9, 2019End of Document

COLUMN: Thanks to surveillance capitalism, we are headed toward American social controlIndiana Daily Student: Indiana UniversityMay 29, 2019 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 621 wordsByline: Bryce GreeneBodyFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appears before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, April 11, 2018. Tribune News ServiceBuy PhotosIn China, the ruling Communist Party is rolling out a social credit system on top of its ubiquitous surveillance state. The system will track citizens' behaviour and assign a points to each person based on how their activities conform to the standard set by the central government.Browsing data, personal associations and driving behavior are all factors that go into determining a score. It will affect things such as what housing, schooling and employment someone is eligible for. The party says it is designed to "allow the trustworthy to roam freely under heaven while making it hard for the discredited to take a single step."Here in America, we are rightly horrified at the blatant invasion of privacy. But while we pat ourselves on the back for our purported freedoms, a similar apparatus is beginning to take shape at home.In 2019, Americans are fairly cavalier about our privacy. Most of us own devices that record and store our data. We all use services that only profit by extracting this data. And we fail to seriously challenge our government even now that we know it was abusing its access to this data.In her book "In The Age Of Surveillance Capitalism," Shoshana Zuboff documents the growth of the digital surveillance apparatus in America. Since the early 2000s, behavioral data generated from everyday life has become a hot commodity.Companies such as Google and Facebook all trade in what are called behavioral futures markets. The best data gives the best predictive capabilities which yields better profits. As companies extract better data, the predictive capability is then applied influencing consumers. Zuboff detects a clear and intentional pattern."The aim of this undertaking is not to impose behavioral norms, such as conformity or obedience, but rather to produce behavior that reliably, definitively, and certainly leads to desired commercial results," Zuboff said.Unlike the Chinese government's system which desires social control, the American version is aimed at profits. What started out as targeted ads to encourage consumer behavior is morphing into something more.Insurers are beginning to collect data from vehicle, personal and home data sensors in order to precisely calculate rates. With modern connected ecosystems, this data includes data from Alexas, Google Homes, cell phones and vehicles. In a way, it is similar to the idea of the panopticon. The message is clear: Behave a certain way or be financially punished.The next step is to sell this data to other parties interested in predicting and influencing our behavior.Some of us may shrug it off when one uses a certain word in a personal phone call only to have it appear as an ad on Google later that day. In the near future, your personal conversation could lead to a spike in life insurance rates. Or perhaps firms could construct a marketing strategy based on your perceived personality and mood.The campaign could go as far as to ensure certain posts appear on your feed or certain songs play when you hit shuffle. Every connected device is a potential access point to your life.The entities engaged in this behavioral modification are as accountable to us as the central government is to the Chinese people.  At least if it was our government, there is formally a constitution to be violated and some framework to defend ourselves. There is no such thing when it comes to corporations. It is all too easy to imagine future abuses of this technology.Like what you're reading?

Wyden Speaks About Legislation to Amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971Targeted News ServiceMay 23, 2019 Thursday 9:36 PM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1254 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON, May 23 -- Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, issued the following statement, which was published in the Congressional Record on May 21, on legislation (S. 1569) to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to allow certain expenditures for cybersecurity-related services or assistance:Today I am introducing the Federal Campaign Cybersecurity Assistance Act of 2019--a bulky name for a bill that attempts to do a simply stated thing: protect our democracy from foreign cyber attacks. This bill allows the national campaign committees to provide much-needed cybersecurity assistance to State political parties, Federal campaign offices' staffs, and Federal candidates' personal accounts and devices.In 2015 and 2016, hackers working for the Russian government penetrated the networks of the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The hackers also compromised the email account of Senator Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign manager, John Podesta. The Russian government subsequently leaked and weaponized Democratic party and campaign emails in order to influence the outcome of several elections--most publicly, the presidential race between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, but also U.S. House of Representatives races in Illinois, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Hackers also targeted Republicans during the same period, but were less successful in their efforts.The impact of Russia's hacking-enabled influence campaign was a surprise to many. However, this was not the first time that a foreign government hacked into the campaign organization of someone running to be President of the United States. Senior officials from the 2008 Obama and McCain presidential campaigns have publicly confirmed that both organizations were compromised by hackers. In an interview with NBC News 2013, Dennis Blair, who served as President Obama's Director of National Intelligence between 2009 and 2010 stated that "Based on everything I know, this was a case of political cyber-espionage by the Chinese government against the two American political parties. They were looking for positions on China, surprises that might be rolled out by campaigns against China."In recent years, the Republican National Committee, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and the the National Republican Congressional Committee have all been hacked, as well as the campaigns of Senators Graham and McCain. Both major political parties have suffered hacks, and will undoubtedly continue to be targeted by foreign governments and other sophisticated hackers.Over the past two years, Congress has turned its attention to several weaknesses in our democracy that were exploited by Russia including the role of social media companies and long-standing flaws in paperless voting machines used in several states. While these issues have yet to be meaningfully addressed, they have, at least, been the subject of oversight hearings and legislative proposals in Congress. In contrast, Congress has yet to hold a single hearing on the vulnerability of political parties and campaigns to hacking by foreign governments, nor has anyone else in Congress introduced legislation to help defend these organizations from cyber attacks.For the sake of the integrity of the American political process, I introduce this bill today to protect those running for office, and the organizations that support them, from cyber attacks. Russia's hacking and leaking of emails in 2016 is now well documented. Their efforts continue. If you think they aren't working towards the 2020 federal elections as hard as any cub reporter in Iowa, you'd be sadly mistaken. And they are likely NOT alone. Other hostile governments will undoubtedly seek to emulate and improve on Russia's tactics.Congress has acted in the past to protect those running for office from serious threats. After Senator Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1968, Congress authorized the Secret Service to protect Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates. In extending Secret Service protection to candidates, Congress recognized that the threats to Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates required professional protection. Congress must now take action to protect candidates for Federal office--and consequently, our democracy--from another serious threat: hacking by foreign governments.The political parties are best of the available options to provide cybersecurity to campaigns. Politicians are already dependent upon the parties for fundraising, advertising, polling, messaging, and other forms of support. Giving parties the responsibility to provide cybersecurity does not make politicians dependent on help from a new entity. Parties are also responsible to politicians they protect, moreso at least than any other government, corporate, or non-profit entity.Quite simply, this bill gives the national campaign committees the role of the "IT Department" for state parties, campaigns, and candidates. The committees will be able to provide these entities with securely configured laptops and cellphones, professionally administered email, encrypted messaging, and collaboration software, and if necessary, hire third-party cybersecurity experts to help in the event of a successful hack.This bill also permits the national parties to provide this assistance with money they raise in their "building fund." The building fund is one of three supplementary accounts through which Congress permitted the national campaign committees to raise an additional $100,000 per individual, per year, to pay for the cost of presidential nominating conventions, national party headquarters buildings, and election recounts and other legal battles.I know that some advocates have serious concerns about the building fund and the other supplementary accounts created by Congress in 2014. I share these concerns, and have long supported bold reforms of our campaign finance system. However, the current Senate is extremely unlikely to pass legislation creating public financing of elections anytime soon, and so while we have the current system, permitting the use of money in the building fund for cybersecurity appears to be the least bad option. Most importantly, this approach does not permit the parties to raise any new funds--it merely permits a new use of money raised through the building fund.I am not the only one to recognize the severity of the cyber threat aimed at political parties. Earlier this year, the Canadian agency responsible for government cybersecurity, the Communications Security Establishment, issued a lengthy report on threats to elections, which noted that that "Globally, political parties, candidates, and their staff remain attractive targets for cyber threat activity." Likewise, the Maryland Board of Elections published guidance last week, recognizing that "Campaigns are a potential cyber target," and consequently permitted state political parties to provide additional cybersecurity assistance to campaigns.November 2020 gets closer by the day. Congress cannot wait any longer to protect state parties, campaigns, and the candidates themselves from sophisticated cyber attacks. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to promptly act on this legislation, and to secure our democracy from cyber threats before it is too late.TARGETED NEWS SERVICE, Harwood Place, Springfield, Virginia, USA: Myron Struck, editor; 703/304-1897; editor@targetednews.com; https://targetednews.com-1393441Load-Date: May 23, 2019End of Document

Semiconductors work on an interesting physical principle. When metalloids such as silicon are bonded together covalently to form lattices, they form an insulating material that doesn't allow electricity to flow through it. However, a process called  doping  can change that completely. Doping is the addition of specific substances to the metalloid lattice in specific quantities so that the electronic structure of the lattice is transformed.            P-type doping comprises the addition of boron or gallium to the silicon. Boron and gallium have three electrons in their outermost electronic shells, as opposed to the four in silicon's. This creates  holes  in the silicon lattice, as single silicon atoms are left with nothing to bond to. In contrast, N-type doping involves the addition of phosphorus or arsenic, which have five electrons in their outermost shell. This results in the formation of free electrons with nothing to bond to. This creates the possibility of the movement of electricity through the lattice. When P-type and N-type silicon lattices are combined, this results in the creation of a diode. Not only can electric current flow through this diode, but semiconductors have the unusual property of allowing more electric current through when their temperature is increased. This makes them perfect for use in computing.            The growing demand for computers and related infrastructure is the major driver for the market. Computing has become a vital need for most industrial areas in recent years thanks to the growing adoption of progressively more advanced computing systems. It wouldn't be too wrong to say that computers run the world in today's highly digitalized age.            The growing importance of the semiconductors industry and the electronics sector to modern economics has led to the semiconductors industry becoming a battleground for global giants. The U.S.'s trade war against Chinese company Huawei has been in the news over the last few months, with the political and economic power held by the semiconductors sector being apparent in the strength of Huawei's close ties with the Chinese government, which have led the U.S. administration to curtail their operations in the country.            This move has also had an adverse impact on the U.S. semiconductors industry in recent months, with companies forecasting lower revenue figures and growth projections in light of the inability to sell semiconductor components to Huawei. The likely extension of the ban on Huawei to other and all Chinese firms is likely to further dampen the semiconductors industry's performance in the U.S. in the coming months.            In June 2019, Taiwan banned semiconductor products made in China in order to safeguard the integrity of the data of Taiwanese firms. Taiwan is a major producer of semiconductor and electronic systems as well as being an archrival of China due to the political conflict in the region. The growth of the semiconductor industry in these two countries has all the potential to escalate into a full-blooded technology battle in the coming years.            The semiconductor sector is likely to grow over the coming years due to the growing demand for higher computing power and the growing use of the Internet of Things and other applications of semiconductors.            CONTACT US: Norah Trent       Partner Relations & Marketing Manager       sales@wiseguyreports.com       www.WiseGuyReports.com       Ph: +1-646-845-9349 (US)       Ph: +44 208 133 9349 (UK)            Tags: OTN Hardware,            OTN Hardware Analysis,            OTN Hardware Application,            OTN Hardware Challenges,            OTN Hardware Demand,            OTN Hardware Development,            OTN Hardware Future Drivers,            OTN Hardware Growth,            OTN Hardware Key Players,            OTN Hardware Market 2019,            OTN Hardware Market Share,            OTN Hardware Market Size,            OTN Hardware Market Trends,            OTN Hardware Opportunities,            OTN Hardware Sales,            OTN Hardware Segmentation,            OTN Hardware Services,            OTN Hardware Solution,            OTN Hardware Technology            See Campaign: https://www.wiseguyreports.com/reports/3621912-global-otn-hardware-market-size-status-and-forecast-2       Contact Information:       Office No.528,Amanora Chambers,Magarpatta Road,Hadapsar,Pune-411028.       Tags:       ,            Research Newswire,            EnglishLoad-Date: June 17, 2019End of Document

United Kingdom phone firms demand clarity over HuaweiStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeJune 13, 2019 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 459 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBodyThe technology company is now the world's second-largest smartphone manufacturer and a market leader in equipment needed to build next-generation 5G mobile data networks, but the United Kingdom is yet to make a decision on whether Huawei should be part of the 5G infrastructure.Some nations, such as Australia and New Zealand, have obstructedHuawei from providing equipment for 5G cell programs."I don't think we're complicit in anything, I believe that our objective is to understand the law and comply with the law, it's for others to make judgments", the UK Government's former chief IT adviser said.The UK's network operators have reportedly written to the Government asking for it to be clearer about its position on Chinese telecommunications giantHuawei, over fears it could impact on the country's roll-out of 5G.But that did not impress the UK's closest ally, who has warned that Washington does not see a difference between core and non-core parts of a 5G network.Fears have been raised that the company and its network equipment could be used by the Chinese state as a route to spy on the West - whichHuawei has strongly denied - while the U.S. is pressuring allies to distance themselves from the firm.Ottawa 'very relieved' after 2 Canadian women abducted in Ghana rescuedGhana's President Nana Akufo-Addo has vowed to take tough action to end the spate of abductions in the country. The ministry said an interrogation process is ongoing, which will determine whether more arrests will be made.Huawei for its part has always insisted that that it poses no security threat to any of its customers.Huawei's global cybersecurity and privacy officer, John Suffolk, was askedmultiple times by members of the Science and Technology Committee if the company had problems working with oppressive regimes.China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology on Thursday allowed commercial-use 5G permits to four state-owned telecom giants to begin rolling out 5G solutions, signalling Beijing's decision to be the worldwide leader in establishing superfast wireless networks.The Shenzhen-headquartered firm, which is under massive weight after the USA issued the boycott cautioning thatHuawei frameworks could be controlled by Beijing to keep an eye on different nations and upset basic, made the declaration on Thursday in a press explanation.In conclusion, Suffolk told MPs that the Chinese government has never had immoral demands, and that the company invites everyone to analyse its products in search of flaws or backdoors. The company's proactive conflicts in USA courts indicate it's prepared to work with all ways, including federal courts, to reduce grief from a race into the 5G marketplace - the potential of high-speed telecommunications.Load-Date: June 13, 2019End of Document

Continue reading NIO has laid off 70 employees and closed an office in Silicon ValleyChinese EV startup NIO has laid off 70 employees across two Silicon Valley offices, one of which is now closed, according to a filing with California's Employment Development Department. The cuts started in early April, shortly after the startup announced it was laying off 3 percent of its workforce in China.Twenty employees were let go from the company's North American headquarters and R&D center in San Jose, California, while 50 employees were cut from NIO's San Francisco office, which housed some of the startup's user interface and experience teams. The San Francisco office has been closed.The cuts are small relative to NIO's total number of employees   the startup disclosed it had 640 employees in the San Jose office alone at the end of 2018 and some 10,000 worldwide, according to the company's financial filings   but they're a sign that the young electric automaker's early momentum is cooling.NIO says it wants to be  optimizing management efficiency this year  After four years of rapid growth, we've set up a global organization. However, fast development has also posed issues like repetitive functional departments, undefined work tasks, unclear work responsibilities, and insufficient work for certain people,  a spokesperson for NIO said in a statement to The Verge.  We would like to solve them by optimizing management efficiency this year. Founded in 2014 as NextEV, NIO has already designed the EP9, an all-electric supercar that is one of the fastest in the world, plus two SUVs, the ES8 and the ES6. The ES8 began shipping last summer, and NIO has delivered more than 15,000 of them since. The ES6 is slated to go into production later this year.NIO's cars are currently being built by Chinese state-owned automaker Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group, or JAC Motors. NIO originally planned to temporarily use JAC to make its cars while the startup built its own massive factory in Shanghai. But the company announced it had abandoned those plans in March, and that it will continue to have its cars contract manufactured.NIO became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange last September, though it raised far less money than it had originally hoped. And while NIO beat its own expectations for sales in 2018, it has gotten off to a really slow start in 2019.On a March 5th conference call with investors, NIO's chief financial officer Louis Hsieh said he was  confident in [NIO's] growth prospects in the coming year,  but that a forthcoming decision from the Chinese government to cut subsidies for electric vehicles was creating  uncertainty.  Up until now, NIO has done just about everything right,  Michael Dunne, who runs automotive consulting firm ZoZo Go.  From here, can they ramp production and sales while sustaining quality? That's the test. Tags:  See Website:            https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/2/18526825/nio-electric-car-ev-layoffs-silicon-valley-officeContact Information:Sean O'KaneTags:           Wire,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: May 4, 2019End of Document

The major index futures are currently pointing to a lower open for the markets, with the Dow futures down by 100 points. Stocks are likely to move back to the downside as traders continue to worry the trade dispute between the U.S. and China is escalating into a full-fledged trade war. A report from the South China Morning Post said Chinas is re-examining the entire bilateral economic relationship between the U.S. and China. The SCMP said Chinese government advisers are highlighting the risk of sourcing critical supplies from an increasingly hostile U.S. following the Trump administration's recent move to blacklist Chinese tech giant Huawei. Mei Xinyu, a fellow at the research institute under China's Ministry of Commerce, told the SCMP that Beijing should prepare for the worst-case scenario to defend its rights in climbing up the global value chain through technological catch-up. "Even if a deal is reached, it could be torn apart [by President Donald Trump] easily at any time," Mei said, comparing the current trade talk deadlock to the Panmunjom peace talks during the Korean War. Potentially adding to the trade concerns, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin recently told CNBC's Ylan Mui the U.S. has no plans to go to Beijing to resume trade negotiations. Later in the session, trading may be impacted by reaction to the release of the minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting. The minutes may shed additional light on the outlook for interest rates but could also be viewed as old news considering the constantly shifting developments on the trade front. Among individual stocks, shares of Qualcomm (QCOM) are moving sharply lower in pre-market trading after a federal judge ruled the communications chip maker violated antitrust, suppressing competition and using its dominant position to exact excessive licensing fees. Home improvement retailer Lowe's (LOW) is also likely to come under pressure after reporting weaker than expected fiscal first quarter earnings and lower its full-year profit forecast. On the other hand, shares of Target (TGT) are moving significantly higher in pre-market trading after the retail giant reported better than expected first quarter results. With the markets continuing to show intense sensitivity to trade-related news, stocks showed a strong move back to the upside during the trading day on Tuesday after moving mostly lower over the course of Monday's session. The major averages ended the day firmly in positive territory. The Dow climbed 197.43 points or 0.8 percent to 25,877.33, the Nasdaq jumped 83.35 points or 1.1 percent to 7,785.72 and the S&P 500 advanced 24.13 points or 0.9 percent to 2,864.36. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region closed mixed for the fifth consecutive session on Wednesday.

While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index is just above the unchanged line, the German DAX Index and the French CAC 40 Index are down by 0.4 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively. In commodities trading, crude oil futures are tumbling $0.86 to $62.27 a barrel after edging down $0.08 to $63.13 a barrel on Tuesday. Meanwhile, after falling $4.10 to $1,273.20 an ounce in the previous session, gold futures are rising $3.40 to $1,276.60 an ounce. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 110.34 yen compared to the 110.50 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Tuesday.

On Monday, the department announced a 90-day grace period on the policy.The US accuses Huawei of helping the Chinese government to spy on other countries, though it hasn't shown any evidence.Load-Date: May 23, 2019End of Document

France is the latest country to tackle 5G vendor security concernsFierceWirelessApril 4, 2019Copyright 2019 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 382 wordsByline: Kendra ChamberlainHighlight: Bloomberg reports France's parliament is currently debating a bill that would see the country establish stricter security rules around 5G networks.BodyFrance's parliament is debating a bill that would see the country establish stricter security rules around 5G networks, according to a report from Bloomberg. The legislation would subject 5G network equipment to special testing to determine whether the equipment is vulnerable to security leaks of sensitive information. Vendor equipment would need to be cleared before those vendors could be eligible for 5G network build-out contracts. The bill is a newer version of an earlier piece of legislation, which failed to gain support among French lawmakers earlier this year. It would see safeguards put in place around critical infrastructure, and extend vetting processes to electronic components and software used in towers and equipment. The bill is the latest development in an ongoing discussion across Europe on how to best manage security concerns in 5G networks. Most of the discussion has centered around China-based equipment vendor Huawei. RELATED: European Commission weighs in on 5G securityThe U.S. government has led the charge against Huawei, lobbying its allies across the globe to ban the equipment maker in light of concerns that Huawei potentially could allow the Chinese government backdoor access to critical infrastructure. As a result, Australia is banning wireless carriers from using Huawei products on their 5G networks; while Japan has banned its federal agencies from using equipment from either Huawei or ZTE.RELATED: Huawei files suit against U.S. as dispute around equipment intensifiesDespite U.S. efforts, several European countries have opted to tighten their own security regulations, rather than ban Huawei outright. Germany's telecom regulator BNetzA announced last month it would not ban Huawei products from 5G build-outs, while the European Commission released a set of operational recommendations that target cybersecurity across 5G networks in the Europe Union. The UK, on the other hand, recently            released a report outlining several security concerns it has in Huawei products, but has not yet decided to formally ban the vendor from 5G networks. French President Emmanuel Macron, meanwhile, has indicated his interest to build “a coherent strategy” with China, according to Bloomberg's report. Chinese president Xi Jinping visited France last month. Load-Date: April 10, 2019End of Document

FCC to hold big 5G auction, spend $20B for rural internetAssociated Press Financial WireApril 12, 2019 Friday 10:10 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: WASHINGTON DATELINELength: 557 wordsByline: By DARLENE SUPERVILLE and TALI ARBEL, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - The U.S. government will hold a massive auction later this year to bolster 5G service , the next generation of mobile networks. President Donald Trump showcased the announcement Friday, declaring that the race to stand up these faster, more powerful networks is a competition "America must win.""We cannot allow any other country to outcompete the United States in this powerful industry of the future," Trump said at the White House. "We are leading by so much in so many different industries of that type, and we just can't let that happen."Trump also announced a $20 billion plan to expand broadband access to rural areas currently without it, a decadelong extension of an existing program.5G will mean faster wireless speeds and has implications for technologies like self-driving cars and augmented reality. Trump said it will transform the way people work, learn, communicate and travel, making farms more productive, manufacturers more competitive and health care better and more accessible. But experts say it's hard to know now how much life will actually change because of the much-hyped network upgrade.It will take years to roll out, and the highest data speeds and capacities may not reach rural areas at all.The rollout started last week in the U.S. and South Korea but will take years.The Federal Communications Commission said Friday that it would hold the largest auction in U.S. history to boost wireless companies' networks. The auction is set for Dec. 10, and will be the agency's third for 5G, said FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, who joined Trump for the announcement."We want Americans to be the first to benefit from this new digital revolution," Pai said.The U.S. is jockeying for position with China over 5G. It has effectively banned Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei from most U.S. networks due to concerns that it might enable Chinese government spying, which Huawei denies. The U.S. has pushed its allies to do the same, with mixed results . Huawei is the world's largest maker of such equipment.FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, criticized the agency's approach to 5G Friday. She said the U.S. has not auctioned off "midband" spectrum that is better suited to serve rural areas because of how far it can carry signals, and that the Trump administration's actions on 5G have "set us back." She cited tariffs on telecom equipment that have raised costs and said the administration has been "alienating allies" on the 5G security issue.The FCC also said Friday that it will be renewing an existing $2 billion broadband subsidy program, for 10 years. It will provide about $20.4 billion over a decade to providers, with the goal of connecting up to 4 million rural homes and small businesses to high-speed internet.The agency spent $34.5 billion on rural-broadband network subsidy programs from 2010 to 2017, according to the Government Accountability Office.It's more expensive for telecom companies to serve spread-out rural areas than cities and suburbs, so the government provides grants to encourage them to build internet networks in rural parts of the country. Some 24 million Americans lacked access to high-speed internet as of the end of 2016, by the FCC's count.___Arbel reported from New York.

It has effectively banned Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei from most U.S. networks due to concerns that it might enable Chinese government spying, which Huawei denies. The U.S. has pushed its allies to do the same, with mixed results . Huawei is the world's largest maker of such equipment.FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, criticized the agency's approach to 5G Friday. She said the U.S. has not auctioned off "midband" spectrum that is better suited to serve rural areas because of how far it can carry signals, and that the Trump administration's actions on 5G have "set us back." She cited tariffs on telecom equipment that have raised costs and said the administration has been "alienating allies" on the 5G security issue.The FCC also said Friday that it will be renewing an existing $2 billion broadband subsidy program, for 10 years. It will provide about $20.4 billion over a decade to providers, with the goal of connecting up to 4 million rural homes and small businesses to high-speed internet.The agency spent $34.5 billion on rural-broadband network subsidy programs from 2010 to 2017, according to the Government Accountability Office.It's more expensive for telecom companies to serve spread-out rural areas than cities and suburbs, so the government provides grants to encourage them to build internet networks in rural parts of the country. Some 24 million Americans lacked access to high-speed internet as of the end of 2016, by the FCC's count.___Arbel reported from New York.

Global Facial Recognition Market by Technology, Type, Application, End-user and Region - Forecast to 2023 - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireApril 11, 2019 Thursday 8:26 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business EditorsLength: 1106 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Global Facial Recognition Market - Segmented by Technology, Type, Application, End User, and Region - Growth, Trends, and Forecast (2018 - 2023)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The Facial Recognition Market was valued at USD 3.83 billion and is expected to reach USD 8.26 billion by 2023, with a CAGR of 13.68% during the forecast period (2018-2023). The report profiles the technologies of facial recognition, like 2D, 3D, and facial analytics in various regions.The facial recognition market is expected to benefit from the measures taken by companies towards security and privacy of the organization and attendance tracking. Multimodal biometric systems have seen increasing adoption for two step or three step authentication. This has led to the growth of facial recognition technology as a secondary authentication method.Government investment to improve security across the borders and within public spaces has opened new venues for players in the facial recognition market. Developing video surveillance systems across the world is also fueling the growth of the facial recognition market. The smartphones industry is integrating facial recognition as a primary authentication technique thus, with the growth of smartphone industry facial recognition market is also expected to grow.Increasing Need for Enhanced Surveillance & MonitoringNeed for advanced security and surveillance systems in public places to improve public safety and security is a major driving factor for the facial recognition market. The Smart City initiative by the Indian government is a great example depicting the growing need of surveillance and monitoring systems where the underdeveloped cities are being equipped by 24x7 surveillance systems to improve the safety, security, as well as traffic management in the cities. China has made massive investments for the facial recognition startup Face+++. The Chinese government is aiming to build a facial recognition AI to improve the surveillance systems.Additionally, organizations are also improving their surveillance systems to monitor and enhance the organizational environment. Data breaches are a critical concern for any organization, and this can be tracked through surveillance systems to identify trespassing. Thus, with increasing demand for surveillance and security, the market for facial recognition is also expected to grow.Asia-Pacific is the Fastest Growing Region for the MarketThe Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow at a high rate during the forecasted period due to increasing investment in facial recognition technology by governments and growing surveillance systems in the developing countries, such as India and China. The increasing number of firms recognizing facial recognition technology as an advanced security feature is also pushing the facial recognition market growth in this region.The major players in the APAC market, like NEC and Cognitec, among others are continuously developing their technology and partnering with various organizations and governments to provide their facial recognition technology. For instance, Singapore's Changi Airport implemented facial recognition technology into Fast and Seamless Travel (FAST) systems and also the Indian government is increasing its surveillance systems through the smart city program. As APAC region has an increasing demand for the surveillance and is expanding the infrastructure for facial recognition technology it is estimated to grow at a high rate.Key Developments in the Market• July 2018: Texas-based startup Blink Identity announced, it raised USD 1.5 million in a seed round led by Sinai Ventures with the participation of Live Nation, Techstars, and other live entertainment related funds. Blink Identity has created a fast, accurate, and user-first identity service for live entertainment venues, solving the bottleneck problem and creating a preferential experience for consumers and venue owners• July 2018: Western Union patents money transfer system using biometrics-based sender verification.

Huawei, a battle of the global warCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 21, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 524 wordsBody Mike Pompeo warned him in Budapest in February: beware who opens the doors to Huawei  There is war, but diplomatic forms are maintained. There are no bullets because it occurs in the intangible and commercial areas. The color of the varnish is that of security, but the rivalry is for communication hegemony.  It is the war between China and the United States.  Steve Bannon designed the Trump for him to declare it to Xi Jinping. The aperitif was taken by the two presidents in Mar-a-Lago, the American relaxation office, in April 2017. Then came the threat of Trump over a tariff imposition, a warrant of arrest against Meng Wanzhou, daughter of the owner of Huawei, and finally, the declaration of war by Google.  In the language of the symbols, that is, the diplomat, President Xi Jinping sent yesterday a very powerful one. Along with his chief trade negotiator, Deputy Prime Minister Liu He, he went to a memorial in Jiangxi province to place a flower arrangement in memory of the Long March of 1934, which marked the rise to power of Mao Zedong. For a year, the Red Army of the Communist Party walked more than 6,400 kilometers to get around the army of the Republic of China. Patience, the message.  The war will be long, and as pointed Anna Fifield of The Washington Post newspaper, the Chinese government prepares the country through the psychology of film art. The night of last Friday the channel CCTV-6 changed its programming. Instead of airing the Asian Film Awards, he released the film Heroic Sons and Daughters by director Wu Zhaodi, whose plot sketches and encourages the patriotic sentiment of the Korean War in which China helped North Korea fight the Americans in 1950. .  During the weekend, the Chinese channel broadcast two films under the same patriotic sentiment, such as: Battle on Shangganling Mountain and Surprise Attack. In social networks, a kind of hashtag promoted three phrases that underlined a clear message to the United States: "Do you want to talk? Let's talk; You want to fight? We do; Do you want to harass us? Keep dreaming".  Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft, among other technology, had to align themselves with the PRISM espionage program of the National Security Agency (NSA), the liquid CIA. Characters like Zuckerberg put their hands to their heads, simulating indignation. Apple, even in an act of leniency, refused to give the key to the FBI of San Bernardino criminals in February 2016. However, the foreign surveillance law (Fisa, 2008), forced them to submit requested data via judicial orders.  Now, Huawei is on the black list of the US Department of Commerce and Google has already lined up to Steve Bannon's run. It's nothing new.  On 11 February in Budapest, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo launched a threat to his European allies: "We want to make sure we identify the opportunities and risks of using that equipment (from Huawei). (Because) whoever associates with them "will have difficulty associating with the United States.  As happened in 1950, the Chinese strategy (and it seems to tie with Trump's) is to sit at the diplomatic table with the US while the war is going on. Load-Date: May 21, 2019End of Document

Electric car makers woo Chinese buyers with range, featuresAssociated Press Financial WireApril 16, 2019 Tuesday 10:25 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 950 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: SHANGHAI BodySHANGHAI (AP) - Automakers showcased electric SUVs and sedans with longer range and luxury features Tuesday at the Shanghai auto show, wooing Chinese buyers as Beijing slashes subsidies that helped to launch the industry.Two of China's biggest state-owned automakers unveiled models they said can travel 600 kilometers (370 miles) on one charge, or nearly double the range of global competitors. If that can be achieved, it would raise the standard for an industry trying to compete with gasoline models by defusing "range anxiety" or fear of being stranded with a dead battery.China's communist leaders have spent heavily seeking to make the country a leader in electrics. They're now shifting the burden to automakers by imposing sales targets. That requires brands to create consumer-friendly models at a time when they are struggling with a sales slump."Competition will become more fierce," said Ma Fanglie, chairman of BJEV, the electric unit of state-owned BAIC Group.BJEV, one of the biggest electric producers by sales volume, unveiled the EX3 sedan, which it said can travel up to 630 kilometers (390 miles) on one charge. Ma said it is one of five new electric models under a plan to "transform and upgrade" BJEV into a brand that can compete without subsidies.General Motors, Nissan, China's Geely Auto and other brands displayed dozens of electric models, from luxury SUVs to compacts priced under $10,000. The auto show, the world's biggest, opens to the public Saturday following a preview for media.China's leaders have been promoting "new energy vehicles" for 15 years with subsidies for developers and buyers. That, along support including orders to state-owned utilities to blanket China with charging stations, is helping make the technology a mainstream product."After an initial push from the government, now customers are really wanting and demanding EVs," said Nissan's director of electric vehicles, Nic Thomas.Electric vehicles are key for government-led development of Chinese global competitors in technologies from robotics to biotech.Those ambitions set off Beijing's tariff war with President Donald Trump. Washington, Europe and other trading partners complain Chinese subsidies to technology developers and pressure on foreign companies to share know-how violate its market-opening commitments.China lags Europe, the United States and Japan in battery and other vehicle technology but is developing fast. It has about half of global production capacity for batteries, an electric car's biggest and most expensive component.Last year's Chinese sales of pure-electric and hybrid sedans and SUVs soared 60% over 2017 to 1.3 million, or half the global total.At the same time, industry revenue was squeezed by a 4.1 percent fall in total Chinese auto sales to 23.7 million vehicles.That skid that worsened this year as first-quarter sales fell 13.7% from a year ago.Subsidies end next year. Under the new system, automakers must earn credits for sales of electrics equal to at least 10% of purchases this year and 12% in 2020. Longer-range vehicles can earn double credits. That means some brands can fill their quota if electrics make up as little as 5% of sales.Most automakers still lose money on each electric vehicle. But industry analysts say that as the cost of batteries and other components falls, electrics could become cost-competitive with gasoline models and profitable for their producers within five years.In Shanghai, the GAC electric car unit GAC New Energy unveiled the Aion LX SUV, which it said can travel 600 kilometers (370 miles) on one charge. The unit's deputy general manager, Xi Zhongmin, said no price or release date have been decided.Most Chinese brands target the domestic market, but Geely has global ambitions.Its electric brand, Geometry, displayed a sedan with an advertised range of up to 500 kilometers (310 miles) on one charge. Geely says the Geometry A, unveiled last week in Singapore, will be marketed worldwide.Geely's parent, Geely Holding, also has a joint venture with Mercedes parent Daimler AG to develop an electric version of the German automaker's smart brand."Geely wants to become the choice of customers for electric driving," said Geely Group's CEO, Yang Xueliang.China's BYD Auto, the biggest global electric brand by sales volume, displayed three new pure-electric models that were unveiled last month. All promise more than 400 kilometers (280 miles) on one charge.On Monday, GM unveiled Buick's first all-electric model for China. GM says the four-door Velite 6 can travel 301 kilometers (185 miles) on one charge.VW showed off a concept electric SUV, the whimsically named I.D. ROOMZZ, designed to travel 450 kilometers (280 miles) on one charge. Features include seats that rotate 25 degrees to create a lounge-like atmosphere.China is a top market for global automakers, giving them an incentive to go along with Beijing's electric ambitions.Also Tuesday, Nissan Motor Co. and its Chinese partner displayed the Sylphy Zero Emission, an all-electric model designed for China. Based on Nissan's Leaf, the lower-priced Sylphy went on sale in August.Mercedes Benz displayed its first all-electric model in China, the EQC 400 SUV, with a 400-kilometer (280-mile) range. It is one of 10 electrified models the German automaker says it will release worldwide, with most made in China.Also this week, Mercedes said it will launch a roadside "butler service" in China offering recharging for drivers who run out of power and other services."We want to take away every reason a customer might say, umm, is it really time go electric?" said Hubertus Troska, a Daimler AG board member.___AP researcher Yu Bing contributed.Load-Date: April 17, 2019End of Document

MODERNISATION OF C2000 TO CONTINUEStates News ServiceApril 26, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 530 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: THE HAGUE, The Netherlands BodyThe following information was released by the Netherlands Government Information Service (RVD):The C2000 system is used for mobile communications between emergency services, for example in the wake of a car collision. A tender to modernise C2000 was awarded in 2015 to a consortium of three companies. One of these is Hytera Mobilfunk GmbH, a former division of a German company, which has been taken over by the Chinese company Hytera. Rising concerns about increasing interference by state actors and changing geopolitical relations led the Minister of Justice and Security, Ferdinand Grapperhaus, to commission a number of investigations, including one by the General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD), into the risk of undesirable influences on C2000 and potential vulnerabilities. The minister has concluded from the security investigations and the measures taken that the modernisation of C2000 will be able to proceed in a responsible manner. He will gladly discuss his considerations shortly with the Dutch House of Representatives. The minister presented this information in a letter to the House of Representatives today.Minister Grapperhaus commissioned two security investigations into the new C2000 system in summer 2018. The AIVD and the IT company Xebia conducted these investigations. While the AIVD investigation identified a low risk of the Chinese government interfering with the modernised C2000 system should Hytera Mobilfunk GmbH be involved, the IT company Xebia qualified the level of security at Hytera Mobilfunk GmbH as 'not bad', which is an average rating. Minister Grapperhaus also commissioned an in-depth technical investigation by the company Valori into two applications that Hytera China has developed, neither of which were found to contain any so-called 'backdoors'.These security investigations have prompted Minister Grapperhaus to increase the level of security by arranging additional technical and organisational measures as well as by incorporating further contractual safeguards. Both the prevention of undesirable interference by state actors and the general security situation will benefit from these measures. The minister has made agreements with Hytera Mobilfunk GmbH on increasing the level of security, the implementation of which will be monitored closely. Further arrangements have been established on a strict separation between the Chinese owner on the one hand and the German process of development, production and management on the other. The minister is always able to have the source code of Hytera Mobilfunk GmbH inspected.An opinion on the investigations and measures referred to above has been requested from Bart Jacobs, Professor of Security and Correctness of Software at Radboud University, who is also a member of the Cyber Security Council. His recommendation is to continue modernising C2000 along the current lines with the parties involved, with a continuous emphasis on security matters and with due regard for a number of areas for improvement. The AIVD has also confirmed that the measures recommended in the classified section of the serviceandapos;s investigation report have been addressed efficiently.Load-Date: May 24, 2019End of Document

The Dow is down 22.03 points or 0.1 percent at 24,793.01 and the S&P 500 is down 8.75 points or 0.3 percent at 2,743.31. A steep drop by shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is weighing on the Nasdaq, with the tech giant plunging by 6 percent. Alphabet has come under pressure after a report from the Wall Street Journal indicated the Justice Department's antitrust division has been laying the groundwork for an investigation of the company in recent weeks.  Meanwhile, some traders are looking to pick up stocks at reduced levels on the heels of last week's sell-off, although trade concerns continue to weigh on the markets. Over the weekend, an official document from the Chinese government blamed the U.S. for the escalating trade dispute between the world's two largest economies. The white paper, issued by China's State Council Information Office, argued the U.S. is "solely responsible" for the collapse of trade talks. China accused President Donald Trump's administration of continually changing its demands, arguing the setbacks in the talks were all the result of "U.S. breach of consensus and commitments, and backtracking." At a press conference in Beijing on Sunday, Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen denied Trump's claims that China had been the side seeking to renegotiate a nearly completed agreement. "Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed," Wang said, noting that China remains willing to resolve the trade dispute but only with an agreement that benefits both countries. In U.S. economic news, the Institute for Supply Management released a report showing the pace of growth in manufacturing activity unexpectedly saw a continued slowdown in the month of May. The ISM said its purchasing managers edged down to 52.1 in May from 52.8 in April, dropping to its lowest level since hitting 51.7 in October of 2016. While a reading above 50 still indicates growth in the manufacturing sector, economists had expected the index to inch up to 53.0. Sector News Software stocks have come under pressure over the course of the trading session, dragging the Dow Jones U.S. Software Index down by 1.6 percent to a two-month intraday low. Notable weakness has also emerged among retail stocks, as reflected by the 1.2 percent drop by the Dow Jones U.S. Retail Index. On the other hand, considerable strength remains visible among gold stocks, with the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index spiking by 3.6 percent to its best intraday level in well over a month. The rally by gold stocks comes amid another sharp increase by the price of the precious metal, as gold for August delivery is jumping $12.40 to $1,323.50 an ounce. Chemical, biotechnology, and steel stocks also continue to see significant strength, rebounding following recent weakness. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly lower during trading on Monday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index slid by 0.9 percent, while China's Shanghai Composite Index fell by 0.3 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets turned positive after seeing early weakness. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index rose by 0.3 percent, the German DAX Index and the French CAC 40 Index advanced by 0.6 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively. In the bond market, treasuries are extending the strong upward move seen over the past several sessions.

Treasuries Rebound Amid Lingering Trade ConcernsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 22, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 400 wordsBody       After drifting modestly lower over the two previous sessions, treasuries regained some ground during the trading day on Wednesday. Bond prices moved to the upside in morning trading and remained firmly positive throughout the afternoon. Subsequently, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, fell by 3.3 basis points to 2.393 percent. The rebound by treasuries came as traders continued to worry the trade dispute between the U.S. and China is escalating into a full-fledged trade war. A report from the South China Morning Post said Chinas is re-examining the entire bilateral economic relationship between the U.S. and China. The SCMP said Chinese government advisers are highlighting the risk of sourcing critical supplies from an increasingly hostile U.S. following the Trump administration's recent move to blacklist Chinese tech giant Huawei. Mei Xinyu, a fellow at the research institute under China's Ministry of Commerce, told the SCMP that Beijing should prepare for the worst-case scenario to defend its rights in climbing up the global value chain through technological catch-up. "Even if a deal is reached, it could be torn apart [by President Donald Trump] easily at any time," Mei said, comparing the current trade talk deadlock to the Panmunjom peace talks during the Korean War. Adding to the trade concerns, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC's Ylan Mui the U.S. has no plans to go to Beijing to resume trade negotiations. Treasuries remained firmly positive following the release of the minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting, which suggested the central bank is in no rush to alter the path of interest rates. The minutes showed members agreed that a patient approach to determining future adjustments to rates would likely remain appropriate for "some time." Citing an environment of moderate U.S. economic growth and muted inflation pressures, the Fed expects to remain patient even if global economic and financial conditions continued to improve. The Fed decided to leave interest rates unchanged at the two-day meeting ended May 1st, as uncertainties affecting the U.S. and global economic outlooks had receded but inflation pressures remained muted. Traders will be on the lookout for any trade-related news on Thursday but are also likely to keep an eye on reports on weekly jobless claims and new home sales.        Load-Date: May 22, 2019End of Document

Nvidia Is Presenting an OpportunityJim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUSMay 20, 2019 Monday 12:35 PM EDTCopyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1930 wordsByline: Jim Cramer and the AAP TeamHighlight: We view headwinds as transitory and end markets as attractive as ever.BodyFollowing Friday night's Mad Money interview with Nvidia  CEO Jensen Huang (which can be viewed in its entirety ), we want to take a moment to review our investment thesis and detail why we are looking at the current pullback as a buying opportunity.First, let's take a look why the shares are down to begin with. The primary concern on investors' minds is the ongoing and seemingly intensifying U.S./China trade dispute. In addition to the fact that Nvidia generates about 23% of its sales in China, there is the potential for the Mellanox  acquisition to be delayed or outright denied by the Chinese government in an attempt to harm U.S. business interests as retaliation.While management did their best to ease these fears, noting on the quarterly conference call that it's in the best interests of the Chinese to approve the Mellanox deal as it benefits their datacenter efforts as much as anyone, the overhang remains as any further intensification could result in rationale going out the window as both the U.S. and China appear to be increasingly willing to take some pain if it means more harm for the other.The second overhang comes as a result of commentary on the quarterly call, where management removed full-year guidance noting that visibility into datacenter spending by customers remains cloudy given uncertainty surrounding the spending pause. Also, an ongoing CPU shortage has caused the initial ramp of its gaming laptop business to come along slower than expected.Adding all of these factors together, it's understandable that shares have taken a beating in recent weeks. However, the question then becomes, have we seen peak demand for Nvidia's products or are we looking at a real opportunity for those with a longer-term investment horizon that have the conviction to ride out any near-term volatility, which will more than likely come from trade rhetoric than anything else.To answer this question, let's look at the headwinds noted above as well the opportunities that lie ahead.Regarding the trade conflict, while this absolutely reflects an obstacle that must be overcome, if only because the semiconductor ETF (and Nvidia as a result) will be hammered every time the rhetoric intensifies, we continue to view the issue through an optimistic lens. We believe that even if it gets worse before it gets better, it will ultimately be resolved as both nations rely so heavily on each other for long-term economic growth and prosperity and the Mellanox acquisition will ultimately be approved.As for the datacenter spending pause, Huang told us flat out on Mad Money that "there's no question in my mind that the spending pause will end," noting simply that "all of the datacenters, the hyperscalers bought a little too much last year. They bought too much in Q4 and so they're going to take a quarter or two to digest it." We are adamant in our view that this is indeed a transient issue because the need and advantages of moving from 100% in-house servers to the cloud (be it a full migration to the public cloud or a partial one in the form of a hybrid ecosystem) are undeniable. Such a move allows for increased flexibility by allowing customers to scale up or down the amount of storage and resources they use in line with their own client demand trends, something that essentially allows companies to convert fixed costs to variable ones. It also removes the need for ongoing maintenance, multi-year build server farm outs (time and money), allows for increased accessibility in an increasingly on the go world and redundant backups, providing an added element of disaster relief.Regarding the notebook ramp, management guided that they do not expect the issues that plagued the initial ramp to disrupt any further ramp and given that this is tied to a CPU shortage, we again come away with the conclusion that this too is a temporary issue.So, while we certainly understand the issues pressuring the shares, we believe that in time, all of them will pass. Looking ahead, we are keeping are eyes on the prize, which in the case of Nvidia, are the company's massive, secular growth end markets: the datacenter (think the cloud), gaming, pro visualization, and autonomous driving. We believe all of these markets will continue their growth trajectory and as we've noted previously, serve to create a datacenter-oriented flywheel, which makes us even more bullish about the Mellanox acquisition.While we believe the cloud will grow for the reasons mentioned above, we maintain that gaming is becoming increasingly more mainstream and with the coming age of virtual reality, is transforming from strictly games to full-blown experiences that everyone, even non-gamers can enjoy; not to mention the impact of eSports and potential for eSports betting.As for pro visualization, with everyone from Pixar, to Adobe  and Autodesk  , to Microsoft  , Epic and the bulk of game developers adopting RTX ray-tracing technology, we believe Huang is spot on in stating that "it is now a forgone conclusion that ray tracing is going to define the next generation of computer graphics."Finally, it is becoming increasingly more clear that the future of driving is autonomous and that the charge will be led by Nvidia. This reflects both the company's auto-based chips, which allow for on-the-fly decisions, as well as those in the datacenter that are allowing for the next stage of deep learning and artificial intelligence, inferencing -- the stage in which machines learn to infer the correct answer/decision on the spot, based on real world inputs and everything learned in the deep-learning stage.Now, while each of these addressable markets is impressive in their own right, we believe that to truly understand and appreciate the Nvidia opportunity, one must recognize the way in which each one outside of the datacenter, ultimately comes back to interacts with the datacenter, which in turn will also help in appreciating management's decision to double down on the datacenter via the Mellanox acquisition. The core premise of this view is simply that all of these end markets in one way or another link back to the cloud (i.e. the datacenter).Starting with gaming, the shift is ongoing, and video games are quickly moving from physical disks, to digital downloads and ultimately coming to the end user as a "Netflix-like" streaming service. This means that games will no longer be stored on disks or user hard drives, but eventually be entirely stored in the cloud. So, the growing popularity and cutting-edge graphics are not only leading to an uptick in demand for RTX chips from at home users, but also resulting in increased demand from hyperscalers such as Microsoft that want to build out fully functioning streaming services. So, gaming alone results in demand for consumer chips for gaming rigs and demand from hyperscalers who want to build out additional capacity to aid the transition to streaming. Furthermore, cloud provider demand stands to increase more over time as more users adopt streaming services such as Microsoft's Game Pass or Nvidia's GeForce NOW, and increasingly tax datacenters as lags will be unacceptable in the world of competitive gaming.On the pro visualization front, RTX GPUs mean that for the first time in history, computer generated images (CGI) can be done on GPUs, rather than large CPU render farms, which until now have been the only solution. This means increased demand for GPUs at the user level as the process is more efficient and thanks to RTX, more effective in creating life-like images. However, with companies such as Adobe and Autodesk increasingly pushing into subscription, cloud-based offerings, this also means increased demand for cloud computing (again, the datacenter) is growing along with it.Finally, autonomous driving may be the most intriguing end market when we consider the impact it will have on the datacenter.For starters, the algorithms that power automated vehicles go through thousands of hours of deep learning (in the datacenter) before they can be put to the test in the real world. One way to do this is Nvidia's DRIVE Constellation platform, which allows auto OEMs to "test and validate billions of miles in the datacenter," before the car even touches the pavement.Considering that full autonomy is considered "Level 5" and we're for the most part still scratching the surface of Level 2, there is a whole lot of training yet to be done in the datacenter. Still, deep learning is only part of the equation, once the machines have "learned," they must be tested.This is where inferencing comes in. Recall, during the inferencing stage, neural networks that have previously been "trained" are put to work and called upon to "infer" things about new data that they have not previously encountered based on skills learned in the training phase. This represents another stage of the progression toward full autonomy and as a reminder, demand on this front was key in offsetting the full impact of the data center spending pause, with management noting on the conference call, "we are seeing many of the hyperscalers definitely purchasing in terms of the inferencing into the installment that it continues, also in terms of the training instances that they will need for their cloud or for internal use absolutely."That said, the need for the datacenter doesn't end once the cars hit the road. At that point, the continuous feedback loop comes into play as 5G wireless technology is making it so that these cars can send data back to the datacenter for further processing and ongoing improvements. As Huang put it on the call, "The cars are collecting a couple of terabytes per day per test car, and all of that data has to be powered through and crunched through in the data center." To put that into perspective, 1 terabyte (TB) is equal to 1,024 gigabytes (GB) -- the largest iPhone available is 512GB; so, every day, a single self-driving car can send information equivalent to four full iPhones (based on a "couple" of terabytes) to the data center for processing, and we are only now scratching the surface of automotive autonomy.Keeping this in mind, it becomes even more clear why a company leading the charge in self driving would keep on doubling down its datacenter efforts. As for the timing, on the call, Huang noted, "Level 2+, call it 2020, late 2021 or like 2022-ish. So that's Level 2+. I would say 2019, very, very early for robotaxis; next year, substantially more volume for robotaxis; 2021, bigger volumes for robotaxis." And, keep in mind, the cars themselves will also of course be loaded full of Nvidia chips as these machines will be required to make literal life or death decisions on the fly.Bottom LineGiven our view that the headwinds are transitory and the end markets remain as attractive as ever, we are keeping a very close eye on the shares. We are eager to bulk up on our position and believe that Nvidia will ultimately prove a winner for years to come because, trade war or not, these end markets will continue to grow and all rely on Nvidia solutions in one form or another.That said, we will be patient so as to ensure that each purchase has a material impact on our basis and provide ourselves time for trade-related updates to trickle out so as not to have a full position in place before we have a more clear view of progress being made throughout the negotiations. On that note, we remind members that we will be watching the G20 summit closely as President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to meet face to face to discuss trade.Load-Date: September 8, 2019End of Document

Global Biopolymer Packaging Market Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2019-2024: Focus on Food & Beverages, Retail, Healthcare, AutomotivePR NewswireJune 26, 2019 Wednesday 12:15 PM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1278 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, June 26, 2019 BodyPR NewswireThe"Biopolymer Packaging Market - Growth, Trends, and Forecast (2019 - 2024)"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.The Biopolymer Packaging market is projected to register a CAGR of 22.68%, during the forecast period (2019 - 2024)Biopolymers refer to naturally occurring polymers, primarily from renewable sources, such as plants and animals, which are helpful in manufacturing plastics. Furthermore, the market is focusing on increasing the production capabilities of biopolymers.Increasing concerns about sustainable packaging created considerable demand for bioplastics. For example, several consumer goods companies, such as Samsung and Apple, are using bioplastics for packaging. For example, as of January 2019, Samsung's electronics division announced its new sustainability policy, which involves changing product packaging for its phones, tablets, and appliances. Products, such as televisions, fridges, and washing machines, will no longer use plastic bags. Instead, they will be packed in bags made of recycled plastic and bioplastics, which are produced from biomass materials, like vegetable fats, corn starch, and sugar cane. Moreover, in the global scenario, the packaging is the most prominent application of biopolymers. However, increasing consolidation in the global market and stringent environmental regulations are expected to boost the demand for biopolymers in the near future. For instance, in January 2019, Danish enzyme manufacturer, Novozymes launched a joint venture with Carbios, a prominent biotechnology company, which based in France, to commercialize the production of biodegradable plastics, primarily with the help of plastic degrading enzymes.Scope of the ReportBiopolymers are polymers that are produced by living organisms. Some of the biopolymers are proteins, lipids, DNA, RNA, and carbohydrates. The report has segmented the market Material Type (Non-Bio-degradable (PET, PA, PTT, and Others)), Bio-Degradable (PLA, PBAT, Starch Blends, Others)), End-user (Food & Beverages, Retail, Healthcare, Automotive), and Region.Key Market TrendsFood and Beverages Industry is Expected to Witness a Significant Growth in the Forecast PeriodInnovations in the fields of biopolymers are expected to drive the market during the forecast period. According to Indian Science Journal, scientists have made biopolymer films from potato peel and fruit pomace, which can be used to store perishable food products, such as bread. The biopolymer films made from potato peels and fruit pomace waste are 0.3 millimeters thin and can withstand temperatures as high as 200 degree Celsius. They have good breakage strength and elongation capacity. The impending government regulations regarding single-use plastic packaging in China is causing the companies to ramp up the production of biodegradable plastics. For instance, the founder and chairman of Saton Daily Necessities would be spending USD 15 million to produce biodegradable straws made from polylactide acid (PLA - a type of bioplastic or biopolymer) by doubling the size of the factory. Food and Beverages companies have started to come with initiatives to curb greenhouse gas emissions. In order to support such moves In October 2016, PepsiCo collaborated with Danimer Scientific for the development of Danimer Scientifics' biodegradable film resins to meet the sustainable flexible packaging requirements of PepsiCo's global food and beverage business. This partnership has enabled companies to expand biopolymer technology to provide innovative bioplastic solutions to a wider range of applications and products.Asia-pacific is expected to Register a fastest growth rate in the Forecast PeriodThe Asia-Pacific region is the largest producer and consumer of biopolymers, globally. According to the statistics released by the European Bioplastics, around 56% of the global bioplastics production is accounted for by the region. When compared to 2016, this data suggests that the country increased its production capacity by over 28%. The Chinese government has stressed upon pollution-free economic progress which has made Chinese plastic makers look for biodegradable materials. A move like this would boost the usage of biopolymers that can be used for packaging thereby influencing the market in a positive way. Moreover, a recent study by the European Bioplastics indicates that most of the investment in new bio-based polymer capacities are expected to take place in the Asia-Pacific region, owing to better access to feedstock and a favorable political framework.Competitive LandscapeThe competitive rivalry in the biopolymer packaging market is high owing to the presence of certain key players like Baraskem SA, Arkema SA, BASF SE, Toray Industries Inc. and many more. These firms are able to gain a competitive advantage over other players due to their ability to consistently innovate their products that could meet the demands of their consumers. This is possible due to their continued investments in research and development activities, mergers and acquisitions and strategic partnerships with other firms or institutions.January 2019 - The European Commission cleared the company's acquisition of Solvay's polyamide business. This acquisition is expected to complement the company's engineering plastics portfolio while enhancing access to key markets in Asia and South America. Furthermore, it is expected to strengthen the company's value chain, through backward integration, in key raw materials, such as ADN.Key Topics Covered:1 INTRODUCTION2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY4 MARKET DYNAMICS4.1 Market Overview4.2 Introduction to Market Drivers and Restraints4.3 Market Drivers4.3.1 The Growing Government Regulations for Bio Based Packaging4.3.2 Increasing Awareness for Human Well Being and Eco Friendly Products4.4 Market Restraints4.4.1 Performance Issues with Bio Based Materials4.4.2 High Cost of Biopackaging Materials4.5 Value Chain Analysis4.6 Industry Attractiveness - Porter's Five Force Analysis4.6.1 Threat of New Entrants4.6.2 Bargaining Power of Buyers/Consumers4.6.3 Bargaining Power of Suppliers4.6.4 Threat of Substitute Products4.6.5 Intensity of Competitive Rivalry5 MARKET SEGMENTATION5.1 By Material Type5.1.1 Non-biodegradable5.1.1.1 PET5.1.1.2 PA5.1.1.3 PTT5.1.1.4 Other Material Types5.1.2 By Biodegradability5.1.2.1 PLA5.1.2.2 Starch Blends5.1.2.3 PBAT5.1.2.4 Other Biodegradability Types5.2 By End-user Industry5.2.1 Food and Beverages5.2.2 Retail5.2.3 Healthcare5.2.4 Automotive5.2.5 Other End-user Industries5.3 Geography6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE6.1 Company Profiles6.1.1 Arkema SA6.1.2 BASF SE6.1.3 NatureWorks LLC6.1.4 Novamont SpA6.1.5 Plantic Technologies Ltd6.1.6 Baraskem SA6.1.7 Biome Technologies PLC6.1.8 Bio-On SpA6.1.9 Toray Industries Inc6.1.10 Spectra Packaging Solutions Ltd6.1.11 United Biopolymers SA6.1.12 PTT MCC Biochem Company Ltd7 INVESTMENT ANALYSIS8 MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND FUTURE TRENDSFor more information about this report visithttps://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/l9mii7Research and Markets also offersCustom Researchservices providing focused, comprehensive and tailored research.Media Contact:Research and MarketsLaura Wood, Senior Managerpress@researchandmarkets.comFor E.S.T Office Hours Call +1-917-300-0470For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call +1-800-526-8630For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900U.S. Fax: 646-607-1907Fax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716 View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-biopolymer-packaging-market-growth-trends-and-forecast-2019-2024-focus-on-food--beverages-retail-healthcare-automotive-300875289.htmlSOURCE Research and MarketsLoad-Date: June 27, 2019End of Document

Huawei smartphones will no longer be sold with WhatsAppStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeJune 7, 2019 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 333 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyAlphabet's Google said earlier that it would no longer provide Android software for Huawei phones after a 90-day reprieve granted by the United States government expires in August.Facebook blocking its popular apps from being pre-installed on Huawei devices is a big blow to the phone maker.Facebook has suspended Huawei's ability to pre-install the social network's apps on its smartphones. This might seem like a minor inconvenience as the apps can just be downloaded from the Play Store once the new phone has been set up, but many consumers might still see it as another reason to avoid Huawei handsets. This new restriction is only applicable to brand new Huawei devices that have not left the factory.It follows President Donald Trump signing an executive order effectively banning the Huawei from U.S. communications networks, based on national security concerns over Huawei's close relationship with the Chinese government. Reuters is reporting that Facebook is now joining Google, Microsoft, Qualcomm, and others in the Huawei ban.Australia vs West Indies - Highlights & StatsWatch Pakistan take on Sri Lanka in the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup live on Sky Sports Cricket World Cup from 10am on Friday . It was timed brilliantly and looked destined to clear the ropes the moment it had left the bat but Cottrell had other ideas.The Chinese company declined to comment on Facebook's decision. The US government granted the search giant a 90-day reprieve after Huawei was blacklisted, meaning even phones not yet shipped or built will still receive updates and come with Google services pre-installed.Huawei isn't giving up without a fight, challenging the ban in United States courts.This move led to Google ceasing Android support for existing Huawei devices and no longer providing the system for future models.However, as we explained before, Huawei's operating system is not a solution for any market but China, and that's mainly because of the Play Store that comes with Google's Android.Load-Date: June 8, 2019End of Document

Decoding the global AI advantage; Deloitte Global report assesses AI readiness and maturity across countriesPR NewswireMay 1, 2019 Wednesday 6:00 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1208 wordsDateline: NEW YORK, May 1, 2019 BodyPR Newswire In the coming years, artificial intelligence (AI) will exert an enormous impact on economic development and the nature of work. It will also radically reshape the competitive dynamics of many industries. A new Deloitte Global study released today,"Future in the balance? How countries are pursuing an AI advantage - Insights from Deloitte's State of AI in the Enterprise, 2nd Edition survey,"examines the growing importance of AI and what we can learn from early adopters across seven countries.The survey found that 57 percent of early AI adopters believe it will transform their company within the next three years. Early AI adopters are using AI to improve both their external and internal capabilities - enhancing products and services and optimizing internal business operations. Sixty-three percent of early adopters say that AI technologies are "very" or "critically" important to their business success today, and that number is expected to increase to 81 percent in just two years.Yet, AI initiatives also present an array of challenges and risks, some of which are perceived differently across regions. Globally 43 percent of executives said they have major or extreme concerns about potential AI risks. Filling the AI skill gap is a significant issue, with 68 percent of global respondents indicating moderate-to-extreme skill gaps. Other top concerns include cybersecurity vulnerabilities and making incorrect decisions based on AI recommendations."Paths to successful AI implementation and use differ greatly, and countries are at varying stages of the process. By examining countries' challenges and how they are addressing them, we can glean some essential best practices," saysPaul Sallomi, Deloitte Global Technology, Media & Telecommunications industry leader. "For example, some countries are more concerned about addressing skill gaps. Others are focusing on how AI can improve decision-making or cybersecurity capabilities. While there is intense competition among countries and companies, all adopters can learn from one another and early success will depend on getting execution right.""There is a growing realization of AI's importance, including its ability to provide competitive advantage and change work for the better,"saysJeff Loucks, executive director, Deloitte Center for Technology, Media and Telecommunications, Deloitte LLP. "To tap into these opportunities and ensure AI success, organizations must excel at a wide range of practices, including strategy development, pursuing the right use case, building a data foundation, and possessing a strong ability to experiment. These capabilities are critical now because, as AI becomes even easier to consume, the window for competitive differentiation will shrink."Key takeaways from the report's country analysis of AI readiness and adoption include:Australia is playing catch up: Organizations from Australia hold a positive view of the strategic importance of AI to their success. Seventy-nine percent believe AI will be "very" or "critically" important to their business within two years. Despite the optimism, 50 percent of AI early adopters from Australia report that AI helps them "catch up" or "keep up" to their competition, rather than establish a distinct lead-the highest rate of all countries. It appears there's a mismatch between perceived levels of urgency and readiness. Canada exhibits caution: Canada is taking a cautious approach, with only 25 percent of early adopters from Canada indicating they currently embed AI into their products and services, the lowest of all countries. Yet at the national level, Canada is making a concerted effort to bolster its collective AI capabilities. This is especially true for talent, where the government has put forth policies to make immigration an easier, more open process for those with AI-related skill sets. China prioritizes R&D: The Chinese government is investing heavily in AI research and development, and 85 percent of respondents from China expect that in two years AI will be very or critically important to their organization's success-the highest level globally. Organizations from China are demonstrating signs of strategic maturity by putting policies, procedures, and metrics in place to succeed with AI. Almost half (46 percent) indicate they have a comprehensive, organizationwide strategy for adopting AI. France aspires to empower its people: The French government is making it a priority to develop AI both domestically and by working broadly with the European Union. Seventy-six percent of early adopters from France believe that AI will augment human capabilities. But the survey also reveals that early adopters in France are struggling to obtain talent and to integrate AI into their organizations' processes. Germany turns fears into strengths: The German government is looking to accelerate adoption and development of AI technologies, but AI early adopters appear to struggle more with some of the ethical concerns surrounding AI. Their top ethical concerns are using AI to manipulate information and create falsehoods and potential job cuts. However, the workforce concerns have translated to a more holistic approach to filling the AI talent gap - respondents from Germany are more likely than their counterparts from other countries to have a strong focus on AI training. The UK bets big on AI: With a thriving startup scene and heavy government investment, the UK is an enthusiastic participant in the global AI revolution. Forty-five percent of respondents from the UK say AI will be of critical importance to their near-future success and 60 percent expect to increase their AI investment more than 10 percent next fiscal year. This is the highest rate for both of these measures among all countries surveyed. US recognizes AI challenges: The US continues to be a leader in public and private AI research, but with sophistication comes recognition of the complexities and challenges. Cybersecurity is a top concern for executives in the US, second only to China. Forty-seven percent of respondents from the US are concerned about sensitive data being stolen, and 45 percent worry that outsiders will influence AI models.Please visit Deloitte Insights to read the full report:https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/us/articles/5189_Global-AI-survey/DI_Global-AI-survey.pdf.About DeloitteDeloitte refers to one or more of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited ("DTTL"), its global network of member firms, and their related entities.

Editorials from around New EnglandAssociated Press State & LocalJune 7, 2019 Friday 1:13 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: STATE AND REGIONAL; Editorial RoundupLength: 4080 wordsByline: By The Associated PressBodyEditorials from around New England:CONNECTICUTHelping schools is good, but not at the cost of transparencyThe Hartford Courant, June 5A $100 million donation to Connecticut's struggling schools from billionaire Ray Dalio's foundation seems like too good a deal to pass up.But it requires a $100 million contribution from state taxpayers, and that means the public should have a transparent view into how its money is being spent.The legislation that creates the panel that oversees the project, though, explicitly states that it will not be a public agency, potentially exempting it from the Freedom of Information Act and ethics rules. That raises serious concerns.The legislation is baked into the massive budget bill that could soon be on Gov. Ned Lamont's desk. It establishes a nonprofit corporation called the "Partnership for Connecticut, Inc." The bill "specifies that the corporation must not be construed (1) as a department, institution, public agency, public instrumentality, or political subdivision or (2) to perform any governmental function."And while the panel initially overseeing the fund includes top state officials, members appointed by the governor and by Mr. Dalio's foundation, they are required only to issue semiannual reports on its workings, "in form and substance agreed to by the corporation and governor but (the bill) does not otherwise specify any required contents or deadlines."That means the people with control over $100 million in state funds would have no accountability to the public. Disclosure of the panel's operations will be at the discretion of those who hold the purse strings. Clearly, there is a public interest in transparency. If the Dalios wanted to create a fund with only their own money, then of course they could handle it however they wished. But if they are bringing state money into the process, the public gets to see how that money is spent. A gift to the public good shouldn't come with conditions that exclude the public from the conversation.The plan itself - to help struggling districts and connect young adults with jobs - looks good on its face. The Dalio's foundation is already active in a number of Connecticut school districts. Meriden's superintendent Mark Begnini recently said that "Barbara (Dalio) has visited our districts, held round tables with students, heard from our staff . She doesn't just invest in public education. Her heart is in this work. She cares about what's happening in this district. She wants success as much as we do."But in other places, the value of philanthropic contributions to schools has been questioned. Some have wondered whether investments in schools from Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Microsoft's Bill Gates have been effective.The issue of transparency, though, is critical. How are taxpayers to be assured, for example, that their money isn't being funneled to politically connected groups, or to businesses that have other oars in state waters, or in exchange for other favors down the road?Deputy House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, put a fine point on the problem during a break in the debate on the bill. "Since when are tax dollars not subject to complete transparency?" he asked. "The governor has created a diversion of taxpayer revenues into a corporation that can spend money in the shadows. . I would be shocked if any legislative leader would honor this cloak of secrecy."He's right. In principle, partnering with a philanthropic interest to help solve the state's workforce and education problems is a great idea. But the devil is in the details, and those details must be open to the public.Online: https://bit.ly/2QT264U___MASSACHUSETTSTransport chief Chao's links to shipping business raise real red flagsRepublican of Springfield, June 4The members of a president's Cabinet are supposed to serve the citizenry. As such, they take an oath to defend our nation's Constitution.While this used to be a given, what had been normal has been largely stood on its head in our era, with members of President Donald Trump's Cabinet often acting as though they'd pledged to honor and defend the businessman-chief executive, no matter what.One Cabinet secretary, though, appears to have a different view, one that could politely be termed a bit more old-school: using the office to the benefit of her own interests and those of the family business.A lengthy report published in The New York Times on Monday detailed myriad ways that Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has appeared to work to aid her family's international shipping business, Foremost Group, a company with deep ties to the Chinese government.Though the secretary herself has no official role in the company, her actions, taken together, show her working to see that the family business had a seat at the table -- sometimes literally.The report in Monday's Times begins with the tale of a canceled trip. Back in October 2017, nine months after Trump had been inaugurated as president, Chao had been scheduled to visit China, in her official capacity. But her plans to bring along at least one family member, and to have others sit in on meetings, raised a red flag with an official at the American embassy in Beijing.After a series of questions, from government officials and journalists alike, the trip was scuttled -- because of a scheduling conflict, don't you know.Chao, it must be noted, is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican who, thanks largely to gifts from his wife's family, is now one of the Senate's richest members.Before she was tapped to head the Department of Transportation under Trump, Chao had served as labor secretary in the administration of President George W. Bush. And during the eight years between those government appointments she made at least four trips to China with Foremost.The report in The Times paints a portrait of a tangled web of money and influence and family connections. Oh, and government posts.One wonders how Trump, who was on his way to London when the Times published its report on Chao, would feel about a member of his Cabinet working for the betterment of someone other than him. One can imagine that Trump would look approvingly at a department head trying to grease the skids for one of his real-estate projects. But someone trying to assist another? Maybe not so much. Or perhaps he won't care a whit, just dismissing the report as "fake news," Trumpspeak for any news account he dislikes, no matter its veracity.China's shipping and shipbuilding interests are not ours. If our nation's transportation secretary has her eye on the family business, even in part, can she at the same time be trusted to be putting America's vital interests on the high seas at the top of her agenda?In our nation, we, the people, are supposed to have the ultimate power. We need to be able to believe that those in Washington who have been elected or appointed to positions of importance have the needs of the country foremost in their minds. Taking even a cursory look at the Chao family business and the doings of the transportation secretary can give one serious pause, and then some.Online: https://bit.ly/2QU5OeH___MAINETransparency a good place to start to reduce prescription drug costsThe Bangor Daily News, June 4Prescription drug costs, which have risen substantially in recent years, now account for a fifth of all health care spending. As a result, a quarter of Americans say they have a difficult time paying for their prescription medications and nearly one in 10 say they do not take their medication as prescribed to save money.This is not sustainable. There are efforts in Congress and the Maine Legislature to slow the cost increases to ensure that people don't go without needed medication.Although rising drug costs have been a problem for years, action is slow at the federal level. That leaves it to states to find ways to lower drug prices for their residents. This is not as effective as a comprehensive national approach, but state action could propel movement on federal fixes.Maine lawmakers are considered a package of bills aimed at lowering prescription drug prices. The Legislature's Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services has given bipartisan support to four of the bills."When it comes to health care, Maine needs to be fighting for patients over profits. This is especially true when it comes to prescription drugs. Nobody should have to choose between putting food on the table, heating their home or taking their medicine," Senate President Troy Jackson, a Democrat from Allagash, said in a statement. He sponsored two of the bills."It's high time we took action to lower the cost of prescription drugs in this country," he added. And I don't mean making minor progress around the margins. We need to tackle the prescription drug crisis head-on."The most comprehensive, LD 1499, would establish a prescription drug affordability board. The board would, for the first time, review how drugs are priced. Manufacturers would be asked to provide information to justify their prices and any price increases.Such transparency will begin to answer questions about why some common medications have recently risen in price, why different groups are charged different amounts for the same medications and why some specialty drugs are so expensive.Based on this review, the board would set prescription medication spending targets for public entities based on a 10-year-rolling average.LD 1162, a bill from Democratic Senator Eloise Vitelli of Arrowsic, is also about transparency. It would broaden the information about drug pricing that is collected by the Maine Health Data Organization in an effort to zero in on the reasons that overall costs are increasing, such as rising ingredient costs, marketing and price negotiations with insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers.Pharmacy benefits managers negotiate drug prices with public and private insurance providers, with little transparency of how prices are set. They are often incentive for the manger to keep drug prices high so they are paid more. In addition to providing more information to insurers, an amended version of LD 1504, sponsored by Sen. Heather Sanborn, D-Portland, would require PBMs to pass manufacturer rebates along to consumers or to the insurance carrier to lower insurance premiums. It would also require that consumers be offered the cash price for a drug if it is lower than their co-pay.Another bill from Jackson, LD 1272, Jackson would allow Maine to create a wholesale prescription importation program to acquire lower priced medications from Canada. While this could help some Maine residents, the state would need a waiver from the federal government to import medications from Canada and not all medications would be available.Sen. Susan Collins is currently working in Congress on a comprehensive bill to lower drug costs that includes many of the same fixes, including more disclosure of how drug prices are set and pharmacy benefit manager reforms. In a recent meeting with the BDN, she predicted that a comprehensive bill would soon come of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pension.Late last month, Collins and two other Republican senators introduced the Prescription Drug Price Reporting Act. It would create a web-based federal database that would include pricing and rebate information and require drug companies to explain any price increases.Lowering prescription drug prices is also a priority for Sen. Angus King, who recently introduced legislation to require more pricing transparency in drug advertising. He has cosponsored other bills to allow importation from Canada and to allow Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices.With three-quarters of Mainers saying they are concerned about prescription drug costs, this work is vital. The same polling found strong support in Maine for many of the fixes currently before the Legislature.Seeking to address the problem from many angles - transparency, importation and price negotiations - and at both the state and federal level makes sense. It will take a comprehensive, sustained approach to reverse the pricing trend that puts the health of too many Americans at risk.Online: https://bit.ly/2wBIjh5___NEW HAMPSHIREPFAS lawsuits will protect public healthFoster's Daily Democrat, June 2New Hampshire citizens have a right to expect the water they drink will not make them sick.This week, three lawsuits were filed to hold responsible the manufacturers of PFAS chemicals that have polluted drinking water across the state and pose a health risk to every man, woman and child.These suits, if successful, will provide communities the financial resources needed to detect, monitor and remove PFAS chemicals from the water we drink.The federal Agency For Toxic Substances and Disease Registry has found exposure to PFAS can increase cancer risk, lower a woman's chance of getting pregnant, interfere with the body's hormones and affect the growth, learning and behavior of infants and children. The Environmental Protection Agency lists PFAS as a possible carcinogen.On Wednesday, Gov. Chris Sununu, Attorney General Gordon MacDonald and Department of Environmental Services Commissioner Bob Scott announced two lawsuits against companies that manufactured and distributed PFAS in New Hampshire."We are confident that this lawsuit will be a success, and that it will provide proper assistance to the state and or communities," Sununu said.MacDonald explained the basis of the lawsuit at a press conference. "... The defendants possessed unique knowledge of the dangers of PFAS chemicals but continued to make and sell them without warning the public of their health risks," he said.Mindi Messmer, a former state representative from Rye, applauded the state's action. Messmer first sounded the alarm about PFAS on the Seacoast and worked in the Legislature to improve water quality standards."The state of New Hampshire was successful in a similar lawsuit relating to a gasoline additive (MtBE), which resulted in payouts of up to approximately $388 million and is being used to fund drinking water projects across the state," Messmer said. "Polluters must be held accountable for the damages associated with public health impacts from exposures to these chemicals in our drinking water."Dr. Tom Sherman, a state senator from Rye who chairs the Senate's Health and Human Services Committee, also spoke strongly in support of the lawsuits.?... New Hampshire taxpayers should not bear the burden of cleanup of chemicals marked and sold by companies that have been aware of their toxicity since the early 1960s," Sherman said. "Further PFAS detections in Stratham, Kingston, East Kingston and Brentwood underscore my concern that New Hampshire does not have the resources to address this remediation on our own."State Sen. Martha Fuller Clark of Portsmouth, who has tried to balance protecting Portsmouth taxpayers while supporting remediation of PFAS pollution from the Coakley landfill, said, "...the lawsuit is the right thing today because it will help ensure New Hampshire communities aren't obligated to absorb the costs of environmental cleanup efforts, which is clearly a responsibility of the PFAS manufacturers."Fuller Clark points out that one PFAS manufacturer, 3M, was already successfully sued in Minnesota. The state of Minnesota in February 2018 reported an $850 million settlement of its suit against 3M.A third lawsuit was filed in federal district court on behalf of military servicemembers and workers at the former Pease Air Force Base (now Pease International Tradeport), who allege exposure to PFAS chemicals in Pease drinking water has already damaged their health and presents additional future health risks.The city shut down its Haven well at the tradeport in 2014 after tests by the Air Force detected PFAS levels significantly higher than those deemed safe by the EPA. Since that time, the Air Force has spent $14 million to install a carbon filtration system with tests showing removal of PFAS to non-detect levels.These lawsuits are the first significant steps toward ensuring communities impacted by these dangerous chemicals will have the funds to apply the needed technologies to remove these dangerous chemicals from our drinking water.Online: https://bit.ly/2MyEnZk___RHODE ISLANDPushing forward with merger talksThe Providence Journal, June 4Showing bold leadership, Gov. Gina Raimondo has joined battle in one of the most consequential issues facing Rhode Island. She is pushing for the unified health-care system that would help keep medical jobs here, and prevent the hollowing-out of the local system.Ms. Raimondo announced Tuesday that she has asked Lifespan, Care New England and Brown University to resume negotiations that could lead to a locally-run academic medical center in Rhode Island. Legislative leaders as well as The Providence Journal have also advocated for a unified system.This is risky business, because the state's renewed interest in a unified system prompted Boston-based Partners HealthCare, one of the top hospital systems in the world, to back out of its proposal to buy the financially troubled Care New England system, which operates Women & Infants Hospital, Butler Hospital, Kent Hospital and other facilities."In order to give this effort the best possible chance for success and to provide maximum flexibility to the governor and the leadership of these three institutions, we will be withdrawing our application to acquire CNE," Anne Klibanski, M.D., the interim president and CEO of Partners, said in a statement.People have known for years that the small state of Rhode Island would benefit from having a unified health-care system that would provide comprehensive services and employ economies of scale to cut costs. Egos and competing financial interests have blocked that in the past.It now seems clear that there is no more time for petty differences. With Partners pulling back, a deal seems the best hope for all concerned.Lifespan, the largest private employer in Rhode Island, has been warning for some time of the "dire consequences" of the Partners deal to local health care. It feared that procedures now done in Rhode Island would be siphoned off to Boston, making it much harder to maintain the concentration of surgeons and staff needed to provide first-class local care.That might also do serious damage to Brown University, which maintains a vibrant school of medicine.Lifespan CEO Timothy Babineau praised the governor for taking an "important first step to achieve a vision that has eluded the state for more than two decades.""A thriving hospital system is critical to the health care of all Rhode Islanders. Over the past several months I have increasingly heard from a number of stakeholders and understand the appeal of a locally-run, academic medical center based in Rhode Island," Governor Raimondo said.While she does not control private local hospitals, she has significant influence through the bully pulpit, which she has decided to wield in behalf of the state. She called on the parties to work quickly through the summer to see if they can move toward a unified system. The Rhode Island Foundation and the Partnership for Rhode Island will provide financial support for consultant work.Legislative leaders showed their support. "A unified hospital and health care delivery system appears to be in the best interests of the needs of Rhode Islanders," House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello said, adding that he is pleased that discussions have resumed.We are encouraged too, and hope that egos and lesser considerations can be set aside in the interests of protecting Rhode Island jobs and promoting high-quality local health care.Online: https://bit.ly/2XuNnzE___VERMONTA different paceThe Times Argus, June 6An article in the New York Times this week raises an interesting conundrum about people - across all ages - using devices for information and entertainment.In fact, it may be true that the argument we are getting dumber as a result of too much screen time is a fallacy. Data suggests the opposite might be true.For certain, younger Americans are quick to point out to adults that they can find information faster; they can multitask better; and when standing in line or at other idle times, they are actually being productive. (The definition of "productivity" could be more aptly debated.)According to the article: "Consider what a person can do in just the time it takes to wait for a bus: text, watch a comedy skit, play a video game, buy concert tickets, take five selfies, each with a different set of cartoon ears."Social scientists say learning how that behavior shapes an individual's life experience requires an entirely new approach, one that recognizes that screen time is no mere habit but now a way of life.That seismic shift in perception was recently argued in the journal Human-Computer Interaction. The phrase "screen time," authors noted, is too broad to be scientifically helpful; it cannot remotely capture the fragmented, ever-shifting torrent of images that constitutes digital experience.According to the article, researchers have linked daily time spent on specific platforms, like Facebook, to measures of well-being and mental health. But to build a more compelling understanding of the effects of digital experience, they'll need far more, the new paper argues. Scientists need to look over people's shoulders, digitally speaking, and record everything, on every device, that an individual sees, does and types. The researchers call this ultra-fine-grained record a "screenome," adapting the concept from "genome," the full blueprint of one's genetic inheritance. Each person's daily screenome is similarly unique, a sequential, disjointed series of screens.What might seem like a frenetic pace to many is the new normal for most young people - and even many adults. The argument becomes, the experts maintain, we actually may be evolving into higher-functioning beings.A paper written by researchers from Penn State University, Boston University, Apple Inc. and Toyota Research Institute is based on exactly what those "threads" look like, and how individuals respond to them.In arguing to develop such an approach, the researchers presented the digital threads of several dozen people, recorded with consent: screenshots taken every few minutes for periods ranging from a day to several days. Those records showed that people switched from one screen activity to another continually, every 20 seconds on average, and rarely spent more than 20 minutes uninterrupted on any one activity, even a full-length movie.Perhaps most intriguing, the paper presented color-coded graphs of the digital threads of 30 college students, monitored over four days. The graphs revealed wide differences in what people used their screens for, as well as in their patterns of switching from one kind of activity, like email, to another, such as entertainment or news. Some people sprinkle brief periods of work between huge chunks of streaming movies and YouTube, for instance; others appear to be bouncing between email, work and news sites compulsively.Researchers also could examine screen time to predict other factors.The most commonly cited downside of excessive screen time is low mood, or depression. In a recent study, researchers examined (with permission) the Facebook activity of 114 people diagnosed with depression. Using machine-learning algorithms, the team analyzed the content of the users' posts from the months and years before receiving the diagnosis, and compared these to the posts of similar people who did not go on to develop depression.The analysis found differences in how frequently certain kinds of words appeared. For instance, people who later received a depression diagnosis talked about themselves on Facebook measurably more often than people who did not develop the mood problem. The analysis, while small by big-data standards, was the first to link to diagnoses in medical records, and it solidified previous correlations between online language content and low moods.It is a fascinating sign of our times."How much screen time is too much" is a puzzle for a past era, the article concludes.What we are looking at, and how we are using that information, are different issues altogether.Online: https://bit.ly/2I0U339Load-Date: June 8, 2019End of Document

Banmerchant recommends going long in the US technology sector and short in the semiconductor subsectorCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 10, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 604 wordsBody The high volatility generated by the trade war between the United States and China in the riskiest assets and the low interest rates that persist in fixed income markets have diminished the opportunities for attractive returns for investors in the world.  However, apparently not all is lost. Despite this complex scenario, some estimate that there are some attractive options to invest, particularly in the US.  " In an economic environment dominated by the trade dispute between China and the United States, global economic slowdown and high expected volatility, we recommend long / short strategies (buy / sell) in order to benefit from the performance or relative profitability of one asset over another. that to the direction of the market ", says Luis Méndez, general manager of Banmerchant Capital SA  One of the strategies aims to take long positions in the technology sector (Nasdaq 100) and short positions in the semiconductor subsector.  Méndez explains that this thesis is based on the fact that "one of the sectors most likely to be harmed by the commercial dispute between China and the United States is the semiconductor or chip producers sector."  He adds that the country governed by Donald Trump produces about half of the global semiconductor market, which reaches US $ 470 billion, where the dispute with Huawei put this sector of the telecommunications production chain and hardware equipment in the eye of the hurricane. Now, he adds, the United States is lobbying worldwide against the Chinese company so that allied countries do not adopt Huawei's 5G technology, so the Chinese government is expected to retaliate against US competitors.  "In this way, we expect American semiconductor producers to be affected by lower demand from China," emphasizes Méndez, adding that the companies that could be most affected are Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, Broadcom, Intel and AMD.  How do you win in this bet? The return is obtained from the differential that occurs between the return obtained by the asset on which a positive performance is expected with respect to the one achieved by the asset with respect to which there are negative expectations. For example, if in a given period the Nasdaq rents 10% and the semiconductor subsector loses 5%, the investor takes a return of 15%. And if the Nasdaq advances 10% and the semiconductors 3%, the investor gains 7%. Utilities versus S & P 500 Another strategy that the investment bank Banmerchant recommends in the United States is to go long in the utilities sector and short in the S & P 500, the index that brings together the 500 largest companies that trade in the stock market of that country.  "Given the possibility of a falling stock market due to lower global economic growth, the consumption of basic services (utilities) tends to be considered a defensive sector, since the demand fluctuates less than for basic services. the demand for other discretional goods and services, "explains Méndez.  He adds that, in this way, "we expect this sector to have a better performance than the stock market in general". Along with this, he argues that the reason for going short in the S & P 500 is to isolate the effect of market direction, where what matters is the relative performance between the index and the utilities sector.  In turn, it estimates that the signatures of saidThe most favored sectors would be Nextera Energy, Duke Energy, Dominion Energy, Exelon, American Electric Power and Sempra Energy.  The Banmerchant entry recommends going long in the US technology sector and short in the semiconductor subsector first published in La Tercera. Load-Date: June 10, 2019End of Document

European companies want to do business with Huawei. That just got harderCNN WireApril 30, 2019 Tuesday 4:59 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 638 wordsByline: By Julia Horowitz, CNN BusinessDateline: LONDON (CNN Business) BodyLONDON (CNN Business) --  Europe's telecoms companies want to do business with China's Huawei. That may have just gotten harder.Vodafone and Huawei confirmed Tuesday that the phone company discovered vulnerabilities in Huawei software in 2011 and 2012, following a report from Bloomberg News. The problems were routine and promptly fixed, the companies said. But the disclosure could give the United States more ammunition in its campaign to block Huawei from next-generation 5G networks in Europe because of fears that China could use the technology for spying or sabotage. "It will be pointed to as ... yet another past security concern around Huawei," said Paul Triolo, head of the geotechnology practice at consultancy Eurasia Group.Messy politicsMany of the biggest telecoms companies in Europe use Huawei components in their existing networks, and would like the option to use the Chinese company's products to build the super-fast 5G services that will power self-driving cars and future smart cities. "The telecom community has been very supportive of Huawei," said Dario Talmesio, an analyst at market research group Ovum. "Without Huawei, they don't have enough diversity of suppliers."Huawei is the world's largest supplier of telecoms equipment, and its market share in Europe is estimated at between 35% and 40%.The company's presence in Europe is helping to keep down costs, telecom providers say. And having components from multiple suppliers can make networks less vulnerable to attacks. Yet their ability to keep doing business with Huawei has been put into doubt by a bruising political fight.The Trump administration has repeatedly warned allied countries that the United States could restrict intelligence sharing if they permit the use of Huawei equipment in their 5G networks. The United States claims that the Chinese government could use Huawei devices for spying, allegations the company has denied. European countries have not yet agreed to the US demands. The United Kingdom reportedly settled on a compromise approach last week that would ban products made by Huawei from "core" 5G infrastructure, but allow them in less sensitive parts of the network.EU officials have directed countries to complete 5G risk assessments, and conduct a wider security review by the end of December that will include steps to safeguard 5G networks.Telecoms companies, meanwhile, have been forced to walk a political tightrope.BT said in December that it would not buy Huawei equipment for the core of its 5G network, even though a top executive at the company later said he had seen no "cause for concern."Europe's biggest wireless provider Vodafone followed in January with an announcement that it would pause the installation of Huawei equipment in its core networks in Europe, given the political uncertainty surrounding the Chinese company.Issues in ItalyBloomberg reported Tuesday that Vodafone found "hidden backdoors" in Huawei software that could have given Huawei unauthorized access to one of its networks in Italy that provides internet service.Huawei's critics are likely to seize on the report as evidence that the company presents a security risk. Vodafone, however, quickly pushed back on the story. The company said in a statement that the issues were identified via routine security testing and resolved in 2011 and 2012. It said there was no evidence of any unauthorized access. Huawei said in a statement that the issues were addressed years ago. "Software vulnerabilities are an industry-wide challenge," a spokesperson said.For European companies inclined to stand by Huawei, it's another headache."[The] Vodafone claims could reopen many of the discussions that were archived as recently as last week," Talmesio said.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Hong Kong protests raise alarm special freedoms are fadingAssociated Press InternationalJune 26, 2019 Wednesday 2:07 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 1095 wordsByline: By ELAINE KURTENBACH, AP Business WriterDateline: HONG KONG BodyHONG KONG (AP) - China promised that for 50 years after Britain gave up control of its last colony, this shimmering financial enclave would get to keep freedoms absent in the communist-ruled mainland. Twenty-two years on, those are rights many here believe Hong Kong cannot live without.The hundreds of thousands who marched in a June 16 protest over a now-shelved extradition bill, and those still demonstrating, are raising alarm that Hong Kong may become just another Chinese city as those protections unravel and Beijing's influence in the territory expands.Activists are planning more protests for Wednesday, hoping to win attention and support from world leaders gathering in Osaka, Japan, for the Group of 20 summit later this week."This is not about a power struggle," said Bonnie Leung, a leader of the Civil Human Rights Front, one of a number of groups involved in organizing protests. "This is about the values that make the world a better place.""The whole world, whoever has connections with Hong Kong, would be stakeholders," she said.All of those involved - the territory's top official, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, the police, lawmakers, the protesters and the rest of Hong Kong - are caught up in tensions stemming from the "one country, two systems" colonial legacy that bequeathed a Western-style civic society under a political system controlled by Beijing.The protests erupted after Beijing-backed Lam tried to push through legislation that would have allowed some criminal suspects to be sent to face trial in Communist Party-dominated courts in mainland China. Many in Hong Kong viewed the bill as another step toward curbing protections they expect from their legal system.While they come from all walks of life, the protesters share a determination to preserve those freedoms, said Samson Yuen, a professor at Hong Kong's Lingnan University."This protest has drawn everybody in town together," he said. "They really value the freedom to speak up and protest."Jerome A. Cohen, a leading expert on Chinese law and government, said the extradition bill would have deprived local authorities of the right to prevent forcible transfers by China of suspects, including visitors, "for detention, trial and punishment that violate international standards of justice."The bill also would have enabled China to require Hong Kong authorities to freeze and confiscate assets of alleged suspects, Cohen wrote in a recent blog post. Efforts to limit the cases subject to extradition would not prevent suspects from being subject to China's "incommunicado torture chambers, its denial of competent legal defenders and its unfair trials."Most Hong Kong residents belong to families that fled poverty and political upheavals in the communist mainland. British rule did not bequeath them democracy, but it laid the foundations for strong civic institutions, schools, health care - as well as a laissez faire trading regime dominated by business leaders deeply invested in keeping Hong Kong as it is.Normally reluctant to wade into political matters or criticize Beijing, businesses also expressed concern over the extradition bill, with the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce noting that the protests reflected "serious apprehensions." The chamber welcomed the government's decision to suspend the bill, as did its American and British counterparts.It's unclear if the turnout for another big protest planned for the July 1 anniversary of Hong Kong's 1997 handover to Chinese control might match the earlier ones.Lam's push for the now stalled legislation, ill-timed around the 30th anniversary of the June 4, 1989, crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, and the tear gas, steel batons and other aggressive tactics used by police, especially in June 12 protests that turned violent, helped draw people young and old into the streets.Activists want an investigation into the complaints over police violence, along with Lam's resignation and other demands. But the continued protests reflect a deeper sense of grievance and unease, especially among Hong Kong residents coming of age in an era of declining economic opportunity, said Ken Courtis, chairman of Starfort Investment Holdings."Social mobility is more and more theoretical in Hong Kong, so young people continue to be very dissatisfied. There's a broader concern about China in Hong Kong. The economy's not growing like people thought it would grow," Courtis said.In many respects, Hong Kong faces the same sorts of challenges of other developed economies with aging populations and slowing growth.The city of 7 million has an economy that is bigger than Vietnam's and a per capita GDP of more than $46,000. But controls on land use favor property developers, and half the apartments available rent for $2,550 a month or more, while median monthly incomes are about $2,300.In a city dominated by business leaders and other elites, the only leverage protesters can wield is "the power of numbers," said Yuen, noting that surveys of those participating in protests in recent weeks generally identify with the city's "grassroots or lower classes.""They see themselves as lower class because of crony capitalism in Hong Kong. It's very hard for them to get a fine paying job and also to buy an apartment in Hong Kong," he said.Brian Chow, one of the protesters sitting in the sweltering heat on a recent day outside the city's Legislative Council building, said he wasn't the "type" to get involved in violence."I'll just carry on sitting here, sing some Christian hymns, show our resistance, keep the government paralyzed until it responds to us," he said.After protesters blocked lines in the tax and immigration offices downtown on Monday, the government issued a statement appealing to them to "act peacefully and rationally when expressing their opinions and not to affect those in need of government services."In her apologies over the extradition bill fiasco, Lam appealed for "another chance" and said she would focus on improving the economy and resolving the housing crisis.Chinese officials warned against "outside interference" but made a point of backing Lam's decision to sideline the proposal. At a time of severe trade friction with the U.S., Beijing's higher priority lies in preserving Hong Kong's status as a financial hub and free port, Courtis said."People in Beijing are pragmatic. They see time in terms of many years," he said. "Step sideways here, if that's not enough then step backwards. Now you focus on making the economy work and keeping people happy."Load-Date: June 26, 2019End of Document

Digital Cash is Here to Stay Saying Bye Bye Conventional Wallets; FN Media Group Presents Microsmallcap.com Market CommentaryPR NewswireMay 14, 2019 Tuesday 8:55 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1979 wordsDateline: NEW YORK, May 14, 2019 BodyPR NewswireFor decades, payments companies such asPayPal(NASDAQ:PYPL) and banks have overcharged consumers with expensive transaction and transfer fees. P2P payment giant Alipay, owned byAlibaba(NYSE: BABA)is free for smaller users but can grow to 1.2% depending on your transaction volume. But, even with Alipay, global transfers are restricted, tightly controlled and monitored by the Chinese government. Even with the new TransferWise service, consumers can't seem to escape processing fees. And it's not just traditional currencies that suffer from high transfer fees. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum charge steep fees when it comes to cashing out to fiat money.Riot Blockchain, Inc.(NASDAQ:RIOT) announced plans tolauncha regulated crypto exchange in the U.S., in the wake of a recentmassive rallyenjoyed by Crypto. Litelink Technologies Inc. (CSE:LLT) (OTC:LLNKF)'s wholly owned subsidiaryuBUCK Technologies SEZC is about to revolutionize the digital payments industry and allows consumers to earn rewards via an integration ofDatable Technology Corp.'s(TSX-V:DAC) (OTC:TTMZF) loyalty program.uBUCK could change the rules forever with the coming launch ofuBUCK Pay, the world's first worldwide decentralized online payments platform offering a stable token with a pin voucher solution that serves as a payment alternative for consumers, businesses and merchants. Users of uBUCK Pay will now be able to transfer uBUCK cash to friends, family, vendors and business associates around the world - all without paying a single penny in transfer fees.Worldwide money transfers are instantly processed in near real-time and are 100% free on this platform. This is essentially the holy grail of overseas transfers that countless people and multinational businesses around the world have been seeking since the dawn of globalization, and that new technologies such as cryptocurrencies could never truly deliver on.In fact, free worldwide money transfers makeLitelink Technologies Inc.'s (CSE:LLT) (OTCPK:LLNKF) uBUCK a game-changing platform with true disruptive potential. Catering to fiat and crypto, this platform is open to users across the spectrum.The company has just signed anagreementto integrate the loyalty and rewards program ofDatable Technology Corp.'s(TSX-V:DAC) (OTCPK:TTMZF)into the uBUCK Pay platform. This would effectively allow account holders of uBUCK Pay to earn rewards for every purchase and payment they make within the uBUCK Pay digital wallet or on their uBUCK Mastercard, another bonus to uBUCK's payment convenience.The beauty of this platform lies in the U.S. dollar backed stable tokens called uBUCK cash. Being a stable utility token makes it incredibly flexible and secure, allowing users to transfer funds worldwide, shop anywhere in the world and earn points while they're at it. Built on the decentralized, distributed ledger of therecord-breakingfast Waves blockchain platform, it enjoys the same security as Crypto but none of the volatility thanks to being a stable token.With uBUCK, you can shop with your virtual multi-currency wallet or a physical card. Users can use their uBUCK Black Elite Mastercard online or offline anywhere Mastercard is accepted. Such an offering easily beats out any and all payment competitors, including digital payments platforms such as cryptocurrencies, Alibaba's Alipay, Western Union, PayPal or PayPal subsidiary Venmo.Truly Disruptive FintechInternational fund transfers have always been difficult. Chinese digital wallets such as WeChat Pay orAlibaba(NYSE: BABA)'s Alipay payment service, are highly convenient - particularly within Mainland China and areas with a large Chinese diaspora. However, international transfers for Alipay are limited to 30,000RMB (USD $4,361), with a fee of 50RMB (USD $7.27) per transfer. WeChat has even stricter limits. In addition, only Chinese citizens are allowed to send money through the app-at least for now. Meanwhile,PayPal(NASDAQ:PYPL) charges $4.99 for international transfers plus another 2.9% plus 30 cents per transaction if funded by a credit or debit card. Paypal also charges 1% of the amount transferred, up to a $10 maximum for instant transfers with an eligible linked debit card.Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have held the promise of secure, cheap and quick transfers, but the bitcoin network is slow and their blockchain fees can get very expensive if there is congestion on the network. Cryptocurrency is notoriously difficult for fiat withdrawals given you have to go through the exchange like that being offered by RIOT Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT), which can take anywhere from four to fourteen days. With the recent rally in Crypto, users looking to cash out on their coins can simply purchase uBUCK cash and immediately convert it to U.S. dollars.Another problem with transferring money using cryptocurrencies is volatility. The value of the most popular cryptocurrency coins and tokens fluctuate wildly over time, as they are not asset-backed or stable tokens, and are traded primarily by speculators on digital currency exchanges. Unlike cryptocurrencies, uBUCK is not mineable or tradeable, and its value is backed by the U.S. dollar through pin voucher sales. When users buy uBUCK vouchers, the funds are held in trust, until the user wishes to load their uBUCK Mastercard. uBUCK, therefore, will never fluctuate in price.Loyalty Rewards to Sweeten an Already Sweet DealWith uBUCK's newest strategic partnership with Datable, the potential market exposure of uBUCK will increase a thousand-fold. Considered the top rewards platform on the market, Datable currently features over 30 brands such as Universal, General Mills, Unilever, and Toro. Under the terms of the latest letter of intent with Datable, the uBUCK prepaid cash card will be featured as a reward for consumers to purchase with their points inside every one of Datable's client portals.As uBUCK charges a transaction fee for each purchase, Datable will be sharing the revenue from these transaction fees and card sales. Meanwhile, Datable's referrals will allow uBUCK to potentially gain access to millions of new users who frequent their portals.The introduction of Datable's customer loyalty and rewards program both encourages adoption and fulfills a key marketing function - introducing the tokens to the market via a rewards program they are familiar with. According to Reuters,80%of Americans already belong to some type of loyalty rewards program, with U.S. consumers holding a whopping3.8 billionmemberships in customer loyalty programs.It's clear that rewards programs have become an incredibly popular feature for even new tech brands, as they offer a loyalty incentive for customers to continue using the service, while consumers and shoppers receive a value-added bonus for something they were already going to do.PayTM's digital wallet has been largely successful due to its customer rewards program.  The company is raising up to USD $2 billion at an $18 billion valuation. The fact that loyalty programs continue to grow despite having been around for so long shows that these systems are demonstrably effective, and can have a significant impact on the bottom line.Litelink Technologies Inc.'s (LLT- LLNKF)uBUCK platform stands to absorb a potential influx of new customers upon its launch. It's also something that other digital payment platforms have never offered, which is why loyalty rewards should giveuBUCKTechnologies SEZC the clear edge in the fight to become a dominant player in the P2P digital payment space.For aFREE research reportonLiteLink Technologies Inc.

What do experts recommend for Huawei users affected by Google measures?CE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 22, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 663 wordsBody Many are the reactions that have occurred on the cancellation of the business of the US firm Google with China Huawei due to the trade war between these two countries.  Due to lack of information and an official pronouncement from the companies involved, many users fear that their cell phones become obsolete, which is why other brands have taken the opportunity to criticize the P30 Series .  Theory approved by experts such as Diego Santos, co-director of 242 Media, who assured that if these measures come into force "people should think about changing cell phones" since the firm would be isolated.  On the other hand, Alejandro Cool, director of the Wobi-mob laboratory, said that there was no need to panic, but that it is necessary for Huawei to make a statement, explain to its users what is happening and that they will not be affected.  Likewise, Leonardo Gómez, a professor of digital media research, said that it would be necessary to analyze how quickly Huawei can react because "it is not only about creating a new operating system, since Huawei has all the capacity to create it, but also that Application developers start designing them to be supported on this new platform. "  He also highlighted the attempts of other companies that have not been successful as is the case of Windows Phone and BlackBerry, so "we must wait to see how this is resolved." Santiago Roldán, technology expert: restrictions may be partial Santiago Roldán said that Huawei users should verify if the cell phone is open to make manual updates and be aware of the equipment's guarantee, because if they do not agree with it they could return it. He also stressed that "the restrictions are not in all the countries of Latin America, so do not panic, but if you buy a new Huawei equipment, you should be aware that it will come with possible restrictions." Daniel Tovar, technology expert: Huawei will not fall for the United States Huawei has always been a company known for its innovation, as it launched a Kirin processor, when the market was led by Qualcomm and implemented Leica cameras when most had Sony, so the risk is "that Google loses the market that represents this and other Chinese companies like Honor and Xiaomi. " He also assured that in the medium term they should get an Operating System, because "the second company that sells the most phones will not be allowed to end up in the US". Diego Santos, co-director of 242 Media: This will generate a desertion Not all technology or telecommunications experts have been positive about the situation of Huawei, Diego Santos said that this "is a cold water for these users. We will have to see how the company avoids this obstacle, but I think there will be a desertion to other devices, because I do not see how Huawei can get away with this "and stressed that it is still unclear which features will continue and which will stop operating Gustavo Ramírez, professor U. Javeriana: Other brands that could be affected While the veto began with Huawei, "the sanction is aimed at companies that collaborate with the Chinese government, but the law of that country requires that all do so, so that other brands such as Honor and Xiaomi can be affected," said Ramírez. In addition, the government can retaliate with those that would affect companies that have their assembly in this countrylike Apple, "for now the only benefit is Samsung because it has nothing to do with them," he added. Alejandro Cool, director of the Wobi-mob laboratory: Disinformation and its effects Google's veto of Huawei, as well as misinformation have generated panic among its users, a situation that has been taken advantage of by ambassadors of other brands that launched attacks against the P30 Series. All this could drastically reduce the sales of the company so it is "necessary to pronounce, give a piece of peace and explain to your users what is happening and how they will not be affected in any way by the actions of the United States" . Load-Date: May 22, 2019End of Document

HEINRICH SECURES MAJOR GAINS FOR N.M. MILITARY INSTALLATIONS, NATIONAL LABS, AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN ANNUAL DEFENSE SPENDING BILLStates News ServiceMay 24, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 6001 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by New Mexico Senator Martin Heinrich:Heinrich amendments to strengthen national security and New Mexico's economy clear Senate Armed Services CommitteeFriday, May 24, 2019WASHINGTON, D.C. Today, U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Ranking Member of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, and co-founder of the Senate Artificial Intelligence Caucus, announced provisions he secured in the fiscal year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that support New Mexico's men and women in uniform, military installations, national laboratories, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), Artificial Intelligence, and job-creating initiatives throughout the state. The Senate Armed Services Committee voted to advance this important legislation to the Senate floor."The people of New Mexico make tremendous contributions to our national security and work at the forefront of cutting-edge research and development in the defense industry,"said Heinrich. "This bipartisan bill supports our servicemembers and their families, and includes provisions I fought for to strengthen New Mexico's military installations, national laboratories, Spaceport America, economic development, and leadership in the future of technologies like Artificial Intelligence, directed energy, and space. I am proud to have authorized funding for military construction projects that will modernize infrastructure at Holloman Air Force Base, White Sands Missile Range and Kirtland Air Force Base. This bill makes major investments to ensure our Armed Forces are equipped with the most modern technology so we can stay ahead of our adversaries. New Mexico is the Center of Excellence for small satellites and for directed energy weapons, and this bill increases funding and streamlines authorities to bolster those missions. I am also proud to have incorporated language from the Armed Forces Digital Advantage Act to modernize defense workforces with digital engineers, specialized in computer science, and to have increased funding for Artificial Intelligence. This bill also makes major reforms to fix the military housing crisis and takes meaningful action on contamination at dairies outside Cannon Air Force Base. These provisions, among many others, help New Mexico families, benefit our economy, and further New Mexico's strong position as a leader in national security for years to come."The NDAA sets the Department of Defense spending levels and policies for the upcoming fiscal year and authorizes funding for the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons programs at Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories, as well as the Department of Energy's environmental cleanup programs including the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP).A list of many of the programs and provisions Senator Heinrich advocated for during the bill writing process that were included in the FY20 NDAA is available as a PDF HERE and below.New Mexico Military Construction ProjectsKirtland Air Force BaseSenator Heinrich secured $15.5 million for the construction of a Combat Rescue Helicopter Simulator Facility at Kirtland Air Force Base. This facility will house new HH-60W simulators, training spaces, and equipment used by the 58th Special Operations Wing to train new students. This construction will allow for a seamless transition from the HH-60G legacy aircraft, to the new HH-60W and provide continuous Programmed Flight Training for its operators.Senator Heinrich secured $22.4 million for the construction of a UH-1 Replacement Facility at Kirtland Air Force Base. This facility will house new simulators used for training flight crew personnel in the UH-1 replacement aircraft set for delivery to the 58th Special Operations Wing starting at the end of FY 2022. This construction will allow for an on-time delivery of the simulators, and critical training in the new aircraft.Holloman Air Force BaseSenator Heinrich secured $20 million for the construction of a climate-controlled, storage and shipment facility at Holloman Air Force Base. The facility will be used to store, inspect, and prepare the movement of military support equipment and provide maximum protection of our expeditionary, warfighting resources. This will enable assets to be maintained in a constant state of readiness and postured for worldwide deployment with greatly reduced maintenance costs. The use of this facility will save the government $800,000 annually for the maintenance and/or replacement of these assets by preserving the shelf-life of items otherwise stored in the open; as well as save $120,000 a year in replacement costs of shipping containers damaged by exposure to weather.White Sands Missile Range (WSMR)Senator Heinrich secured $5.8 million to build a micro-grid at White Sands. The micro-grid will utilize a solar array, natural gas generator, and lithium ion battery system to power water wells to provide an uninterrupted water supply to WSMR. Currently, the wells are connected in such a way that leaves them susceptible to power outages that could leave WSMR without drinkable potable water. This micro-grid system will ensure a reliable supply of water for the installation.White Sands Missile Range Land Enhancements and White Sands National ParkThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that incorporates legislation to, amongst other things, finalize updated land exchanges between the Department of the Interior and the Department of the Army that have been pending since the 1970s. The exchange of parcels between White Sands National Monument and White Sands Missile Range will clean up boundary anomalies, transfer important missile range infrastructure to the jurisdiction of the Army, and provide increased opportunities for visitors at the National Monument. The bill was developed in close consultation with the Army, the Air Force, the National Park Service, local elected officials, neighboring tribes, and local residents.New Mexico Air National GuardThe Senate Armed Services Committee included language that requests the Secretary of the Air Force, in consultation with the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, to report back to the committee within 60 days to present options for achieving an operational flying mission in states currently without ownership of aircraft.New Mexico is one of three states New Mexico, Virginia, and Washington that have an operational flying mission, but due to the classic associate construct they lack ownership of aircraft. The Air National Guard enterprise is based on established Capstone Principles that notionally set the foundational framework for mission allocation in the 54 states and territories. One of those Capstone Principles is to allocate at least one unit-equipped wing and flying squadron to each state.The New Mexico congressional delegation is dedicated to working with the Air Force and the National Guard Bureau to ensure a unit-equipped flying squadron for the New Mexico Air National Guard (NMANG). New Mexico's outstanding flying weather, airspace and ranges around Kirtland Air Force Base (KAFB) offer excellent training capabilities. KAFB's location in central New Mexico allows for important co-training opportunities with Cannon and Holloman Air Force Bases, White Sands Missile Range, and Fort Bliss, Texas. Having hosted aircraft for decades, appropriate infrastructure such as runways and hangars are already in place that can save taxpayer dollars and accommodate additional aircraft.New Mexico's National Laboratories and WIPPLos Alamos National Laboratory's Plutonium MissionSenator Heinrich again supported full funding to secure Los Alamos National Laboratory's (LANL) role as the nation's Center of Excellence for Plutonium Research. The bill authorizes $551 million for LANL's ongoing plutonium research and pit production programs. The funding supports personnel, equipment and other activities at LANL to meet pit production requirements by 2026; highlights include, $232 million for plutonium operations, $21 million to support pit production, $10.5 million for fire suppression upgrades in PF-4, $16 million for power and communications improvements and $168 million for construction related to replacing the outdated Chemistry and Metallurgy Research (CMR) building at LANL.Senator Heinrich included a provision in last year's NDAA directing the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to contract for an independent review of the National Nuclear Security Administration's (NNSA) preferred plutonium strategy. The assessment released last month concluded that a key milestone will be achieving the goal of producing 30 plutonium pits per year at LANL by 2026. However, the assessment found DoD's requirement of 80 pits per year was unlikely to be met on NNSA's currently planned schedule or budget. In response, during committee markup Senator Heinrich secured another amendment requiring DoD to provide by December the administration's formal response to the potential requirement shortfall and options to mitigate the risk of further delays.Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety BoardDuring committee markup, Senator Heinrich secured an amendment directing the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to review the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) new order 140.1 that governs the interface of the DOE with the independent Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB). Congress created the DNFSB in 1988 to provide oversight of public health and safety at the defense nuclear facilities managed by the Department of Energy, including Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratory and Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. The DNFSB is concerned that the new order 140.1 could limit the board's oversight of DOE's facilities. The Department of Energy issued Order 140.1 without consultation with the DNFSB or with the local communities most impacted by the department's defense nuclear facilities. The board expressed its concerns in letters to the Secretary of Energy and held a public hearing this year in Albuquerque to gather information on the order's implementation by DOE. The GAO's review shall be provided to Congress by March 2020.National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD)Senator Heinrich successfully passed an amendment with unanimous support to permanently remove the overhead burden on NNSA labs for LDRD that currently double-taxes Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory. LDRD is a strategic research and development program that is critical to maintaining the scientific vitality of the national laboratories. In 2016, Congress suspended the overhead burden on the labs' LDRD for three years. Senator Heinrich's amendment this year permanently eliminates it for all NNSA nuclear laboratories and facilities.National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Employee Recruitment and RetentionThe bill again includes a provision to make permanent NNSA's personnel management system that has been used successfully on a trial basis for over 10 years. Senator Heinrich secured this provision last year in the defense bill, but it was not included in the final conference report. The temporary personnel system has enhanced the recruitment and retention of federal employees of the Department of Energy's NNSA. NNSA needs to attract highly technical employees to manage critical national security programs, including about 800 based in New Mexico. Key advantages of NNSA's personnel system include helping attract and retain top talent by offering competitive salaries, reducing attrition rates, and properly rewarding high-performing employees.National Laboratory FundingSenator Heinrich supported full funding authorization for the National Nuclear Security Administration's (NNSA) nuclear weapons programs. Within NNSA's funding, Senator Heinrich secured full funding of $2.1 billion to continue the Life Extension Programs supported by Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories. This increase of $197 million over FY19 will maintain the existing weapons stockpile and assure safety and security.For fiscal year 2020, the bill authorizes funding from NNSA of $1.99 billion for Sandia National Laboratories, an increase of $110 million over fiscal year 2019. For Los Alamos National Laboratory, the bill authorizes funding of $1.97 billion, up from $1.89 billion in fiscal year 2019.Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Environmental CleanupThe bill authorizes $195.5 million for soil and water remediation and removal of radioactive waste. Funding is included again this year to address the hexavalent chromium and Royal Demolition eXplosive (RDX) plumes in groundwater in Los Alamos.Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP)The bill authorizes full funding of $398 million to operate the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), including $17.5 million to repair and replace degraded facility structures, systems, and components, $58 million to continue construction of additional ventilation for the mine and $34.5 million for a new utility shaft.New Mexico's Defense RandD Labs, Test Ranges, and IndustryU.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Mentor-Protege ProgramThe Defense Small Business Advancement Act of 2019The Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that incorporates S. 1320, the Defense Small Business Advancement Act. Senators Heinrich and Joni Ernst's (R-Iowa) bill language would permanently authorize the DoD's Mentor Protege Program (MPP), which is the oldest continuously operating federal mentor-protege program in existence, but expired last year. Originally established in 1991, the MPP helps eligible small businesses expand their footprint in the defense industrial base. Under the MPP, small businesses are partnered with larger companies. In the past five years, DoD's MPP has successfully helped more than 190 small businesses fill unique niches and become part of the military's supply chain. Senator Heinrich ensured the survival of the MPP when it faced expiration, and salvaged this influential, small-business focused program.Directed Energy Test Range WorkloadsSenator Heinrich secured $15 million for White Sands Missile Range in order to accommodate the increase in directed energy testing workloads to accommodate the increased demand in the 21st century. A lack of funding for increased directed energy testing is a serious issue; especially, given the workload and number of directed energy demonstrations and exercises have increased significantly since 1975. The projected workload for fiscal years 20182022 for the High Energy Laser Systems Test Facility at White Sands is large and growing, and has expanded to include high-powered microwave testing. Yet, funding remained at the same level. Senator Heinrich secured the funds necessary to meet the growing demand and support the appropriate test workloads.High-Powered Microwave ResearchIn this year's NDAA, Senator Heinrich capitalized on the newly enacted authorities allowing the Joint Directed Energy Transition Office (JDETO) to conduct high-powered microwave research. Senator Heinrich successfully secured an increase of $5 million for JDETO to allow for needed basic research at the university level, and focus applied research efforts into the joint development of an effects database, common high-power radio frequency models, and predictive capabilities for the high-powered microwave technology capabilities. Senator Heinrich's efforts bring attention to the shift in the JDETO's responsibility to help oversee the development and transition of directed energy weapons systems from the laboratories to the battlefield.High-Powered Microwave Test Range AssetThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich which supports the Air Force's development of an enduring testing and evaluation capability for high powered microwaves (HPM). The committee noted that such an asset at our nation's test ranges would support the transitioning of new and game changing directed energy technologies to the warfighter. Doing so would also help the military services develop the doctrine and concepts of operation that will bring these technologies to operational use. Currently, an enduring-frequency, agile, and tunable HPM asset is not available for evolving doctrine and HPM Directed Energy Concept of Operations at Major Range and Test Facility Bases.Missile Defense Agency's Low Power Laser DemonstratorThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich expressing the committee's support for the Missile Defense Agency's (MDA) Low-Power Laser Demonstrator (LPLD) program. The language secured expresses continued support for LPLD for the development of a boost-phase missile intercept capability and multiple other applications and capabilities, and could be adapted to be an effective countermeasure against other threats, including cruise, surface-to-air, air-to-air, and hypersonic missiles. The language requests the DoD's plans for the flight test program for the LPLD project including:The expected date that operational airborne tests of the LPLD will begin;The expected required number of flight tests and expected cadence of flight tests that the LPLD project will require, and;A comprehensive description of the DoD's planned locations to conduct LPLD flights and tests, including a cost-benefit analysis for each location and an analysis of each location's suitability for the flight platforms anticipated to participate in the project.3-D Printed Electronics Army Innovation Hub for Next Generation Additive ManufacturingSenator Heinrich secured an additional $2 million for additive manufacturing (AM), which is already making innovative technological leaps that could yield major advances in more lethal and longer-ranged fires. New Mexico Tech and University of Texas at El Paso are leading entities in 3-D printing. This technology can combine existing and new materials into 3-D printed circuit architectures, producing smarter, lighter, and denser constructs to enable projectiles to double current ranges while achieving higher precision.Hypersonics Prototyping and ProductionThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that encourages the Department of Defense (DoD) to utilize the technical and scientific expertise at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) necessary for the development of prototypes and to assist commercial industry in manufacturing.The language recognizes the enormous contributions that SNL has made in the area of hypersonics. For over 30 years, SNL has emerged as the center of excellence for the prototyping and testing of hypersonic vehicles. SNL houses the most experienced scientists and engineers in the development of this technology, utilizing their hypersonic wind tunnel, and advanced laser diagnostic technology. Over seven years ago, Sandia conducted a successful flight test of the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon (AHW) concept for the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command. This first-of-its-kind vehicle utilized a three-stage booster system and hypersonic glide vehicle. This test propelled SNL with data on hypersonic boost-glide technologies and test range performance for long-range atmospheric flight with emphasis on aerodynamics, navigation, guidance and control, and thermal protection technologies.The language also notes that the technical expertise at SNL and the laboratory has been, and will continue to be, instrumental to the development and eventual production of hypersonics. The language encourages DoD to utilize the technical and scientific expertise at labs, including SNL, necessary for the development of prototypes and to assist commercial industry in manufacturing.Navy Laser Weapon System Integration on ShipsThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that directs the Secretary of the U.S. Navy to provide a briefing to the committee no later than October 1, 2019, describing the path forward for shipboard integration of High Energy Laser (HEL) systems, and the risk reduction plan to achieve improved technology and manufacturing readiness levels for such higher power systems. The committee also directs the Navy to provide briefings on the progress of laser systems development and testing every six months through fiscal year 2021.The Navy has rapidly demonstrated laser weapon systems on surface ships. In 2014, the Navy deployed a 30 kilowatt (kW) Laser Weapon System (LaWS) on USS Ponce, which will be followed by a 150 kW LaWS on USS Portland (LPD-27) planned for 2019. The Navy also plans to integrate the 60 kW High Energy Laser and Integrated Optical-dazzler with Surveillance (HELIOS) program into Arleigh Burke-class destroyers beginning in 2021.If successful, there may be additional opportunities to integrate HEL systems on large capital ships, including aircraft carriers and large amphibious ships, to increase the defensive capabilities and lethality of our carrier strike groups and expeditionary forces. There may also be broader applications of laser weapons for providing capability for fleet air defense from more Navy vessels.STARBASESenator Heinrich secured an additional $15 million for the STARBASE program. This program is meant to improve the knowledge and skills of students in kindergarten through 12th grade in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subjects, to connect them to the military, and to motivate them to explore STEM and possible military careers as they continue their education. STARBASE is a highly effective program run by our dedicated servicemembers and strengthens the relationships between the military, communities, and local school districts. The program allows students to participate in a 25-hour hands-on curriculum where they solve scientific challenges related to aerospace. Students learn the importance of STEM skills in real world situations and develop essential math and science fundamentals, while fostering positive relationships between military bases and their surrounding communities. STARBASE currently operates at 76 locations in 40 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, primarily on military installations. New Mexico is one of those locations. Since its inception in 1991, over 825,000 students have benefitted from the STARBASE program, including 45,000 last year.5th Generation Spectrum SharingAs a member of the Cybersecurity Subcommittee, Senator Heinrich supported an increase in $25 million to support U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) spectrum sharing and to allow for full utilization of the 5th Generation (5G) network. The 5G wireless network is the foundation for future economic growth, and will have a vital impact on national security. As such, this funding will prepare DoD to use dynamic spectrum sharing technologies that will lead to more efficient and effective use of the 5G and future wireless networks.New Mexico Space MissionsDepartment of Defense Launch Support and Infrastructure Program for Small-Class and Medium-Class PayloadsThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that authorizes the Secretary of Defense to carry out a program to enhance infrastructure and improve support activities for the processing and launch of Department of Defense (DoD) small-class and medium-class payloads. The language would establish a program and plan which would include how the Secretary intends to:Invest in infrastructure to improve operations at ranges and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-licensed spaceports consistent with usage by the DoD;Take measures to normalize processes, systems, and products across ranges and spaceports to minimize burden on launch providers; andImprove transparency, flexibility, and responsiveness for launch scheduling, factoring in proximity to, and quantity of, existing commercial airline flight patterns.The provision would require the Secretary to submit to the congressional defense committees, not later than 270 days after the enactment of this Act, a report on the plan for such a program.Spaceport America in New Mexico is a licensed inland spaceport that provides surface-to-space open sky launches landing in restricted flight zones. The New Mexico Spaceport is located next to White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) where the DoD controls the only restricted air space in the country besides the White House.Space Sensor LayerIn an effort to develop a reliable defense against cruise missiles and hypersonic weapons, Senator Heinrich and Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) added $108 million for a space sensor layer that will help correlate data and track the incoming target for intercept. Senator Heinrich crafted language to help prioritize this capability gap and increased funding.Tactically Responsive Space Launch Operations PlanThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that requires a plan from the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)for tactical responsive launch. The language directs the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, to develop a plan to leverage and analyze commercial space launch capabilities and to integrate these capabilities into DoD space operations. The language also requires the Secretary to provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees not later than March 1, 2020, on such plan.Space Rapid Capabilities Office (Sp-RCO)The Senate Armed Services Committee authorized $18.88 million for the Space Rapid Capabilities Office (Sp-RCO) which is housed at Kirtland AFB. As Ranking Member of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, Senator Heinrich has fought to ensure New Mexico remains the small satellite center of excellence for the military. Senator Heinrich recently announced plans for the establishment of additional classified workspace, near Sp-RCO, that can be used by potential commercial partners to facilitate the rapid fielding of new space capabilities.Space Test Program (STP)The Senate Armed Services Committee authorized $26.09 million for the Space Test Program (STP) which is housed at Kirtland Air Force Base. As Ranking Member of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, Senator Heinrich has fought to ensure New Mexico remains the small satellite center of excellence for the military. Senator Heinrich has strongly supported STP's mission to secure launches for experimental spacecraft from emerging entrants including Rocket Lab or Vox Space that are smaller and far less expensive than traditional military satellites that are launched aboard larger rockets under the National Security Space Launch program. Senator Heinrich included provisions elsewhere in the mark to establish a program to improve infrastructure and launch support at FAA licensed spaceports. Since 1965, the STP has conducted space test missions for the purpose of accelerating Department of Defense space technology transformation while lowering developmental risk.Rocket Systems Launch ProgramThe Senate Armed Services Committee authorized $13.19 million for the Rocket Systems Launch Program (RSLP) which is housed at Kirtland Air Force Base. As Ranking Member of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, Senator Heinrich has fought to ensure New Mexico remains the small satellite center of excellence for the military. Senator Heinrich supports the Rapid Agile Launch Initiative which seeks to award launch service agreements with non-traditional, venture-class companies.China Space Industrial Base StudyThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that directs the Secretary of Defense to provide, not later than March 15, 2020, a briefing on the current state of the small satellite and small launch industry in China, to include an assessment of the role of Chinese government support in the growth of these companies and a set of recommended steps and investments the Secretary should take to ensure the Department of Defense has long-term access to world-leading small satellite and small launch technologies and capabilities from U.S. companies.Artificial IntelligenceArmed Forces Digital Advantage ActThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that incorporated language introduced on May 15, 2019, the Armed Forces Digital Advantage Act (S. 1471), which emphasizes digital engineering as a core competency of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and establishes a career track for computer scientists in the military. This effort would modernize the DoD workforce by adding a recruitment focus and establishing military career tracks for digital engineering that will provide incentives for service members to specialize in computer science and have accelerated promotion tracks. The language requires a Chief Digital Engineering Recruitment and Management Officer and a plan for each Service to establish new career tracks.As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly prioritized, computer coding skills should be treated similarly to mission-critical foreign language skills. In addition to building a younger generation of AI experts, this Act creates an avenue for educating mid-to-senior level leaders and policy makers about the importance of data. With mid-to-senior level leadership trained in AI and an appreciation for how data underlies AI, we have every opportunity to get ahead.Artificial Intelligence Commercial SolutionsThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that secured $7.5 million specifically for accelerating commercial AI solutions. The committee noted the importance of accelerating AI applications in support of the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center's (JAIC) National Mission Initiatives, including disaster response and predictive maintenance. Heinrich's language supports the use of commercial AI solutions and urges the Defense Innovation Unit to coordinate with the JAIC to identify problem sets facing the Department and to seek commercial AI solutions.U.S. Department of Defense Artificial Intelligence Investment InventoryThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich directing the Comptroller to brief the defense committees by September 1, 2019 on the total complement of artificial intelligence (AI) investments, to include PE and line numbers amounts with sufficient detail and description of those investments. Senator Heinrich is co-founder of the Senate Artificial Intelligence Caucus and believes it is important that the Department of Defense (DoD) have accurate insight to the nature and extent of investments in AI.National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence Extension of AuthorityThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that extends the duration of the current Artificial Intelligence Commission in order to account for time lost due to the government shutdown.New Mexico Military Housing Reform and Contamination Clean-UpMilitary Housing ReformThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that establishes a uniform code of basic housing standards and requires inspections to ensure compliance. This uniform code provides for safety, comfort, and habitability for military housing units and ensures the inspection of such units adhere to this standard. This is a critical step in addressing the problems associated with military housing around the world and ensuring our warfighters live in the healthy dwellings they deserve.The Senate Armed Services Committee NDAA takes other meaningful steps to address serious issues with the Military Housing Privatization Initiative, including: creating a Tenant Bill of Rights, setting up a dispute resolution process, and increasing oversight Holding private military housing companies accountable by instating new quality assurance and quality control measures and increasing health and hazard inspections Strengthening management of military housing by providing an additional $301.8 million to ensure each installation has the necessary government housing personnel to implement thorough oversight and planning measures.Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) Contamination CleanupThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich to address Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) contamination at Cannon Air Force Base. As a result of contamination, New Mexico dairy farmers' livelihoods are threatened. The contamination was caused by the U.S. Air Force, but the Air Force has not yet addressed immediate needs for filtration or long-term remediation. The legislative language provides the appropriate authorities to enable the Air Force to take action.Senator Heinrich also fought for the continued funding of the ongoing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention human health study on PFAS in drinking water. Heinrich secured an additional $10 million to the President's Budget to demonstrate and validate the most promising innovative technologies that can meet the U.S. Department of Defense's most urgent requirements, provide a return on investment, and are executed through a free and open competition. This funding helps ensure the safety and welfare of service members and their dependents by eliminating or reducing the generation of pollution and use of hazardous materials and reducing the cost of remedial actions and compliance with environmental laws and regulations, specifically as it relates to per- and polyfluoroakyl substances; develop, demonstrate, validate, and field fluorine-free firefighting foam; and long-term environmental threats to sustain training and testing ranges.New Mexico Military Energy ResilienceMilitary Environmental Research ProgramsThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich and Senator Angus King (I-Maine) that would direct $10 million for development and demonstration of long-duration, on-site battery storage for distributed energy applications, $10 million for development, demonstration and validation of secure microgrids for both installations and forward operating bases, $10 million for development, demonstration, and validation of non-fluorine based firefighting foam and $5 million for development, demonstration, and validation of technologies that can harvest potable water from air.U.S. Department of Defense Energy Siting ClearinghouseSenator Heinrich strongly supported a bipartisan amendment adopted in committee that eliminated a provision proposed by the chairman that would have severely restricted the siting of wind farms in any area with military aircraft training and operations. The proposed provision was clearly not needed given that nearly all of New Mexico's existing wind farms are sited in these areas without harm to military operations or training. Any possible impacts from wind turbines on military and civilian aviation have always been successfully resolved through the U.S. Department of Defense's energy clearinghouse and Federal Aviation Administration's aeronautical study process. If it hadn't been eliminated, the proposal would have restricted New Mexico's ability to develop additional wind generation on federal, state and private land just as the state is transitioning to clean energy technologies.Aerospace Technology Development/DemonstrationSenator Heinrich secured an additional $5 million to fund the design and manufacturing of aircraft active winglets and aft body drag reduction devices, as well as high pressure compressor blade coatings that have demonstrated reduced drag, shown fuel savings, and decreased maintenance requirements. These small fins adhere to each side of the C-17's aft fuselage to reduce drag and have shown a 1.2 percent reduction in fuel burn at cruise. This results in a cost savings of about $10 million each year for the 40+ years of the fleet.Load-Date: May 25, 2019End of Document

HEINRICH SECURES MAJOR WINS FOR N.M. IN ANNUAL DEFENSE SPENDING BILLStates News ServiceJune 27, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 5802 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by New Mexico Senator Martin Heinrich:Today, U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) voted to pass the fiscal year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that supports New Mexico's men and women in uniform, military installations, national laboratories, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), Artificial Intelligence, and job-creating initiatives throughout the state. The legislation passed the Senate by a vote of 86-8. Heinrich, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Ranking Member of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, secured a number of provisions to strengthen New Mexico's military installations, national laboratories, economic development, and leadership in the future of technologies like Artificial Intelligence, directed energy, and space. "I am proud to have authorized funding for military construction projects that will modernize infrastructure at Holloman Air Force Base, White Sands Missile Range, and Kirtland Air Force Base," said Heinrich. "This bill makes major investments to ensure our Armed Forces are equipped with the most modern technology so we can stay ahead of our adversaries. New Mexico is the Center of Excellence for small satellites and for directed energy weapons, and this bill increases funding and streamlines authorities to bolster those missions. This bill also makes major reforms to fix the military housing crisis and takes meaningful action on contamination at dairies outside Cannon Air Force Base." As the co-founder of the Senate Artificial Intelligence Caucus, Heinrich added, "I am also proud to have incorporated language from the Armed Forces Digital Advantage Act to modernize defense workforces with digital engineers, specialized in computer science, and to have increased funding for Artificial Intelligence. These provisions, among many others, help New Mexico families, benefit our economy, and further New Mexico's strong position as a leader in national security for years to come." The NDAA sets the Department of Defense spending levels and policies for the upcoming fiscal year and authorizes funding for the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons programs at Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories, as well as the Department of Energy's environmental cleanup programs including the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). A list of many of the programs and provisions Senator Heinrich advocated for during the bill writing process that were included in the FY20 NDAA is available as a PDF HERE and below. New Mexico Military Construction Projects Kirtland Air Force Base Senator Heinrich secured $15.5 million for the construction of a Combat Rescue Helicopter Simulator Facility at Kirtland Air Force Base. This facility will house new HH-60W simulators, training spaces, and equipment used by the 58th Special Operations Wing to train new students. This construction will allow for a seamless transition from the HH-60G legacy aircraft, to the new HH-60W and provide continuous Programmed Flight Training for its operators. Senator Heinrich secured $22.4 million for the construction of a UH-1 Replacement Facility at Kirtland Air Force Base. This facility will house new simulators used for training flight crew personnel in the UH-1 replacement aircraft set for delivery to the 58th Special Operations Wing starting at the end of FY 2022. This construction will allow for an on-time delivery of the simulators, and critical training in the new aircraft. Holloman Air Force Base Senator Heinrich secured $20 million for the construction of a climate-controlled, storage and shipment facility at Holloman Air Force Base. The facility will be used to store, inspect, and prepare the movement of military support equipment and provide maximum protection of our expeditionary, warfighting resources. This will enable assets to be maintained in a constant state of readiness and postured for worldwide deployment with greatly reduced maintenance costs. The use of this facility will save the government $800,000 annually for the maintenance and/or replacement of these assets by preserving the shelf-life of items otherwise stored in the open; as well as save $120,000 a year in replacement costs of shipping containers damaged by exposure to weather. White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) Senator Heinrich secured $5.8 million to build a micro-grid at White Sands. The micro-grid will utilize a solar array, natural gas generator, and lithium ion battery system to power water wells to provide an uninterrupted water supply to WSMR. Currently, the wells are connected in such a way that leaves them susceptible to power outages that could leave WSMR without drinkable potable water. This micro-grid system will ensure a reliable supply of water for the installation. White Sands Missile Range Land Enhancements and White Sands National Park The Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that incorporates legislation to, amongst other things, finalize updated land exchanges between the Department of the Interior and the Department of the Army that have been pending since the 1970s. The exchange of parcels between White Sands National Monument and White Sands Missile Range will clean up boundary anomalies, transfer important missile range infrastructure to the jurisdiction of the Army, and provide increased opportunities for visitors at the National Monument. The bill was developed in close consultation with the Army, the Air Force, the National Park Service, local elected officials, neighboring tribes, and local residents. New Mexico Air National Guard The Senate Armed Services Committee included language that requests the Secretary of the Air Force, in consultation with the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, to report back to the committee within 60 days to present options for achieving an operational flying mission in states currently without ownership of aircraft. New Mexico is one of three states New Mexico, Virginia, and Washington that have an operational flying mission, but due to the classic associate construct they lack ownership of aircraft. The Air National Guard enterprise is based on established Capstone Principles that notionally set the foundational framework for mission allocation in the 54 states and territories. One of those Capstone Principles is to allocate at least one unit-equipped wing and flying squadron to each state. The New Mexico congressional delegation is dedicated to working with the Air Force and the National Guard Bureau to ensure a unit-equipped flying squadron for the New Mexico Air National Guard (NMANG). New Mexico's outstanding flying weather, airspace and ranges around Kirtland Air Force Base (KAFB) offer excellent training capabilities. KAFB's location in central New Mexico allows for important co-training opportunities with Cannon and Holloman Air Force Bases, White Sands Missile Range, and Fort Bliss, Texas. Having hosted aircraft for decades, appropriate infrastructure such as runways and hangars are already in place that can save taxpayer dollars and accommodate additional aircraft. New Mexico's National Laboratories and WIPP Los Alamos National Laboratory's Plutonium Mission Senator Heinrich again supported full funding to secure Los Alamos National Laboratory's (LANL) role as the nation's Center of Excellence for Plutonium Research. The bill authorizes $551 million for LANL's ongoing plutonium research and pit production programs. The funding supports personnel, equipment and other activities at LANL to meet pit production requirements by 2026; highlights include, $232 million for plutonium operations, $21 million to support pit production, $10.5 million for fire suppression upgrades in PF-4, $16 million for power and communications improvements and $168 million for construction related to replacing the outdated Chemistry and Metallurgy Research (CMR) building at LANL. Senator Heinrich included a provision in last year's NDAA directing the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to contract for an independent review of the National Nuclear Security Administration's (NNSA) preferred plutonium strategy. The assessment released last month concluded that a key milestone will be achieving the goal of producing 30 plutonium pits per year at LANL by 2026. However, the assessment found DoD's requirement of 80 pits per year was unlikely to be met on NNSA's currently planned schedule or budget. In response, during committee markup Senator Heinrich secured another amendment requiring DoD to provide by December the administration's formal response to the potential requirement shortfall and options to mitigate the risk of further delays. Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board During committee markup, Senator Heinrich secured an amendment directing the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to review the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) new order 140.1 that governs the interface of the DOE with the independent Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB). Congress created the DNFSB in 1988 to provide oversight of public health and safety at the defense nuclear facilities managed by the Department of Energy, including Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratory and Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. The DNFSB is concerned that the new order 140.1 could limit the board's oversight of DOE's facilities. The Department of Energy issued Order 140.1 without consultation with the DNFSB or with the local communities most impacted by the department's defense nuclear facilities. The board expressed its concerns in letters to the Secretary of Energy and held a public hearing this year in Albuquerque to gather information on the order's implementation by DOE. The GAO's review shall be provided to Congress by March 2020. Senator Heinrich also secured an amendment to clarify that DNFSB board member may serve up to two terms. National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) Senator Heinrich successfully passed an amendment with unanimous support to permanently remove the overhead burden on NNSA labs for LDRD that currently double-taxes Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory. LDRD is a strategic research and development program that is critical to maintaining the scientific vitality of the national laboratories. In 2016, Congress suspended the overhead burden on the labs' LDRD for three years. Senator Heinrich's amendment this year permanently eliminates it for all NNSA nuclear laboratories and facilities. National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Employee Recruitment and Retention The bill again includes a provision to make permanent NNSA's personnel management system that has been used successfully on a trial basis for over 10 years. Senator Heinrich secured this provision last year in the defense bill, but it was not included in the final conference report. The temporary personnel system has enhanced the recruitment and retention of federal employees of the Department of Energy's NNSA. NNSA needs to attract highly technical employees to manage critical national security programs, including about 800 based in New Mexico. Key advantages of NNSA's personnel system include helping attract and retain top talent by offering competitive salaries, reducing attrition rates, and properly rewarding high-performing employees. National Laboratory Funding Senator Heinrich supported full funding authorization for the National Nuclear Security Administration's (NNSA) nuclear weapons programs. Within NNSA's funding, Senator Heinrich secured full funding of $2.1 billion to continue the Life Extension Programs supported by Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories. This increase of $197 million over FY19 will maintain the existing weapons stockpile and assure safety and security. For fiscal year 2020, the bill authorizes funding from NNSA of $1.99 billion for Sandia National Laboratories, an increase of $110 million over fiscal year 2019. For Los Alamos National Laboratory, the bill authorizes funding of $1.97 billion, up from $1.89 billion in fiscal year 2019. Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Environmental Cleanup The bill authorizes $195.5 million for soil and water remediation and removal of radioactive waste. Funding is included again this year to address the hexavalent chromium and Royal Demolition eXplosive (RDX) plumes in groundwater in Los Alamos. Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) The bill authorizes full funding of $398 million to operate the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), including $17.5 million to repair and replace degraded facility structures, systems, and components, $58 million to continue construction of additional ventilation for the mine and $34.5 million for a new utility shaft. New Mexico's Defense RandD Labs, Test Ranges, and Industry U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Mentor-Protege Program The Defense Small Business Advancement Act of 2019 The Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that incorporates S. 1320, the Defense Small Business Advancement Act. Senators Heinrich and Joni Ernst's (R-Iowa) bill language would permanently authorize the DoD's Mentor Protege Program (MPP), which is the oldest continuously operating federal mentor-protege program in existence, but expired last year. Originally established in 1991, the MPP helps eligible small businesses expand their footprint in the defense industrial base. Under the MPP, small businesses are partnered with larger companies. In the past five years, DoD's MPP has successfully helped more than 190 small businesses fill unique niches and become part of the military's supply chain. Senator Heinrich ensured the survival of the MPP when it faced expiration, and salvaged this influential, small-business focused program. Directed Energy Test Range Workloads Senator Heinrich secured $15 million for White Sands Missile Range in order to accommodate the increase in directed energy testing workloads to accommodate the increased demand in the 21st century. A lack of funding for increased directed energy testing is a serious issue; especially, given the workload and number of directed energy demonstrations and exercises have increased significantly since 1975. The projected workload for fiscal years 20182022 for the High Energy Laser Systems Test Facility at White Sands is large and growing, and has expanded to include high-powered microwave testing. Yet, funding remained at the same level. Senator Heinrich secured the funds necessary to meet the growing demand and support the appropriate test workloads. High-Powered Microwave Research In this year's NDAA, Senator Heinrich capitalized on the newly enacted authorities allowing the Joint Directed Energy Transition Office (JDETO) to conduct high-powered microwave research. Senator Heinrich successfully secured an increase of $5 million for JDETO to allow for needed basic research at the university level, and focus applied research efforts into the joint development of an effects database, common high-power radio frequency models, and predictive capabilities for the high-powered microwave technology capabilities. Senator Heinrich's efforts bring attention to the shift in the JDETO's responsibility to help oversee the development and transition of directed energy weapons systems from the laboratories to the battlefield. High-Powered Microwave Test Range Asset The Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich which supports the Air Force's development of an enduring testing and evaluation capability for high powered microwaves (HPM). The committee noted that such an asset at our nation's test ranges would support the transitioning of new and game changing directed energy technologies to the warfighter. Doing so would also help the military services develop the doctrine and concepts of operation that will bring these technologies to operational use. Currently, an enduring-frequency, agile, and tunable HPM asset is not available for evolving doctrine and HPM Directed Energy Concept of Operations at Major Range and Test Facility Bases. Missile Defense Agency's Low Power Laser Demonstrator The Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich expressing the committee's support for the Missile Defense Agency's (MDA) Low-Power Laser Demonstrator (LPLD) program. The language secured expresses continued support for LPLD for the development of a boost-phase missile intercept capability and multiple other applications and capabilities, and could be adapted to be an effective countermeasure against other threats, including cruise, surface-to-air, air-to-air, and hypersonic missiles. The language requests the DoD's plans for the flight test program for the LPLD project including:The expected date that operational airborne tests of the LPLD will begin;The expected required number of flight tests and expected cadence of flight tests that the LPLD project will require, and;A comprehensive description of the DoD's planned locations to conduct LPLD flights and tests, including a cost-benefit analysis for each location and an analysis of each location's suitability for the flight platforms anticipated to participate in the project.3-D Printed Electronics Army Innovation Hub for Next Generation Additive Manufacturing Senator Heinrich secured an additional $2 million for additive manufacturing (AM), which is already making innovative technological leaps that could yield major advances in more lethal and longer-ranged fires. New Mexico Tech and University of Texas at El Paso are leading entities in 3-D printing. This technology can combine existing and new materials into 3-D printed circuit architectures, producing smarter, lighter, and denser constructs to enable projectiles to double current ranges while achieving higher precision. Hypersonics Prototyping and Production The Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that encourages the Department of Defense (DoD) to utilize the technical and scientific expertise at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) necessary for the development of prototypes and to assist commercial industry in manufacturing. The language recognizes the enormous contributions that SNL has made in the area of hypersonics. For over 30 years, SNL has emerged as the center of excellence for the prototyping and testing of hypersonic vehicles. SNL houses the most experienced scientists and engineers in the development of this technology, utilizing their hypersonic wind tunnel, and advanced laser diagnostic technology. Over seven years ago, Sandia conducted a successful flight test of the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon (AHW) concept for the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command. This first-of-its-kind vehicle utilized a three-stage booster system and hypersonic glide vehicle. This test propelled SNL with data on hypersonic boost-glide technologies and test range performance for long-range atmospheric flight with emphasis on aerodynamics, navigation, guidance and control, and thermal protection technologies. The language also notes that the technical expertise at SNL and the laboratory has been, and will continue to be, instrumental to the development and eventual production of hypersonics. The language encourages DoD to utilize the technical and scientific expertise at labs, including SNL, necessary for the development of prototypes and to assist commercial industry in manufacturing. Navy Laser Weapon System Integration on Ships The Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that directs the Secretary of the U.S. Navy to provide a briefing to the committee no later than October 1, 2019, describing the path forward for shipboard integration of High Energy Laser (HEL) systems, and the risk reduction plan to achieve improved technology and manufacturing readiness levels for such higher power systems. The committee also directs the Navy to provide briefings on the progress of laser systems development and testing every six months through fiscal year 2021. The Navy has rapidly demonstrated laser weapon systems on surface ships. In 2014, the Navy deployed a 30 kilowatt (kW) Laser Weapon System (LaWS) on USS Ponce, which will be followed by a 150 kW LaWS on USS Portland (LPD-27) planned for 2019. The Navy also plans to integrate the 60 kW High Energy Laser and Integrated Optical-dazzler with Surveillance (HELIOS) program into Arleigh Burke-class destroyers beginning in 2021. If successful, there may be additional opportunities to integrate HEL systems on large capital ships, including aircraft carriers and large amphibious ships, to increase the defensive capabilities and lethality of our carrier strike groups and expeditionary forces. There may also be broader applications of laser weapons for providing capability for fleet air defense from more Navy vessels. STARBASE Senator Heinrich secured an additional $15 million for the STARBASE program. This program is meant to improve the knowledge and skills of students in kindergarten through 12th grade in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subjects, to connect them to the military, and to motivate them to explore STEM and possible military careers as they continue their education. STARBASE is a highly effective program run by our dedicated servicemembers and strengthens the relationships between the military, communities, and local school districts. The program allows students to participate in a 25-hour hands-on curriculum where they solve scientific challenges related to aerospace. Students learn the importance of STEM skills in real world situations and develop essential math and science fundamentals, while fostering positive relationships between military bases and their surrounding communities. STARBASE currently operates at 76 locations in 40 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, primarily on military installations. New Mexico is one of those locations. Since its inception in 1991, over 825,000 students have benefitted from the STARBASE program, including 45,000 last year. 5th Generation Spectrum Sharing As a member of the Cybersecurity Subcommittee, Senator Heinrich supported an increase in $25 million to support U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) spectrum sharing and to allow for full utilization of the 5th Generation (5G) network. The 5G wireless network is the foundation for future economic growth, and will have a vital impact on national security. As such, this funding will prepare DoD to use dynamic spectrum sharing technologies that will lead to more efficient and effective use of the 5G and future wireless networks. New Mexico Space Missions Department of Defense Launch Support and Infrastructure Program for Small-Class and Medium-Class Payloads The Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that authorizes the Secretary of Defense to carry out a program to enhance infrastructure and improve support activities for the processing and launch of Department of Defense (DoD) small-class and medium-class payloads. The language would establish a program and plan which would include how the Secretary intends to:Invest in infrastructure to improve operations at ranges and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-licensed spaceports consistent with usage by the DoD;Take measures to normalize processes, systems, and products across ranges and spaceports to minimize burden on launch providers; andImprove transparency, flexibility, and responsiveness for launch scheduling, factoring in proximity to, and quantity of, existing commercial airline flight patterns.The provision would require the Secretary to submit to the congressional defense committees, not later than 270 days after the enactment of this Act, a report on the plan for such a program. Spaceport America in New Mexico is a licensed inland spaceport that provides surface-to-space open sky launches landing in restricted flight zones. The New Mexico Spaceport is located next to White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) where the DoD controls the only restricted air space in the country besides the White House. Space Sensor Layer In an effort to develop a reliable defense against cruise missiles and hypersonic weapons, Senator Heinrich and Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) added $108 million for a space sensor layer that will help correlate data and track the incoming target for intercept. Senator Heinrich crafted language to help prioritize this capability gap and increased funding. Tactically Responsive Space Launch Operations Plan The Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that requires a plan from the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)for tactical responsive launch. The language directs the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, to develop a plan to leverage and analyze commercial space launch capabilities and to integrate these capabilities into DoD space operations. The language also requires the Secretary to provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees not later than March 1, 2020, on such plan. Space Rapid Capabilities Office (Sp-RCO) The Senate Armed Services Committee authorized $18.88 million for the Space Rapid Capabilities Office (Sp-RCO) which is housed at Kirtland AFB. As Ranking Member of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, Senator Heinrich has fought to ensure New Mexico remains the small satellite center of excellence for the military. Senator Heinrich recently announced plans for the establishment of additional classified workspace, near Sp-RCO, that can be used by potential commercial partners to facilitate the rapid fielding of new space capabilities. Space Test Program (STP) The Senate Armed Services Committee authorized $26.09 million for the Space Test Program (STP) which is housed at Kirtland Air Force Base. As Ranking Member of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, Senator Heinrich has fought to ensure New Mexico remains the small satellite center of excellence for the military. Senator Heinrich has strongly supported STP's mission to secure launches for experimental spacecraft from emerging entrants including Rocket Lab or Vox Space that are smaller and far less expensive than traditional military satellites that are launched aboard larger rockets under the National Security Space Launch program. Senator Heinrich included provisions elsewhere in the mark to establish a program to improve infrastructure and launch support at FAA licensed spaceports. Since 1965, the STP has conducted space test missions for the purpose of accelerating Department of Defense space technology transformation while lowering developmental risk. Rocket Systems Launch Program The Senate Armed Services Committee authorized $13.19 million for the Rocket Systems Launch Program (RSLP) which is housed at Kirtland Air Force Base. As Ranking Member of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, Senator Heinrich has fought to ensure New Mexico remains the small satellite center of excellence for the military. Senator Heinrich supports the Rapid Agile Launch Initiative which seeks to award launch service agreements with non-traditional, venture-class companies. China Space Industrial Base Study The Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that directs the Secretary of Defense to provide, not later than March 15, 2020, a briefing on the current state of the small satellite and small launch industry in China, to include an assessment of the role of Chinese government support in the growth of these companies and a set of recommended steps and investments the Secretary should take to ensure the Department of Defense has long-term access to world-leading small satellite and small launch technologies and capabilities from U.S. companies. Artificial Intelligence Armed Forces Digital Advantage Act The Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that incorporated language introduced on May 15, 2019, the Armed Forces Digital Advantage Act (S. 1471), which emphasizes digital engineering as a core competency of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and establishes a career track for computer scientists in the military. This effort would modernize the DoD workforce by adding a recruitment focus and establishing military career tracks for digital engineering that will provide incentives for service members to specialize in computer science and have accelerated promotion tracks. The language requires a Chief Digital Engineering Recruitment and Management Officer and a plan for each Service to establish new career tracks. As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly prioritized, computer coding skills should be treated similarly to mission-critical foreign language skills. In addition to building a younger generation of AI experts, this Act creates an avenue for educating mid-to-senior level leaders and policy makers about the importance of data. With mid-to-senior level leadership trained in AI and an appreciation for how data underlies AI, we have every opportunity to get ahead. Artificial Intelligence Commercial Solutions The Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that secured $7.5 million specifically for accelerating commercial AI solutions. The committee noted the importance of accelerating AI applications in support of the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center's (JAIC) National Mission Initiatives, including disaster response and predictive maintenance. Heinrich's language supports the use of commercial AI solutions and urges the Defense Innovation Unit to coordinate with the JAIC to identify problem sets facing the Department and to seek commercial AI solutions. U.S. Department of Defense Artificial Intelligence Investment Inventory The Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich directing the Comptroller to brief the defense committees by September 1, 2019 on the total complement of artificial intelligence (AI) investments, to include PE and line numbers amounts with sufficient detail and description of those investments. Senator Heinrich is co-founder of the Senate Artificial Intelligence Caucus and believes it is important that the Department of Defense (DoD) have accurate insight to the nature and extent of investments in AI. National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence Extension of Authority The Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that extends the duration of the current Artificial Intelligence Commission in order to account for time lost due to the government shutdown. New Mexico Military Housing Reform and Contamination Clean-Up Military Housing Reform The Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that establishes a uniform code of basic housing standards and requires inspections to ensure compliance. This uniform code provides for safety, comfort, and habitability for military housing units and ensures the inspection of such units adhere to this standard. This is a critical step in addressing the problems associated with military housing around the world and ensuring our warfighters live in the healthy dwellings they deserve. The Senate Armed Services Committee NDAA takes other meaningful steps to address serious issues with the Military Housing Privatization Initiative, including: creating a Tenant Bill of Rights, setting up a dispute resolution process, and increasing oversight Holding private military housing companies accountable by instating new quality assurance and quality control measures and increasing health and hazard inspections Strengthening management of military housing by providing an additional $301.8 million to ensure each installation has the necessary government housing personnel to implement thorough oversight and planning measures. Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) Contamination Cleanup The Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich to address Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) contamination at Cannon Air Force Base. As a result of contamination, New Mexico dairy farmers' livelihoods are threatened. The contamination was caused by the U.S. Air Force, but the Air Force has not yet addressed immediate needs for filtration or long-term remediation. The legislative language provides the appropriate authorities to enable the Air Force to take action. Senator Heinrich also fought for the continued funding of the ongoing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention human health study on PFAS in drinking water. Heinrich secured an additional $10 million to the President's Budget to demonstrate and validate the most promising innovative technologies that can meet the U.S. Department of Defense's most urgent requirements, provide a return on investment, and are executed through a free and open competition. This funding helps ensure the safety and welfare of service members and their dependents by eliminating or reducing the generation of pollution and use of hazardous materials and reducing the cost of remedial actions and compliance with environmental laws and regulations, specifically as it relates to per- and polyfluoroakyl substances; develop, demonstrate, validate, and field fluorine-free firefighting foam; and long-term environmental threats to sustain training and testing ranges. New Mexico Military Energy Resilience Military Environmental Research Programs The Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich and Senator Angus King (I-Maine) that would direct $10 million for development and demonstration of long-duration, on-site battery storage for distributed energy applications, $10 million for development, demonstration and validation of secure microgrids for both installations and forward operating bases, $10 million for development, demonstration, and validation of non-fluorine based firefighting foam and $5 million for development, demonstration, and validation of technologies that can harvest potable water from air. Aerospace Technology Development/Demonstration Senator Heinrich secured an additional $5 million to fund the design and manufacturing of aircraft active winglets and aft body drag reduction devices, as well as high pressure compressor blade coatings that have demonstrated reduced drag, shown fuel savings, and decreased maintenance requirements. These small fins adhere to each side of the C-17's aft fuselage to reduce drag and have shown a 1.2 percent reduction in fuel burn at cruise. This results in a cost savings of about $10 million each year for the 40+ years of the fleet.Load-Date: June 28, 2019End of Document

Sen. Heinrich: Defense Amendments Help New MexicoTargeted News ServiceMay 24, 2019 Friday 7:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 6030 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Martin Heinrich, D-New Mexico, issued the following news release:* * *- Heinrich Secures Major Gains For N.M. Military Installations, National Labs, and Artificial Intelligence In Annual Defense Spending Bill- Heinrich amendments to strengthen national security and New Mexico's economy clear Senate Armed Services Committee* * *Today, U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Ranking Member of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, and co-founder of the Senate Artificial Intelligence Caucus, announced provisions he secured in the fiscal year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that support New Mexico's men and women in uniform, military installations, national laboratories, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), Artificial Intelligence, and job-creating initiatives throughout the state. The Senate Armed Services Committee voted to advance this important legislation to the Senate floor."The people of New Mexico make tremendous contributions to our national security and work at the forefront of cutting-edge research and development in the defense industry,"said Heinrich. "This bipartisan bill supports our servicemembers and their families, and includes provisions I fought for to strengthen New Mexico's military installations, national laboratories, Spaceport America, economic development, and leadership in the future of technologies like Artificial Intelligence, directed energy, and space. I am proud to have authorized funding for military construction projects that will modernize infrastructure at Holloman Air Force Base, White Sands Missile Range and Kirtland Air Force Base. This bill makes major investments to ensure our Armed Forces are equipped with the most modern technology so we can stay ahead of our adversaries. New Mexico is the Center of Excellence for small satellites and for directed energy weapons, and this bill increases funding and streamlines authorities to bolster those missions. I am also proud to have incorporated language from the Armed Forces Digital Advantage Act to modernize defense workforces with digital engineers, specialized in computer science, and to have increased funding for Artificial Intelligence. This bill also makes major reforms to fix the military housing crisis and takes meaningful action on contamination at dairies outside Cannon Air Force Base. These provisions, among many others, help New Mexico families, benefit our economy, and further New Mexico's strong position as a leader in national security for years to come."The NDAA sets the Department of Defense spending levels and policies for the upcoming fiscal year and authorizes funding for the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons programs at Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories, as well as the Department of Energy's environmental cleanup programs including the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP).A list of many of the programs and provisions Senator Heinrich advocated for during the bill writing process that were included in the FY20 NDAA is available as a PDF HERE and below.New Mexico Military Construction ProjectsKirtland Air Force BaseSenator Heinrich secured $15.5 million for the construction of a Combat Rescue Helicopter Simulator Facility at Kirtland Air Force Base. This facility will house new HH-60W simulators, training spaces, and equipment used by the 58th Special Operations Wing to train new students. This construction will allow for a seamless transition from the HH-60G legacy aircraft, to the new HH-60W and provide continuous Programmed Flight Training for its operators.Senator Heinrich secured $22.4 million for the construction of a UH-1 Replacement Facility at Kirtland Air Force Base. This facility will house new simulators used for training flight crew personnel in the UH-1 replacement aircraft set for delivery to the 58th Special Operations Wing starting at the end of FY 2022. This construction will allow for an on-time delivery of the simulators, and critical training in the new aircraft.Holloman Air Force BaseSenator Heinrich secured $20 million for the construction of a climate-controlled, storage and shipment facility at Holloman Air Force Base. The facility will be used to store, inspect, and prepare the movement of military support equipment and provide maximum protection of our expeditionary, warfighting resources. This will enable assets to be maintained in a constant state of readiness and postured for worldwide deployment with greatly reduced maintenance costs. The use of this facility will save the government $800,000 annually for the maintenance and/or replacement of these assets by preserving the shelf-life of items otherwise stored in the open; as well as save $120,000 a year in replacement costs of shipping containers damaged by exposure to weather.White Sands Missile Range (WSMR)Senator Heinrich secured $5.8 million to build a micro-grid at White Sands. The micro-grid will utilize a solar array, natural gas generator, and lithium ion battery system to power water wells to provide an uninterrupted water supply to WSMR. Currently, the wells are connected in such a way that leaves them susceptible to power outages that could leave WSMR without drinkable potable water. This micro-grid system will ensure a reliable supply of water for the installation.White Sands Missile Range Land Enhancements and White Sands National ParkThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that incorporates legislation to, amongst other things, finalize updated land exchanges between the Department of the Interior and the Department of the Army that have been pending since the 1970s. The exchange of parcels between White Sands National Monument and White Sands Missile Range will clean up boundary anomalies, transfer important missile range infrastructure to the jurisdiction of the Army, and provide increased opportunities for visitors at the National Monument. The bill was developed in close consultation with the Army, the Air Force, the National Park Service, local elected officials, neighboring tribes, and local residents.New Mexico Air National GuardThe Senate Armed Services Committee included language that requests the Secretary of the Air Force, in consultation with the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, to report back to the committee within 60 days to present options for achieving an operational flying mission in states currently without ownership of aircraft.New Mexico is one of three states - New Mexico, Virginia, and Washington - that have an operational flying mission, but due to the classic associate construct they lack ownership of aircraft. The Air National Guard enterprise is based on established Capstone Principles that notionally set the foundational framework for mission allocation in the 54 states and territories. One of those Capstone Principles is to allocate at least one unit-equipped wing and flying squadron to each state.The New Mexico congressional delegation is dedicated to working with the Air Force and the National Guard Bureau to ensure a unit-equipped flying squadron for the New Mexico Air National Guard (NMANG). New Mexico's outstanding flying weather, airspace and ranges around Kirtland Air Force Base (KAFB) offer excellent training capabilities. KAFB's location in central New Mexico allows for important co-training opportunities with Cannon and Holloman Air Force Bases, White Sands Missile Range, and Fort Bliss, Texas. Having hosted aircraft for decades, appropriate infrastructure such as runways and hangars are already in place that can save taxpayer dollars and accommodate additional aircraft.New Mexico's National Laboratories and WIPPLos Alamos National Laboratory's Plutonium MissionSenator Heinrich again supported full funding to secure Los Alamos National Laboratory's (LANL) role as the nation's Center of Excellence for Plutonium Research. The bill authorizes $551 million for LANL's ongoing plutonium research and pit production programs. The funding supports personnel, equipment and other activities at LANL to meet pit production requirements by 2026; highlights include, $232 million for plutonium operations, $21 million to support pit production, $10.5 million for fire suppression upgrades in PF-4, $16 million for power and communications improvements and $168 million for construction related to replacing the outdated Chemistry and Metallurgy Research (CMR) building at LANL.Senator Heinrich included a provision in last year's NDAA directing the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to contract for an independent review of the National Nuclear Security Administration's (NNSA) preferred plutonium strategy. The assessment released last month concluded that a key milestone will be achieving the goal of producing 30 plutonium pits per year at LANL by 2026. However, the assessment found DoD's requirement of 80 pits per year was unlikely to be met on NNSA's currently planned schedule or budget. In response, during committee markup Senator Heinrich secured another amendment requiring DoD to provide by December the administration's formal response to the potential requirement shortfall and options to mitigate the risk of further delays.Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety BoardDuring committee markup, Senator Heinrich secured an amendment directing the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to review the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) new order 140.1 that governs the interface of the DOE with the independent Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB). Congress created the DNFSB in 1988 to provide oversight of public health and safety at the defense nuclear facilities managed by the Department of Energy, including Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratory and Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. The DNFSB is concerned that the new order 140.1 could limit the board's oversight of DOE's facilities. The Department of Energy issued Order 140.1 without consultation with the DNFSB or with the local communities most impacted by the department's defense nuclear facilities. The board expressed its concerns in letters to the Secretary of Energy and held a public hearing this year in Albuquerque to gather information on the order's implementation by DOE. The GAO's review shall be provided to Congress by March 2020.National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD)Senator Heinrich successfully passed an amendment with unanimous support to permanently remove the overhead burden on NNSA labs for LDRD that currently double-taxes Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory. LDRD is a strategic research and development program that is critical to maintaining the scientific vitality of the national laboratories. In 2016, Congress suspended the overhead burden on the labs' LDRD for three years. Senator Heinrich's amendment this year permanently eliminates it for all NNSA nuclear laboratories and facilities.National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Employee Recruitment and RetentionThe bill again includes a provision to make permanent NNSA's personnel management system that has been used successfully on a trial basis for over 10 years. Senator Heinrich secured this provision last year in the defense bill, but it was not included in the final conference report. The temporary personnel system has enhanced the recruitment and retention of federal employees of the Department of Energy's NNSA. NNSA needs to attract highly technical employees to manage critical national security programs, including about 800 based in New Mexico. Key advantages of NNSA's personnel system include helping attract and retain top talent by offering competitive salaries, reducing attrition rates, and properly rewarding high-performing employees.National Laboratory FundingSenator Heinrich supported full funding authorization for the National Nuclear Security Administration's (NNSA) nuclear weapons programs. Within NNSA's funding, Senator Heinrich secured full funding of $2.1 billion to continue the Life Extension Programs supported by Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories. This increase of $197 million over FY19 will maintain the existing weapons stockpile and assure safety and security.For fiscal year 2020, the bill authorizes funding from NNSA of $1.99 billion for Sandia National Laboratories, an increase of $110 million over fiscal year 2019. For Los Alamos National Laboratory, the bill authorizes funding of $1.97 billion, up from $1.89 billion in fiscal year 2019.Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Environmental CleanupThe bill authorizes $195.5 million for soil and water remediation and removal of radioactive waste. Funding is included again this year to address the hexavalent chromium and Royal Demolition eXplosive (RDX) plumes in groundwater in Los Alamos.Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP)The bill authorizes full funding of $398 million to operate the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), including $17.5 million to repair and replace degraded facility structures, systems, and components, $58 million to continue construction of additional ventilation for the mine and $34.5 million for a new utility shaft.New Mexico's Defense R&#38;D Labs, Test Ranges, and IndustryU.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Mentor-Protege ProgramThe Defense Small Business Advancement Act of 2019The Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that incorporates S. 1320, the Defense Small Business Advancement Act. Senators Heinrich and Joni Ernst's (R-Iowa) bill language would permanently authorize the DoD's Mentor Protege Program (MPP), which is the oldest continuously operating federal mentor-protege program in existence, but expired last year. Originally established in 1991, the MPP helps eligible small businesses expand their footprint in the defense industrial base. Under the MPP, small businesses are partnered with larger companies. In the past five years, DoD's MPP has successfully helped more than 190 small businesses fill unique niches and become part of the military's supply chain. Senator Heinrich ensured the survival of the MPP when it faced expiration, and salvaged this influential, small-business focused program.Directed Energy Test Range WorkloadsSenator Heinrich secured $15 million for White Sands Missile Range in order to accommodate the increase in directed energy testing workloads to accommodate the increased demand in the 21st century. A lack of funding for increased directed energy testing is a serious issue; especially, given the workload and number of directed energy demonstrations and exercises have increased significantly since 1975. The projected workload for fiscal years 2018-2022 for the High Energy Laser Systems Test Facility at White Sands is large and growing, and has expanded to include high-powered microwave testing. Yet, funding remained at the same level. Senator Heinrich secured the funds necessary to meet the growing demand and support the appropriate test workloads.High-Powered Microwave ResearchIn this year's NDAA, Senator Heinrich capitalized on the newly enacted authorities allowing the Joint Directed Energy Transition Office (JDETO) to conduct high-powered microwave research. Senator Heinrich successfully secured an increase of $5 million for JDETO to allow for needed basic research at the university level, and focus applied research efforts into the joint development of an effects database, common high-power radio frequency models, and predictive capabilities for the high-powered microwave technology capabilities. Senator Heinrich's efforts bring attention to the shift in the JDETO's responsibility to help oversee the development and transition of directed energy weapons systems from the laboratories to the battlefield.High-Powered Microwave Test Range AssetThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich which supports the Air Force's development of an enduring testing and evaluation capability for high powered microwaves (HPM). The committee noted that such an asset at our nation's test ranges would support the transitioning of new and game changing directed energy technologies to the warfighter. Doing so would also help the military services develop the doctrine and concepts of operation that will bring these technologies to operational use. Currently, an enduring-frequency, agile, and tunable HPM asset is not available for evolving doctrine and HPM Directed Energy Concept of Operations at Major Range and Test Facility Bases.Missile Defense Agency's Low Power Laser DemonstratorThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich expressing the committee's support for the Missile Defense Agency's (MDA) Low-Power Laser Demonstrator (LPLD) program. The language secured expresses continued support for LPLD for the development of a boost-phase missile intercept capability and multiple other applications and capabilities, and could be adapted to be an effective countermeasure against other threats, including cruise, surface-to-air, air-to-air, and hypersonic missiles. The language requests the DoD's plans for the flight test program for the LPLD project including:The expected date that operational airborne tests of the LPLD will begin;The expected required number of flight tests and expected cadence of flight tests that the LPLD project will require, and;A comprehensive description of the DoD's planned locations to conduct LPLD flights and tests, including a cost-benefit analysis for each location and an analysis of each location's suitability for the flight platforms anticipated to participate in the project.3-D Printed Electronics Army Innovation Hub for Next Generation Additive ManufacturingSenator Heinrich secured an additional $2 million for additive manufacturing (AM), which is already making innovative technological leaps that could yield major advances in more lethal and longer-ranged fires. New Mexico Tech and University of Texas at El Paso are leading entities in 3-D printing. This technology can combine existing and new materials into 3-D printed circuit architectures, producing smarter, lighter, and denser constructs to enable projectiles to double current ranges while achieving higher precision.Hypersonics Prototyping and ProductionThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that encourages the Department of Defense (DoD) to utilize the technical and scientific expertise at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) necessary for the development of prototypes and to assist commercial industry in manufacturing.The language recognizes the enormous contributions that SNL has made in the area of hypersonics. For over 30 years, SNL has emerged as the center of excellence for the prototyping and testing of hypersonic vehicles. SNL houses the most experienced scientists and engineers in the development of this technology, utilizing their hypersonic wind tunnel, and advanced laser diagnostic technology. Over seven years ago, Sandia conducted a successful flight test of the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon (AHW) concept for the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command. This first-of-its-kind vehicle utilized a three-stage booster system and hypersonic glide vehicle. This test propelled SNL with data on hypersonic boost-glide technologies and test range performance for long-range atmospheric flight with emphasis on aerodynamics, navigation, guidance and control, and thermal protection technologies.The language also notes that the technical expertise at SNL and the laboratory has been, and will continue to be, instrumental to the development and eventual production of hypersonics. The language encourages DoD to utilize the technical and scientific expertise at labs, including SNL, necessary for the development of prototypes and to assist commercial industry in manufacturing.Navy Laser Weapon System Integration on ShipsThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that directs the Secretary of the U.S. Navy to provide a briefing to the committee no later than October 1, 2019, describing the path forward for shipboard integration of High Energy Laser (HEL) systems, and the risk reduction plan to achieve improved technology and manufacturing readiness levels for such higher power systems. The committee also directs the Navy to provide briefings on the progress of laser systems development and testing every six months through fiscal year 2021.The Navy has rapidly demonstrated laser weapon systems on surface ships. In 2014, the Navy deployed a 30 kilowatt (kW) Laser Weapon System (LaWS) on USS Ponce, which will be followed by a 150 kW LaWS on USS Portland (LPD-27) planned for 2019. The Navy also plans to integrate the 60 kW High Energy Laser and Integrated Optical-dazzler with Surveillance (HELIOS) program into Arleigh Burke-class destroyers beginning in 2021.If successful, there may be additional opportunities to integrate HEL systems on large capital ships, including aircraft carriers and large amphibious ships, to increase the defensive capabilities and lethality of our carrier strike groups and expeditionary forces. There may also be broader applications of laser weapons for providing capability for fleet air defense from more Navy vessels.STARBASESenator Heinrich secured an additional $15 million for the STARBASE program. This program is meant to improve the knowledge and skills of students in kindergarten through 12th grade in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subjects, to connect them to the military, and to motivate them to explore STEM and possible military careers as they continue their education. STARBASE is a highly effective program run by our dedicated servicemembers and strengthens the relationships between the military, communities, and local school districts. The program allows students to participate in a 25-hour hands-on curriculum where they solve scientific challenges related to aerospace. Students learn the importance of STEM skills in real world situations and develop essential math and science fundamentals, while fostering positive relationships between military bases and their surrounding communities. STARBASE currently operates at 76 locations in 40 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, primarily on military installations. New Mexico is one of those locations. Since its inception in 1991, over 825,000 students have benefitted from the STARBASE program, including 45,000 last year.5th Generation Spectrum SharingAs a member of the Cybersecurity Subcommittee, Senator Heinrich supported an increase in $25 million to support U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) spectrum sharing and to allow for full utilization of the 5th Generation (5G) network. The 5G wireless network is the foundation for future economic growth, and will have a vital impact on national security. As such, this funding will prepare DoD to use dynamic spectrum sharing technologies that will lead to more efficient and effective use of the 5G and future wireless networks.New Mexico Space MissionsDepartment of Defense Launch Support and Infrastructure Program for Small-Class and Medium-Class PayloadsThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that authorizes the Secretary of Defense to carry out a program to enhance infrastructure and improve support activities for the processing and launch of Department of Defense (DoD) small-class and medium-class payloads. The language would establish a program and plan which would include how the Secretary intends to:Invest in infrastructure to improve operations at ranges and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-licensed spaceports consistent with usage by the DoD;Take measures to normalize processes, systems, and products across ranges and spaceports to minimize burden on launch providers; andImprove transparency, flexibility, and responsiveness for launch scheduling, factoring in proximity to, and quantity of, existing commercial airline flight patterns.The provision would require the Secretary to submit to the congressional defense committees, not later than 270 days after the enactment of this Act, a report on the plan for such a program.Spaceport America in New Mexico is a licensed inland spaceport that provides surface-to-space open sky launches landing in restricted flight zones. The New Mexico Spaceport is located next to White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) where the DoD controls the only restricted air space in the country besides the White House.Space Sensor LayerIn an effort to develop a reliable defense against cruise missiles and hypersonic weapons, Senator Heinrich and Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) added $108 million for a space sensor layer that will help correlate data and track the incoming target for intercept. Senator Heinrich crafted language to help prioritize this capability gap and increased funding.Tactically Responsive Space Launch Operations PlanThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that requires a plan from the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)for tactical responsive launch. The language directs the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, to develop a plan to leverage and analyze commercial space launch capabilities and to integrate these capabilities into DoD space operations. The language also requires the Secretary to provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees not later than March 1, 2020, on such plan.Space Rapid Capabilities Office (Sp-RCO)The Senate Armed Services Committee authorized $18.88 million for the Space Rapid Capabilities Office (Sp-RCO) which is housed at Kirtland AFB. As Ranking Member of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, Senator Heinrich has fought to ensure New Mexico remains the small satellite center of excellence for the military. Senator Heinrich recently announced plans for the establishment of additional classified workspace, near Sp-RCO, that can be used by potential commercial partners to facilitate the rapid fielding of new space capabilities.Space Test Program (STP)The Senate Armed Services Committee authorized $26.09 million for the Space Test Program (STP) which is housed at Kirtland Air Force Base. As Ranking Member of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, Senator Heinrich has fought to ensure New Mexico remains the small satellite center of excellence for the military. Senator Heinrich has strongly supported STP's mission to secure launches for experimental spacecraft from emerging entrants including Rocket Lab or Vox Space that are smaller and far less expensive than traditional military satellites that are launched aboard larger rockets under the National Security Space Launch program. Senator Heinrich included provisions elsewhere in the mark to establish a program to improve infrastructure and launch support at FAA licensed spaceports. Since 1965, the STP has conducted space test missions for the purpose of accelerating Department of Defense space technology transformation while lowering developmental risk.Rocket Systems Launch ProgramThe Senate Armed Services Committee authorized $13.19 million for the Rocket Systems Launch Program (RSLP) which is housed at Kirtland Air Force Base. As Ranking Member of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, Senator Heinrich has fought to ensure New Mexico remains the small satellite center of excellence for the military. Senator Heinrich supports the Rapid Agile Launch Initiative which seeks to award launch service agreements with non-traditional, venture-class companies.China Space Industrial Base StudyThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that directs the Secretary of Defense to provide, not later than March 15, 2020, a briefing on the current state of the small satellite and small launch industry in China, to include an assessment of the role of Chinese government support in the growth of these companies and a set of recommended steps and investments the Secretary should take to ensure the Department of Defense has long-term access to world-leading small satellite and small launch technologies and capabilities from U.S. companies.Artificial IntelligenceArmed Forces Digital Advantage ActThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that incorporated language introduced on May 15, 2019, the Armed Forces Digital Advantage Act (S. 1471), which emphasizes digital engineering as a core competency of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and establishes a career track for computer scientists in the military. This effort would modernize the DoD workforce by adding a recruitment focus and establishing military career tracks for digital engineering that will provide incentives for service members to specialize in computer science and have accelerated promotion tracks. The language requires a Chief Digital Engineering Recruitment and Management Officer and a plan for each Service to establish new career tracks.As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly prioritized, computer coding skills should be treated similarly to mission-critical foreign language skills. In addition to building a younger generation of AI experts, this Act creates an avenue for educating mid-to-senior level leaders and policy makers about the importance of data. With mid-to-senior level leadership trained in AI and an appreciation for how data underlies AI, we have every opportunity to get ahead.Artificial Intelligence Commercial SolutionsThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that secured $7.5 million specifically for accelerating commercial AI solutions. The committee noted the importance of accelerating AI applications in support of the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center's (JAIC) National Mission Initiatives, including disaster response and predictive maintenance. Heinrich's language supports the use of commercial AI solutions and urges the Defense Innovation Unit to coordinate with the JAIC to identify problem sets facing the Department and to seek commercial AI solutions.U.S. Department of Defense Artificial Intelligence Investment InventoryThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich directing the Comptroller to brief the defense committees by September 1, 2019 on the total complement of artificial intelligence (AI) investments, to include PE and line numbers amounts with sufficient detail and description of those investments. Senator Heinrich is co-founder of the Senate Artificial Intelligence Caucus and believes it is important that the Department of Defense (DoD) have accurate insight to the nature and extent of investments in AI.National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence - Extension of AuthorityThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that extends the duration of the current Artificial Intelligence Commission in order to account for time lost due to the government shutdown.New Mexico Military Housing Reform and Contamination Clean-UpMilitary Housing ReformThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that establishes a uniform code of basic housing standards and requires inspections to ensure compliance. This uniform code provides for safety, comfort, and habitability for military housing units and ensures the inspection of such units adhere to this standard. This is a critical step in addressing the problems associated with military housing around the world and ensuring our warfighters live in the healthy dwellings they deserve.The Senate Armed Services Committee NDAA takes other meaningful steps to address serious issues with the Military Housing Privatization Initiative, including: creating a Tenant Bill of Rights, setting up a dispute resolution process, and increasing oversight Holding private military housing companies accountable by instating new quality assurance and quality control measures and increasing health and hazard inspections Strengthening management of military housing by providing an additional $301.8 million to ensure each installation has the necessary government housing personnel to implement thorough oversight and planning measures.Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) Contamination CleanupThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich to address Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) contamination at Cannon Air Force Base. As a result of contamination, New Mexico dairy farmers' livelihoods are threatened. The contamination was caused by the U.S. Air Force, but the Air Force has not yet addressed immediate needs for filtration or long-term remediation. The legislative language provides the appropriate authorities to enable the Air Force to take action.Senator Heinrich also fought for the continued funding of the ongoing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention human health study on PFAS in drinking water. Heinrich secured an additional $10 million to the President's Budget to demonstrate and validate the most promising innovative technologies that can meet the U.S. Department of Defense's most urgent requirements, provide a return on investment, and are executed through a free and open competition. This funding helps ensure the safety and welfare of service members and their dependents by eliminating or reducing the generation of pollution and use of hazardous materials and reducing the cost of remedial actions and compliance with environmental laws and regulations, specifically as it relates to per- and polyfluoroakyl substances; develop, demonstrate, validate, and field fluorine-free firefighting foam; and long-term environmental threats to sustain training and testing ranges.New Mexico Military Energy ResilienceMilitary Environmental Research ProgramsThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich and Senator Angus King (I-Maine) that would direct $10 million for development and demonstration of long-duration, on-site battery storage for distributed energy applications, $10 million for development, demonstration and validation of secure microgrids for both installations and forward operating bases, $10 million for development, demonstration, and validation of non-fluorine based firefighting foam and $5 million for development, demonstration, and validation of technologies that can harvest potable water from air.U.S. Department of Defense Energy Siting ClearinghouseSenator Heinrich strongly supported a bipartisan amendment adopted in committee that eliminated a provision proposed by the chairman that would have severely restricted the siting of wind farms in any area with military aircraft training and operations. The proposed provision was clearly not needed given that nearly all of New Mexico's existing wind farms are sited in these areas without harm to military operations or training. Any possible impacts from wind turbines on military and civilian aviation have always been successfully resolved through the U.S. Department of Defense's energy clearinghouse and Federal Aviation Administration's aeronautical study process. If it hadn't been eliminated, the proposal would have restricted New Mexico's ability to develop additional wind generation on federal, state and private land just as the state is transitioning to clean energy technologies.Aerospace Technology Development/DemonstrationSenator Heinrich secured an additional $5 million to fund the design and manufacturing of aircraft active winglets and aft body drag reduction devices, as well as high pressure compressor blade coatings that have demonstrated reduced drag, shown fuel savings, and decreased maintenance requirements. These small fins adhere to each side of the C-17's aft fuselage to reduce drag and have shown a 1.2 percent reduction in fuel burn at cruise. This results in a cost savings of about $10 million each year for the 40+ years of the fleet.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6740878 TeamManagerLoad-Date: May 25, 2019End of Document

Sen. Heinrich Secures Major Wins for N.M. in Annual Defense Spending BillTargeted News ServiceJune 27, 2019 Thursday 7:21 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 5794 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Martin Heinrich, D-New Mexico, issued the following news release:Today, U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) voted to pass the fiscal year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that supports New Mexico's men and women in uniform, military installations, national laboratories, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), Artificial Intelligence, and job-creating initiatives throughout the state. The legislation passed the Senate by a vote of 86-8.Heinrich, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Ranking Member of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, secured a number of provisions to strengthen New Mexico's military installations, national laboratories, economic development, and leadership in the future of technologies like Artificial Intelligence, directed energy, and space."I am proud to have authorized funding for military construction projects that will modernize infrastructure at Holloman Air Force Base, White Sands Missile Range, and Kirtland Air Force Base," said Heinrich. "This bill makes major investments to ensure our Armed Forces are equipped with the most modern technology so we can stay ahead of our adversaries. New Mexico is the Center of Excellence for small satellites and for directed energy weapons, and this bill increases funding and streamlines authorities to bolster those missions. This bill also makes major reforms to fix the military housing crisis and takes meaningful action on contamination at dairies outside Cannon Air Force Base."As the co-founder of the Senate Artificial Intelligence Caucus, Heinrich added, "I am also proud to have incorporated language from the Armed Forces Digital Advantage Act to modernize defense workforces with digital engineers, specialized in computer science, and to have increased funding for Artificial Intelligence. These provisions, among many others, help New Mexico families, benefit our economy, and further New Mexico's strong position as a leader in national security for years to come."The NDAA sets the Department of Defense spending levels and policies for the upcoming fiscal year and authorizes funding for the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons programs at Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories, as well as the Department of Energy's environmental cleanup programs including the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP).A list of many of the programs and provisions Senator Heinrich advocated for during the bill writing process that were included in the FY20 NDAA is available as a PDF HERE and below.New Mexico Military Construction ProjectsKirtland Air Force BaseSenator Heinrich secured $15.5 million for the construction of a Combat Rescue Helicopter Simulator Facility at Kirtland Air Force Base. This facility will house new HH-60W simulators, training spaces, and equipment used by the 58th Special Operations Wing to train new students. This construction will allow for a seamless transition from the HH-60G legacy aircraft, to the new HH-60W and provide continuous Programmed Flight Training for its operators.Senator Heinrich secured $22.4 million for the construction of a UH-1 Replacement Facility at Kirtland Air Force Base. This facility will house new simulators used for training flight crew personnel in the UH-1 replacement aircraft set for delivery to the 58th Special Operations Wing starting at the end of FY 2022. This construction will allow for an on-time delivery of the simulators, and critical training in the new aircraft.Holloman Air Force BaseSenator Heinrich secured $20 million for the construction of a climate-controlled, storage and shipment facility at Holloman Air Force Base. The facility will be used to store, inspect, and prepare the movement of military support equipment and provide maximum protection of our expeditionary, warfighting resources. This will enable assets to be maintained in a constant state of readiness and postured for worldwide deployment with greatly reduced maintenance costs. The use of this facility will save the government $800,000 annually for the maintenance and/or replacement of these assets by preserving the shelf-life of items otherwise stored in the open; as well as save $120,000 a year in replacement costs of shipping containers damaged by exposure to weather.White Sands Missile Range (WSMR)Senator Heinrich secured $5.8 million to build a micro-grid at White Sands. The micro-grid will utilize a solar array, natural gas generator, and lithium ion battery system to power water wells to provide an uninterrupted water supply to WSMR. Currently, the wells are connected in such a way that leaves them susceptible to power outages that could leave WSMR without drinkable potable water. This micro-grid system will ensure a reliable supply of water for the installation.White Sands Missile Range Land Enhancements and White Sands National ParkThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that incorporates legislation to, amongst other things, finalize updated land exchanges between the Department of the Interior and the Department of the Army that have been pending since the 1970s. The exchange of parcels between White Sands National Monument and White Sands Missile Range will clean up boundary anomalies, transfer important missile range infrastructure to the jurisdiction of the Army, and provide increased opportunities for visitors at the National Monument. The bill was developed in close consultation with the Army, the Air Force, the National Park Service, local elected officials, neighboring tribes, and local residents.New Mexico Air National GuardThe Senate Armed Services Committee included language that requests the Secretary of the Air Force, in consultation with the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, to report back to the committee within 60 days to present options for achieving an operational flying mission in states currently without ownership of aircraft.New Mexico is one of three states - New Mexico, Virginia, and Washington - that have an operational flying mission, but due to the classic associate construct they lack ownership of aircraft. The Air National Guard enterprise is based on established Capstone Principles that notionally set the foundational framework for mission allocation in the 54 states and territories. One of those Capstone Principles is to allocate at least one unit-equipped wing and flying squadron to each state.The New Mexico congressional delegation is dedicated to working with the Air Force and the National Guard Bureau to ensure a unit-equipped flying squadron for the New Mexico Air National Guard (NMANG). New Mexico's outstanding flying weather, airspace and ranges around Kirtland Air Force Base (KAFB) offer excellent training capabilities. KAFB's location in central New Mexico allows for important co-training opportunities with Cannon and Holloman Air Force Bases, White Sands Missile Range, and Fort Bliss, Texas. Having hosted aircraft for decades, appropriate infrastructure such as runways and hangars are already in place that can save taxpayer dollars and accommodate additional aircraft.New Mexico's National Laboratories and WIPPLos Alamos National Laboratory's Plutonium MissionSenator Heinrich again supported full funding to secure Los Alamos National Laboratory's (LANL) role as the nation's Center of Excellence for Plutonium Research. The bill authorizes $551 million for LANL's ongoing plutonium research and pit production programs. The funding supports personnel, equipment and other activities at LANL to meet pit production requirements by 2026; highlights include, $232 million for plutonium operations, $21 million to support pit production, $10.5 million for fire suppression upgrades in PF-4, $16 million for power and communications improvements and $168 million for construction related to replacing the outdated Chemistry and Metallurgy Research (CMR) building at LANL.Senator Heinrich included a provision in last year's NDAA directing the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to contract for an independent review of the National Nuclear Security Administration's (NNSA) preferred plutonium strategy. The assessment released last month concluded that a key milestone will be achieving the goal of producing 30 plutonium pits per year at LANL by 2026. However, the assessment found DoD's requirement of 80 pits per year was unlikely to be met on NNSA's currently planned schedule or budget. In response, during committee markup Senator Heinrich secured another amendment requiring DoD to provide by December the administration's formal response to the potential requirement shortfall and options to mitigate the risk of further delays.Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety BoardDuring committee markup, Senator Heinrich secured an amendment directing the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to review the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) new order 140.1 that governs the interface of the DOE with the independent Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB). Congress created the DNFSB in 1988 to provide oversight of public health and safety at the defense nuclear facilities managed by the Department of Energy, including Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratory and Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. The DNFSB is concerned that the new order 140.1 could limit the board's oversight of DOE's facilities. The Department of Energy issued Order 140.1 without consultation with the DNFSB or with the local communities most impacted by the department's defense nuclear facilities. The board expressed its concerns in letters to the Secretary of Energy and held a public hearing this year in Albuquerque to gather information on the order's implementation by DOE. The GAO's review shall be provided to Congress by March 2020.Senator Heinrich also secured an amendment to clarify that DNFSB board member may serve up to two terms.National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD)Senator Heinrich successfully passed an amendment with unanimous support to permanently remove the overhead burden on NNSA labs for LDRD that currently double-taxes Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory. LDRD is a strategic research and development program that is critical to maintaining the scientific vitality of the national laboratories. In 2016, Congress suspended the overhead burden on the labs' LDRD for three years. Senator Heinrich's amendment this year permanently eliminates it for all NNSA nuclear laboratories and facilities.National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Employee Recruitment and RetentionThe bill again includes a provision to make permanent NNSA's personnel management system that has been used successfully on a trial basis for over 10 years. Senator Heinrich secured this provision last year in the defense bill, but it was not included in the final conference report. The temporary personnel system has enhanced the recruitment and retention of federal employees of the Department of Energy's NNSA. NNSA needs to attract highly technical employees to manage critical national security programs, including about 800 based in New Mexico. Key advantages of NNSA's personnel system include helping attract and retain top talent by offering competitive salaries, reducing attrition rates, and properly rewarding high-performing employees.National Laboratory FundingSenator Heinrich supported full funding authorization for the National Nuclear Security Administration's (NNSA) nuclear weapons programs. Within NNSA's funding, Senator Heinrich secured full funding of $2.1 billion to continue the Life Extension Programs supported by Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories. This increase of $197 million over FY19 will maintain the existing weapons stockpile and assure safety and security.For fiscal year 2020, the bill authorizes funding from NNSA of $1.99 billion for Sandia National Laboratories, an increase of $110 million over fiscal year 2019. For Los Alamos National Laboratory, the bill authorizes funding of $1.97 billion, up from $1.89 billion in fiscal year 2019.Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Environmental CleanupThe bill authorizes $195.5 million for soil and water remediation and removal of radioactive waste. Funding is included again this year to address the hexavalent chromium and Royal Demolition eXplosive (RDX) plumes in groundwater in Los Alamos.Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP)The bill authorizes full funding of $398 million to operate the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), including $17.5 million to repair and replace degraded facility structures, systems, and components, $58 million to continue construction of additional ventilation for the mine and $34.5 million for a new utility shaft.New Mexico's Defense R&#38;D Labs, Test Ranges, and IndustryU.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Mentor-Protege ProgramThe Defense Small Business Advancement Act of 2019The Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that incorporates S. 1320, the Defense Small Business Advancement Act. Senators Heinrich and Joni Ernst's (R-Iowa) bill language would permanently authorize the DoD's Mentor Protege Program (MPP), which is the oldest continuously operating federal mentor-protege program in existence, but expired last year. Originally established in 1991, the MPP helps eligible small businesses expand their footprint in the defense industrial base. Under the MPP, small businesses are partnered with larger companies. In the past five years, DoD's MPP has successfully helped more than 190 small businesses fill unique niches and become part of the military's supply chain. Senator Heinrich ensured the survival of the MPP when it faced expiration, and salvaged this influential, small-business focused program.Directed Energy Test Range WorkloadsSenator Heinrich secured $15 million for White Sands Missile Range in order to accommodate the increase in directed energy testing workloads to accommodate the increased demand in the 21st century. A lack of funding for increased directed energy testing is a serious issue; especially, given the workload and number of directed energy demonstrations and exercises have increased significantly since 1975. The projected workload for fiscal years 2018-2022 for the High Energy Laser Systems Test Facility at White Sands is large and growing, and has expanded to include high-powered microwave testing. Yet, funding remained at the same level. Senator Heinrich secured the funds necessary to meet the growing demand and support the appropriate test workloads.High-Powered Microwave ResearchIn this year's NDAA, Senator Heinrich capitalized on the newly enacted authorities allowing the Joint Directed Energy Transition Office (JDETO) to conduct high-powered microwave research. Senator Heinrich successfully secured an increase of $5 million for JDETO to allow for needed basic research at the university level, and focus applied research efforts into the joint development of an effects database, common high-power radio frequency models, and predictive capabilities for the high-powered microwave technology capabilities. Senator Heinrich's efforts bring attention to the shift in the JDETO's responsibility to help oversee the development and transition of directed energy weapons systems from the laboratories to the battlefield.High-Powered Microwave Test Range AssetThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich which supports the Air Force's development of an enduring testing and evaluation capability for high powered microwaves (HPM). The committee noted that such an asset at our nation's test ranges would support the transitioning of new and game changing directed energy technologies to the warfighter. Doing so would also help the military services develop the doctrine and concepts of operation that will bring these technologies to operational use. Currently, an enduring-frequency, agile, and tunable HPM asset is not available for evolving doctrine and HPM Directed Energy Concept of Operations at Major Range and Test Facility Bases.Missile Defense Agency's Low Power Laser DemonstratorThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich expressing the committee's support for the Missile Defense Agency's (MDA) Low-Power Laser Demonstrator (LPLD) program. The language secured expresses continued support for LPLD for the development of a boost-phase missile intercept capability and multiple other applications and capabilities, and could be adapted to be an effective countermeasure against other threats, including cruise, surface-to-air, air-to-air, and hypersonic missiles. The language requests the DoD's plans for the flight test program for the LPLD project including:The expected date that operational airborne tests of the LPLD will begin;The expected required number of flight tests and expected cadence of flight tests that the LPLD project will require, and;A comprehensive description of the DoD's planned locations to conduct LPLD flights and tests, including a cost-benefit analysis for each location and an analysis of each location's suitability for the flight platforms anticipated to participate in the project.3-D Printed Electronics Army Innovation Hub for Next Generation Additive ManufacturingSenator Heinrich secured an additional $2 million for additive manufacturing (AM), which is already making innovative technological leaps that could yield major advances in more lethal and longer-ranged fires. New Mexico Tech and University of Texas at El Paso are leading entities in 3-D printing. This technology can combine existing and new materials into 3-D printed circuit architectures, producing smarter, lighter, and denser constructs to enable projectiles to double current ranges while achieving higher precision.Hypersonics Prototyping and ProductionThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that encourages the Department of Defense (DoD) to utilize the technical and scientific expertise at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) necessary for the development of prototypes and to assist commercial industry in manufacturing.The language recognizes the enormous contributions that SNL has made in the area of hypersonics. For over 30 years, SNL has emerged as the center of excellence for the prototyping and testing of hypersonic vehicles. SNL houses the most experienced scientists and engineers in the development of this technology, utilizing their hypersonic wind tunnel, and advanced laser diagnostic technology. Over seven years ago, Sandia conducted a successful flight test of the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon (AHW) concept for the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command. This first-of-its-kind vehicle utilized a three-stage booster system and hypersonic glide vehicle. This test propelled SNL with data on hypersonic boost-glide technologies and test range performance for long-range atmospheric flight with emphasis on aerodynamics, navigation, guidance and control, and thermal protection technologies.The language also notes that the technical expertise at SNL and the laboratory has been, and will continue to be, instrumental to the development and eventual production of hypersonics. The language encourages DoD to utilize the technical and scientific expertise at labs, including SNL, necessary for the development of prototypes and to assist commercial industry in manufacturing.Navy Laser Weapon System Integration on ShipsThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that directs the Secretary of the U.S. Navy to provide a briefing to the committee no later than October 1, 2019, describing the path forward for shipboard integration of High Energy Laser (HEL) systems, and the risk reduction plan to achieve improved technology and manufacturing readiness levels for such higher power systems. The committee also directs the Navy to provide briefings on the progress of laser systems development and testing every six months through fiscal year 2021.The Navy has rapidly demonstrated laser weapon systems on surface ships. In 2014, the Navy deployed a 30 kilowatt (kW) Laser Weapon System (LaWS) on USS Ponce, which will be followed by a 150 kW LaWS on USS Portland (LPD-27) planned for 2019. The Navy also plans to integrate the 60 kW High Energy Laser and Integrated Optical-dazzler with Surveillance (HELIOS) program into Arleigh Burke-class destroyers beginning in 2021.If successful, there may be additional opportunities to integrate HEL systems on large capital ships, including aircraft carriers and large amphibious ships, to increase the defensive capabilities and lethality of our carrier strike groups and expeditionary forces. There may also be broader applications of laser weapons for providing capability for fleet air defense from more Navy vessels.STARBASESenator Heinrich secured an additional $15 million for the STARBASE program. This program is meant to improve the knowledge and skills of students in kindergarten through 12th grade in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subjects, to connect them to the military, and to motivate them to explore STEM and possible military careers as they continue their education. STARBASE is a highly effective program run by our dedicated servicemembers and strengthens the relationships between the military, communities, and local school districts. The program allows students to participate in a 25-hour hands-on curriculum where they solve scientific challenges related to aerospace. Students learn the importance of STEM skills in real world situations and develop essential math and science fundamentals, while fostering positive relationships between military bases and their surrounding communities. STARBASE currently operates at 76 locations in 40 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, primarily on military installations. New Mexico is one of those locations. Since its inception in 1991, over 825,000 students have benefitted from the STARBASE program, including 45,000 last year.5th Generation Spectrum SharingAs a member of the Cybersecurity Subcommittee, Senator Heinrich supported an increase in $25 million to support U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) spectrum sharing and to allow for full utilization of the 5th Generation (5G) network. The 5G wireless network is the foundation for future economic growth, and will have a vital impact on national security. As such, this funding will prepare DoD to use dynamic spectrum sharing technologies that will lead to more efficient and effective use of the 5G and future wireless networks.New Mexico Space MissionsDepartment of Defense Launch Support and Infrastructure Program for Small-Class and Medium-Class PayloadsThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that authorizes the Secretary of Defense to carry out a program to enhance infrastructure and improve support activities for the processing and launch of Department of Defense (DoD) small-class and medium-class payloads. The language would establish a program and plan which would include how the Secretary intends to:Invest in infrastructure to improve operations at ranges and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-licensed spaceports consistent with usage by the DoD;Take measures to normalize processes, systems, and products across ranges and spaceports to minimize burden on launch providers; andImprove transparency, flexibility, and responsiveness for launch scheduling, factoring in proximity to, and quantity of, existing commercial airline flight patterns.The provision would require the Secretary to submit to the congressional defense committees, not later than 270 days after the enactment of this Act, a report on the plan for such a program.Spaceport America in New Mexico is a licensed inland spaceport that provides surface-to-space open sky launches landing in restricted flight zones. The New Mexico Spaceport is located next to White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) where the DoD controls the only restricted air space in the country besides the White House.Space Sensor LayerIn an effort to develop a reliable defense against cruise missiles and hypersonic weapons, Senator Heinrich and Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) added $108 million for a space sensor layer that will help correlate data and track the incoming target for intercept. Senator Heinrich crafted language to help prioritize this capability gap and increased funding.Tactically Responsive Space Launch Operations PlanThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that requires a plan from the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)for tactical responsive launch. The language directs the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, to develop a plan to leverage and analyze commercial space launch capabilities and to integrate these capabilities into DoD space operations. The language also requires the Secretary to provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees not later than March 1, 2020, on such plan.Space Rapid Capabilities Office (Sp-RCO)The Senate Armed Services Committee authorized $18.88 million for the Space Rapid Capabilities Office (Sp-RCO) which is housed at Kirtland AFB. As Ranking Member of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, Senator Heinrich has fought to ensure New Mexico remains the small satellite center of excellence for the military. Senator Heinrich recently announced plans for the establishment of additional classified workspace, near Sp-RCO, that can be used by potential commercial partners to facilitate the rapid fielding of new space capabilities.Space Test Program (STP)The Senate Armed Services Committee authorized $26.09 million for the Space Test Program (STP) which is housed at Kirtland Air Force Base. As Ranking Member of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, Senator Heinrich has fought to ensure New Mexico remains the small satellite center of excellence for the military. Senator Heinrich has strongly supported STP's mission to secure launches for experimental spacecraft from emerging entrants including Rocket Lab or Vox Space that are smaller and far less expensive than traditional military satellites that are launched aboard larger rockets under the National Security Space Launch program. Senator Heinrich included provisions elsewhere in the mark to establish a program to improve infrastructure and launch support at FAA licensed spaceports. Since 1965, the STP has conducted space test missions for the purpose of accelerating Department of Defense space technology transformation while lowering developmental risk.Rocket Systems Launch ProgramThe Senate Armed Services Committee authorized $13.19 million for the Rocket Systems Launch Program (RSLP) which is housed at Kirtland Air Force Base. As Ranking Member of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, Senator Heinrich has fought to ensure New Mexico remains the small satellite center of excellence for the military. Senator Heinrich supports the Rapid Agile Launch Initiative which seeks to award launch service agreements with non-traditional, venture-class companies.China Space Industrial Base StudyThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that directs the Secretary of Defense to provide, not later than March 15, 2020, a briefing on the current state of the small satellite and small launch industry in China, to include an assessment of the role of Chinese government support in the growth of these companies and a set of recommended steps and investments the Secretary should take to ensure the Department of Defense has long-term access to world-leading small satellite and small launch technologies and capabilities from U.S. companies.Artificial IntelligenceArmed Forces Digital Advantage ActThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that incorporated language introduced on May 15, 2019, the Armed Forces Digital Advantage Act (S. 1471), which emphasizes digital engineering as a core competency of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and establishes a career track for computer scientists in the military. This effort would modernize the DoD workforce by adding a recruitment focus and establishing military career tracks for digital engineering that will provide incentives for service members to specialize in computer science and have accelerated promotion tracks. The language requires a Chief Digital Engineering Recruitment and Management Officer and a plan for each Service to establish new career tracks.As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly prioritized, computer coding skills should be treated similarly to mission-critical foreign language skills. In addition to building a younger generation of AI experts, this Act creates an avenue for educating mid-to-senior level leaders and policy makers about the importance of data. With mid-to-senior level leadership trained in AI and an appreciation for how data underlies AI, we have every opportunity to get ahead.Artificial Intelligence Commercial SolutionsThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that secured $7.5 million specifically for accelerating commercial AI solutions. The committee noted the importance of accelerating AI applications in support of the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center's (JAIC) National Mission Initiatives, including disaster response and predictive maintenance. Heinrich's language supports the use of commercial AI solutions and urges the Defense Innovation Unit to coordinate with the JAIC to identify problem sets facing the Department and to seek commercial AI solutions.U.S. Department of Defense Artificial Intelligence Investment InventoryThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich directing the Comptroller to brief the defense committees by September 1, 2019 on the total complement of artificial intelligence (AI) investments, to include PE and line numbers amounts with sufficient detail and description of those investments. Senator Heinrich is co-founder of the Senate Artificial Intelligence Caucus and believes it is important that the Department of Defense (DoD) have accurate insight to the nature and extent of investments in AI.National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence - Extension of AuthorityThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that extends the duration of the current Artificial Intelligence Commission in order to account for time lost due to the government shutdown.New Mexico Military Housing Reform and Contamination Clean-UpMilitary Housing ReformThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich that establishes a uniform code of basic housing standards and requires inspections to ensure compliance. This uniform code provides for safety, comfort, and habitability for military housing units and ensures the inspection of such units adhere to this standard. This is a critical step in addressing the problems associated with military housing around the world and ensuring our warfighters live in the healthy dwellings they deserve.The Senate Armed Services Committee NDAA takes other meaningful steps to address serious issues with the Military Housing Privatization Initiative, including: creating a Tenant Bill of Rights, setting up a dispute resolution process, and increasing oversight Holding private military housing companies accountable by instating new quality assurance and quality control measures and increasing health and hazard inspections Strengthening management of military housing by providing an additional $301.8 million to ensure each installation has the necessary government housing personnel to implement thorough oversight and planning measures.Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) Contamination CleanupThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich to address Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) contamination at Cannon Air Force Base. As a result of contamination, New Mexico dairy farmers' livelihoods are threatened. The contamination was caused by the U.S. Air Force, but the Air Force has not yet addressed immediate needs for filtration or long-term remediation. The legislative language provides the appropriate authorities to enable the Air Force to take action.Senator Heinrich also fought for the continued funding of the ongoing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention human health study on PFAS in drinking water. Heinrich secured an additional $10 million to the President's Budget to demonstrate and validate the most promising innovative technologies that can meet the U.S. Department of Defense's most urgent requirements, provide a return on investment, and are executed through a free and open competition. This funding helps ensure the safety and welfare of service members and their dependents by eliminating or reducing the generation of pollution and use of hazardous materials and reducing the cost of remedial actions and compliance with environmental laws and regulations, specifically as it relates to per- and polyfluoroakyl substances; develop, demonstrate, validate, and field fluorine-free firefighting foam; and long-term environmental threats to sustain training and testing ranges.New Mexico Military Energy ResilienceMilitary Environmental Research ProgramsThe Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment by Senator Heinrich and Senator Angus King (I-Maine) that would direct $10 million for development and demonstration of long-duration, on-site battery storage for distributed energy applications, $10 million for development, demonstration and validation of secure microgrids for both installations and forward operating bases, $10 million for development, demonstration, and validation of non-fluorine based firefighting foam and $5 million for development, demonstration, and validation of technologies that can harvest potable water from air.Aerospace Technology Development/DemonstrationSenator Heinrich secured an additional $5 million to fund the design and manufacturing of aircraft active winglets and aft body drag reduction devices, as well as high pressure compressor blade coatings that have demonstrated reduced drag, shown fuel savings, and decreased maintenance requirements. These small fins adhere to each side of the C-17's aft fuselage to reduce drag and have shown a 1.2 percent reduction in fuel burn at cruise. This results in a cost savings of about $10 million each year for the 40+ years of the fleet.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6775055 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: June 28, 2019End of Document

Huawei offers to meet with U.S. cybersecurity officialsFierceWirelessJune 4, 2019Copyright 2019 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 795 wordsByline: Matt Hamblen Highlight: Huawei would be willing to discuss ways to show it is meeting U.S. security standards suggested by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.BodyDONGGUAN, CHINA —Huawei cybersecurity officials this week outlined plans for bolstering security in Huawei products, arguing that software development needs to be improved throughout the telecom industry, not only at Huawei.In a related move, these Huawei officials also offered to meet with U.S. cybersecurity officials to gain more insight on specifically which Huawei security capabilities are lacking.The U.S. has claimed in recent months that the Chinese government can access data running on Huawei computers used by Huawei's customers, posing a national security threat. Among other measures, President Trump has imposed a ban that takes effect in August on U.S. companies supplying components to Huawei.RELATED:Commerce Dept. bans Huawei, 70 affiliates from sourcing U.S. componentsJeff Nan, senior expert for cybersecurity at Huawei, told reporters here that Huawei would like to meet U.S. security officials to discuss the U.S. security claims, but no such meeting has occurred. He said Huawei would be willing to discuss ways to show it is meeting U.S. security standards suggested by the National Institute of Standards and Technology as well as FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards).“The U.S. government hasn't used NIST to evaluate existing Huawei products and give objective insights,” he said. “We've not given up. We communicate with stakeholders in the U.S."But that apparently does not include the U.S. government security establishment.Martin Wang, director of Huawei's cybersecurity lab in Dongguan said an elaborate procedure for reviewing security and privacy of products such as smartphones and base stations was created in 2012. In 2013, the lab found 50 of 224 products reviewed could not proceed to market, about 30%, for various problems. That percentage dropped to 5% in 2014 and 0.1 % in 2019.Security in the UKHowever, concerns raised by the UK's Huawei Cybersecurity Evaluation Center (HCSEC) in March showed that dozens of Huawei products hadserious defects in software engineering and cybersecurity compromises.RELATED:U.K. says Huawei equipment has major security flawsHuawei quickly responded that it takes the findings seriously and has committed to a process of three to five years to rectify the problem, at a cost of more than $2 billion. But the latest HCSEC report found that despite numerous security concerns identified in the 2018 report, Huawei has made “no material progress” in addressing those issues.On Tuesday before a small group of U.S. reporters, Wang said the HCSEC findings “are not an issue faced by Huawei only but all others in the industry. We need to build the software engineering process and it's a challenge for all in the industry. Huawei will be seen as a leader.”He said Huawei carrier customers rated Huawei telecom equipment above the industry average in 2016 to 2018, according to an analysis by CFI Group.“We are determined to resolve the issues with organization, processes and our training program,” Wang added. Concerns raised by HCSEC and the U.S. government have steeled the resolve of cybersecurity personnel at Huawei, he said. “Our morale has never been better. We will fulfill our responsibility,” Wang added.Huawei's Dongguan campusThe Huawei executives spoke after reporters toured a new Huawei Bantian campus in Dongguan. The campus houses 18,000 R&D employees, which will reach 25,000 by next year. Buildings inspired by mainly Renaissance European architecture are arranged on hillsides and ponds, with mass dining halls for workers. A rail train built by a Swiss firm runs on tracks through eight zones (reaching a dozen next year) labeled Paris and Grenada, among others. Japanese architecture firm Nikken Sekkei designed the project.Joe Kelly, vice president of international media affairs for Huawei, said Huawei employees — now tallied at 188,000 globally —are “talking at the water cooler” about U.S. government criticism of Huawei security and related matters. “At lot of people didn't know what the issue was” at first, he added.Some company leaders had anticipated the criticism coming from the U.S. and some other governments, going back more than a year, partly because of Huawei's success in the global market, Kelly added. Huawei saw a 19% jump in revenues in 2018 to $107 billion, and saw a 39% hike in revenues in the first three months of 2019. “Employees are buoyed by the results,” Kelly said. First half 2019 revenues will be reported in July.Huawei has distributed 100,000 5G base stations and is working with 42 carriers to implement 5G, he added.“We have so many supporters, including carriers and governments, and that makes people feel good,” Kelly said. “We have no issue with the American people or American companies, just the American government.”Load-Date: June 11, 2019End of Document

A Tale of Two Surveillance StatesAtlantic OnlineMay 30, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 899 wordsByline: Derek ThompsonBodySubscribe to Crazy/Genius: Apple Podcasts |            Spotify |            Stitcher |            Google PlayUpdated at 1:23 p.m. ET on May 30, 2019.The Chinese government is brutalizing its Muslim Uyghur population in the western province of Xinjiang, in what Omer Kanat, the director of the Uyghur Human Rights Watch, calls a "genocide without the gas chambers." Up to 2 million Uyghurs are            reportedly being held in detention centers, where they have allegedly been separated from their families and in many cases tortured.This horrifying situation is built on the scaffolding of mass surveillance. Cameras fill the marketplaces and intersections of the key city of Kashgar. Recording devices are placed in homes and even in bathrooms. Checkpoints that limit the movement of Muslims are often outfitted with facial-recognition devices to vacuum up the population's biometric data. As China seeks to export its suite of surveillance tech around the world, Xinjiang is a kind of R&amp;D incubator, with the local Muslim population serving as guinea pigs in a laboratory for the deprivation of human rights.Nothing in the United States compares. But the use of novel surveillance tools to monitor, terrify, and even oppress minority citizens is not a foreign concept.The latest episode of Crazy/Genius, produced by Jesse Brenneman and Patricia Yacob, tells the tale of two surveillance states. The first is Xinjiang, China. The second is Brooklyn, New York. (Subscribe here.)This spring, I spoke with residents of Atlantic Plaza Towers, a rent-stabilized apartment complex in East Brooklyn. They have dealt with the omnipresence of security cameras in and around their home. "Once I walk out of my house, on the elevator, in the lobby, in between the buildings, in the supermarket, in the parking lot. I can go nowhere and not be watched," said Tranae Moran, a young mother. "It's almost like a panopticon complex, where they have every nook and cranny covered," said Fabian Rogers, a 23-year-old resident.Last fall the landlord, Nelson Management, mailed residents a letter announcing plans to install a facial-recognition-technology system at the entrance of the buildings. The letter asked tenants for their permission, but that request seemed less than genuine, for several reasons. Many tenants never received the letter-one of the mailrooms was under reconstruction, disrupting delivery services. Worse, after some residents met in the lobby to discuss the landlord's plan, they received a threatening letter from management warning them not to gather in public spaces again. (A lawyer told me the landlord's request violated the law.) Attached to the letter was a photo taken from a corner camera in the lobby. In black-pen ink, each resident in the photograph had been identified by his or her apartment number. Residents said the message was clear: Get with the program, or get out.Most of the residents of Atlantic Plaza Towers are black. The tenants I met said the threat of installing facial-recognition technology felt designed to scare them away to clear out space for richer, white tenants. "I think [management] wants a new look for the building, and that look does not look brown or any color like us," Moran said. "In China, they have facial-recognition technology that they're using to target communities of Muslim people. Sounds very similar to Brooklyn and gentrification.""You wouldn't do this to anyone in SoHo, in the Upper East Side, or in other gentrified communities," Rogers said. "So why do this to me? I'm not on parole. I'm not on house arrest. I don't have a collar on my neck or my ankles. Don't treat me like I'm an inmate."Nelson Management did not respond to requests for comment before publication. In an email on Thursday, a spokesperson for the landlord sent a statement. "Nelson Management Group prioritizes identifying and implementing cutting edge technology at all properties to create a safer environment for tenants and to provide the highest-quality housing in the rent-stabilized market," the statement said. "Since Nelson Management Group acquired Atlantic Plaza Towers in 2007, the resident turnover rate has been trending down to an average of 2.56% per annum." Nelson Management denied "claims that management are pursuing these safety upgrades at buildings for data harvesting."According to Mona Patel of Brooklyn Legal Services, the landlord may have another motive that's just as sinister as displacement: data harvesting. "The tenants in these two buildings are being exploited for their data," said Patel. "This is a new technology that hasn't been, as far as we know, tested in a residential complex. We haven't seen any validation studies proving it will accurately work for people of color. It almost feels like the tenants are the study."Nelson Management is not the Chinese Communist Party. And Atlantic Towers is not Xinjiang. But in both places, minorities are being surveilled with nascent technology and subjected to an organized effort to control their behavior.Citizens should have the right to make informed choices about participating in a brave new world of biometric data. It's comforting to pretend that the gravest threats from these technologies are only as close as a newspaper headline describing a distant world. But the project of protecting people from our own inventions is a project that begins at home.Load-Date: June 2, 2019End of Document

Premier, challenger defend Australian intel agency bossesAssociated Press InternationalMay 6, 2019 Monday 5:43 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 672 wordsByline: By ROD McGUIRK, Associated PressDateline: CANBERRA, Australia BodyCANBERRA, Australia (AP) - Australia's prime minister on Monday defended the nation's intelligence agency bosses after a former prime minister described them as "nutters" who have damaged bilateral relations with China.Former Prime Minister Paul Keating on Sunday urged his center-left Labor Party to "clean them out" - referring to the security agency chiefs - if Labor wins government at elections next week.Conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that Australian security agencies had prevented 15 terrorist attacks in Australia since the national threat level was increased in 2014."For what the Labor Party calls a Labor legend to go out there and attack the credibility of our security agencies that have been saving lives in this country, I think is very disappointing," Morrison told reporters.Labor leader Bill Shorten, whom opinion polls suggest will replace Morrison as prime minister after the May 18 election, distanced himself from Keating's comments."Paul Keating's an elder statesman of Australian politics, he's never been shy of saying what he thinks, but for myself and my opposition team, we've worked very well with the national security agencies," Shorten told reporters. "We, of course, will continue to take the professional advice of the people who help keep Australians safe."Keating, a 75-year-old who was prime minister from 1991 until 1996, made scathing comments about the Australian Security Intelligence Organization and the Australian Secret Intelligence Service during an interview televised by Australian Broadcasting Corp. after Labor's official campaign launch.Relations between Australia and its most important trading partner, China, became strained after former conservative Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced in 2017 plans to ban covert foreign interference in politics.The ban followed a classified report by China analyst John Garnaut that found the Chinese Communist Party for a decade had tried to influence Australian policy, compromise political parties and gain access to all levels of government.Keating said security agencies had "all gone berko" - a slang term meaning berserk - since Garnaut's report."When the security agencies are running foreign policy, the nutters are in charge," Keating said."They've lost their strategic bearings, these organizations," he added.Security agencies' advice has led to the government banning Chinese technology giant Huawei from involvement in Australia's national broadband network and the rollout of the upcoming 5G network.The agencies were also responsible for Australia this year stripping Chinese billionaire political donor Huang Xiangmo of permanent residency and rejecting his citizenship application.Keating said Australia's relations with China needed to be mended by a Labor government."There's healing to be done, but I think a Labor government would make a huge shift just really making the point that China's entitled to be there rather than being some illegitimate state that has to be strategically watched," Keating said.Shorten said a Labor government would put Australians' interests first in the bilateral relationship with China."There is a debate which says we shouldn't look at the rise of China solely through the prism of strategic risk," Shorten said. "We'll mind the security; we'll also make sure that we try and gain the best deal I can for Australian jobs, Australian exports, dealing with China and other Asian economies."Two opinion polls published on Monday showed that Labor is likely to win the election.A Newspoll published in The Australian newspaper showed that 51% of respondents supported Labor and 49% supported the conservative coalition.The poll was based on a nationwide weekend survey of 1,846 voters. It has a 2.3 percentage point margin of error.An Ipsos poll published in The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper found 52% support for Labor and 48% for the coalition.That poll was based on a nationwide survey of 1,200 voters from May 1 to 4. It has a 2.8 percentage point margin of error.Load-Date: May 7, 2019End of Document

Google puts in limbo Huawei and at the mercy of TrumpCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 20, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 867 wordsBody MEXICO CITY (Expansion) - Google announced the suspension of business with the Chinese Huawei technology immediately losing updates to its Android operating system and the next version of the same in smartphones that the Asian is about to launch on the market, so future users will not have Google Play Store and Gmail services.  But although Huawei have said that those who are currently users of the firm will have support, analysts estimate that the blow to the technology after the break goes beyond the updates for the user; his device business would be the most affected.  "This decision by Trump affects the entire chain but specifically the link of devices" commented Gonzalo Rojón, an analyst at the Competitive Intelligence Unit (CIU).  Interested in:  "It's a lethal blow when it comes to the device part. Huawei is not only a mobile device company, but the few companies that provide end-to-end solutions, give you from the team to the tower on the subject of mobile connectivity, "said Rojon.  Huawei is on the list of best-selling devices, below Samsung and Apple, however before this "fall" of Huawei by the US government measure remains the question about which company will benefit from this situation.  Until the first quarter of 2019 Huawei was positioned as the second manufacturer with the most sales worldwide with 59.1 million units sold and 19% market share; above it is only Samsung with 71.9 million units and 23.1% share, according to data from IDC Global.  The analyst said that after this Google action, all companies benefit: "Huawei is a company that has good devices and good prices but it is not the only one, there is also Samsung, Apple, LG, at the moment one disappears there is more brands. I would not say that Samsung was the beneficiary 100% but it will undoubtedly benefit, it is shared among all. "  Rojon, highlighted that Huawei was already growing strongly "so much so that it was going to equal or surpass Samsung worldwide".  In March of this year, the Asian company announced that the profits of 2018 increased 25% to 8,700 million dollars and although sales did not reach the previous forecast of the company, they increased by 19.5% 105,000 million dollars.  Read:  "The most serious thing is going forward for Huawei, this veto is made by Donald Trump and we do not know how much longer he has left," reiterated Rojón. He also said that it is necessary to see the reaction of more companies.  "The escalation of problems was already coming constantly and what perhaps was not expected (Huawei) is that Google would join in doing this; For a long time less devices were sold in North American stores, infrastructure operators, but Google cut the relationship, that surprised. Many more companies can make this a much bigger problem, an example is Microsoft that can be added in the case of computers, "Rojon said in an interview.  In this regard we must be waiting for the response from the Chinese government "the important thing is to see the retaliation that can be very high, most mobile devices are made in China," he says, since Huawei is one of the main brands in the Asian country and without a doubt this decision will affect more to the commercial war between both nations.  According to the analyst, if in November 2020 Donald Trump is not re-elected, there is the possibility that they will return to Google and Huawei relations: "It is an option, Google at least publicly what he has said is that there is a possibility that if Trump is no longer able to strengthen relations. "  If alreadyyou have one, you will not have problems  Although, the breakdown of both companies will have an impact on future updates of operating systems and applications, Huawei warned that it will continue to provide after-sales service, although without clarifying details of time and ways.  Huawei said in a statement that it will continue to provide security updates and after-sales services to all existing products of smartphones and tablets of the brand "including those that have already been sold and those that are available for sale."  For its part, a Google spokesman said: "We are complying with the request of the authorities and reviewing the relevant implications. For the users of our services, Google Play and the security protections of Google Play Protect will continue to work on existing Huawei devices "  We recommend:  Android is an operating system that currently works on 90% of smartphones, so not having constant updates in the future can have a considerable impact.  "The Android operating system is the most used globally and this network economy has many benefits, when you no longer have access to those benefits your phone no longer has the functionality it currently has," said the analyst.  "The statements say a lot and at the same time they say nothing, they will continue to provide after-sales service, but they do not specify what they are referring to, they do not say how long they will continue to have access to the store, that information will be seen in the next few hours and You will see if a Huawei phone will be unusable, however, you still do not have enough information, "Rojón told Expansión.  Read more: Load-Date: May 20, 2019End of Document

International Federation of Journalists: Hong Kong Demand Withdrawal of Extradition BillTargeted News ServiceJune 17, 2019 Monday 8:11 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 390 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: BRUSSELS, Belgium BodyThe International Federation of Journalists issued the following news release:Following a week of unrest and some of the largest demonstrations in Hong Kong's history, Chief Executive (CE) of Hong Kong Carrie Lam announced on Saturday that the controversial extradition bill will be suspended. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) urges the Hong Kong government to withdraw the bill and hold discussions with stakeholders and society.CE Lam made the announcement following days of large scale protests in Hong Kong, which also blocked access to the city's parliament. On June 12, several journalists and protesters were injured when police fired tear gas and rubber bullets into the crowds. Despite the announcement by CE Lam, over two million people took to the streets of Hong Kong Sunday demanding the government withdraw the bill immediately. The Civil human Rights Front (CHRF) estimated that 28.5% of the city' population took part in Sunday's protests.Since the protests started on June 9, it is estimated that over 80 protesters have been injured, while journalists and media have been harassed and attacked, targeted with rubber bullets and tear gas as they cover the demonstrations. On June 13, it was reported that secure communications platform Telegram suffered a major cyberattack originating from China. The platform was been used by people across Hong Kong during the protests.While the protests have received widespread coverage across the globe, media coverage in China has been largely non-existent. The People's Daily, which is seen as the unofficial mouthpiece of the Chinese Government, published a short opinion piece playing down the protests but has otherwise been silent. China's state broadcaster CCTV avoided the subject in its main news bulletins throughout the day on Sunday.The IFJ said: "We stand in solidarity with our colleagues in Hong Kong who continue to fight for their rights in Hong Kong. We call on the Hong Kong government to immediately withdraw the extradition bill and hold widespread consultations on the issue. Immediate action also needs to be taken to ensure the safety and security of the media as they cover public situations. The reports of harassment and attacks on the media for simply doing their job are unacceptable."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6762226 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: June 21, 2019End of Document

Your memories raise your voiceCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 12, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 740 wordsBody       MEXICO. Enter the premises and the suspicion dissipates. It is true, man and work are oneself. The rotund figure, the gray and disheveled beard, the casual sweatshirt and a cautious gait, clearly measuring the space and the hundreds of journalists who receive it, yes, like a rockstar. It is Ai Weiwei who enters the MUAC. In the mind of some appears the series of three portraits, in black and white, showing him loosely releasing a vase from the Han Dynasty that ends up undone on the floor. One of his best known works. In the case of others, with certainty, some of the headlines that in 2011 reported their arbitrary detention, captivity for 81 days and psychological torture by the Chinese Government appeared. Sculptor, modern master of the ready-made, photographer, blogger, dissident, filmmaker and activist, Ai rejects the simple classifications. "I'm not really interested if I'm an artist or not, maybe I'm a teacher of the Lego or the selfie, like Rembrandt was a master of oil painting and Andy Warhol of silkscreen," he says. line between artist and activist. The question of the laymen comes to mind because of a rather serious issue that Ai (China, 1957) deals with seriously after years immersed in trying to understand the implications of a tragedy that, well, well, Mexico does not finish explaining itself. In Room 9 of the MUAC, a mural or "altarpiece", as the curator of the enclosure, Cuauhtémoc Medina, shows the faces of the 43 normalistas of Ayotzinapa and the three others who were killed or incapacitated on September 26, 2014 The confusion of seeing those faces, so replicated in placards, t-shirts and protest posters, now constructed from toy blocks, with its pop and childish aura, dissipates with the artist's explanation. Since 2014, in a commission that he made in the former maritime prison of Alcatraz, Ai noticed the fact that the available photos of political prisoners and activists, especially those facing repression, are frequently blurred or of poor quality. The same thought with the photos of the 43. "I realized that if I use legos in pixelated images they will look fresh, defined, precisely characterized and, in addition, beautiful," he explains. A million pieces of Lego, assembled with the help of students from the Faculty of Architecture of the UNAM, now define the contours of the faces, as if this would seek, perhaps, to remember them more clearly. The show, which opens tomorrow, is called, for this and other pieces, Ai Weiwei. Reset memories. The expo will arrive to the regios through Marco in November. THE DETONANTE The artist's interest in the subject of memories came to him three years ago, when he was able to meet relatives of the normalistas who had disappeared at the Pro Human Rights Center. For Ai, who had already been raised the possibility of a sample in the MUAC, that meeting was the trigger of a long artistic process. During the subsequent years, in alliance with Mexican producers and filmmakers, he toured the country in silence and without media turbulence to conduct dozens of interviews with relatives, activists and journalists involved in the tragic case. The resulting documentary is entitled: Vivos. "Of course one could see those facts and could reach a sort of conclusion, but while talking to them, there is no bargaining: they believe they are alive," he says in a later meeting with a small group of media. "They think they're alive somewhere, if I were in their place, I'd believe it too, because that idea keeps those parents alive." The look of Ai in the film is shaped by compassion and understanding in a poetic search that comes from his father Ai Qing, a Chinese poet who spent 20 years in exile, banned during the Cultural Revolution. "I've always loved to make my work work like poetry," he explains. "TOSometimes I can achieve it, sometimes I do not, but poetry is the highest form of human thought. "But he is blunt, he says he would go mad if he lost his 10-year-old son." I would become a terrorist if they took him away, so I really have deep feelings for these people, "the Berlin-based creator launches, for him there is no doubt that the" historical truth "offered by the Mexican government is a sham and that the police and the army were involved in the tragedy of Iguala After leaving the MUAC, he has time to show his expertise with the selfie to whoever wants to ask for it There is no doubt: Ai Weiwei is in Mexico.       Load-Date: April 12, 2019End of Document

Apple and Google's App Stores Are Still Seeing Strong Growth -- Tech CheckRealMoneyApril 12, 2019 Friday 8:09 PM EDTCopyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 798 wordsByline: Eric JhonsaHighlight: Recent estimates indicate the App Store and Google Play both saw double-digit revenue growth in Q1. Google Play's revenue grew faster, but the App Store's revenue remains much higher.BodyApple and Google's App Stores Are Still Posting Solid Double-Digit GrowthApp analytics firms SensorTower and App Annie have each released estimates for Q1 spending on Apple  and Alphabet/Google's  lucrative app stores. And though their numbers differ a little, it's easy to spot some common trends.Though global smartphone sales have been declining in recent months,  total spending on the iOS App Store and Google Play rose 16.9% to $19.5 billion in Q1.  total spending on the App Stores rose 20% to over $22 billion. Previously, SensorTower estimated total App Store and Google Play spending  to $71.3 billion.Apple and Google, as a reminder, typically take a 30% cut on app store transactions such as paid downloads and in-app purchases, and cuts ranging from 15% to 30% on subscription payments made through their platforms.SensorTower and App Annie both think Google Play spending grew faster than App Store spending in Q1, but also that App Store spending remained much higher -- depite the fact that Google Play is now easily handling more than twice as many app downloads. SensorTower thinks App Store revenue rose 15% to $12.4 billion, and that Google Play revenue rose 20.2% to $7.1 billion. Apple's  help out here, as does the fact that the App Store, unlike Google Play, operates in China.China, it's worth adding, appears to have been a headwind for the App Store in Q1. SensorTower estimates App Store downloads fell 21% annually in China, but were up 3.6% elsewhere. The Chinese government's 2018 halt on game monetization approvals (it  in Q1) has weighed on the country's game developers and app stores. One thing to watch going forward: How much Apple's  , which launches this fall and will provides access to over 100 games lacking ads or in-game purchases, will weigh on App Store gaming revenue. SensorTower estimates games accounted for over two-thirds of the App Store's Q1 revenue. Much as it was ready to cannibalize iTunes music download revenue via Apple Music subscriptions, Apple now seems ready to cannibalize some of its App Store gaming revenue via Arcade subscriptions. Tesla's Latest Moves Suggest It's Scrambling to Prop Up Margins Hardly a week passes at this point during which Tesla  doesn't make some kind of meaningful change to how its cars are priced and/or sold.  , Elon Musk's company:  Announced that the recently-launched, Standard Range version of the Model 3 will no longer be sold online, nor will the long-range, rear-wheel drive version of the sedan. Tesla, which  said it's shifting to an online-only sales model, now says customers will have to call Tesla or visit a retail store to buy those two cars. Began offering leasing options for Model 3 trims. Tesla says customers can choose between annual mileage options of 10,000, 12,000 and 15,000 miles, while adding they won't be able to buy their car once their lease is up, since Tesla plans to use the cars to support its planned driverless ride-hailing service. Announced that all vehicles will now be sold with Tesla's Autopilot system enabled, and that prices are being hiked as a result. Tesla notes that the Standard Plus version of the Model 3, which previously had a $37,500 base price with Autopilot costing an extra $3,000, will now cost $39,500. One clear takeaway from the changes is that Tesla, though having gotten a boost lately from the start of European and Chinese Model 3 sales, is still scrambling to turn a profit at a time when sales of its costlier Model S sedan and Model X crossover  .Ending online sales for the Standard Range version of the Model 3, which had a $35,000 base price before the Autopilot-related price hike and had long faced questions about its margin profile, very much feels like a move meant to boost Tesla's gross margin. So does hiking vehicle prices across the board while making Autopilot standard, given that Autopilot has been activated via software -- the hardware has been included within Tesla cars whether or not it has been activated -- and thus costs virtually nothing for Tesla to enable.And by refusing to give consumers who lease the Model 3 the option to buy the car, Tesla seems to be deliberately trying to limit leasing activity -- and thus the capital needed to support its leasing business -- in the wake of a Q1 for which the company has suggested it posted a loss.None of this is too encouraging for a company that still has an enterprise value (market cap plus net debt) that's around $57 billion. One doesn't have to buy into the predictions of imminent doom made by some die-hard Tesla bears to remain cautious about its stock (in spite of its recent selloff) on account of the company's recent sales trends, profit commentary and sales and pricing actions.To see Tech Check coverage from the previous trading day,  .Load-Date: April 13, 2019End of Document

FCC Chairman Pai Issues Remarks at U.S.-India Business Council India Ideas SummitTargeted News ServiceJune 12, 2019 Wednesday 1:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1605 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Federal Communications Commission issued the following remarks by Chairman Ajit Pai at the U.S.-India Business Council India Ideas Summit:* * *- Strategies for Successful Digital Infrastructure Deployment* * *"Good afternoon. It's great to be with you today, and it's an honor to be a part of this impressive lineup. You're barely three hours into this summit, and you've already heard from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the Governors of Kentucky and New Jersey, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and NASDAQ CEO Adena Friedman. Who do you have lined up for Day Two? Perhaps the Indian Avengers? Priyanka Chopra, Salman Khan, and Virat Kohli? The bar has been set high, but with my fellow panelist, Sudhanshu Vats, and moderator Jim Taiclet, I think we're up to the challenge. I actually have a story to share about Jim's company, American Tower."Last October, I had the opportunity to attend the India Mobile Congress in New Delhi. During this trip, I visited a dusty neighborhood outside New Delhi, where I checked out an American Tower cell site. This cell site provides wireless coverage to thousands of people for whom a mobile phone is their only digital access to the outside world. And the fiber that feeds the site is used for Internet kiosks for teaching math and reading to kids in impoverished areas. As a person of South Asian descent, I can't describe what it meant to see Indian kids eager for the opportunity to learn and improve their lives."To me, this site visit perfectly captures the value of the U.S.-India Business Council and the collaboration it promotes. American Tower benefits from the opportunity to expand its business to a new market. And the people of India benefit from expanded access to modern communications. Everyone is better off."The chance to promote mutual growth and prosperity is why I'm excited to work with groups like the USIBC and my peers in India's government. On my first international trip as Chairman of the FCC, I met with my Indian counterpart, the Chairman of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, R.S. Sharma. We charted a plan for enhanced collaboration and signed a Letter of Intent for cooperation between the two agencies. Since then, our two agencies have increased our cooperation, regularly exchanging information and sharing ideas on topics of mutual interest, like advancing broadband deployment and attacking robocalls. I'm grateful for the opportunity to meet with you today and continue to build on this foundation."You've already had a couple of presentations about promoting technology and innovation--in particular, Sundar Pichai's discussion on "Ushering in a Connected Future." So by now, you should have a pretty high-level picture of the opportunities than digital technologies can open up and why it matters. For this session, we're going to get deeper in the weeds to talk about how to deploy the physical infrastructure that makes this innovation possible."In thinking about what areas to highlight, I thought that I would use the Indian government's National Digital Communications Policy as my guide. Released in September 2018, the strategy is organized around three central pillars: Connect India; Propel India; Secure India. I think this is a useful way to think about our own work at the FCC. I'll talk about strategies we are pursuing to make sure everyone can access modern communications--connect; to unleash next-generation technologies--propel; and to guard against threats to our networks-- secure."Let's start with connect. In the U.S., we believe that a competitive free market is the most powerful force we have for driving network investment."That's why the FCC has removed many regulatory barriers to lower costs and speed up the process of building broadband infrastructure. To make it easier to install wireless infrastructure like small cells, we set a reasonable deadline for cities to rule on siting applications and reasonable limits on siting fees. We also eliminated federal red tape to make sure that infrastructure the size of a pizza box won't face the same regulatory review as a 200-foot tower. We also convened a panel of outside experts from industry, state and local government, and the non-profit community. We call it our Broadband Deployment Advisory Council. Among other things, it laid the foundation for the FCC to enact a groundbreaking reform known as "onetouch- make-ready," which made it much easier for competitive broadband providers to attach fiber to utility poles."We've also modernized rules to make it easier for carriers to transition from maintaining yesterday's copper networks to building tomorrow's fiber networks. And we scrapped utility style broadband regulation inspired by rules from the 1930s."There is plenty of evidence that our policies are working. In 2018, fiber was deployed to more new homes in the United States than any year ever. Small-cell deployment more than quadrupled. Average broadband speeds are up 40% year over year. And just this week, we learned that investment in broadband networks was up about $3 billion in 2018, the second consecutive annual increase. This is particularly notable since network investment fell in 2015 and 2016, the last two years of the prior Administration."Of course, despite the good news, millions of Americans still live in rural areas where there is currently no business case for the private sector alone to build broadband networks. As is the case in parts of Assam, Uttarakhand, and Karnataka, we have communities in Alaska, Utah, and Kansas that don't have access. To connect these communities, the FCC's Universal Service Fund provides federal subsidies to private carriers to leverage additional investment. We've begun allocating some of this support by using a reverse auction, which harnesses market forces and a diverse array of technologies to maximize the impact and efficiency of this investment. Indeed, just this week, we authorized $167 million in universal service subsidies to connect 60,000 unserved rural homes and businesses in some of the hardest-to-connect corners of the country."Obviously, India's connectivity challenges are significantly different in nature and scale. "I commend Prime Minister Modi and the Indian government for their ambitious goals of universal Internet access by 2022 and fixed broadband access to 50% of households by 2022. To meet these targets, they're pursuing bold strategies such as installing two million public Wi-Fi hotspots in rural areas and redesigning and expanding the Universal Service Obligation Fund."Turning from "connect," there is our work to propel next-generation technologies, specifically 5G. Many of the actions I already mentioned to speed wireless infrastructure deployment are part of what we call our 5G FAST plan. Another part of our plan is making additional spectrum available for 5G. Already this year, we've held spectrum auctions in the 28 GHz and 24 GHz bands. On December 10, we'll be launching a single auction of 3,400 MHz of spectrum in the 37, 39, and 47 GHz bands. We've also been working to repurpose mid-band spectrum for 5G. Among other steps, we will be holding an auction in the 3.5 GHz band next year. We think 5G could be transformative, enabling things like telemedicine and precision agriculture, automotive safety and gaming, industrial IoT and other breakthroughs we can't even conceive today. We want to set the stage for this innovation and see what develops."Finally, I'll briefly highlight some of the things we're doing to make sure our communications networks are secure. One of our top priorities is to protect the security and integrity of the communications supply chain. That's why the FCC has proposed to prohibit the use of the broadband funding we administer to purchase equipment or services from any company that poses a national security threat to the integrity of United States communications networks or the communications supply chain. That's why the FCC denied the application of China Mobile USA, a wireless carrier ultimately owned by the Chinese government, to provide international telecommunications services in the United States. And that's why last month, I was honored to be part of the United States delegation that traveled to Prague for an important conference on how best to secure our 5G networks. This meeting featured government officials from more than 30 countries, as well as industry leaders. And at this gathering, we were able to develop a set of consensus best practices for 5G security."When making decisions that impact 5G security, in particular, we need to remember that the implications are wide-ranging. 5G will affect our militaries, our industries, our critical infrastructure, and much more. The procurement and deployment decisions made now will have a generational impact on our security, economy, and society."When it comes to 5G, we cannot afford to make risky choices and just hope for the best. We must see clearly the threats to the security of our networks and act to address them. And the more that allies like the United States and India can work together and make security decisions based on shared principles, the safer that our 5G networks will be."These are just some of the strategies we are pursuing at the FCC to enable our citizens to benefit from the digital revolution. I look forward to exploring other strategies with you today, and working with you and others in the days ahead to connect, to propel, and to secure the digital future of the United States and India--two strong allies and two good friends."Copyright Targeted News Services11R-Swain-6757854 11R-SwainLoad-Date: June 16, 2019End of Document

Continue reading Huawei executive accused of helping steal trade secretsA Huawei executive was involved in a plot to steal trade secrets, claims California-based electronics startup CNEX Labs. Chinese telecommunications company Huawei and CNEX   which was co-founded by a former Huawei employee   have filed dueling lawsuits over trade secret theft. Now, The Wall Street Journalreports that high-level Huawei figure Eric Xu has been accused of helping oversee an alleged conspiracy.The Journal quotes a newly released hearing transcript that offers some details in a largely locked-down trial. According to its write-up, CNEX claims that Xu   one of Huawei s rotating chairmen    directed a Huawei engineer to analyze Cnex s technical information.  The engineer then allegedly posed as a potential CNEX customer to obtain details about its operations. CNEX also says that Xu was briefed on a plot to surreptitiously gather information from Xiamen University, which had obtained a computer memory board from CNEX.According to the Journal, Huawei lawyers admitted that Xu had been  in the chain of command that had requested  information about CNEX, but they denied that any trade secrets had been stolen. Huawei and CNEX didn t immediately respond to requests for comment from The Verge.This is probably not Huawei s biggest problem right nowHuawei originally filed a lawsuit against CNEX co-founder Yiren  Ronnie  Huang in 2017, claiming Huang   who left Huawei in 2013   had poached employees and used its patents to build CNEX s solid-state drive technology. CNEX counter-sued, claiming that Huawei had misappropriated its tech and was trying to gather even more information through the lawsuit.Right now, the case likely isn t Huawei s most pressing problem. President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order that let him ban American companies from dealing with Huawei   partly because of fears that the company s telecom infrastructure contained security exploits that the Chinese government could use for espionage, but possibly also as retaliation against China amid an ongoing trade war. Either way, Google revoked Huawei s Android license, ARM cut ties with the company, and Microsoft has distanced itself as well. Meanwhile, another Huawei executive was arrested last year on suspicion of violating sanctions against Iran.A trial over CNEX s claims is scheduled to start on June 3rd in Texas.Tags: See Campaign:https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/22/18636237/huawei-cnex-trade-secrets-lawsuit-eric-xu-accusation-trial-hearingContact Information:Adi RobertsonTags:,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            Wire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: May 25, 2019End of Document

Continue reading Far-right extremists keep evading social media bansWhen Facebook told me this morning that it would ban Alex Jones and Infowars from its platform, my initial reaction was one of deja vu. Haven't we been through this before? Indeed, it was nine months ago that Facebook first acted to remove Jones' public page, after previously suspending him.But banning a Jones page and removing Jones' network are different things. And despite Facebook's move   along with many other tech platforms   to remove his influence, Jones continued to thrive. It was only in February when Facebook found another 22 pages related to him and his businesses. And while his diminished reach has certainly limited his ability to attract new followers and profit from vile conspiracy theories, he has continued to have a home even in places where he was supposed to be unwelcome.That's what makes today's move by Facebook an important escalation of the effort to scrub Jones from social networks. The company has officially designated him   along with fellow extremist influencers Louis Farrakhan, Paul Nehlen, Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph Watson, Laura Loomer, and Infowars itself   as dangerous individuals and organizations. From my story today in The Verge: We've always banned individuals or organizations that promote or engage in violence and hate, regardless of ideology,  the company said in a statement.  The process for evaluating potential violators is extensive and it is what led us to our decision to remove these accounts today.  [ ]As some observers pointed out, it's quite a stretch for Facebook to say that it has  always banned  people who promote hate.  Always  is offensive here to the individuals who've had to spend countless hours pointing out clear rule violations,  Charlie Warzel tweeted.And the actual ban took longer than expected. Facebook began removing accounts at 10:30AM PT on Thursday, but some accounts remained up for an hour or more, Paris Martineau reported in Wired.Asked about the  banned  accounts remaining active for an hour or more after the ban was disclosed, the Facebook spokesperson said it was the result of a plan gone awry. Facebook had originally intended for the six users and Infowars to be banned from the platform and told of the ban before they read about it in the press.However, actually scrubbing all of the accounts from the platforms took much longer than Facebook had anticipated, the spokesperson said, leading to more than an hour of lag time in some cases.Some reporters made hay of the fact that in delaying the actual ban, some of the affected accounts were able to change their bios to promote other remaining social presences, such as an email newsletter or a Telegram account. While that's unfortunate, any superfan making hourly visits to the Facebook or Instagram page of any of these accounts almost certainly would have found those other social presences somehow through other means.Of greater concern, I think, is that Jones in particular continued to thrive on Facebook for nearly a year after he was purportedly banned. The other extremists who lost their accounts benefited similarly from Facebook's excessively deliberate approach to enforcing its own policies. How many followers did they accrue over the past year, thanks in part to Facebook's own viral sharing mechanics? How much farther did their ideology spread around the world than it otherwise might have?One heartening aspect of today's bans is the reasoning behind them. From my story again:First in December and again in February, Jones appeared in videos with Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes. Facebook has designated McInnes as a hate figure.Yiannopoulos publicly praised McInnes and British far-right activist Tommy Robinson, who Facebook has designated as a hate figure.Loomer appeared with McInnes in December, and more recently declared her support for far-right activist Faith Goldy, who was banned after posting racist videos to her account.In citing those examples, Facebook has acknowledged that right-wing extremism is a global network, in which the most prominent influencers regularly collaborate and promote each other. By banning the extremists because they collaborated, Facebook both begins to root out its hate-speech network and discourage others from joining in. (Let's hope YouTube is paying attention here.)But perhaps the biggest lesson to learn here is that banning an account is not a one-time action. Jones' existence on Facebook has lasted for nearly a year since the ban hammer first came down. Keeping these extremists off the network is going to be an ongoing challenge. Here's hoping Facebook is up to it.DemocracyExclusive: New privacy oversight on the table for Facebook, ZuckerbergNancy Scola reports that the FTC's proposed settlement with Facebook over privacy violations would require the company to take several steps in addition to paying a fine:The steps, which are subject to change until a deal is final, would include appointing a federally approved privacy official at the social network and creating an  independent  privacy oversight committee that may include Facebook board members, said the person, who requested anonymity because the discussions are ongoing.Separately, Facebook Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg would take on the role of  designated compliance officer  responsible for carrying out the company's privacy policies, the person said. That would make him personally accountable for Facebook's handling of the issue.Facebook users are posting videos of themselves lighting wood on fire to spread hoaxes about the Notre Dame fireDaniel Funke reports on a conspiracy theory related to the cathedral burning that is spreading on Facebook:The videos, which together had more than 5 million views as of publication, depict internet users trying to ignite the wood as part of a conspiracy theory about the origin of the Notre Dame fire in Paris more than two weeks ago. Since the oaks beams wouldn't burn, both Facebook and YouTube users claimed that the cathedral's destruction could not possibly have been an accident   it had to be a criminal act.It wasn't, both the Agence France-Presse and Le Monde's Les Décodeurs have reported. But that hasn't stopped the user-generated videos from getting massive reach on Facebook   more than 200 times more likes, shares and comments than the two fact checks combined.Googlers Protest Retaliation; Even Some Facebook Staff Join FrayInteresting detail in Bloomberg's story on the Google protest of retaliation against walkout organizers:Facebook employees associated with Workers for Workers, an advocacy group for contingent workers at the social network, posted anonymous stories about retaliation on its website on Wednesday. Outside the company's office in San Francisco, organizers with Unite Here, a service worker union, passed out flyers accusing FlagShip Facility Services, a vendor that staffs Facebook's cafeteria, with firing an employee for labor activism.  Since winning union recognition, FlagShip management has disciplined several of our union's key leaders,  the flyer read. Unite Here representatives declined to comment, citing ongoing bargaining discussions.A Google Scion Is Starting A New Publication With Focus On International Tech IssuesSophie Schmidt, daughter of longtime Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt, is coming after this newsletter with a new publication, Joseph Bernstein reports:The publication, which does not yet have a name or any full-time staffers aside from Schmidt, will be  focused on exploring the surprising and complex effects of technology internationally, specifically outside the US and Europe,  the source wrote in an email to BuzzFeed News.  We're most curious about human impact: social, cultural and political phenomena driven by the interaction between new tech and different cultures, institutions and norms abroad. California synagogue shooting casts harsh light on mutual-fund darling CloudflareTim McLaughlin and Ross Kerber examine Cloudflare's decision to continue providing service to 8Chan as it has become a more prominent home of terrorist content:The alleged gunman who killed one person and wounded three at a San Diego synagogue on Saturday, as well as one who massacred 50 people at New Zealand mosques in March, had posted hate-filled screeds on the 8chan message board, a Cloudflare client. The man accused of killing 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue in October did likewise on Gab, also a Cloudflare client, according to Internet records.Cloudflare helped both those sites mask their real Internet protocol addresses. The service obfuscates where its customers are hosted, making it more difficult to hold them accountable, said Micah Schaffer, a technology policy consultant and former Snap Inc executive.How Mass Surveillance Works in Xinjiang, China:  Reverse Engineering' Police App Reveals Profiling and Monitoring StrategiesHuman Rights Watch deconstructs the mobile app that Chinese law enforcement uses to connect to the Integrated Joint Operations Platform,  the Xinjiang policing program that aggregates data about people and flags those deemed potentially threatening.  It's the program used to create a surveillance state for 13 million Uighur Muslims: Our research shows, for the first time, that Xinjiang police are using illegally gathered information about people's completely lawful behavior   and using it against them,  said Maya Wang, senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch.  The Chinese government is monitoring every aspect of people's lives in Xinjiang, picking out those it mistrusts, and subjecting them to extra scrutiny. ElsewhereFacebook Building Cryptocurrency-Based Payments SystemAnnaMaria Andriotis, Liz Hoffman, Peter Rudegeair, and Jeff Horwitz have new details on Facebook's payment plans:Facebook aims to wiggle more deeply into the lives of its users. It is building a type of checkout option that users could port around the internet, some of the people said. Similar to how a Facebook profile can be used to log into hundreds of websites (including The Wall Street Journal), Facebook envisions allowing those credentials to be selected as a payment method when users buy goods online.One idea under discussion is Facebook paying users fractions of a coin when they view ads, interact with other content or shop on its platform not unlike loyalty points accrued at retailers, some of the people said.Making Facebook more ephemeral could make it harder to fact-check false claimsDaniel Funke considers the impact of Facebook's move to make messages disappear after a limited period of time:He agreed that ephemeral content, like word-of-mouth communications, can convey errors that are hard to correct, but said the limited audience can circumscribe the damage.  On balance,  he said,  I think Facebook's move is promising because it breaks away from Facebook's current model of rewarding sensationalist viral content. A Former Alt-Right Member's Message: Get Out While You Still CanRosie Gray profiles Katie McHugh, a former far-right activist who now regrets her time with the movement: People like me should be given a chance to recognize how bad this is and that the alt-right is not a replacement for any kind of liberal democracy whatsoever, any kind of system; they have no chance, and they're just harmful,  McHugh said.  There is forgiveness, there is redemption. You have to own up to what you did and then forcefully reject this and explain to people and tell your story and say,  Get out while you can.' Unraveling Mark Zuckerberg's Secret Deal for a $59 Million Tahoe CompoundFacebook's CEO has a fancy new property in Lake Tahoe, Katherine Clark reports:A few months ago, the 34-year-old CEO of Facebook quietly closed on $59 million worth of real estate on the West Shore of Lake Tahoe, a popular vacation destination for Northern Californians. And he's looking to buy more, according to people familiar with the transactions, reported here for the first time.The deals were kept under wraps through the use of a limited-liability company, a high-end wealth manager and a series of nondisclosure agreements, which even required that listing pictures of the homes be removed from the internet.Jack Dorsey Is Gwyneth Paltrow for Silicon ValleyNellie Bowles examines the Twitter CEO's improbable rise as a lifestyle guru.Just as an endorsement from Ms. Paltrow can make even the most spurious self-help objects instantly covetable, an endorsement from Mr. Dorsey can put products out of stock for weeks. We're just really glad he's spreading the message,  said Harpreet Rai, the chief executive of Oura Ring, which makes a sleep tracking device Mr. Dorsey endorsed.LaunchesGoogle's latest AI art project turns your face into a  poem portrait'Sure, why not:Google is always sponsoring weird and inventive projects with the help of artificial intelligence, and its latest is characteristically odd. Named PoemPortraits, the web app takes a word of your suggestion and combines it with a selfie to create the eponymous poem portrait. Basically, it's an Instagram filter paired with a few lines of AI-generated poetry.TakesFacebook is trying to make the word  private  meaninglessCasey Johnston takes issue with Facebook's rather narrow definition of  privacy. What his presentation elided was the fact that Facebook does not need to see the content of what people are saying in order to advertise to them. The metadata   who, or what (as in a business), you're talking to, and even where you are or what time the conversation is taking place as it comes together with other pieces of information   provides more than enough information to make a very educated guess about what you're interested in, to the point that knowing specifically what you are saying adds almost nothing.The value of metadata, not just in advertising but in building an understanding of a person, has been well-studied for years; Facebook is neither inventing it nor even just beginning to use it. It's easy to forget that while Facebook builds all of these  private  features into its own products, it still has not only an immense body of information that we gave to it freely in its earlier days, but also an extremely robust tracking apparatus across the entire Internet.I Trashed the Sonic Movie Trailer And I Already Regret ItWhen anything happens online, lots of folks rush to Twitter to make fun of it. Brian Altano mocked the (admittedly bizarre) trailer for an upcoming movie about a popular video game hedgehog, but now he has regrets:Why did I even do that? What did I even gain from amplifying such a miserably negative take for thousands of people to see? I don't want to be known for that. I probably won't even see this movie. I don't even care if this thing is good or bad. At best I'll be on a cross country flight a year from now and I'll see most of it out of the corner of my eye on somebody else's screen. I liked some Sonic games when I was a kid, but why does it matter if his first live action movie looks weird or stupid? It's not even for me. I'm in my thirties. I'm tired constantly. I spent the last thirty minutes at my Endgame screening thinking about when I could go to the bathroom. What am I gaining from trashing this kid's movie anyway?Being critical of things is good. Analyzing why things work or don't work is necessary with all types of art. Calling out things that are problematic and confronting things that are reprehensible with deliberation and nuance is an important part of what defines us as humans. On the flip side, being mean just for the sake of it feels cheap and easy. Everybody should be allowed to dump a point or two into their own  dickhead skill tree.  Maxing it out feels as dirty and obnoxious as the rewards it yields.And finally  Authorities: Alleged Russian spy whale is refusing to leave and seeking Norwegians' devotionEarlier this week in this space I noted the discovery of Russia's latest platform interference   a beluga spy whale that turned up in Norway. Today Rick Noack reports that the whale appears to have defected:An alleged Russian spy whale is refusing to leave a Norwegian port city, in what appears to be a high-profile defection after a week of global attention on the unnamed beluga.Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries official Jorgen Ree Wiig told The Washington Post that the beluga  was the first thing I saw outside of the window  of his patrolling ship in the morning. Speaking from the city of Hammerfest, he said the whale had moved only about 25 nautical miles within the last week and appeared to enjoy the proximity to humans, which he noted was  strange  for a beluga.Getting really excited about the movie version of this one.Talk to meSend me tips, comments, questions, and jury duty stories: casey@theverge.comTags:  See Website:            https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/5/3/18527590/facebook-alex-jones-laura-loomer-ban-evasionContact Information:Casey NewtonTags:           Wire,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: May 3, 2019End of Document

Summary of the feasibility study, an incomplete SWOT analysisCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 13, 2019 SaturdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 552 wordsBody Last Thursday, at 2:31 pm, the "public" agenda of the Presidency arrived via email. The call was for 3:00 pm, -29 minutes after the invitation arrived- at the Logistics Center for Humanitarian Assistance in Panama Pacifico. The reason: the presentation of the Panama-David Train Feasibility Study. Then, President Juan Carlos Varela would travel to Veraguas to reiterate the presentation.  Last Monday, April 8, this medium had published a note entitled 'They ask to raise a reservation on the feasibility study of the Panama-Chiriqui train', where several experts in the matter asked the Government to ponder well the convenience of the work, but especially that the feasibility study was made public.  Among them, the former president of the Panamanian Chamber of Construction (Capac), Manuel González Ruiz; the economist and author of the book 'La Ruta de la Seda y Panamá, Eddie Tapiero and the economist Aníbal Culiolis.  The tour was given. President Juan Carlos Varela and the Presidency of the Republic flooded their Twitter accounts with photos of the events held last Thursday. A tweet from the agent's account, posted at 6:41 pm, announced the presentation of the 'study summary'. He even posted a video with basic details of the project, such as the 21 stations and the speed of the electric train that would travel 391.3 kilometers (km) at a maximum speed of 160 km per hour. 'EXECUTIVE PRESENTATION' However, what was presented by the Government last Thursday was an "executive presentation", in the words of the engineer and also manager of Tocumen SA, Óscar Ramírez, who is at the head of the commission that carried out the feasibility study.  'The feasibility study is under review and until that review is passed it will not be made public. We have presented it in Chiriquí, in David, in Veraguas, Azuero and soon in Penonomé, but it is a global executive presentation of the study, "he confirmed by telephone to La Estrella de Panamá.  The official reiterated that the presentation does not go into specific or technical details. "We are making the executive presentation, but the same document will be released after the reviews the experts are doing," he continued.  Varela emphasized five pillars that underpin the railway project: efficiency in public services, mobility, valuation of public and private properties, tourism and enhancement of the Canal's maritime route and logistics centers.  At a cost of $ 4,100 million, 'it is feasible for social profitability', says the official statement of the Presidency, which is accompanied by photographs in which appears, next to the head of state, the ambassador of the People's Republic of China in Panama, Wei Qiang.  The study was carried out by China Railway Design Corporation, with non-reimbursable cooperation funds from the Chinese government after the signing of several agreements between the two countries in the light of diplomatic relations re-established in June 2017.  The work is publicized by the Government as part of the initiative of the Strip and the Route, which runs the Asian country on several continents to connect production roads and markets.  For Central America, this train would be the first link to connect a market of 50 million people that, virtually, to reach Mexico, would add another 130 million people. Load-Date: April 13, 2019End of Document

Continue reading The real bias on social networks isn't against conservativesToday Senate Republicans held a hearing titled  Stifling Free Speech: Technological Censorship and the Public Discourse.  It was the second such hearing to be held in Congress in the past six months   in September, House Republicans put on a similar show, lambasting Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.Makena Kelly took one for the team and watched it:Representatives from Facebook and Twitter sparred with Republican lawmakers for hours at the Senate hearing where Cruz, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's panel on the Constitution, pressured industry representatives over deep concerns he and his colleagues have that social media platforms actively censor conservative political speech. But all of the evidence Republicans provided were anecdotal stories that representatives from the companies were able to clearly explain away by citing their respective content policies or investigations into specific takedowns. [ ]The entire premise of the hearing, conservative bias, was rebuked by the subcommittee's ranking member Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI), who was one of only two Democrats who took their seat at the dais throughout the hearing.  We cannot simply allow the Republican Party to harass tech companies into weakening content moderation policies that already fail to remove hateful, dangerous, and misleading content,  Hirono said.  If conservatives have had their content removed, maybe they should look at the content they're posting.  Maybe look at the content you're posting  is a good burn indeed from the senator. It underscores the most galling thing about these hearings, which is the way they take as a given the conspiracy theory that platforms are attempting to undermine them without.To the extent that these hearings have any basis in actual events, as Hirono notes, they tend to involve isolated cases in which some conservative-leaning person or organization is temporarily suspended from a service, or does not appear in search results, or is not being promoted sufficiently by a site's recommendation features. And while unintentional bias often is baked into algorithms, as this recent study of Facebook's ad products suggests, no research has ever suggested that Republicans have been disadvantaged on social media platforms.In fact, as I often like to point out, Fox News typically gets more engagement on Facebook than any other publisher. Still, that's just one data point. How do partisan pages fare across the social network?A study today published by Media Matters for America attempts to answer that question. Over 37 weeks, the authors measured engagement   likes, comments, and shares   across left- and right-leaning pages. What did they find?Right-leaning pages earned on average about 372,000 weekly interactions and left-leaning pages earned on average about 369,000 weekly interactions.Partisan pages also outperformed pages that are not politically aligned, earning a piddling 283,000 weekly interactions. (The study isn't about how hard it is to reach an audience on Facebook these days, though it certainly makes the case: a post from a partisan page reached just 0.17 percent of its followers, and a post from a non-partisan page reached 0.07 percent. Thank you, Facebook Journalism Project!)The results of the study are consistent with the results of a similar exercise undertaken by Media Matters last year. That study, which measured engagement on the same set of pages over the previous six months, found that right-leaning pages had a nearly identical average rate of interactions with left-leaning pages. It also found that the right-leaning pages it studied earned 51 percent more total interactions than left-leaning pages.The truth is that social networks have been a boon to partisans of every stripe   conservatives especially. A conservative social media star became the president of the United States   and a liberal social media star seems well on her way to higher office, despite being in her first term in Congress. The real bias of social networks, as Mark Zuckerberg has acknowledged, is toward the extremes. And any moves Facebook has taken so far to reduce that polarization seem to have had little effect.There are many legitimate questions about the effects of big social networks on our democracy. Whether they have been engineered to silence conservative voices is simply not one of them.DemocracyFacebook and the 2020 Election: The Tech Giant Backs Away From Democratic DebatesFour years ago, Facebook co-sponsored the Republican debates and partnered with CNN on an election road show that ended at a Democratic candidate debate. Not this time, Maxwell Tani reports:According to several people involved with the planning debates for the Democratic primary, Facebook will not be a major participant in the first several events. Neither CNN or MSNBC are currently working with the company for the first debates, and sources at both networks said there are no current plans for a significant role for the platform either.Twitter removes Trump's video featuring music from The Dark Knight for copyright infringementWell this is a lot:Twitter late Tuesday evening removed a video tweeted out by President Donald Trump's official account because it contained music from Warner Bros. Pictures' The Dark Knight Rises, the final film in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. According to both The HillBuzzFeed News, the producers of the short clip did not acquire the license to use the song, resulting in Warner Bros. filing a copyright claim. Twitter then removed the video hours later for violating its policies around copyrighted material.Apple Music in China removes Jacky Cheung song with reference to Tiananmen massacreHolmes Chan reports on the latest incidence of Apple censoring its music library to remain on good terms with the Chinese government:Apple Music has removed a song by Hong Kong singer Jacky Cheung from its Chinese streaming service, with some questioning if the move was related to politically sensitive lyrics.The song, the title of which translates to  The Path of Man,  was the theme music of the 1990 film A Chinese Ghost Story II. According to the late James Wong, who penned the lyrics, parts of the song were directly referring to the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown.ElsewhereFacebook Showed Me My Data Is Everywhere And I Have Absolutely No Control Over ItKatie Notopoulos says  a transparency tool on Facebook inadvertently provides a window into the confusing maze of companies you've never heard of who appear to have your data. Facebook removing third-party data was a pro-privacy move, and showing this page of advertisers is a great transparency measure. But this list of advertisers that use a contact list is a nightmare for any normal person to look at. It's confusing (who?!), aggravating (how did they get my email or phone number?!), and disheartening (privacy is dead, everyone has my data, it's a lost cause). It sheds some light on the dark and infinite universe of spam we exist in.eMarketer Slashes Snapchat Growth Forecast for 2019Marketers might be excited about the Snapchat Audience Network, but eMarketer is sounding an alarm about Snap's growth potential. (Snap disputes the methodology.)In 2019, Snapchat will have 77.5 million monthly US users, down 2.8% from last year. This represents a significantly lower projection than eMarketer expected in its Q3 2018 forecast, which anticipated 6.6% growth to 90.4 million monthly US users this year.Google Founders Have Skipped All Of The Company's 2019 Town Hall MeetingsAs dissent inside Google has grown, Larry Page and Sergey Brin are nowhere to be found, Alex Kantrowitz and Caroline O'Donovan report:Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have yet to make an appearance at any of the company's weekly  TGIF  town halls in 2019, BuzzFeed News has learned. Their absence from these meetings, the longest attendance lapse in company history, comes at a time when Google is wrestling with tough questions from its employees on a variety of issues, ranging from harassment to censorship.The anti-Facebook: Inside Pinterest's slow and quiet riseFun detail in Seth Fiegerman's profile of Pinterest ahead of its initial public offering:By 2013, the stampede of new users started to slow noticeably. Pinterest set up war rooms where employees spent hours poring over data to understand the cause of the slowdown and what they could do to address it. Even today, people who worked at Pinterest during that period seem to have a different answer for why growth began to lag: the rise of Instagram, the struggle to attract men, or maybe just the limits of the word-of-mouth marketing that had worked in its first years.Mark Zuckerberg had a different opinion. In Pinterest's early days, when the service was still growing at a fast clip, the Facebook CEO told one of his employees that he thought Pinterest was interesting, but  niche,  according to a source with knowledge of the conversation. To Zuckerberg, niche meant it would end up with 200 million to 300 million users.Hate Your Internet Provider? Look to SpaceTech giants have big plans to deliver internet service via satellite, Christopher Mims reports:These companies play their cards close, but SpaceX, Amazon and Facebook have all seen detailed plans for their potential satellite networks leak through filings with the Federal Communications Commission and International Telecommunication Union, a United Nations agency that manages global wireless spectrum. While Google no longer appears to be building its own satellites, it has agreed to license technology to Canadian satellite operator Telesat for its own network of satellites. Virgin Orbit, meanwhile, hopes to be an affordable launch platform for the kind of small satellites that will comprise these networks.Social media usage in U.S. remains unchanged despite a year of turmoilNew Pew research has good news for Facebook:A 2018 Center survey found that some Facebook users had recently taken steps to moderate their use of the site   such as deleting the Facebook app from their phone or taking a break from the platform for some time. But despite these findings and amid some high profile controversies, Facebook users as a whole are just as active on the site today as they were a year ago. Roughly three-quarters of Facebook users (74%) visit the site daily, including about half who do so several times a day. These shares are identical to those reported by Facebook users in the Center's 2018 social media use survey.LaunchesFacebook will punish groups for repeatedly spreading fake newsFacebook announced changes today to groups, the News Feed algorithm, and safety features on Messenger. I'll have my own thoughts tomorrow, but you can get started by reading Jake Kastrenakes' take.Facebook Is Changing News Feed (Again) to Stop Fake NewsEmily Dreyfuss and Issie Lapowsky look at one of the other changes Facebook announced today: a new metric called  click gap  that seeks to penalize sites that perform well on Facebook and nowhere else. (It's a sign that they're gaming the system.)The AP isn't abandoning its fact-checking partnership with Facebook. It's expanding it.The Associated Press is bringing its fact-checking services to Spanish-language posts, Daniel Funke reports:In a press release sent to Poynter on Tuesday, the wire service announced that it will start debunking false content in Spanish for its American audience. The outlet will also publish corresponding fact checks in Spanish, making it the first of Facebook's American partners to do so, according to the release.TakesListen up bitches, it's time to learn incorrect things about someone you've never heard ofRosa Lyster has an extremely funny piece about what she calls Buckle Up Twitter   the phenomenon where people just start screaming historical information of varying degrees of accuracy into the void in hopes of going viral. To get there, of course, they affect total outrage:Buckle Up Twitter threads tend to proceed from two assumptions. The first is that no one but the author of the thread has ever read a book, and the second is that no one actually ever needs to read a book in order to understand anything, because what do you need a motherfucking BOOK for when you have ALL THE INFORMATION YOU COULD POSSIBLY NEED RIGHT HERE IN THIS GODDAMN BITCH OF A THREAD. There's not a whole lot of daylight between that and the insistence that, I don't know, no one in the history of the world has ever had any reason or desire to read Ulysses.I wanted to help Google make AI more responsible. Instead I was treated with hostility.Kay James Coles, the president of the Heritage Foundation whose appointment to a Google ethics panel related to artificial intelligence drew outrage inside the company, sounds off about the experience. (Google ultimately disbanded the council, though it has another internal one.)In 1961, at age 12, I was one of two-dozen black children who integrated an all-white junior high school in Richmond. White parents jeered me outside the school, and inside, their kids stuck me with pins, shoved me in the halls and pushed me down the stairs. So when the group of Google employees resorted to calling names and making false accusations because they didn't want a conservative voice advising the company, the hostility was reminiscent of what I felt back then   that same intolerance for someone who was different from them.Uncivil discourse is an illness in America. We can do better   we must strive to show the world what a pluralistic society should be, a place where people of different faiths and viewpoints are willing to engage and willing to listen to others, especially when they bring different ideas to the table.And finally  Black hole gets welcomed to the Earth with memesIf you think a supermassive void that destroys all information that passes its event horizon is a good metaphor for our life in 2019, does Mashable have some memes for you.Talk to meSend me tips, comments, questions, and [censored]. casey@theverge.comTags:  See Website:            https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/4/11/18305407/social-network-conservative-bias-twitter-facebook-ted-cruzContact Information:Casey NewtonTags:           Wire,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: April 15, 2019End of Document

Continue reading Seven questions we still have about Huawei's US blacklistingPresident Trump sent shockwaves throughout the tech industry last week with an executive order that declared a national emergency and barred American companies from doing business with companies deemed a national security risk. Days later, the effects have started to become apparent as companies from Google to Intel have taken action to comply, shutting Huawei out of supply chains and stopping it from using US software.This development could have major, long-lasting repercussions for the entire tech industry, but there are still several questions without definite answers. Here are some of our most immediate:1) What if you own a Huawei device right now?Google has said that Google Play Services and the app store itself will continue to work on Huawei devices, so your phone should continue to operate as normal. You almost certainly shouldn't expect an update to Android Q or other platform-level upgrades, however, as that would require Google's sign-off.If you were thinking of buying a new Huawei phone, meanwhile, we wouldn't advise it until we have more information. But if you're sure you want that P30 Pro camera, for example, you can at least rest assured that it shouldn't lose any out-of-the-box functionality.2) Is this situation likely to be resolved?The action taken by Google and others is the direct result of an executive order from one of the least predictable US presidents of all time, so it's anyone's guess as to what might happen next. Much will hinge on China's reaction. Huawei is the biggest smartphone vendor in China, and even though Google's ban itself won't affect that market, the company still relies on components from other US suppliers that are now refusing to do business.Outside its home market, Huawei is arguably the most successful Chinese consumer brand so far. It's usually the second largest phone vendor in the world, depending on how it competes with Apple in a given quarter. China has the nuclear option of reciprocating with action against Apple, which sounds outlandish but could prove to be a useful bargaining chip if normality is to be restored.3) What is Huawei's plan B?It's long been known that Huawei has been working on a backup OS that it would switch to in precisely this eventuality. How that OS would look like in practice, however, is less clear. Huawei already ships a Google-less version of Android in China, where Google services are banned, and the obvious move would be to ship that elsewhere too. But some reports, as well as Huawei itself, have implied that the plan-B OS could be a more radical break from the open-source Android code base.Since Huawei makes its own smartphone CPUs through its HiSilicon subsidiary, it's possible that the company could seek to gain a technical edge through vertically integrated development that leverages a tight marriage between hardware and software. It's unlikely, however, that the company's sway outside of China would be enough to gain support for a new OS outside of the Android ecosystem. It's hard enough getting developers to put their apps on Amazon's Fire devices. Huawei would also, of course, have to find non-American replacements for the various other components it relies on in its phones.4) What about Honor?Honor is a smartphone brand operated independently from Huawei's own smartphone division, but it's still wholly owned by Huawei and makes heavy use of the parent company's technology and supply chain. There's no real reason to think that it wouldn't fall under the same scrutiny as Huawei, but it's possible that Google might treat it as a separate OEM for licensing purposes. We've reached out for comment.5) What about Microsoft?If Google considers itself legally unable to do business with Huawei, it's hard to see how Microsoft wouldn't reach the same conclusion. Huawei's Windows laptops are very well-regarded, and unlike its phones, they're actually sold in the US. We've reached out to Microsoft for comment, but if there's a loophole that will allow the company to continue to sell Windows 10 licenses to Huawei, we're unaware of it.6) Are other Chinese companies next?The executive order didn't target Huawei specifically, and since some of the concern around the company relates to Chinese law that demands local firms cooperate with the government, other Chinese companies could theoretically be affected. But the US Department of Commerce did single out Huawei last week for inclusion on the Bureau of Industry and Security's Entity List, which details companies considered to be a potential national security threat.ZTE, a telecoms equipment and smartphone maker that competes directly with Huawei, has run into its own trouble with the US government already. But the company was caught clean violating trade sanctions and then failed to comply with the terms of its own punishment, leading to a severe but somewhat less controversial response from the US. The two parties ultimately struck a deal to let ZTE get back on its feet. The two situations aren't directly comparable, but Chinese companies like Oppo and Xiaomi will likely be on edge nonetheless.7) What does this mean for the rollout of 5G globally?Huawei is a leading provider of 5G networking equipment, at least in countries that the US hasn't persuaded not to use it, and much of it relies on American suppliers like Intel, Broadcom, and Xilinx. The ban on trade could certainly delay Huawei's moves to supply 5G equipment to countries around the world, and the American companies' business, in turn, could be adversely affected.Bloomberg reports that Huawei has stockpiled at least three month's worth of components in anticipation of this situation, but beyond that the company may need to seek alternatives. If your local provider is building out its 5G network using Huawei gear then delays could very well be on the horizon.Tags:  See Campaign:            https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18632265/seven-questions-we-still-have-about-huaweis-us-blacklistingContact Information:Sam ByfordTags:,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            Wire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: June 2, 2019End of Document

Global Factory Automation & Industrial Controls Markets to 2024: Digitization and Industry 4.0 Revolution have Significantly Stimulated the GrowthPR NewswireApril 2, 2019 Tuesday 8:45 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1695 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, April 2, 2019 BodyPR NewswireThe"Factory Automation & Industrial Controls Market - Growth, Trends, and Forecast (2019 - 2024)"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.The Factory Automation and Industrial Control Systems market is expected to register a CAGR of over 8.4% during the forecast period 2019 - 2024.The evolution of technological advancements and innovations across various manufacturing units have encouraged the adoption of automation technologies. Digitization and Industry 4.0 revolution have significantly stimulated the growth of automation among industries, by necessitating the use of smarter and automated solutions, such as robotics and control systems, to improve production processes.Automation has drastically changed the way of production in the industrial sector, by reducing the manufacturing time and production costs. The production lines in several factories were manual, for a considerable time. Even if there have been improvements in assembly technologies, such as faster pick-and-place machines and smarter reflow ovens, the back-end operations have remained non-automated.Hence, there has been an exponential rise in labor costs. In addition, the quality requirements are also getting more stringent. Against this backdrop, factory automation can cause a reduction in production, operation, and labor costs.Various advancements have been made in the automation of the various activities that were formerly carried out manually, particularly in the labor-intensive manufacturing industry, with most of these being almost fully automated, using the latest technologies. This has led to improved efficiency, high-quality products, and attendant savings in labor and costs.The high costs of automated systems are associated with effective and robust hardware and efficient software. Automation equipment requires higher capital expenditure, to invest in automation technologies (an automated system can cost millions of dollars to design, fabricate, and install). They also require a higher level of maintenance, than a manually operated machine, and a generally lower degree of flexibility in terms of the possible products, as compared to a manual system (even flexible automation is less flexible than humans, the most versatile machines of all).The sluggish adoption of Industrial IoT technologies can be linked to the higher costs for maintaining their connections, considering that M2M connections were charged heavy taxation, similar to mobile device subscriptions. The acquisition and installation cost of a control system for industrial automation represents half of the total cost, during its lifetime. Additionally, the frequent changes in technology and networking result in significant cost, which is more than that of the initial investment, further slowing down the adoption.In addition, significantly low adoption in SMEs, in developing countries like Brazil, which cannot bear the product costs, is restraining the market's growth.Scope of the ReportThe Industrial control and Factory automation is a rising trend in the manufacturing industry which provides smart manufacturing infrastructure. The industrial control and factory automation facilitate cost efficiency, quality of production; standardize manufacturing, reliability, and flexibility in the process of manufacturing. Industrial control and factory automation offers a perfect mix of mechanical components and devices and Information Technology MarketKey Market TrendsUtilities Sector Expected to Register a Significant GrowthThe overall savings from these digitally-enabled measures are estimated to be in the order of USD 80 billion per year over 2016-40, or about 5% of total annual power generation costs based on the enhanced global deployment of available digital technologies to all power plants and network infrastructure.Data centers worldwide consumed around 194 TWh of electricity in 2014, or about 1% of total demand. Although data center workload is estimated to triple by 2020, related energy demand is expected to grow by only 3%, due to continued efficiency gains. This is expected to drive the growth in power generation for meeting the demand from ICT sector.The evolution of smart grid and a synchronization to match the variable demand for the electricity, between the peak demand period to rest of the period demand, is expected to further create high demand from the energy and utilities sector. Due to the automation of processes and a networked system communication, digitalization can help integrate the renewable energy by enabling grids to match energy demand to times when the wind is blowing and the sun is shining.In the European Union alone, increased storage and digitally-enabled demand response is estimated to reduce curtailment of solar PVs and wind power from 7% in 2017 to 1.6% in 2040, avoiding 30 million tons of CO2 emissions in 2040.China Expected to Hold a Major Share in Asia Pacific regionDespite China accounting for 25% of the world's manufacturing activities, its manufacturing productivity is a mere one-fifth of that of developed economies. Companies in the country are, thus, embracing Industry 4.0 to improve productivity. A strong indicator of automation uptake in the country is the 58% increase in robot density in 2017 as compared to 2015. Further, the Chinese government's programs, such as the Made in China 2025 plan, are promoting the use of R&D in factory automation and technologies and its investments. Also, as most of the automation equipment is imported from Germany and Japan, the Made in China' initiative aims to expand the country's domestic production of automation hardware and equipment.China is the 28th fastest in the world, and has a very high industrial production rate. These factors act as drivers for the automation market in the country. Investments are being planned for aiding the quality of growth, addressing environmental concerns, and reducing overcapacity, for the same. The number of companies deploying factory and process automation technologies and robotics in the country is less when compared to the enormous size of China's manufacturing base and the number of workers it employs. This trend presents a great opportunity for companies in the industrial automation sector in China.Automation in the country is also expected to be augmented by the uptake of smart manufacturing. As per the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, China is anticipated to initiate 100 smart manufacturing pilot projects in 2018. According to the 13th Five-Year Plan of Smart Manufacturing, China aims to establish its intelligent manufacturing system and complete the key industries' transformation by 2025.Competitive LandscapeThe Factory Automation and Industrial Control Systems market is highly competitive and consists of several major players. In terms of market share, few of the major players currently dominate the market. These major players with prominent share in the market are focusing on expanding their customer base across foreign countries. These companies are leveraging on strategic collaborative initiatives to increase their market share and increase their profitability. The companies operating in the market are also acquiring start-ups working on Factory Automation and Industrial Control Systems to strengthen their product capabilities.In May 2018, Texas Instruments announced the mass production of its highly integrated, ultra-wideband AWR1642 and IWR1642 mmWave sensors. These sensors support frequencies from 76 to 81 GHz and deliver three times more accurate sensing and the smallest footprint at a fraction of the power of competing for sensor technologies. Thousands of customers are developing with the company's mmWave sensors to enable innovation in automotive and industrial applications, including vehicle occupancy detection, people counting in buildings, machine, and human interaction, and more.Key Topics Covered:1 INTRODUCTION2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY4 MARKET DYNAMICS4.1 Market Overview4.2 Introduction to Market Drivers and Restraints4.3 Market Drivers4.3.1 Emphasis on Cost Cutting and Business Process Improvement4.3.2 Increased Adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine- to-Machine Technologies4.4 Market Restraints4.4.1 Lack of Skilled Workforce Preventing Enterprises from Full-scale Adoption of Factory Automation4.5 Value Chain / Supply Chain Analysis4.6 Industry Attractiveness Porters Five Force Analysis5 MARKET SEGMENTATION5.1 By Product5.1.1 Field Devices5.1.1.1 Machine Vision5.1.1.2 Robotics5.1.1.3 Sensors5.1.1.4 Motors and Drives5.1.1.5 Relays and Switches5.1.1.6 Other Field Devices5.1.2 Industrial Control Systems5.1.2.1 SCADA5.1.2.2 DCS5.1.2.3 PLC5.1.2.4 MES5.1.2.5 PLM5.1.2.6 ERP5.1.2.7 HMI5.1.2.8 Other Control Systems5.2 By End-user Industry5.2.1 Automotive5.2.2 Chemical and Petrochemical5.2.3 Utility5.2.4 Pharmaceutical5.2.5 Food and Beverage5.2.6 Oil and Gas5.2.7 Other End-user Industries5.3 Geography6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE6.1 Company Profiles6.1.1 Rockwell Automation Inc.6.1.2 Honeywell International Inc.6.1.3 General Electric Co.6.1.4 ABB Limited6.1.5 Dassault Systemes SE6.1.6 Schneider Electric SE6.1.7 Emerson Electric Company6.1.8 Autodesk Inc.6.1.9 Mitsubishi Electric Corporation6.1.10 Siemens AG6.1.11 Aspen Technology Inc6.1.12 Robert Bosch GmbH6.1.13 Texas Instruments Inc.6.1.14 Yokogawa Electric Corporation7 INVESTMENT ANALYSIS8 MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND FUTURE TRENDSFor more information about this report visithttps://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/k3v7vzResearch and Markets also offersCustom Researchservices providing focused, comprehensive and tailored research.Media Contact:Laura Wood, Senior Managerpress@researchandmarkets.com For E.S.T Office Hours Call +1-917-300-0470For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call +1-800-526-8630For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900U.S. Fax: 646-607-1907Fax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716 View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-factory-automation--industrial-controls-markets-to-2024-digitization-and-industry-4-0-revolution-have-significantly-stimulated-the-growth-300822850.htmlSOURCE Research and MarketsLoad-Date: April 3, 2019End of Document

Lower Open Expected For Hong Kong Stock MarketCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 4, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 476 wordsBody       The Hong Kong stock market has moved lower in four straight sessions, sliding almost 500 points or 1.8 percent along the way. The Hang Seng Index now rests just above the 26,890-point plateau and it's looking at another red light again on Tuesday. The global forecast for the Asian markets is mixed to lower, with technology and oil stocks expected to fall under considerable pressure. The European markets were up and the U.S. bourses were mostly down and the Asian markets are tipped to follow the latter lead. The Hang Seng finished slightly lower on Monday following losses from the casinos and oil and insurance companies. For the day, the index lost 7.23 points or 0.03 percent to finish at 26,893.86 after trading between 26,735.48 and 26,968.10. Among the actives, Sands China plummeted 3.38 percent, while China Mobile surged 2.92 percent, WH Group plunged 2.83 percent, Tencent Holdings soared 2.33 percent, Galaxy Entertainment tumbled 2.22 percent, Hong Kong & China Gas skidded 1.73 percent, AIA Group declined 1.63 percent, BOC Hong Kong retreated 0.66 percent, CSPC Pharmaceutical dropped 0.63 percent, CITIC climbed 0.56 percent, New World Development advanced 0.52 percent, CNOOC sank 0.47 percent, China Petroleum and Chemical (Sinopec) shed 0.38 percent, AAC Technologies lot 0.36 percent, China Mengniu Dairy added 0.17 percent, China Life Insurance fell 0.11 percent, Ping An Insurance eased 0.06 percent and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China was unchanged. The lead from Wall Street is ominous thanks to a steep drop from the tech-heavy NASDAQ - while the Dow and the S&P were mixed and little changed. The Dow added 4.74 points or 0.02 percent to 24,819.78, while the NASDAQ plummeted 120.13 points or 1.61 percent to 7,333.02 and the S&P 500 fell 7.61 points or 0.28 percent to 2,744.45. The steep drop by the NASDAQ came as tech stocks came under pressure following reports of antitrust investigations involving several big-name companies like Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL). Trade concerns also continued to weigh on the markets after an official document from the Chinese government blamed the U.S. for the escalating trade dispute between the world's two largest economies. The escalating global trade tensions led St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard to suggest a reduction in interest rates "may be warranted soon." In U.S. economic news, the Institute for Supply Management said the pace of growth in manufacturing activity unexpectedly saw a continued slowdown in May. Crude oil futures ended lower Monday, extending losses to a fourth straight session amid continued worries about energy demand due to fears of global economic slowdown. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures for July ended down $0.25 or 0.5 percent at $53.25 a barrel.        Load-Date: June 4, 2019End of Document

The IC Socket Market: Global Growth, Trends, and Forecast (2019-2024) - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireJune 21, 2019 Friday 6:45 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 1237 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "The IC Socket Market: Global Growth, Trends, and Forecast (2019-2024)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The IC socket market is expected to witness a CAGR of 9.11% over the forecast period 2019-2024.IC sockets have become one of the most crucial and widely used components in the production cycle of ICs. Due to the increasing demand for performance and efficiency, the consumption of IC sockets has witnessed rapid growth over recent years.According to expertise, China is re-engineering its development and innovation processes in a bid to reduce the TTM (time to market) for the new products. By doing this, the trend of miniaturization is becoming a challenge for the IC socket market as they tend to occupy more space and add an extra electrical signal path to the IC device.Key Highlights• The increasing popularity of enterprise technologies like Big Data, and cloud-based services and the dependency on servers and CPUs with high computing power has been increasing significantly over the past few years further leading to the growth of this market. Companies like Intel and AMD are using new processors. These new processor platforms require socket designs to meet the design requirements and offer higher performance and better system scaling.• With the advent of the Internet of Things, coupled with an increasing focus on automation in the automotive and manufacturing industries, the IC socket market is expected to grow during the forecast period.• The trend of miniaturization has been a challenge for the IC sockets market as they tend to occupy additional space and add an extra electrical signal path to the IC device.Major Market TrendsConsumer Electronics Segment is Expected to Have Significant GrowthConsumer electronics leads the market on account of the massive sales of laptops, smartphones, PCs, tablets, and other consumer electronic devices, which incorporate integrated circuits. These electronic appliances are manufactured with some simple or complex circuits. Electronic components in these circuits are connected with each other by wires or conducting wires for the flow of electric current through the multiple components of the circuit, such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and transistors. Owing to the increasing sales of consumer electronics, IC sockets are expected to witness a greater adoption in these devices.• Sales growth in both smartphones and personal computing systems is being bolstered by increasing memory prices. However, the ongoing decline in shipments of standard personal computers, along with the slow growth of tablets, is aiding the mobile IC sales to override total personal computing sales over the forecast period.• In the consumer electronics industry, the demand for more precise results, along with smaller chips is rapidly increasing, owing to ascended profit margins and reduced transportation cost.• With the miniaturization and fabrication of multiple technologies onto a single disk in consumer devices, like smartphones, tablets, wearable's, smart TVs, and gaming consoles, the need for IC's is expected to grow to evaluate the inputs into an actionable function, which can be then followed by the device. The rise in IoT also resulted in increased usage of chips for consumer electronic devices.Asia-Pacific Expected to Have Significant GrowthAsia-Pacific is expected to have significant growth for this market. Various companies have almost reduced the product development period by half, owing to the changing consumer demands. This trend requires companies to continuously design and test products, driving the adoption of IC sockets.• China's National Guidelines for the Development and Promotion of the IC Industry," is set to drive investments in the China National IC industry, particularly in the IC design, packing, and testing sectors. The growing level of investment in the fabless, IDMs, foundries, and OSATs in the Asia-Pacific aims to drive the market for ICs.• Big Data is gaining popularity in China, which is further expected to drive the demand for the enterprise server market.• The "Made in China 2025" initiative outlines that the nation is aiming to raise its self-sufficiency rate for ICs to 40% in 2020 and 70% in 2025, such initiatives are expected to promote the demand for test and burn ICs.• Chinese government is planning on improving the healthcare infrastructure, supported by Healthy China 2030. This is expected to impact the adoption of new technologies in healthcare, including AI, big data, and cloud computing, to promote more flexible healthcare, to meet the needs of patients and consumers. Growing adoption of IoT and Big Data has been a significant driver for the market in China, which remains one of the significant end-user segment for IC sockets.Competitive LandscapeThe IC Socket market is neither highly competitive nor has a limited number of players. The IC Socket market is witnessing many mergers and acquisitions among regional players. In the past few years, acquisitions have been one of the major growth strategies of the companies to increase their revenue share in the market.• December 2017 - TEC Connectivity acquired VOXX International Corporation's subsidiary Hirschmann Car Communication, a leading provider of antennas, antenna systems, and broadcast tuners, for automotive and commercial vehicle applications. The acquisition expanded TE's product portfolio and the integrated, highly engineered solutions they provide for connected and autonomous vehicles worldwide.Topics Covered1 INTRODUCTION1.1 Study Deliverables1.2 Study Assumptions1.3 Scope of the Study2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY4 MARKET DYNAMICS4.1 Market Overview4.2 Introduction to Market Drivers and Restraints4.3 Market Drivers4.3.1 Growing Demand for Electronics with High Computing Power4.3.2 Need for Reduction in Product Development Cycle4.4 Market Restraints4.4.1 Growing Demand for Miniaturized Products Poses Challenge to Product Manufacturers4.5 Industry Value Chain Analysis4.6 Industry Attractiveness - Porter's Five Force Analysis5 MARKET SEGMENTATION5.1 By Product Type5.1.1 Dual-in-line Memory Module Sockets5.1.2 Production Sockets(Land Grid Array, Pin Grid Array, Plastic Leaded Chip Carrier)5.1.3 Test and Burn-in Sockets5.1.4 Others Sockets(Ball Grid Array, Dual-in-line Package, Specialty Sockets)5.2 By End-user Industry5.2.1 Consumer Electronics5.2.2 Telecom/Datacom5.2.3 Aerospace & Defense5.2.4 Automotive & Transportation5.2.5 Industrial5.3 Geography5.3.1 North America5.3.2 Europe5.3.3 Asia-Pacific5.3.4 Rest of the world6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE6.1 Company Profiles6.1.1 TE Connectivity Ltd.6.1.2 Smiths Interconnect Inc.6.1.3 Mill-Max Manufacturing Corporation6.1.4 Aries Electronics Inc.6.1.5 Yamaichi Electronics Co.

The rival companies behind the Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch just sent a joint letter to the US government asking to be left out of Trump's tariffsBusiness Insider USJune 26, 2019 Wednesday 01:57 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 625 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Ben Gilbert)Highlight: The three big video game console makers - Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo - all want to be exempt from the Trump administration's proposed China tariffs.BodyNintendo• The three major video game console makers - Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo - sent a joint letter to the US government seeking exemption from Chinese tariffs.• "While we appreciate the Administration's efforts to protect US intellectual property and preserve US high-tech leadership," the letter says, "the disproportionate harm caused by these tariffs to US consumers and businesses will undermine - not advance - these goals."• The letter is a rare instance of the big three competing game console makers coming together.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.Sony's PlayStation 4, Microsoft's Xbox One, and Nintendo's Switch may all compete for consumer attention and spending dollars, but the three major makers of the game consoles are coming together to push back on the Trump administration's Chinese tariffs.All three companies are represented in a joint letter addressed to Office of United States Trade Representative general counsel Joseph Barloon, originally sent on June 17.The letter cites "disproportionate harm caused by these tariffs to US consumers and businesses," and asks that game consoles be exempt from the tariffs.The reason for three competing game console makers coming together is simple: The vast majority of game consoles made by the trio come from China - just over 95% of consoles sold in 2018 were manufactured in China, according to Trade Partnership Worldwide. Getty Images/Michael KovacUnder the Trump administration's proposed tariffs for $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, game console makers would face a 25% tariff, an increase from the existing 10% rate.The letter indicates that, due to small profit margins on video game consoles, the console makers would pass the added cost on to consumers - which could have a major impact on game console sales."A price increase of 25% will likely put a new video game console out of reach for many American families who we expect to be in the market for a console this holiday season," the letter says. "Consumers would pay $840 million more than they otherwise would have."Moreover, the letter argues, the new tariffs could outright slow innovation in the American technology sector."There would be ripple effects extending far beyond the video game industry, because the video game industry has historically and persistently been a leader in US technology innovation in both the hardware and software spaces and beyond the game industry," the letter says.Associated Press/Andy WongAbove all other concerns, the letter argues that - in imposing a 25% tariff on Chinese-manufactured game consoles - the goal of protecting intellectual property won't be achieved.Under a section labeled, "Imposing Tariffs on Video Game Consoles Would Not Be 'Practicable or Effective to Obtain the Elimination' of China's Problematic IP Practices," the letter argues that Chinese game consoles are "virtually non-existent" - that the Chinese market hasn't successfully copied the game consoles made there.But the letter stops short of pushing back on the plan to increase tariffs on Chinese goods - instead, it seeks to make game consoles exempt. Read the full letter right here.NOW WATCH: Here's why it's so hard to switch from Apple to AndroidSee Also:• We just got a much longer look at this year's gorgeous new 'Star Wars' game - check it out right here• Forget the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One - at least 10 major games are already being made for 'next-generation' game consoles• The video game industry is facing government scrutiny over loot boxes, and the most powerful leaders in gaming are divided over what to doSEE ALSO: Dozens of retailers are in Washington to testify about how Trump's next round of China tariffs could hurt them.

Various companies have almost reduced the product development period by half, owing to the changing consumer demands. This trend requires companies to continuously design and test products, driving the adoption of IC sockets.• China's National Guidelines for the Development and Promotion of the IC Industry," is set to drive investments in the China National IC industry, particularly in the IC design, packing, and testing sectors. The growing level of investment in the fabless, IDMs, foundries, and OSATs in the Asia-Pacific aims to drive the market for ICs.• Big Data is gaining popularity in China, which is further expected to drive the demand for the enterprise server market.• The "Made in China 2025" initiative outlines that the nation is aiming to raise its self-sufficiency rate for ICs to 40% in 2020 and 70% in 2025, such initiatives are expected to promote the demand for test and burn ICs.• Chinese government is planning on improving the healthcare infrastructure, supported by Healthy China 2030. This is expected to impact the adoption of new technologies in healthcare, including AI, big data, and cloud computing, to promote more flexible healthcare, to meet the needs of patients and consumers. Growing adoption of IoT and Big Data has been a significant driver for the market in China, which remains one of the significant end-user segment for IC sockets.Competitive LandscapeThe IC Socket market is neither highly competitive nor has a limited number of players. The IC Socket market is witnessing many mergers and acquisitions among regional players. In the past few years, acquisitions have been one of the major growth strategies of the companies to increase their revenue share in the market.• December 2017 - TEC Connectivity acquired VOXX International Corporation's subsidiary Hirschmann Car Communication, a leading provider of antennas, antenna systems, and broadcast tuners, for automotive and commercial vehicle applications. The acquisition expanded TE's product portfolio and the integrated, highly engineered solutions they provide for connected and autonomous vehicles worldwide.Topics Covered                   1 INTRODUCTION1.1 Study Deliverables1.2 Study Assumptions1.3 Scope of the Study2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY4 MARKET DYNAMICS4.1 Market Overview4.2 Introduction to Market Drivers and Restraints4.3 Market Drivers4.3.1 Growing Demand for Electronics with High Computing Power4.3.2 Need for Reduction in Product Development Cycle4.4 Market Restraints4.4.1 Growing Demand for Miniaturized Products Poses Challenge to Product Manufacturers4.5 Industry Value Chain Analysis4.6 Industry Attractiveness - Porter's Five Force Analysis5 MARKET SEGMENTATION5.1 By Product Type5.1.1 Dual-in-line Memory Module Sockets5.1.2 Production Sockets(Land Grid Array, Pin Grid Array, Plastic Leaded Chip Carrier)5.1.3 Test and Burn-in Sockets5.1.4 Others Sockets(Ball Grid Array, Dual-in-line Package, Specialty Sockets)5.2 By End-user Industry5.2.1 Consumer Electronics5.2.2 Telecom/Datacom5.2.3 Aerospace & Defense5.2.4 Automotive & Transportation5.2.5 Industrial5.3 Geography5.3.1 North America5.3.2 Europe5.3.3 Asia-Pacific5.3.4 Rest of the world6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE6.1 Company Profiles6.1.1 TE Connectivity Ltd.6.1.2 Smiths Interconnect Inc.6.1.3 Mill-Max Manufacturing Corporation6.1.4 Aries Electronics Inc.6.1.5 Yamaichi Electronics Co.

Senate Appropriations Subcommittee Issues Testimony From FCC Chairman PaiTargeted News ServiceMay 7, 2019 Tuesday 10:47 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2755 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government issued the following testimony by Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai at a hearing to review the fiscal 2020 budget request:"The Commission's Office of Management and Budget-designated spending level for FY20 is $335,660,000, derived exclusively from regulatory fees for regular FCC operations, and an auction spending cap of $132,538,680."But before I discuss the Commission's plans for the next fiscal year, I want to take this opportunity to thank this Subcommittee for its support during the prior year. We greatly appreciate your decision to provide us with funds above the FY19 request, as well as your permission to complete internal reorganizations to advance agency reform efforts."Let me highlight a few positive impacts of this Subcommittee's decisions."First, you increased auction funding by more than $17 million. The funds provided by this Subcommittee have enabled us to meet our statutory deadline to complete our rulemaking to implement changes to the TV Broadcaster Relocation Fund and provide money to reimburse low-power television, TV translator, and FM radio stations impacted by the post-Incentive Auction spectrum repack. They have also helped us establish a dedicated call center and launch a public education campaign to assist consumers impacted by the relocation of broadcast stations. And they have funded monthly reports to Subcommittee staff on our progress with respect to the repack."Second, you authorized two agency reorganization initiatives to help the Commission better carry out its mission. You approved the creation of the Office of Economics and Analytics, which brought together economists who were previously scattered throughout the Commission. The Office is already having a positive impact on the Commission's work, and going forward, I am confident that it will allow us to continue expanding and deepening the use of economic analysis in the Commission's decision-making. This Subcommittee also permitted us to transfer the audit and enforcement responsibilities associated with our Equal Employment Opportunity rules from the Media Bureau to the Enforcement Bureau. This reorganization, which took place earlier this year, was supported by many civil rights organizations and will help us to more effectively enforce these rules."Third, you gave us nearly $6 million above our general request for FY19, which is supporting a broad range of Commission efforts essential to our core mission. The FCC greatly appreciates your decision to return our funding to $339,000,000 in FY19. This amount means a great deal to a small agency and aids our efforts to expand the deployment of rural broadband, improve public safety, foster technological innovation, protect consumers, and modernize our information technology."Turning to the future, I'd like to discuss some of the Commission's most important priorities for next year--priorities that the funds requested in this budget submission are critical to advancing."First, we will continue our work to secure our nation's leadership in 5G, the next generation of wireless connectivity. 5G networks will be 100 times faster than today's networks, maybe even more."They will have lag times that are a tenth of what they are today. And they'll have much more capacity, being able to connect as many as one million devices per square kilometer."Our work on 5G will open the door to new services and applications that will grow our economy and improve our standard of living. Smart transportation networks will link connected cars--reducing traffic, preventing accidents, and limiting pollution. Ubiquitous wireless sensors will enable healthcare professionals to remotely monitor your health and transmit data to your doctor before problems become emergencies. Connected devices will empower farms to apply precision agriculture. And there will be more innovations that we can't even conceive of today."These breakthroughs will boost our economy. One study pegs 5G's potential at three million new jobs, $275 billion in private investment, and $500 billion in new economic growth."To realize this potential, we've developed a comprehensive strategy that will "Facilitate America's Superiority in 5G Technology"; it's called the "5G FAST" plan. It has three key components: (1) pushing more spectrum into the marketplace; (2) promoting the deployment of wireless infrastructure; and (3) modernizing outdated regulations. In my testimony today, I'd like to concentrate on the first prong, spectrum."The applications and services of tomorrow will require much more bandwidth. They cannot be developed and deployed without spectrum. This critical resource represents the lifeblood of the communications industry--and with it, the future of our economy. That's why the FCC must continue its work to aggressively make more spectrum available for commercial use."In my testimony to this Subcommittee last year, I said that the FCC would hold two high-band spectrum auctions during FY19: one for the 28 GHz band and another for the 24 GHz band. And I noted that conducting these auctions successfully and promptly would be important to U.S. leadership in 5G."I am pleased to report that we have done what I said we would do. Our 28 GHz auction began last November and concluded this January. All in all, bidders won 2,965 licenses, and the auction raised $702,572,410 in gross bids for the U.S. Treasury. Our 24 GHz auction began in March. The clock phase of this auction ended in April, and the assignment phase is currently taking place. Gross bids so far have more than doubled from the amount raised in the 28 GHz auction, to just short of $2 billion."While these auctions are significant accomplishments, the FCC cannot and will not rest on our laurels. Instead, we will continue to free up spectrum for commercial use. Starting on December 10, we will hold the largest auction in Commission history--we expect the upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47 GHz bands will release 3.4 gigahertz of spectrum into the commercial marketplace. During the next fiscal year, we also intend to auction mid-band spectrum in the 3.5 GHz band. We will continue our work to make additional mid-band spectrum bands available for flexible use, including in the 2.5 GHz and 3.7-4.2 GHz bands."All in all, these auctions will free up for the commercial marketplace over 5 gigahertz of spectrum for flexible use. For context, that's more spectrum than is currently used for mobile broadband by all mobile broadband providers in the United States combined."As part of our balanced spectrum strategy, we have also been working to make more spectrum available for unlicensed use. Earlier this year, for example, we allocated over 21 gigahertz of spectrum above 95 GHz for unlicensed operations. And we are continuing our effort to open up a large amount of unlicensed spectrum in the 6 GHz band, proposing to safeguard incumbents with innovative technologies and sharing techniques that will make sure we get the most use of this limited, essential resource."The second priority I'd like to address involves our continuing efforts to close the digital divide. Closing the digital divide has been my top priority since becoming chairman. That's why last year, the Commission took a variety of steps to better enable the private sector to deploy broadband infrastructure."For example, we made it easier and cheaper for competitive providers to attach fiber to utility poles through a groundbreaking reform called "one-touch make ready.""Of course, there are some areas where the business case for broadband deployment just won't exist--no matter how much red tape we cut. These are typically rural areas with sparser populations and lower incomes. The FCC manages programs to connect these rural communities through what is called the Universal Service Fund (USF). And we've been aggressively taking action to maximize the USF's impact--to stretch scarce dollars as far as we can."Last year, we finished a landmark reverse auction called Connect America Fund Phase II. Through this novel approach, we're awarding about $1.5 billion to connect over 713,000 homes and businesses nationwide. Before the auction, we identified parts of our country that were unserved by broadband. This was so that we could target funding to leverage--not displace--private capital expenditures. We didn't want to fund overbuilding. We also made sure the auction was open to providers of all types, including rural telecom companies, cable, fixed wireless, and satellite companies, ands well as electric utilities. This ensured that there would be plenty of competition."The outcome of the auction was a tremendous success. We distributed funding much more efficiently thanks in part to intermodal, competitive bidding, saving $3.5 billion from the $5 billion price we initially thought would be required to connect these unserved areas. We also ensured that 99.7% of the winning bids would provide consumers with service of at least 25/3 Mbps. And we set a level playing field that enabled a variety of entities, from fixed wireless to electric utilities, to win."Moreover, last December, we implemented reforms to the FCC's Alternative Connect America Cost Model (A-CAM). As a result, a total of 186 small, rural carriers participating in the A-CAM program have now accepted $65.7 million in additional annual support over the next decade to provide 106,000 more rural homes and small businesses with 25/3 Mbps broadband service. This represents a 31.8% increase in the number of locations that will have high-quality service available through the FCC's A-CAM program. And the increase is much larger in many states, such as 105.4% in Montana and 92.4% in my home state of Kansas."In December, for the first time we also began requiring that small, rural carriers that continue to rely on the Commission's legacy, cost-based support mechanism provide 25/3 Mbps broadband service to specific numbers of rural homes and small businesses in their service areas. Under the prior Administration's rules, these carriers were only required to provide 10/1 Mbps service to 115,441 locations; under our new rules, these same carriers will have to provide 25/3 Mbps broadband to at least 600,535 locations. At the same time, we also initiated a second round of A-CAM offers of fixed, model-based support for a term of ten years to these carriers, in exchange for building out 25/3 Mbps broadband to all fully-funded locations in their service areas. If all legacy-reliant carriers accept the new A-CAM offers, they will be required to provide 25/3 Mbps service to at least 1,126,082 locations."Last year, we took other steps through the Fund to help close the digital divide as well. For example, we increased the annual cap on rural healthcare program spending by nearly 43%, to $571 million per year for that funding year-the first increase in the program's funding level since it was established in the 1990s. These additional funds will help to provide critical connectivity to rural healthcare institutions."And we plan to continue our emphasis on closing the digital divide. Later this year, for example, we will begin a rulemaking to establish a $20.4 billion Rural Digital Opportunity Fund. Applying lessons learned from the Connect America Fund Phase II reverse auction, this program will spur the deployment of high-speed broadband networks across more of rural America over the next decade, bringing greater economic opportunities to America's heartland. Service providers that win funding in the reverse auction will deploy needed infrastructure to provide up to gigabit-speed broadband in the parts of the country most in need of connectivity. I'm excited about this program--it will be the FCC's single biggest step yet to close the digital divide and will connect up to four million rural homes and small businesses to high-speed broadband networks."Of course, it is important that we spend USF funds wisely and eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse in these programs. That's why last month, we sent you a reorganization plan to create a Fraud Division within the Enforcement Bureau. I am pleased that this proposal was unanimously endorsed by the Commission and cleared by the Office of Management and Budget. This reform will embed a permanent effort to combat USF fraud within the structure of the Enforcement Bureau."Our third priority is to continue fulfilling our important mission to protect public safety. Last year, for example, we took important steps to improve Wireless Emergency Alerts, which play a critical role in notifying Americans when emergencies strike."In February, I visited the Orleans Parish Communications District, which is the 911 call-handling and dispatch center for the Crescent City. And in March, I traveled to New Jersey and Delaware and visited 911 call centers. These interactions underscored to me the importance of supporting those who work every day to help their fellow Americans in their time of need. During the last fiscal year, we began work to implement laws passed by Congress to improve 911 calling. For example, we proposed rules to implement Kari's Law. Kari's Law requires multi-line telephone systems--which commonly serve hotels, office buildings, and campuses--to enable users to dial 911 directly. And it also contains a notification requirement so that when a 911 call is made in these settings, a front desk or security office will be alerted to facilitate building entry by first responders. We have proposed rules to help first responders locate wireless 911 callers in multi-story buildings. In the coming year, the Commission intends to take further steps to improve 911 calling. Among other things, I believe that we will be able to take final action to add a vertical, or "z-axis" metric to our location accuracy rules and finalize rules implementing Kari's Law."Our work in this area also extends to national security and involves our review of foreign companies that seek to do business in the United States. Later this week, at our May open meeting, the Commission will act to promote secure communications--a long-standing FCC priority. In 2011, China Mobile USA, which is ultimately owned by the Chinese government, applied to the Commission seeking to provide international telecommunications services in the United States. Consistent with agency policy, we solicited the views of the relevant federal agencies on whether the application raised national security, law enforcement, or related concerns."After a lengthy review of the application and in consultation with the U.S. intelligence community, in 2018, the Executive Branch agencies recommended that the FCC deny China Mobile USA's application due to substantial national security and law enforcement concerns that cannot be resolved through an agreement with the company (called "voluntary mitigation"). Notably, this is the first time the Executive Branch has ever recommended that the FCC deny an application due to national security concerns. Based on this recommendation and the full public record in this proceeding, I have determined that approving this application would not serve the public interest. At our May meeting, the Commission therefore will vote on an order that would deny China Mobile USA's application."Going forward, we will continue to use our statutory authority to protect the people and overall security of United States. That includes following through with our proposal to ban the use of money from the FCC's Universal Service Fund from being used by recipients to procure equipment or services from companies that pose a national security threat to our communications networks or the communications supply chain."I would like to conclude by highlighting the FCC's most important resource: our staff. Day in and day out, they come to work ready and eager to advance the public interest. Whether they are working to expand broadband deployment, combat robocalls, promote wireless innovation, protect public safety, or address consumer complaints, they serve the American people with skill and dedication, and I am honored to have them as colleagues. The funds that you provide to our Commission enable them to do their jobs, and for that I am very grateful."Thank you for this opportunity to discuss this budget proposal. I will be pleased to answer any questions that you may have."[TheHill]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6722410 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: May 8, 2019End of Document

Apple could make iPhone in MexicoCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 20, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 191 wordsBodyMEXICO CITY, June 20 (THE UNIVERSAL).- Apple will not stand by as the u.S. and Chinese governments launch threats and intimidation. Before a possible increase in tariffs is realized, the company considers taking up to 30% of its production out of Chinese territory, with Mexico being one of the candidates to receive such a move. According to a report from the Nikkei Asian Review, the "manzanite" company asked its main suppliers to evaluate the option of moving to our country or, either to India, Vietnam, Indonesia and/or Malaysia. This alternative would prevent the shipment of equipment to the U.S. market (and thus phones) from rising prices. As for the manufacture of products for the rest of the world, the idea is that it does remain in China. Thus, key participants in the iPhone assembly, such as Foxconn, Pegatron, Wistron and Quanta Computer; iPad, such as Compal Electronics; and AirPods, such as Inventec, Luxshare-ICT and Goertek, will need to determine if they move their operations. Beyond his decision, the change would not be reflected until two or three years from now.Copyright Grupo de Diarios América - GDA/El Universal/MexicoLoad-Date: June 22, 2019End of Document

The S&P 500 also fell 7.61 points or 0.3 percent to 2,744.45, while the Dow inched up 4.74 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 24,819.78.        Load-Date: June 4, 2019End of Document

Microsoft Joins Google's Crackdown on Huawei Amid US BlacklistingStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeMay 31, 2019 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 474 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyChina's Huawei, hit by crippling U.S. sanctions, could see shipments decline by as much as a quarter this year and faces the possibility that its smartphones will disappear from worldwide markets, analysts said."Huawei has always been an important partner with Panasonic Corp", it said in a statement.Last week, US President Donald Trump declared a national emergency to bar US companies from using foreign telecoms equipment deemed a security risk.In Japan, KDDI and SoftBank Corp, the country's number-two and number-three carriers respectively, said they were delaying the release of Huawei handsets.Huawei will lose its access to Google's Android operating system, preventing the company from making phones with Gmail, YouTube and the Google Play Store built-in."However, rather than a reprieve for the Chinese firm itself, the slight easing of rules is squarely aimed at Huawei's past customers, such as rural broadband providers or owners of its Android phones", UBS said.Japan's Toshiba also announced it was temporarily halting shipments to Huawei to check whether US-made parts were involved, in order to comply with Washington's new restrictions.The BBC also reported that British firm ARM, which designs processors used in most mobile devices and makes products that contain "US-origin technology", is set to cut ties with Huawei.Huawei's own operating system could be called Ark OSSamsung can actually take a huge leap forward through this downfall of Huawei , which can help it be ahead in the race. Instead, the company has to depend on a brand like Asahi Glass or they have to come up with their own tempered glass.Vodafone soon followed suit, announcing a temporary suspension of pre-orders for Huawei handsets.Huawei said in response that it recognised "the pressure" placed on its suppliers and that it was "confident this regrettable situation can be resolved".The Osaka-based company does not have a major production site for components in the United States, but it said the ban applies to goods having 25% or more of US -originated technologies or materials.Tensions between the two countries have hit fever pitch in recent days as the United States trade ban sends shockwaves through the supply chain. In the immediate aftermath of being placed on the list, U.S. companies started cutting off Huawei from access to their technologies, starting off with Google. That prompted Google and others to begin suspending dealings with the firm.On a related topic, all Huawei phones have also been removed from the official Android.com site.Huawei has been facing allegations that it spies for the Chinese government which the company vehemently denies.On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security announced it would allow some companies to continue to do business with Huawei under specific conditions.Load-Date: June 1, 2019End of Document

"I didn't yell anything back"."I was just traumatized", she said.Jocelyn said that she was on her way to work when the accident occurred and is now afraid that her insurance premium will go up because Tracy's vehicle is so expensive.USA claims China playing 'blame game' in trade warHowever, the white paper said the White House demanded more as they were given new offers from their Chinese counterparts. The Chinese government further revealed that Trump's administration actually did the same thing."Thanks for any concern but I am totally fine".A witness says Morgan said he had just bought the auto and paid $2 million for it. Madulid also says that she was on her way to work when the crash occurred. Morgan was involved in a minor traffic accident on Tuesday, June 4, 2019, while driving his 2019 Bugatti in New York City. "We are both turning right - people are still crossing [the street]. I was there, he was the one who hit me!" He was talking about it all weekend.Prior to the accident, Madulid said that she was "curious" as she saw people taking photos of Morgan in his new vehicle. He couldn't wait to get it.The comedian seems to be unlucky when it comes to roads as he was in involved in a fatal accident in 2014 that killed his friend and left him seriously injured.The former "Saturday Night Live" star suffered major injuries as a result and he sued Walmart as a result.Load-Date: June 8, 2019End of Document

The protesters have been trying to hand over military power to the civilian forces in the country.The TMC has offered to let protesters form a government to run the country but insists on maintaining overall authority during an interim period.Tens of thousands of protesters have been camped since April 6 outside the military's headquarters, the epicenter of Sudan's uprising that led to the military overthrow of al-Bashir.Demonstrators want civilians to run the transitional period and lead the North African country of 40 million to democracy.Earlier, a statement by protest leaders said the military is trying to disperse the sit-in, and urged supporters to come to the area.Sudanese security forces are moving against a protest sit-in camp in the capital, besieging the site, witnesses and protest leaders said.

Mining and Refining Magnesium in the United States; Mg Magnesium Inc., is a US based corporation engaged in the mining and production of magnesium products, announced today that it has reached an agreement with CVMR(USA) Inc. (CVMR®) to mine, beneficiate (concentrate) and refine one of the largest North American Magnesium mines owned by Mg Magnesium Inc. - Mg Magnesium Inc.PR NewswireJune 3, 2019 Monday 6:00 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1046 wordsDateline: CHEYENNE, Wyo., June 3, 2019 BodyPR NewswireCHEYENNE, Wyo., June 3, 2019 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Mg Magnesium Inc., a US-based corporation engaged in the mining and production of magnesium products, announced today that it has reached an agreement with CVMR (USA) Inc. (CVMR®) to mine, beneficiate (concentrate) and refine one of the largest North American Magnesium mines owned by Mg Magnesium Inc. According to this agreement, the beneficiation and refining plants will be built by CVMR®, using its proprietary processes and refining technology. The refinery is scheduled to be built in Tennessee. The capital cost for phase one of the project is estimated to be about $60 mil. The plant will be constructed in a modular structure that can be expanded to produce a variety of Magnesium-based products for the US market.Mg Magnesium Inc.'s Serpentinite Magnesium deposits bear substantial quantities of Rare Earth Elements and other valuable minerals as well. A series of field and metallurgical works were carried out during 2018 consisting of detailed geological surveys, systematic sampling of the mineral body, preparation and supervision of an extensive diamond drilling program, analysis and interpretation of results. The mine is certified to contain over 22 million tons of "proven reserves" of Magnesium Oxide with an average grade of 36.5%. It has sufficient reserves of Magnesium to curtail substantial imports of Magnesium into the United States from China.The US economy is growing faster than anyone had expected. Consequently, self-sufficiency in raw materials has become of great importance. Magnesium is a crucial element used in various industrial products, medicine, and food supplements. MgMI is taking advantage of this vast, highly diversified and ever-expanding market in the United States by initiating the mining and refining of its magnesium resources in partnership with CVMR®.China is the world's largest magnesium producer. The producers in China have massive primary magnesium production capacity, and most Chinese government export statistics indicate that they are increasing their production capacity. The industry producing Magnesium in China is heavily export-oriented, with more than half of its 2018 production exported to the United States, sometimes below production cost. Given the existing antidumping duty controls in place against alloys of Magnesium, China would have a strong incentive to shift production to finished goods, if the orders were revoked and end users of refined Magnesium in the US looked for alternative sources. Magnesium from China is also currently subject to antidumping duties in Brazil and Europe.CVMR®CVMR® is a mining and refining company that refines some 36 different metals. It is a world leader in metal powder production used in 3D printing, Metal Injection Moulding (MIM), superalloys, complex net shapes, electronics, rechargeable batteries, manufacture of aerospace and automotive parts, medical instruments and pharmaceuticals. In producing these products, CVMR® uses its proprietary technologies and refining processes based on vapour metallurgy. CVMR ®'s name and trademark is an acronym derived from its principal refining process, "chemical vapour metal refining." All CVMR® refining processes are environmentally neutral without an impact on the air, water, or soil. CVMR® is a designated NATO supplier.MAGNESIUM MARKETThere is an increasing demand for Magnesium in the United States. Magnesium is an attractive material for the automotive, aerospace and defense industries, primarily because of its lightweight (36% lighter per unit volume than aluminum and 78% lighter than iron.) When alloyed, Magnesium has the highest strength-to-weight ratio of all the structural metals.In the aerospace and automotive part manufacturing, Magnesium Alloys can withstand elevated-temperature applications. New Magnesium Alloys have been developed by CVMR® that use calcium and strontium or Rare Earth Elements with sufficient creep resistance at elevated temperatures. These alloys are used in components such as engine blocks and power trains.Magnesium is considered to be a good choice material in the areas of defense and aerospace engineering for aircraft and missile components; aircraft engine mounts, control hinges, fuel tanks, and wings, all use alloys of Magnesium. In the automotive and motorcycle sectors, Magnesium is used for wheels, housings, transmission cases, engine blocks, steering wheels and columns, seat frames and electronics. The use of Magnesium and its alloys in automotive components was limited in the early sixties and seventies, but today, fuel savings and environmental protection through reduced CO2 emissions have substantially increased its demand.The usage of Magnesium and its alloys, on a worldwide scale, has increased considerably over the past ten years. In structural applications, where weight plays a major role, Magnesium is by far a superior choice. Laptop computers, television sets, cell phones, and many other electronic devices use Magnesium as a primary metal.Magnesium is a critical nutrient necessary for our bodies to function well. Magnesium deficiency has far-reaching consequences, from Alzheimer's and Asthma, to back pain, blood pressure, colon cancer, diabetes, cirrhosis of the liver, toxic shock syndrome, urinary incontinence among many more illnesses, all can be traced often to a dietary deficiency in Magnesium. Magnesium is such a vital part of our biology that, often times, simply adding it to our diet and supplementation routine will reverse a whole slew of health issues.Magnesium salts are included in various foods, fertilizers, manufacture of paper, fireproofing wood, mothproofing textiles, and electrical insulators. Magnesium compounds, primarily Magnesium Oxide, are used as a refractory material in furnace lining to produce iron, steel, nonferrous metals, glass, and cement.The underlying demand for Magnesium remains quite robust in the United States as the aluminum alloying sector ramps up amid a booming automotive market. Mg Magnesium is in an enviable position to take advantage of this vast, highly diversified and ever-expanding market in the United States and beyond.For more information visit us athttps://www.magnesiuminc.comSOURCE Mg Magnesium Inc.Load-Date: June 4, 2019End of Document

This is good, since you can physically ensure security, including privacy," he explained.  The interest of the telecommunications giant appears at a time when it is accused by the United States of being an arm of the Chinese government and attacking national security, recommending its allies not to use their products.  Yong also reiterated in the interview the company's interest in the submarine cable project that will connect the world's largest copper producer with Asia and hope that the stage of selecting suppliers to participate will open.  "I do not know if the route will be defined now or later, Huawei is interested in this project," he said. "We will see what the role of Huawei will be."  During a tour of China, Chilean President Sebastián Piñera met with senior executives of that company and invited them to participate in the upcoming 5G network and transpacific cable offers, noting that they will be open tenders.  Yong stressed that Huawei is committed to comply with international standards and Chile in cybersecurity. Load-Date: April 28, 2019End of Document

WHITE HOUSE DOWNPLAYS TRUMP MEETING WITH TYCOONStates News ServiceMay 2, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 693 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):Steve HermanA White House meeting between the current U.S. president and a prominent businessman who is seeking to become president of Taiwan is causing concern. The White House on Thursday sought to downplay any diplomatic or political sensitivities, saying President Donald Trump and Foxconn founder Terry Gou did not discuss support for the billionaire's presidential campaign in Taiwan. "He is just a great friend" of Trump, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement. The Taiwanese businessman, however, in a Facebook posting after Wednesday's meeting and in a discussion with reporters, said he told the president of his candidacy and Trump responded that being president "was a tough job." He also displayed a pen and autographed coin he said that Trump gave him. "If I am elected president of the Republic of China, I will be a peacemaker and won't become a troublemaker," Gou told reporters. "I will strengthen Taiwan and the U.S. economically." He also boasted that of all the presidential contenders, he is the only one to have secured an Oval Office meeting. Wednesday's discussion is the first known circumstance of a sitting American president meeting with a Taiwanese presidential candidate since Washington broke diplomatic ties with Taipei in 1979 as part of its recognition of the communist government in Beijing. Gou is to seek the nomination of the opposition Kuomintang party in Taiwan's 2020 presidential election. The party is regarded as having a friendlier stance toward Beijing than the ruling Democrat Progressive Party of President Tsai Ing-wen.Terry Gou, founder of Foxconn, holds a testimonial next to a portrait of Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of Taiwan, as he announces his bid for the nomination of the opposition Kuomintang party to run for the island's presidency, in Taipei, Taiwan, April 17,2019. Trump also was seen as breaking protocol as president-elect when he had a phone conversation with Tsai, something that prompted protest from the Chinese government, which regards Taiwan as a renegade island province. The Trump-Gou meeting occurred at a particularly sensitive time. The United States is in the final stages of negotiating a sweeping trade deal with China amid growing strategic tension between the two Pacific powers. Meanwhile, Gou who has appeared in public previously alongside Trump to tout economic investment is receiving criticism in the U.S. state of Wisconsin because what was envisioned as a $10 billion liquid crystal display factory project has fallen behind schedule. "Mr. Gou is spending a lot of money in Wisconsin and soon will announce even more investment there," the White House press secretary said in her statement. Foxconn, which is a major supplier for Apple Inc. products, says Gou and Trump discussed the "positive progress of the Wisconn Valley Science and Technology Park project and other matters." Trump, a strong supporter of the project in the political swing state, has proclaimed it the "eighth wonder of the world" for its scope and its projected economic impact, including as many as 13,000 jobs. There is concern about whether it will become a reality as envisioned because Foxconn failed to meet its job targets in 2018 to qualify for state tax credits and it has reduced the size of the factory it originally announced it would construct. Gou, speaking to reporters on Wednesday, disputed that anything significant has changed. "It is not right to say our investment in Wisconsin has changed," he said. "We suspended the work around October and November last year because the weather there was snowy and icy cold. We will continue our work in May when the weather gets warmer."FILE - Wisconsin Democratic candidate for governor Tony Evers speaks at a rally in Milwaukee, Oct. 26, 2018.

LONDON MARKET EARLY CALL: Lower Call; BHP Group Cuts GuidanceLive Briefs PRO Global MarketsApril 17, 2019 Wednesday 2:00 AM ESTCopyright 2019 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 854 wordsBody Stock prices in London are called for a slightly lower open on Wednesday, despite sentiment getting a further boost from positive Chinese GDP data. In early UK company news, mining giant BHP Group has been forced to reduce iron ore guidance for 2019 following Cyclone Veronica in Australia. IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index is to open 7 points lower at 7,462.92. The blue-chip index closed 0.4% higher at 7,469.92 on Tuesday. China's economy grew 6.4% in the first quarter of 2019, holding steady from the last quarter of 2018, official data showed Wednesday.The data beat analysts' expectations of a 6.3% growth in the first quarter. Financial indicators in March had suggested the government's efforts to shore up the slowing economy were starting to take hold.Exports jumped 14.2% year-on-year in March, after a serious contraction in February.China's economy grew 6.6% last year - its slowest pace in almost three decades - due to pressure from a trade war with the US and rising government debt.Chinese Premier Li Keqiang last month set a 6-to-6.5% economic growth target for 2019, citing "rising uncertainties" facing the world's second-largest economy."This is just the latest in a string of recent Chinese data that has surprised to the upside, indicating policy implemented by Beijing at the end of last year could finally be bearing fruit," said London Capital Group's Jasper Lawler."Concerns over the health of the Chinese economy will start to fade following the recent impressive run in data. An improvement in the Chinese economy was a necessary requirement for an improvement in the health of the global economic outlook."The Japanese Nikkei 225 index is up 0.3%. In China, the Shanghai Composite is 0.4% higher, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is marginally higher.In the economic calendar locally on Wednesday, UK producer prices and consumer prices figures are delivered at 0930 BST."With wages growth at ten-year highs consumers will be hoping inflation pressures continue to remain soft, having seen headline CPI slip back over the last few months to as low as 1.8% at the beginning of the year," CMC Markets UK's Michael Hewson said."We have seen a modest rebound in the last couple of months, to 2%, though core prices have been more subdued, with the main price rises coming in the form of oil price rises filtering through."In corporate news, BHP Group has reduced annual iron ore production guidance after a cyclone affected its operations, as it reported third-quarter production results.For the nine months ended March, iron ore production remained flat at 175 million tonnes. Copper production fell 3% to 1.25 million tonnes. In coal, metallurgical coal and energy coal production both remained unchanged at 31 million tonnes and 20 million tonnes, respectively.BHP reduced its iron ore guidance for 2019 to between 235 million tonnes and 239 million tonnes from between 241 and 250 million tonnes previously. This was after the firm was forced to reduce output forecast following the disruption caused by Cyclone Veronica in March. In financial 2018, iron ore production was 238.4 million tonnes.Wednesday's UK corporate calendar has first quarter results from support services firm Bunzl, oil & gas industry services company Hunting, property group SEGRO, asset manager Quilter and cybersecurity firm Avast.Meanwhile, trading statements are expected from estate agent Countryside Properties, private hospital firm Mediclinic International and currency manager Record.In the US on Tuesday, Wall Street ended higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing up 0.3%, the S&P 500 0.1% higher, and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.3%.Online-video streaming service Netflix on Tuesday reported a first-quarter profit that rose from last year, as subscriber additions surged.Earnings for the quarter trumped Wall Street estimates, as did revenue. However, moving ahead, Netflix detailed a weak second-quarter guidance.Netflix added 9.60 million subscribers globally in the quarter, above its forecast of 8.90 million, to end the quarter with 148.86 million subscribers. The company added 1.74 million customers in the US during the quarter, above its estimates of 1.60 million. Netflix's first-quarter profit rose to USD344 million, or USD0.76 per share, from USD290 million, or USD0.64 per share, last year. On average, 36 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected earnings of USD0.57 per share for the quarter.Netflix's revenue for the quarter rose 22% to USD4.52 billion from USD3.70 billion last year. Analysts had a consensus revenue estimate of USD4.50 billion for the quarter.Looking forward to the second quarter, Netflix expects revenue of USD4.93 billion and earnings of USD0.55 per share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters currently expect earnings of USD0.99 per share and revenues of USD4.95 billion.Elsewhere the data calendar Wednesday, eurozone current account data is released at 0900 BST with trade balance and consumer price index figures at 1000 BST.In the US, trade balance data is printed at 1330 BST after mortgage applications figures are released at 1200 BST. Load-Date: April 18, 2019End of Document

The Company defines non-GAAP general and administrative expenses as general and administrative expenses excluding share-based compensation. The Company defines non-GAAP loss from operations as loss from operations excluding share-based compensation. The Company defines non-GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders as net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders excluding share-based compensation and impairment loss of long-term investment. The Company defines non-GAAP loss per ADS as loss per ADS excluding share-based compensation and impairment loss of long-term investment per ADS. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.The Company believes that non-GAAP loss from operations, non-GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and non-GAAP loss per ADS help identify underlying trends in its business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain expenses that it includes in loss from operations and net loss. Share-based compensation is a non-cash expense that varies from period to period. Impairment loss of long-term investment is a non-cash expense that occurred in this period. As a result, management excludes these two items from its internal operating forecasts and models. Management believes that this adjustment for share-based compensation provides investors with a basis to measure the company's core performance, including compared with the performance of other companies, without the period-to-period variability created by share-based compensation. The Company believes that non-GAAP loss from operations, non-GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and non-GAAP loss per ADS provide useful information about its operating results, enhances the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the management in their financial and operational decision-making.The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP loss from operations, non-GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders or non-GAAP loss per ADS is that it does not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the Company's operations. Further, the non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. The Company encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.Reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included at the end of this press release.Exchange Rate Information StatementThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader.

Apple touches the valuation of the trillion dollars againCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 2, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 877 wordsBody The value of the stock market of Apple returned yesterday to overcome briefly the barrier of the trillion of dollars, when Wall Street breathed with relief before the signals of which the worse part of the fall of the iPhone was behind.  Late last day, the US consumer technology giant projected a faster-than-expected rebound from a six-month drop in revenue, driven by lower sales of mobile phones, especially in China.  The news yesterday caused a 6 percent rise in Apple shares, which led the company to overcome the trillion dollar mark, which crossed for the first time last summer, although the slide in shares Technology last fall and the problems of the iPhone later caused that 330 billion dollars of its value were eliminated.  The company issued an income guideline of between 52 thousand 500 and 54 thousand 500 million dollars for the quarter ending in June, the third of its fiscal year. At the midpoint of the range, that was $ 1.5 billion above the estimates of most analysts and points to a slight increase in revenue of $ 53.3 billion in sales in the same quarter last year.  Speaking in an interview before the earnings conference with analysts, Luca Maestri, CFO of the company, said the guidance reflects growing confidence in the outlook for the iPhone after the company's early earnings warning. of year.  "We saw an improvement in the performance of our iPhone during the quarter, especially in the last few weeks," he said.  The recovery was particularly noticeable in China, he added, thanks in part to price reductions and the introduction of new payment programs for buyers.  Tim Cook, executive director, also pointed to more general economic and political factors that are likely to be considered encouraging for other companies that sell to consumers in China. These include a boost due to the Chinese government's actions to stimulate the economy, including a reduction in the value-added tax rate.  "The stimulus programs, I think, have an effect on consumers," he said at the results conference.  He also attributed the strongest sales in China at the end of the first quarter to a reduction in commercial tensions. "The trade dialogue between the EU and China improved. From our point of view, that affected the confidence of the consumer in the field in a positive way, "he explained.  With 10 thousand 200 million dollars, Apple's sales in the Asian country fell almost 22 percent in the last quarter compared to the previous year. However, that was an improvement compared to the 27 percent drop reported three months ago.  The partial recovery at the end of the quarter did not prevent the income of the iPhone from slipping 17 percent, to reach 31 thousand 100 million dollars. The drop made iPhones account for less than 54 percent of Apple's overall revenue, compared to 62 percent the previous year and its smallest contribution in the second quarter in six years.  In spite of that, on Wall Street the figures were considered as confirmation that the iPhone business stabilized, after a sharp slowdown that began with what many considered too aggressive price increases last year to compensate for the lack of growth of volume per unit.  Cook said that Apple's price reductions in China covered the higher costs caused by the rise of the US dollar "and much more."  Typically, Apple sees a sequential decline in revenue of between 13 and 15 perpercent in the quarter through June, as customers begin to anticipate the next iPhone launch. But its revenue pattern for this year pointed to a seasonal fall of only 8 percent.  The forecast of a possible return to growth occurred when Apple recorded a 5 percent drop in revenues in the last quarter, to 58 billion dollars, or slightly above the expectations of most analysts that corresponds to the decrease of the previous three months. Its earnings per share of $ 2.46, although 10 percent below the previous year, were 10 percent above Wall Street forecasts.  Reported income would be 2 percent higher if it had not been for the increase in the value of the US dollar. Apple also said it set its revenue forecast for the current quarter after taking into account the anticipated impact of the 3 percent currency.  The decline in concerns about the iPhone freed Wall Street to focus on other parts of Apple's business, where strong growth could soon overcome falling mobile phone revenues. This includes the 22 percent increase in iPad revenues - the best in six years - after the product was reformed last year.  Revenues from services increased 16 percent, to reach 11 thousand 500 million dollars. While it only represents 20 percent of sales, services generated a third of Apple's gross profits, Maestri said. Apple said it added 30 million subscription accounts in the last three months, bringing the total to more than 390 million.  The company also announced a $ 75 billion increase in its share buyback program, in line with expectations, and a 5 percent increase in its quarterly dividend payments.  Apple's valuation of a trillion dollars is based on the share count that was most recently released. After the recent share buybacks, a new title count had to be issued yesterday, which will potentially cause the valuation to fall below the trillion dollar mark. Load-Date: May 2, 2019End of Document

Huawei apt to be stripped of Google services after US banAssociated Press InternationalMay 20, 2019 Monday 11:06 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 903 wordsByline: By FRANK BAJAK and JOE McDONALD, Associated PressBodyHuawei could quickly lose its grip on the No. 2 ranking in worldwide cellphone sales after Google announced it would comply with U.S. government restrictions meant to punish the Chinese tech powerhouse.The Trump administration's move, which effectively bars U.S. firms from selling components and software to Huawei, ups the ante in a trade war between Washington and Beijing that partly reflects a struggle for global economic and technological dominance.Google said it would continue to support existing Huawei smartphones but future devices will not have its flagship apps and services, including maps, Gmail and search. Only basic services would be available for future versions of the Android operating system on Huawei's smartphones.Though the U.S. Commerce Department grants exceptions, the ban announced last week on all purchases of U.S. technology is thus apt to badly hurt Huawei, analysts say.Washington claims Huawei poses a national security threat, and its placement on the so-called Entity List by the Trump administration last week is widely seen as intended to persuade resistant U.S. allies in Europe to exclude Huawei equipment from their next-generation wireless networks, known as 5G."This is major crisis for Huawei. Instead of being the world's largest handset manufacturer this year, it will struggle to stay two, but probably fall behind," analyst Roger Entner said. "How competitive is a smartphone without the most well-known and popular apps?"Huawei will likely use its own, stripped-down version of Android, whose basic code is provided free of charge by Google. But the Mountain View, California, company said Huawei would not be authorized to use other Google software and services if the sanctions go forward as announced.Google could seek exemptions, but would not comment on whether it planned to do so.Entner, founder of Recon Analytics, said Google itself won't feel a large direct impact, "as consumers will shift to other Android devices. The biggest concern is not to be caught in the crossfire of two governments."Gartner analyst Tuong Nguyen said 48% of Huawei's phone shipments last year were outside of China and the company will need to scramble not to lose market share.Samsung led global smartphone sales in the first quarter of this year with a 23.1% share. Huawei was second with 19%, followed by Apple at 11.7%, according to IDC.Huawei's smartphone sales in the U.S. are tiny - and the Chinese company's footprint in telecommunications networks is limited to smaller wireless and internet providers- so any impact on U.S. consumers of a Google services cutoff would be slight.Hardware suppliers led by Qualcomm, Broadcom and Intel would also be forced to halt shipments to Huawei under the Commerce Department rule, which requires all U.S. technology sales to the company to obtain U.S. government approval unless exceptions are made.The Commerce Department on Monday announced a 90-day grace period this week. In a report, the global risk assessment outfit Eurasia Group said that if the sanction process helps persuade European carriers to shun Huawei equipment, a full ban on purchases of U.S. technology products and services could be avoided.Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., said in a statement late Sunday that it was complying with and "reviewing the implications" of the requirement for export licenses for technology sales to Huawei, which took effect Thursday. "For users of our services, Google Play and the security protections from Google Play Protect will continue to function on existing Huawei devices," it added.The U.S. government says Chinese suppliers including Huawei and its smaller rival, ZTE Corp., pose an espionage threat because they are beholden to China's ruling Communist Party. But American officials have presented no evidence of any Huawei equipment serving as intentional conduits for espionage by Beijing.Huawei, headquartered in the southern city of Shenzhen near Hong Kong, reported earlier that its worldwide sales rose 19.5% last year over 2017 to 721.2 billion ($105.2 billion). Profit rose 25.1% to 59.3 billion yuan ($8.6 billion).Huawei smartphone shipments rose 50% in the first three months of 2019 to 59.1 million, compared with a year earlier, while the global industry's total fell 6.6%, according to IDC. Shipments from Samsung and Apple both declined.Huawei defended itself Monday as "one of Android's key global partners." The company said it helped to develop a system that "benefited both users and the industry.""We will continue to build a safe and sustainable software ecosystem, in order to provide the best experience for all users globally," the company said.A foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang, said China will "monitor the development of the situation" but gave no indication how Beijing might respond.The U.S. order took effect Thursday and requires government approval for all purchases of American microchips, software and other components globally by Huawei and 68 affiliated businesses. Huawei says that amounted to $11 billion in goods last year.That could certainly create some collateral damage for U.S. companies.The California chipmaker Xilinx Inc. tumbled 4% Monday. David Wong, an analyst with Nomura, said Xilinx has benefited from demand in next-generation, 5G technologies and "action against a major maker of communications infrastructure equipment like Huawei likely poses risk for Xilinx."Load-Date: May 21, 2019End of Document

In a report, the global risk assessment outfit Eurasia Group said that if the sanction process helps persuade European carriers to shun Huawei equipment, a full ban on purchases of U.S. technology products and services could be avoided.Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., said in a statement late Sunday that it was complying with and "reviewing the implications" of the requirement for export licenses for technology sales to Huawei, which took effect Thursday. "For users of our services, Google Play and the security protections from Google Play Protect will continue to function on existing Huawei devices," it added.The U.S. government says Chinese suppliers including Huawei and its smaller rival, ZTE Corp., pose an espionage threat because they are beholden to China's ruling Communist Party. But American officials have presented no evidence of any Huawei equipment serving as intentional conduits for espionage by Beijing.Huawei, headquartered in the southern city of Shenzhen near Hong Kong, reported earlier that its worldwide sales rose 19.5% last year over 2017 to 721.2 billion ($105.2 billion). Profit rose 25.1% to 59.3 billion yuan ($8.6 billion).Huawei smartphone shipments rose 50% in the first three months of 2019 to 59.1 million, compared with a year earlier, while the global industry's total fell 6.6%, according to IDC. Shipments from Samsung and Apple both declined.Huawei defended itself Monday as "one of Android's key global partners." The company said it helped to develop a system that "benefited both users and the industry.""We will continue to build a safe and sustainable software ecosystem, in order to provide the best experience for all users globally," the company said.A foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang, said China will "monitor the development of the situation" but gave no indication how Beijing might respond.The U.S. order took effect Thursday and requires government approval for all purchases of American microchips, software and other components globally by Huawei and 68 affiliated businesses. Huawei says that amounted to $11 billion in goods last year.That could certainly create some collateral damage for U.S. companies.The California chipmaker Xilinx Inc. tumbled 4% Monday. David Wong, an analyst with Nomura, said Xilinx has benefited from demand in next-generation, 5G technologies and "action against a major maker of communications infrastructure equipment like Huawei likely poses risk for Xilinx."Load-Date: May 21, 2019End of Document

Ryan Kavanaugh's Proxicoin, The First Security Token Allowing Investors To Invest In Studio Quality Film And Television Slates, Receives $100 Million USD Investment From The Central Wealth Investment Fund Of Hong Kong And Step Ventures; Also Announces the Creation of the Entertainment Stock X (ESX), the First Trading Platform Where Films, Television, Music and Other IP Will Be IPOd and Publicly TradedPR NewswireMay 23, 2019 Thursday 2:00 PM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1486 wordsDateline: HONG KONG, May 23, 2019 BodyPR Newswire Proxicoin and the Central Wealth Group of Hong Kong announced today that the Central Wealth Investment Fund of Hong Kong and Step Ventures is investing $100 million USD into Proxicoin, a first of its kind security token (STO).Proxicoin, created and owned by Proxima Media, is a securities token built on the Ethereum platform which allows fractionalized ownership in film, television, music and other IP-driven content where every day qualified investors can, for the very first time, participate in the Hollywood industry in a capacity previously available only to large, elite institutions. "Blockchain technology is enabling new business models that unlock value in traditional industries like film financing. Global audiences can now participate as investors in tokenized offerings through a new asset class. Having worked closely with the management team to structure the offering, we are confident that Proxicoin will create unprecedented value by establishing a marketplace for global entertainment assets," said Aman Johar, Principal at Proteum Capital, who has been an early advisor and consultant to Proxicoin.The token has been built and is fully audited and has already signed a deal with the Fusang Exchange.  Fusang is the first crypto exchange in Asia that trades security tokens and Proxicoin will be among the first security tokens to be listed and traded on their platform.Proxicoin holders will also be partial owners of Entertainment Stock X (ESX), an innovative platform operating similar to a stock exchange for financing entertainment projects.  It utilizes Regulation A of the JOBS Act allowing each film or TV show to undergo an IPO, providing liquidity for each production through aftermarket trading. ESX takes advantage of the booming global demand for content while helping fill the need for new, efficient sources of financing for filmmakers. There are only 57 recognized trading platforms worldwide, making this a unique and highly sought-after asset. It will also benefit from the $1.6 billion USD, and growing, crowd-sourced film financing market. Proxima has been working on building ESX for almost two years and expects to be live before the end of the year. Currently the trading platform has deals for listings on over 30 major feature film projects and is expected to have a significant share of the 600 major films and television shows shot annually."This is a game-changing moment for the entertainment industry.  Proxicoin makes a highly sought-after financial product available to many individual and smaller investors. Film, as an asset class, is traditionally uncorrelated to capital markets and has been a competitive and sought-after asset class among the large hedge funds and banks including Citibank, Duetsche Bank, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and many others. During the Great Depression one of the only stocks that went up was MGM," said Vincent Tse, CEO of Step Ventures."We are impressed by the Proxicoin team and their dedication to creating cooperation and synergies between the China and Hollywood film industries," said David Lee of The Central Wealth Group of Hong Kong.  "We are looking forward to reaping success from our investment in Proxicoin and their respected leadership on the roadmap to developing great productions using the latest technology. This is perfect for our LP investors to help create a broad and highly defensive portfolio looking to create better than market returns.""Proxicoin and this transaction eliminate many of the hurdles that have held back growth between the two countries due to heavy restrictions in currency conversion. Proxicoin removes those friction points while creating total transparency. We have put together a stellar team to implement what we believe will be a serious paradigm shift in the financing and marketing of films. We have top bankers with a deep understanding of the capital markets, content creators, operators and brand experts. Having Central Wealth Investment Fund and Step VC as partners is a great validation for us that we are on the right track. There couldn't be better lead investors and partners," said Ryan Kavanaugh.The front end of the trading platform was built through a partnership with Hanzo, a Techstars funded AI marketing platform that has powered over $300 million USD in funding for some of the most successful crowd sales in history. Zach Kelling, founder and CEO of Hanzo comes on board, via an exclusive agreement, to lead development of the ESX exchange platform.The advisory and management team includes Bonin Bough, Chairman of Marketing and Branding; Eddie Ibanez, Technology and Artificial Intelligence Advisor; Jaeson Ma, Co-Chairman of Asia Content; Alex Zhang, Co-Chairman of Asia Content; Aman Johar, CEO of Proteum Partners among many others.Step Ventures is a Hong Kong-based Venture Capital Company whose focus is on investing in emerging technologies, companies which create and promote innovative technology and systems with entrepreneurs with historical success of innovation and creation of paradigm shifts in the technology and media industries.The Hong Kong Central Wealth Group is a publicly-traded, long-established and deeply respected financial services company based in and serving China and Hong Kong. As a comprehensive financial services group enterprise, CWF provides high-quality services through an experienced elite and customer-focused management team. CWF is a global, sound and efficient financial trading platform for China, Hong Kong and Macau investors which provides new, high-quality and safe financial services. Proxima Media was founded by legendary Hollywood producer Ryan Kavanaugh, who together with his executive team, have been responsible for more than 200 films, with a box office of $17 billion. Among their productions are Immortals, Fast and the Furious, Girl with Dragon Tattoo, Salt, Wanted, Limitless, The Fighter, Mirror Mirror, Safe Haven, Beyond the Lights;andThe Social Network, which received eight Oscar nominations. Other films include Mamma Mia! 3:10 to Yuma, Grown Ups and Dear John. Proxicoin is owned and operated by Proxima Media founder, Ryan Kavanaugh. Proxicoin utilizes block chain technology to provide previously untapped investors with the ability to participate in tokenized offerings for film and television financing. Their business model aspires to generate higher market returns by creating a space for the everyday investor to reach global audiences.Mr. Kavanaugh is also credited with originating a number of first-of-their-kind deals that changed the film industry, including for Marvel Studios, which led to the creation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, that has amassed more than $17.5 billion at the worldwide box office. Mr. Kavanaugh followed-up that success with a first of its kind television pay deal with Netflix and created what is today known as the SVOD window for Netflix, which boosted Netflix's market capitalization to $10 billion USD. He was also honored with a 'Hollywood Producer of the Year' Award and was named by Variety as, 'Showman of the Year.'  Mr. Kavanaugh has a depth of experience in China as he was instrumental in launching Sky Land Entertainment, which entered into a historic partnership with Huaxia Film Distribution Co. Ltd. to handle production and distribution of films in China and the U.S. The deal marks the only strategic alliance to date between a Hollywood film production entity and a Chinese government-sponsored company. Mr. Kavanaugh's other notable credits include what is now called Independent Sports & Entertainment, an integrated sports, media, entertainment and management company that represents 300 of the best athletes in the NBA, NFL and MLB, and is the second-largest integrated management company in the U.S. with about $2.5 billion in player contacts. He also created the powerhouse television company, now called Critical Content, which produced hit shows such as Catfish on MTV and Limitless on CBS and under his tenure had over 40 series on the air.Entertainment Stock X (ESX) is an innovative aftermarket-trading platform two years in the making. Individual film or television projects will undertake an IPO to be given liquidity and be easily traded with transparency, providing an efficient avenue for filmmakers seeking financing for the growing demand for new content. ESX currently has deals for listings on over 30 major feature film projects and is expected to have a significant share of the 600 major films and television shows shot annually. ESX is expected to launch by the end of 2019. View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ryan-kavanaughs-proxicoin-the-first-security-token-allowing-investors-to-invest-in-studio-quality-film-and-television-slates-receives-100-million-usd-investment-from-the-central-wealth-investment-fund-of-hong-kong-and-step-ven-300856147.htmlSOURCE Proxima Media LLCCONTACT: Howard Bragman, 310.508.3700, Howard@LaBrea.MediaLoad-Date: May 24, 2019End of Document

Meng was arrested on December 1, 2018 at the Vancouver airport, at the request of the US, which seeks her extradition. THE RESPONSE OF HUAWEI Faced with this blockade, the Chinese company said they are 'willing to collaborate' with the US government and 'propose' effective measures to ensure the safety of the products. He also warned that these restrictions would only harm the United States.  'Restricting Huawei from doing business in the United States will not make them safer or stronger, on the contrary, it will only serve to limit them to lower and more expensive alternatives, leaving them behind in the deployment of 5G and, eventually, harming the interests of the companies. companies and consumers in that country, "he said.  He also considered that "these unreasonable restrictions would infringe the rights of the Chinese company and pose other serious legal problems."  Prior to this veto, Huawei president for Central America and the Caribbean, Harry Bai, stated that "in the 32 years that the company has been operating in 170 countries around the world, we have not had any problem, conflict or complaint about security computing'.  And he affirmed that the accusation of the United States are only "speculations".

Korea's Competitiveness in Memory Semiconductor Has No ProblemTargeted News ServiceApril 8, 2019 Monday 8:10 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 531 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: SEOUL, South Korea BodyThe Korea International Trade Association issued the following news:* * *- Proliferation of 5G service will be a turning point... need to keep in check on China and respond to the US-China disputes* * *An analysis suggests that Korea has a robust global competitiveness in memory semiconductors and the country will be able to take another leap forward when 5G mobile communication-based services are expanded.According to a report titled 'Competitiveness, Opportunities and Threats of the Korean Semiconductor Industry' issued by the Institute for International Trade of the Korea International Trade Association on April 2nd, Korea's memory semiconductor industry has a firm competitive edge despite its recent sluggish export.Korea currently takes up 63.7 percent of the global memory semiconductor market and its technology is far ahead of China and other countries where the followers will not able to catch up in a short term. Although the Chinese government has invested heavily in order to increase the self-sufficiency rate of memory, the technology level is still years behind Korea, and mass production is also failing. Their chase is slow as the cost for microfabrication process is greatly increased.In the system semiconductor industry, the sales volume of the foundry sector of consigned manufacturing rose from 4th place in the world in 2017 to the second place in the world last year, and the manufacturing capacity accumulated in the memory field shines in the system sector as well. However, the fabless sector specialized in design without manufacturing facilities is lagging behind the United States, Japan, Europe and China. Since Korea's system semiconductor industry occupies about half of the global semiconductor market, active investment is urgent.The report selected the proliferation of killer apps that will dominate the markets all at once in 5G, autonomous cars, Internet of Things (IoT), and high-definition streaming as an important opportunity to rebound the stagnant semiconductor demand. When the 5G service proliferates, not only the amount of produced data will increase exponentially but also new semiconductor demand for new services will increase and it will be a breakthrough for Korean semiconductor companies. In the system sector, where Korea is a latecomer, opportunities can arise in places where no one is preempted, such as the app processor (AP) market for automobiles, rather than the mobile AP market, which is already dominated by the United States.* World Mobile Traffic Outlook (Cisco, 2019, EB/Month): ('17)12 - ('18)19 - ('20)41 - ('22)77Kim Kun-woo, a researcher at the Institute for International Trade of the Korea International Trade Association, stressed, "In order to complement the weaknesses of the Korean semiconductor industry and respond to the threats, it is important to reduce the reliance on the overseas semiconductor supply chain by fostering the domestic semiconductor design sector and increasing the self-sufficiency rate of the equipment and materials sector, along with diplomatic efforts to minimize the damage caused by the US-China trade conflicts."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6685780 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: April 9, 2019End of Document

Pentagon, DHS considering designating fentanyl a WMD, memo saysCNN.comApril 19, 2019 Friday 1:17 PM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 919 wordsByline: By David Shortell, CNNBodyTop military and Homeland Security officials are considering classifying fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction, according to an internal DHS memo.The synthetic opioid, blamed in health surveys for surging drug overdose deaths in the United States, has for decades concerned national security officials because of its potential widespread lethality in terror attacks, and in recent months, officials from DHS and the Pentagon have met to discuss an official WMD designation as a tool to disrupt the drug's widespread availability on the black market, the memo says."Fentanyl's high toxicity and increasing availability are attractive to threat actors seeking nonconventional materials for a chemical weapons attack," the DHS assistant secretary for countering weapons of mass destruction, James F. McDonnell, wrote in the memo, which was obtained by the military news publication Task & Purpose.A DHS official confirmed the authenticity of the memo, which was sent to then-DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in February.The national security threat posed by fentanyl has remained largely out of the public eye, but the Trump administration has made thwarting its illegal distribution a centerpiece of the campaign against the opioid crisis.Fentanyl and its derivatives were behind 30,000 of the 72,000 overdose deaths in the US in 2017, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.Versions of the drug, which has legitimate medical use as a painkiller, are widely produced in China and can be purchased on the dark web in the US. Mexican cartels and elements of the heroin trade have been known to use fentanyl as an additive to increase the potency of other illegal drugs.Late last year, after pressure from the Trump administration, the Chinese government said it would add fentanyl to its list of controlled substances in a significant shift that aims to curb the drug's manufacturing in the country.Congress has also set new standards on the US Postal Service that will help customs inspectors screen and interdict packages with fentanyl and other opioids at ports of entry."Disturbingly easy" to weaponizeDespite these efforts, it would be "disturbingly easy" to use the drug in a chemical attack, said Andy Weber, the former assistant secretary of defense for Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Defense Programs."Now that there's actually a market where one can buy large quantities of fentanyl analogues, it eliminates the capability gap and it makes it accessible to terrorist groups," Weber said. "It's a game changer. In my lifetime I've never seen a weapon of mass destruction that is part of an existing black market."There are other officially-designated WMDs that are made from easily obtainable items, like ricin, which is extracted from the castor bean, though weapons experts said the threat posed by fentanyl and its derivatives are more significant."It's as bad as it seems," said a government consultant who requested anonymity to discuss countering-WMD projects he has worked on. "Because of its strength, it's like nothing else that we've seen, beyond radiation, nuclear, chemical and high explosive. It's something that is potentially very, very dangerous."Fentanyl could be weaponized to devastating effect through its distribution in air and water systems.US defense officials first noted the danger of a fentanyl attack when the Russian military in 2002 pumped it into the ventilation system of a theater in Moscow that had been taken over by Chechen rebels, according to Weber.Dozens of hostages were killed by the fentanyl gas, along with the insurgents."That's when we at the Pentagon started to realize that militaries were developing fentanyl analogues as a form of chemical weapon and that we needed to start working on countermeasures," Weber said.Formal designation proposedAccording to the memo, there has been "reinvigorated interest" in addressing fentanyl as a WMD "due to the ongoing opioid crisis," and in recent months, senior DOD leaders, including the commander of the US Southern Command, have proposed the formal designation.Another former Defense Department official, who requested anonymity to speak to CNN about sensitive topics, said the current consideration of fentanyl as a WMD is part of a broader discussion between national security officials around the classification of pharmaceutical-based agents.DHS also had "informal discussions on the topic" in the first two months of this year between its sub-agencies and a number of DOD divisions, McDonnell wrote in the memo.In statements, DHS and US Southern Command both said that they are "constantly assessing" a range of threats in partnership with other agencies, but declined to comment on the specifics of those conversations.Countering illegal shipmentsDesignating fentanyl as a WMD would allow national security officials to more effectively divert resources to building technology that could detect shipments of fentanyl.The Defense Department has been developing capabilities against non-traditional chemical weapons, like fentanyl, according to the memo, but "certain operational [countering weapons of mass destruction] entities at DOD and elsewhere have been slow to act due to concern of getting pulled into the counter-narcotics mission," the memo says.An official WMD designation would also open up new tools for prosecuting the illicit distribution of the drug."It's going to enable them to get moving on the ability to stop big shipments of it quicker and easier," the government consultant said.Load-Date: April 22, 2019End of Document

While the Walmart titles were benefited from the sales growth published yesterday by the supermarket chain.  During the week, the broadcasters with the largest increases were from the financial sector: Compartamos Banco and Banorte, whose stock price accumulated an increase of 11.5% and 10%, respectively.  On Wednesday morning, the BMV presented a communication problem with the brokerage houses, which had to suspend operations for 35 minutes and then resumed them without major problem.  In the United States, the Dow Jones closed at 26,424.99 points, a weekly advance of 1.9%. The S & P gained 2% and closed at 2,892.74 units, and the Nasdaq technology index accumulated a 2.7% rise to 7,938.69 points.  The talks between China and the United States were in the magnifying glass of the market during the week and in the end the resolution was delayed. After Donald Trump met with representatives of the Chinese government, the White House reported that it requires at least four more weeks to close the "epic" trade agreement with the Asian giant, even though the main disputes have been resolved.  Analysts said figures from the US labor and manufacturing markets in China allayed concerns about a global economic recession.  For the following week, the market will be alert to the inflation data of China and the United States, and to the announcement of the European Central Bank. In Mexico, inflation and the minutes of the Bank of Mexico will be announced. Load-Date: April 5, 2019End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 25 of 322Industry Voices—Mun: Today's magic number appears to be 4  Page 29 of 322Kim Jong Un rode his bulletproof armored train from North Korea to Russia's extreme east for his first-ever meeting with Vladimir Putin  Page 32 of 322Pompeo revels in US-UK 'special relationship' despite cracks  Page 34 of 322COLUMN: Thanks to surveillance capitalism, we are headed toward American social control  Page 37 of 322Sen.
