China to scan every mobile user's faceCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 3, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 597 wordsBodyA Chinese government rule that came into force on Sunday requires operators to collect biometric information from all citizens who register a mobile line.Since last Sunday, all Chinese mobile phone users who register a new SIM card in their name will have to undergo facial recognition scans, according to a new regulation approved by Xi Jinping Executive.The standard, announced in September, states that telecommunications companies must implement "artificial intelligence and other technical methods" solutions to verify the identities of people who register a new mobile line. All physical stores in the country have had until December 1 to introduce the new standards.Mobile phone users in the Asian giant must already present their ID or passport at the time of collecting their SIM card, as required in many countries, and taking pictures. Now, the Chinese government is turning this process further and requires storing its biometric data as well.Information explained from the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information will help "protect citizens' legitimate rights and interests in cyberspace," helping to reduce fraud and cybercrime. However, from human rights organizations they denounce that this is yet a further measure to strengthen the already strong control over Chinese citizens on the Internet. It should be remembered that the Asian giant has since 1998 a large digital firewall that restricts its citizens' access to content on the web and to Western platforms such as Facebook or WhatsApp.What is not yet clear is whether customers who already have a mobile line in China Mobile, China Unicom or China Telecom, the country's three major operators, will also need to provide their biometric verification data. The country's carriers had 1.6 billion mobile subscribers by the end of the third quarter, according to GSMA Intelligence estimates.The Chinese 'big brother'For years, China has tightened surveillance rules to ensure that everyone who surfs the Internet in the country does so under their real identity. In practice, this makes it very difficult for internet users to operate under a pseudonym. In 2017, for example, they forced Chinese social media to verify the identity of users before allowing them to post content online.Facial recognition plays a key role in a country's surveillance system that expects to have 400 million security cameras by 2020. In fact, its use has spread from the online world to the physical, being usual lyuse in stations, concert halls and public transport. In China's Xinjiang region, an international media investigation recently revealed, China uses facial recognition to identify and detain members of the Uighur Muslim minority.  Looking for a regulation on biometric recognitionChinese companies, the most developed in the field of facial recognition, are working to approve a new standard in the United Nations International Telecommunication Union (ITU), while trying to open new markets to sell their technology, 'Financial Times' reports. The standards ratified in ITU, comprising almost 200 member states, are adopted as policy by the developing countries of Africa, the Middle East and Asia. With no resources to develop their own regulations, as is the case in Europe or North America, they tend to adopt IUT regulations. In recent years, China's surveillance infrastructure has spread throughoutAfrica.Earlier this year, Johannesburg, in South Africa, installed 15,000 facial recognition cameras from China's Hikvision. In August, Uganda confirmed an agreement with Huawei to deploy its smart cameras.Load-Date: January 27, 2020End of Document

The Weekly: China's Clock is TikTok-ingThe Hillsdale Collegian: Hillsdale CollegeNovember 21, 2019 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HOMEPAGE - OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 322 wordsBodyTikTok was the most down­loaded app during the month of Sep­tember 2019. | WikipediaTikTok, the most-down­loaded social media app in Sep­tember, is looking to cut its Chinese roots. And for good reason: Through TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, the Chinese gov­ernment demands access to TikTok's user data. And when requested, ByteDance hands it over.Now TikTok wants to move out of Beijing and into Sin­gapore or else­where in Southeast Asia. That's a great idea - and other com­panies would do well to follow suit, even if it means losing profits.Earlier this month, United States sen­ators called to undertake a national security review undertook an inves­ti­gation into TikTok's ties with China, con­cerned that the company was cen­soring content to please Beijing. ByteDance runs ads for Chinese gov­ernment min­istries at no cost, according to the Wall Street Journal. The company also sur­renders users' cell phone numbers and national citizen iden­ti­fi­cation numbers to Chinese police if they're deemed nec­essary to inves­tigate an alleged crime.As a former TikTok employee who worked in the company's Los Angeles office told the Wall Street Journal, TikTok "is a Chinese company" who "answers to China."Other orga­ni­za­tions such as the NBA and Google eagerly kowtow to China. After Daryl Morey, general manager of the Houston Rockets, tweeted in support of Hong Kong's pro­testors last month, the rest of the NBA rushed to appease China's Com­munist leaders. Google also col­lab­o­rates with the Chinese gov­ernment, agreeing to censor certain search-engine requests. It also runs an arti­ficial intel­li­gence lab in Beijing.For the pro­tection of privacy and human rights, large cor­po­ra­tions should be leery in business dealings with China, and they should not sac­rifice users' privacy for the sake of com­plying with a total­i­tarian regime. TikTok should exit China, and the others should follow.Load-Date: November 21, 2019End of Document

CHINA EXPORTING LETHAL, AUTONOMOUS WEAPONS TO MIDDLE EAST, ESPER WARNSInside the Air ForceNovember 8, 2019Copyright 2019 Inside Washington Publishers All Rights ReservedLength: 652 wordsBody Posted Nov. 5, 2019The Chinese government is exporting armed drones advertised as being capable of "full autonomy," Defense Secretary Mark Esper said today in a speech aimed at drawing distinctions between the United States and China's competing approaches to artificial intelligence."As we speak, the Chinese government is already exporting some of the most advanced military aerial drones to the Middle East, as it prepares to export its next-generation stealth [unmanned aerial vehicle] when those come online," Esper said today in prepared remarks delivered at the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence conference in Washington."In addition, Chinese weapons manufacturers are selling drones advertised as capable of full autonomy, including the ability to conduct lethal targeted strikes," Esper added. He did not say which countries purchased the drones or which companies sold the weapons.Esper additionally pointed to the Chinese government's use of surveillance technologies and artificial intelligence to repress more than one million Muslim Uyghurs."All signs point to the construction of a 21st century surveillance state designed to censor speech and deny basic human rights on an unprecedented scale," Esper said.Esper also spoke out against international firms doing business in or with the Chinese government."Equally troubling are the outside firms or multinational corporations that are inadvertently or passively providing the technology or research behind China's unethical use of AI," he said.Esper pledged the U.S. government would lead in AI ethics."The United States, on the other hand, will offer a vision of AI that upholds American values and protects our fundamental belief in liberty and human rights," Esper said. "We will harness the potential of AI to create a force fit for our time. We believe there's tremendous opportunity to enhance a wide range of the department's capabilities, from the back office to the front line, and we will do this while being recognized as the world leader in military ethics by developing principles for using AI in a lawful and ethical manner."The Defense Innovation Board last week released its recommended "AI principles" the Pentagon could adopt. Esper appeared to endorse the recommendations, saying he was "very pleased" with the report."It's very comprehensive," Esper said. "It balances out a number of different things. It talks about the need for continued exploration of these topics, to make sure we get it right. This is one we cannot afford to get wrong."The report recommends DOD adhere to five general AI principles, while also stating that the department's adoption of the technology can largely be guided by existing laws of war and DOD ethics rules.Esper's comments represent his most comprehensive public remarks on AI since being sworn in this past July. During his confirmation hearing, Esper said AI was among his top technology priorities since it would "likely change the character of war."During the conference today, Esper also pointed to AI in taking an implicit jab at companies that refuse to work with the Pentagon. While he did not specify any company, DOD officials have been highly critical of Google for dropping out of the Project Maven program.During a session earlier in the day, a Google executive said the company is "committed" to working with DOD."Unlike some parts of the world, American corporations have a choice of who they work with," Esper said. "That is the virtue of our free enterprise system. But let me be clear. The question is not whether AI will be used by militaries around the world -- it will be. The real question is whether we let authoritarian governments dominate AI, and by extension, the battlefield or whether industry, the United States military and our partners can work together to lead the world in responsible AI research and application." -- Justin Doubleday   Load-Date: November 8, 2019End of Document

It makes no mention of Hong Kong or China.The company removed the poster from all its Twitter and Instagram channels on Thursday, Newsweek reported.DC ComicsHours after the ad campaign was released on Wednesday, Chinese fans claimed the book depicted ongoing anti-China protests in Hong Kong, representing veiled support for the demonstrators. Thousands of people have been protesting the Chinese government's increasing encroachment on the semi-autonomous city since June.People on Weibo, the popular Chinese social media platform, said Batwoman's throwing a Molotov cocktail symbolized Hong Kong protesters doing the same, Variety reported.Demonstrations have become increasingly violent in recent weeks, with police officers deploying tear gas and live rounds, and activists using Molotov cocktails and acid on numerous occasions.Anthony Kwan/Getty ImagesChinese commentators also said Batwoman's black clothing and masked face referenced the de facto uniform of the Hong Kong protests - a black t-shirt, black trousers, and a gas mask.Batman has virtually always dressed in black.Chinese fans also claimed that the "golden child" in the book's title referred to the color yellow, the unofficial color of pro-democracy protests in 2014, Variety said.One person wrote on Weibo, according to a screenshot posted on Twitter: "I don't even know what the hell DC is trying to hint at. I've truly never seen Batman hold a Molotov cocktail before."Another Weibo user wrote: "I don't know what exactly [DC Comics] is trying to say, but it's certainly a bit sensitive."Another person wrote, according to Variety: "The black clothes represent Hong Kong, the mask represents Hong Kong, the Molotov cocktail represents Hong Kong, what else here doesn't represent Hong Kong???"REUTERS/Fred Dufour/PoolChina's state-run Global Times tabloid also joined in the fray, reporting that the poster "implied its support of Hong Kong's rioters."Business Insider was unable to find any posts relating to "Dark Knight Returns: The Golden Child" on Weibo on Friday, suggesting that the platform's censors had blocked all mention of the topic.Weibo often removes posts and censors key words to prevent discussion of politically sensitive topics.Aly Song/ReutersDC Comics has not yet responded to Business Insider's request for comment.It is one of many Western companies to have bowed to pressure from Chinese consumers in recent years - a testament to the China market's enormous clout.Dozens of brands, from Dior to Versace to the Houston Rockets, have groveled to Chinese customers after running ad campaigns or products that did not appear to respect China's perceived borders and internal politics.China has proven itself to be an increasingly valuable market to Hollywood production studios, including DC Comics' parent company Warner Bros. US and Canadian box offices earned a total of $11.9 billion on all films last year, while China alone earned $9 billion, according to the Motion Picture Association of America.Warner Bros' 2018 movie, "Aquaman," reaped more than $232 million in Chinese box office sales last year, some $44 million more than what it gained in US box offices.• Read more:• The NBA faces a billion-dollar crisis over one executive's tweet about Hong Kong.

Huawei freaked out at The Wall Street Journal over a report that it secured its global tech dominance on the back of $75 billion in state support from ChinaBusiness Insider USDecember 26, 2019 Thursday 06:27 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 699 wordsByline: kcorcoran@businessinsider.com,  (Kieran Corcoran)Highlight: Huawei accused the news outlet of a pattern of bias against it, and relying on "false information", though it has so far not provided details.BodyReuters• Chinese tech giant Huawei attacked The Wall Street Journal for a reporting detailing $75 billion of state aid which the outlet said underpinned its explosive growth.• It said that loans, grants, tax breaks, and discounted land sales had put it in a stronger position than its rivals.• In response, Huawei denied that state support for its work amounts to special or unfair treatment.• It posted a long rebuttal accusing the Journal of using "false information" and a pattern of biased reporting, though it did not substantiate those allegations.• Huawei has had a rocky 2019 which saw it blacklisted by the US government. Its CFO spent the whole year under house arrest. It maintained a dominant market position nonetheless.• Visit Business Insider's home page for more stories.Huawei launched an angry attack on The Wall Street Journal the day after it published an article laying out what it said was $75 billion in state support from China which helped fuel its growth.The article, published on December 25, ran under the headline "State Support Helped Fuel Huawei's Global Rise."It gave figures for four different ways the Chinese state helped Huawei in its explosive growth to become the world's largest telecoms equipment firm, manufacturing smartphones and vying to build 5G networks around the world.Here are the numbers, based on the Journal's research (which it described in a separate article):• $46 billion in loans, lines of credit and other financing from state lenders• $25 billion in tax breaks for tech companies• $2 billion in discounts on land purchases• $1.6 billion in grantsThe total is $74.6 billion.Huawei said in a statement that the Journal relied on "false information" for its reporting, and characterized it as part of a pattern of "disingenuous" reporting on the company.Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1210110450198671360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw Once again, the @WSJ has published untruths about            #Huawei based on false information.

COMMENTARY: SURFACE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION CRUCIAL THIS CONGRESS BY U.S. REP. DANIEL LIPINSKIStates News ServiceNovember 1, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 707 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of Illinois Rep. Daniel Lipinski:As the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee begins a surface transportation reauthorization, the rail industry is at a unique crossroads. In certain aspects, rail has never been in a stronger position in the post-World War II era. Ridership on commuter and intercity passenger rail is at an all-time high, due in part to perpetual road congestion and younger generations preferences for public transit over driving. On the freight side, rails economic and environmental benefits have sparked renewed interest among shippers wary of road transportation.At the same time, the rail industry is facing serious challenges both new and old that must be addressed. A lack of funding for passenger rail is causing our system to reach a breaking point; we cannot continue to rely on 70-year-old equipment and 100-year-old bridges and tunnels, and expect the system to function efficiently. Modernization requires sustained investment and a commitment to a national passenger-rail system at a level that it is currently lacking. The freight industry is also going through the biggest operational change in a generation through the adoption of precision scheduled railroading. There are valid concerns that this foundational change is not meeting its expectations to benefit the people and businesses that rely on railroads.The railroad supply industry also faces a fundamental threat from a strategic adversary in China. The Chinese government has clearly expressed a desire to take over the passenger- and potentially freight-rail supplier markets in the United States. Its Made in China 2025 initiative aims at our domestic rail markets through state-owned enterprises. The threat is heightened by the industrys move toward integrating new technologies like positive train control, which bring critical safety and economic benefits, but rely on software that could potentially be hacked. We must remain suspicious of Chinas motives and take steps to address its economic and national security threats, including cyber vulnerabilities, while mitigating any consequences to the livelihood of American workers who are currently working at domestic Chinese-owned factories.I have always been well aware of the issues surrounding freight and passenger rail because rail is vital to my district in Northeastern Illinois. The Chicago region is the epicenter of the American rail network, with six Class Is, nearly 4,000 miles of rail, and more than a quarter of U.S. freight rail running through it. In addition, Chicagos commuter rail system, Metra, moves more than 76 million people annually. Railroads, especially freight railroads, have a direct and indirect benefit producing tens of thousands of jobs. But as with many industries, railroads also produce some challenges for local residents.As Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committees Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials, Im ready to lead and tackle all of these challenges and opportunities in the rail industry.The most important work well do this Congress will be the reauthorization of surface transportation programs and Im committed to including a robust rail section in this bill. My priorities include:increasing funding for critical, backlogged capital infrastructure needs on our commuter and intercity passenger rail systems;improving grade crossing safety, including building needed grade separations;addressing community quality of life concerns such as blocked rail crossings and the lack of funding for quiet zones;maintaining an integrated national passenger rail system;protecting our domestic rail supply chain from national security threats, including cybersecurity; andensuring that changes in our freight railroad industry benefit everyone, including railroads, workers, and shippers.I look forward to working with my colleagues and stakeholders this fall to start crafting a reauthorization bill that accomplishes these goals. It is important that we enact a bill this Congress so we provide funding and policy certainty. With so much movement in the rail industry, kicking the can down the road until next Congress is not an option.Load-Date: November 19, 2019End of Document

AVENTURA TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND ITS SENIOR MANAGEMENT CHARGED WITH FRAUD, MONEY LAUNDERING AND ILLEGAL IMPORTATION OF EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURED IN CHINAStates News ServiceNovember 7, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 3995 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BROOKLYN, NY BodyThe following information was released by the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York:The Long Island Company Supplied Chinese-Made Surveillance Equipment to U.S. Government and Private Customers While Falsely Claiming its Products Were "Made in U.S.A."A criminal complaint was unsealed today in federal court in Brooklyn charging surveillance and security equipment company Aventura Technologies, Inc. (Aventura), located in Commack, New York, and seven current and former employees with selling Chinese-made equipment with known cybersecurity vulnerability to government and private customers while falsely representing that the equipment was made in the United States and concealing that the products were manufactured in the People's Republic of China (PRC). Aventura has generated more than $88 million in sales revenue since November 2010, and the charged scheme has been ongoing since 2006.In addition to Aventura, the individual defendants charged in the complaint are Jack Cabasso, Aventura's Managing Director and de facto owner and operator; Frances Cabasso, his wife and Aventura's purported owner and Chief Executive Officer; senior executives Jonathan Lasker, Christine Lavonne Lazarus and Eduard Matulik; current employee Wayne Marino; and recently retired employee Alan Schwartz.Four of the individual defendants are also charged with defrauding the U.S. government by falsely claiming that Frances Cabasso was the owner and operator of the company in order to obtain access to valuable government contracts reserved for women-owned businesses when, in fact, Aventura was actually controlled by her husband, Jack Cabasso. The Cabassos are also charged with laundering the monetary proceeds of these fraudulent schemes.Six of the defendants were arrested this morning and are scheduled to be arraigned this afternoon before United States Magistrate Judge Ramon E. Reyes, Jr. Law enforcement agents executed search warrants at Aventura's headquarters in Commack, New York, and at the home of Jack and Frances Cabasso in Northport, New York. The government has also seized the Cabassos' 70-foot luxury yacht, and has frozen approximately $3 million in 12 financial accounts that contain proceeds from the defendants' unlawful conduct.Richard P. Donoghue, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York; William F. Sweeney, Jr., Assistant Director-in-Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation, New York Field Office (FBI); Joseph P. Dattoria, Special Agent-in-Charge, U.S. General Services Administration, Office of Inspector General (GSA-OIG); Leigh-Alistair Barzey, Special Agent-in-Charge, Defense Criminal Investigative Service, Northeast Field Office (DCIS); J. Russell George, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA); Troy Miller, Director of Field Operations, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, New York Field Office (CBP); Jonathan D. Larsen, Special Agent-in-Charge, Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation, New York (IRS-CI); Jason T. Hein, Special Agent-in-Charge, U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations, Office of Procurement Fraud Investigations, Detachment Six (AFOSI); Leo Lamont, Special Agent-in-Charge, Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS); and Teri L. Donaldson, Inspector General, U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Inspector General (DOE-OIG), announced the charges."As alleged, the defendants falsely claimed for years that their surveillance and security equipment was manufactured on Long Island, padding their pockets with money from lucrative contracts without regard for the risk to our country's national security posed by secretly peddling made-in-China electronics with known cyber vulnerabilities," stated United States Attorney Donoghue. "With today's arrests, the defendants' brazen deceptions and fraud schemes have been exposed, and they will face serious consequences for slapping phony 'Made in the U.S.A.' labels on products that our armed forces and other sensitive government facilities depended upon." Mr. Donoghue expressed his appreciation to U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command's Major Procurement Fraud Unit for their work on the case."Greed is at the heart of this scheme, a reprehensible motive when the subjects in this case allegedly put into question the security of men and women who don uniforms each day to protect our nation," stated FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Sweeney. "There is no mistaking the cyber vulnerabilities created when this company sold electronic surveillance products made in the PRC, and then using those items in our government agencies and the branches of our armed forces. I cannot stress enough that we will do everything we can to search out and stop any other company willing to cut corners and pocket profits that endanger the lives of Americans, and make this country less safe.""The laws in place regulating government contracts ensure both the taxpayer and government receive quality goods and services at competitive prices. In addition, they provide a fair opportunity and level playing field for all businesses seeking government contracts. The General Services Administration's Office of Inspector General will continue to work closely with our law enforcement partners to aggressively investigate allegations of fraud against the United States Government," stated GSA-OIG Special Agent-in-Charge Dattoria."The arrests and other enforcement operations that occurred today were the direct result of a joint investigative effort," stated DCIS Special Agent-in-Charge Barzey. "The introduction of counterfeit parts and materials into the U.S. Defense Department's supply chain poses a significant risk and impacts America's military readiness and our national security. The DCIS is committed to working with its law enforcement partners and the U.S. Attorney's Office, Eastern District of New York, to ensure that individuals and companies who engage in fraudulent activity, at the expense of the U.S. military, are investigated and prosecuted.""TIGTA's mission includes investigating allegations of waste, fraud or abuse involving the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)," stated TIGTA Inspector General George. "Mr. Cabasso and his co-conspirators secured products from outside of the U.S. while purporting that these products were made in America. They then sold these products to the U.S. Government, including the IRS and other Government agencies. TIGTA is committed to investigating and working with our law enforcement partners to root out this type of fraud from the Government contracting and procurement process. I want to thank U.S. Attorney Donoghue for the steadfast support that he and his talented prosecutors gave to this investigation.""U.S. Customs and Border Protection provided the critical link to an ongoing investigation that resulted in the takedown of an elaborate criminal enterprise," stated CBP Director of Field Operations Miller. "This case serves as a great example of collaborative law enforcement efforts to uncover and dismantle criminal enterprises that seek to defraud the United States government for personal gain while jeopardizing our national defense and causing economic harm to their competitors.""In today's global economy, 'Made in the USA' is too sacred of a mark to fraudulently use for one's self interest," stated IRS-CI Special Agent-in-Charge Larsen. "IRS-Criminal Investigation works diligently with our law enforcement partners to uncover con artists devising elaborate schemes to become independently wealthy. These allegations have serious national security implications that go beyond shameless attempts at personal enrichment.""Product substitution is a serious crime that puts our men and women in uniform at greater risk," stated NCIS Special Agent-in-Charge Lamont. "Our Sailors, Marines, and other armed services personnel deserve to have equipment that meets the highest standards for safety and performance, which will not fail them when it matters most. Substandard and counterfeit parts simply cannot be depended upon. Investigating product substitution and mitigating risks to the Department of the Navy supply chain is a top priority for the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. NCIS has a cadre of Special Agents trained in all aspects of economic crime, tirelessly fighting fraud in the procurement process.""Ensuring the integrity of the US Air Force procurement process and the quality of the products provided to our warfighters is a top investigative priority of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations," stated AFOSI Special Agent-in-Charge Hein. "Those who seek to conduct business with the Air Force must be candid and truthful. AFOSI will aggressively investigate those who attempt to defraud the Air Force, and will work with our law enforcement partners to identify and prosecute those who would take advantage of the USAF and its interests. The victims are not just our men and women in uniform, but every American taxpayer.""The Department of Energy's Office of Inspector General remains committed to ensuring the integrity and security of the Department's vendors, especially given the serious nature of the Department's mission," stated DOE Inspector General Donaldson. "We take allegations of conspiracy against the U.S. Government very seriously and will aggressively investigate these matters to protect the Department and the American taxpayers. We appreciate the collaborative efforts of the DOJ and our other law enforcement partners."The Country of Origin Fraud and Unlawful Importation SchemeAs charged in the criminal complaint and in court documents filed today,[1] for over a decade Aventura lied to its customers, including the U.S. military, the federal government and private customers in the United States and abroad. Under federal government procurement laws and regulations a product's country of origin can impact a procurement officer's decision to purchase a product. A product's country of origin also matters to some private sector customers. In addition, all products imported into the United States must be marked with their country of origin. Over the past decade, Aventura made upwards of $88 million, including over $20 million in federal government contracts, while claiming that it was manufacturing its products at its headquarters in Commack. In fact, Aventura does not manufacture anything in the United States. Instead, since at least 2006, Aventura has been importing products primarily from the PRC, then reselling them as American-made or manufactured in a small number of other countries.Notably, Aventura imported networked security products from PRC manufacturers with known cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and resold them to U.S. military and other government installations while claiming that they were American-made. Aventura similarly deceived private customers in the United States and abroad who paid a premium for what they believed to be American-made goods. As a result, Aventura not only defrauded its customers, but also exposed them to serious, known cybersecurity risks, and created a channel by which hostile foreign governments could have accessed some of the government's most sensitive facilities.For this conduct, Aventura and the seven individual defendants are charged with unlawful importation and conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud.In the course of its investigation, the government intercepted and covertly marked numerous shipments from PRC sources to Aventura's Commack headquarters. In some cases, cameras shipped from the PRC were pre-marked with Aventura's logo and the phrase "Made in USA," accompanied by an American flag. In many instances, the items were later resold to government agencies to whom the defendants falsely represented that the products were American-made.For example, in March 2019 the U.S. Navy ordered from Aventura a $13,500 laser-enhanced night vision camera that was specified as American-made on Aventura's U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) price list. (In fact, no item on Aventura's GSA price list is listed as being made in the PRC.) In April 2019, at a shipping facility in Jamaica, Queens, a team led by CBP officers intercepted a shipment from a PRC manufacturer ("PRC Manufacturer-3") to Aventura that contained a camera matching the Navy's order and surreptitiously marked it for later identification using a method that would not be apparent to a casual observer.[2] Two weeks later, that same camera was delivered to Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton, Connecticut.In another instance, in September 2018, the Department of Energy (DOE) ordered approximately $156,000 worth of networked automated turnstiles from Aventura, to be installed at a facility in Tennessee. Aventura's GSA price list described the turnstiles as American-made. In January 2019, turnstiles matching DOE's order were intercepted in a shipment from a PRC manufacturer and marked by CBP; one month later, they arrived at the DOE facility in Tennessee. The crates shipped by Aventura to the DOE appeared identical to those that the CBP-led team had inspected, except that the shipping labels from the PRC directing the crates to Aventura had been peeled off, leaving behind visible traces of paper and glue. A special agent with the DOE-OIG placed a call to Lazarus regarding the turnstile shipment in May 2015. During the call, Lazarus falsely stated that the turnstiles were "U.S. made [in] New York."As a third example, in 2018, Aventura sold the U.S. Air Force 25 body cameras for use by Air Force security personnel at an Air Force base. Aventura was contractually required to provide goods from a limited set of countries that did not include the PRC. In August 2018, however, an Air Force service member observed Chinese characters on the built-in screen of one of the body cameras. The body camera was sent for analysis to a specialist, who downloaded its firmware and found numerous indications that the camera was manufactured in PRC. The camera contained multiple preloaded images that were apparently designed to display on the built-in screenincluding the U.S. Air Force logo, the logo of the PRC Ministry of Public Security and the logo of PRC Manufacturer-1. All three logos had been saved to the camera's firmware using the same software, on a computer that was set to a time zone in the PRCindicating that the camera's manufacturer in the PRC had been aware that the U.S. Air Force was a likely end user of the camera.The defendants, working with counterparts in the PRC, took extraordinary steps to conceal this scheme. In November 2018, Jack Cabasso exchanged emails with an employee of a PRC manufacturer of surveillance equipment (PRC Manufacturer-2), identifying the need to "hide" the name of PRC Manufacturer-2 from Aventura's customers. Cabasso wrote that Schwartz was "putting together a list" of steps to be taken. One week later, Cabasso stressed the need to take steps so that "they cannot trace" the product to PRC Manufacturer-2, adding, "The housings are a problem since you publish them on your website but nothing we can do about that." Cabasso added that "the biggest problem" was that PRC Manufacturer-2's initials were marked on its circuit boards, and said that he had "lost several potential customers" because of similar practices by another PRC manufacturer (PRC Manufacturer-1). The employee responded that the company's initials would be removed from all circuit boards shipped to Aventura. Lasker was copied on all of the emails in this sequence.Similarly, in December 2018, Jack Cabasso and Marino exchanged emails with employees of another PRC-based digital video equipment manufacturer (PRC Manufacturer-4). Marino complained to the employees that "communication from the server to the client contains [PRC Manufacturer-4's name] visible in clear text. This should be changed." When one of the employees wrote that this could not be changed, Cabasso responded: "WE CANNOT HAVE CUSTOMERS ABLE TO SEE" PRC Manufacturer-4's name, later adding, "we also sent a sample to a customer and he found [PRC Manufacturer-4]. . . branding in the [operating system] which is a problem." Schwartz and Lasker, among others, were included on these communications.On or about November 23, 2016, Jack Cabasso sent an email to a GSA representative accusing 12 other GSA contractors of selling products to the U.S. Government that were manufactured by a PRC manufacturer of surveillance equipment (PRC Manufacturer-1). Cabasso asserted that this was a "big problem" and "doesn't get any worse," because PRC Manufacturer-1 was "actually the Communist Chinese Government and ha[d] 'significant' cybersecurity issues aside from" compliance with U.S. laws specifying country-of-origin requirements for government purchases. Cabasso stated that PRC Manufacturer-1 "will acknowledge they manufacture no products outside of China," and appended an article about the removal of cameras manufactured by PRC Manufacturer-1 from the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan.Notably, Aventura was importing security equipment from PRC Manufacturer-1 while Jack Cabasso was complaining to GSA about other contractors' supposed dealings with the company. For example, bank records show that Aventura wired funds to PRC Manufacturer-1 in the PRC on or about October 31, 2016 and November 29, 2016. And, law enforcement records show that on or about December 13, 2016, Aventura imported from PRC Manufacturer-1 in PRC an approximately 1,800-pound shipment of goods manifested as "digital video."In November 2018, Jack Cabasso and Matulik communicated with a potential distributor in Qatar, who asked for assurance that Aventura's cameras were American made. Cabasso responded: "I believe Ed confirmed that they are made in the Aventura factory here in New York and [anyone] may visit at any time." Cabasso attached what purported to be a photograph of Aventura's assembly line, depicting a row of seated individuals in blue lab coats and protective hairnets working at laboratory benchesa photograph that also appears on Aventura's website. In reality, this photograph first appeared in a trade publication article recounting a reporter's visit to PRC Manufacturer-1's manufacturing facility in Hangzhou, PRC, and it depicts PRC Manufacturer-1's assembly line, not Aventura's.The Scheme to Misrepresent Aventura as a Woman-Owned Small BusinessJack and Frances Cabasso, along with Lasker and Lazarus, falsely represented on numerous occasions that Frances Cabasso was the chief executive of Aventura. In fact, the true chief executive officer of Aventura was Jack Cabasso, and Frances Cabasso played a minimal role at the company. This misrepresentation gave Aventura access to government contracts that were set aside for women-owned small businesses, a category that is legally defined to include only those businesses owned by women, where management and daily operations are also controlled by one or more women.In order to win these set-asides, the defendants represented to the public that Frances Cabasso controlled Aventura. Aventura's website and its GSA webpage identify Aventura as a woman-owned business, and the defendants repeatedly certified to the GSA and stated to government procurement officers that Aventura is a woman-owned business. For example, on or about January 13, 2014, a GSA employee emailed Frances Cabasso to "verify if Aventura Technologies, Inc. is a Woman-Owned business." She replied: "Yes we are still a certified women-owned business." Aventura has won numerous contracts from the federal government on the strength of its status as a woman-owned business.As Jack Cabasso repeatedly admitted, he was the true chief executive officer of Aventura. In 2017, Jack Cabasso emailed an Air Force procurement officer, stating in part, "I am the Managing Director of Aventura Technologies and the senior most person within the organization." Similarly, in a 2018 deposition, Cabasso said that his job responsibilities were to "oversee all operations of the company." By contrast, Frances Cabasso has worked as a bookkeeper at an unrelated accounting firm since 2011 and is rarely present at Aventura's offices. At times, emails sent to Frances Cabasso's email address appear to have been auto-forwarded to Jack Cabasso who sometimes signed his responses in Frances's name. The defendants joked about the fact that Frances Cabasso did not work at Aventura. For example, in an instant message exchange on December 5, 2016 between Jack Cabasso and Lazarus, both defendants discussed moving another employee into "Fran's" officethe office of the purported owner of the companyputting the name "Fran's" in quotation marks.The Money Laundering SchemeJack and Frances Cabasso siphoned Aventura's illegal profits out of the company through a network of shell companies and intermediaries. The funds were then directed to investments owned by the Cabassos or controlled for their benefit.Between 2016 and 2018, Aventura transferred approximately $2 million to an attorney escrow account belonging to a Long Island, New York-based law firm (Law Firm-1), some of which appears to have been intended to conceal the source of the funds. For example, on or about May 24, 2016, Aventura transferred $450,000 to Law Firm-1. On the same day, Law Firm-1 paid a total of $435,000 towards the purchase of a new home for a relative of Jack and Frances Cabasso.Similarly, in early 2018, Aventura transferred $675,000 to Law Firm-1. Those funds were loaned out to a separate company for use in purchasing a house. When that company repaid the loan to Law Firm-1, the proceeds, totaling approximately $682,000, were transferred to Frances Cabasso.In addition to the transactions through Law Firm-1, Aventura has transferred at least $2.75 million to shell companies owned by Frances Cabasso. Those funds were then transferred to a number of accounts, including Frances Cabasso's personal bank account and the business account of a lawyer retained by Jack Cabasso. Some of these funds were returned to Aventura's bank accounts, in transactions having no discernible economic purpose.In addition to these and other transfers, Aventura has made approximately $1 million in payments since 2013 related to the Cabassos' 70-foot luxury yacht, known as the Tranquilo, which is moored in the gated community where the Cabassos reside. Although Aventura is the purported owner of the Tranquilo, the yacht appears to have no connection with Aventura's corporate business, and its rental income flows to the Cabassos, not to Aventura.***The defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. If convicted, the defendants each face up to 20 years' imprisonment on each charge in the complaint.The government's case is being handled by the Office's National Security and Cybercrime Section. Assistant United States Attorneys Ian C. Richardson, Alexander Mindlin, Kayla Bensing and Claire Kedeshian are in charge of the prosecution.The FBI has established an email hotline for potential victims.

Tour de France Shanghai Critérium 2019 successfully held, reflecting growing interest in international sports events in China; The integrated marketing solutions provider Activation Group announces world-class sports and entertainment intellectual property to expand innovative experiential marketing businessBusiness WireNovember 16, 2019 Saturday 11:17 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 1606 wordsDateline: HONG KONG Body2019 Tour de France Skoda Shanghai Critérium, an international cycling competition, was held at the China Art Museum on 15 and 16 November 2019. The Tour de France champion Egan Bernal for the year 2019, a three-time Grand Slam champion Vincenzo Nibali, and a four-time Tour de France champion Christopher Froome, along with other Tour de France stars, including five world-class cycling teams and 7 outstanding local teams, participated in the event. With outstanding ability, Caleb Ewan took the lead and was crowned the champion of Tour de France Shanghai.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191116005032/en/Mr. Steve Lau (first on the left), Co-chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Activation Group, and Yann Le Moenner, Chief Executive Officer of Amaury Sport Organization (A.S.O.), with Egan Bernal (middle), Tour de France 2019 champion. (Photo: Business Wire)In 1903, the first Tour de France was held in France. The event has a history of more than 100 years and is regarded as the most prestigious event in the cycling world. In 2017, Tour de France took place in China for the first time. For the past three years, it has been held in Changsha, Beijing, Zhuji and Shanghai. Domestic and foreign, professionals and amateur cyclists as well as the public have already enjoyed Tour de France. With the support of the local municipal governments in China and partners, Tour de France in China has been held in Zhuji and Changsha, where 4,000 people participated in the closed-loop cycling event and thus broke the record of attendance. The brand of the Tour de France has been gaining traction in China as the event combines the elements of sports and entertainment with the participation of the world's top cyclists.Tour de France intellectual property ("IP") combines elements of sports and entertainment as a model for sports event marketingIn recent years, an intellectual property-based operating model has been adopted in sports event marketing. In that operating model, sports events are at the core of the marketing content while the participants and audience alike can enjoy various forms of entertainment during the experiential marketing. The markets for intellectual property ("IP") and brands can thus be developed. Taking the 2019 Tour of Shanghai as an example, domestic amateur cyclists can compete with top professional cyclists. Fans can participate in a public relations photo shoot before the game and wear personalized Tour de France yellow jerseys. The Tour de France brand has attracted a large audience, allowing them to experience the charm of Tour de France. Such experiences have formed a unique and innovative product in the intellectual property-based operating model for marketing. At the same time, the professional cyclists try their hand at singing Peking Opera, and are taken to the streets to taste traditional breakfasts in a place where Tour de France is held. Moreover, a series of retro products of Tour de France and the products of the cycling event that have been adapted to local cultures of the places where the event has been held have also been launched. These activities can promote a cultural exchange between international professional cyclists and the locals of the places where the event is held, thus expanding the market for intellectual property of Tour de France. The ingeniously personalized service to the Tour de France contestants allows them to fully enjoy their participation in the event and, at the same time, enables Tour de France to grip the host country.The top international French sports company and Tour de France planner, Amaury Sport Organization (A.S.O.) has actively promoted the globalization of the Tour de France brand in recent years. This is aligned with the IP marketing concept of the Activation Group. The two parties have cooperated since 2017 to promote the Tour de France IP in China. Tour de France held in Changsha in 2017, Beijing, Shanghai and Zhuji at the beginning of the year has, in turn, earned its host cities fame and plentiful business opportunities. It is reported that an experience center for cycling will be opened in Zhuji in 2020. It will be positioned as a first-of-its-kind "one-stop, multi-functional, outdoor cycling tour service center", which will be complemented by the official cycling routes and themed homestays. With its strong sense of market, Activation Group has explored the integration of the Tour de France with mass consumption, enabling cyclists and sports enthusiasts to enjoy entertainment as a part of their lives.In addition to the experience center for cycling in Zhuji, Activation Group has also announced another new strategy for Tour de France IP under which a bicycle-themed TV series "Legendary of Cycling" will be produced. As the first TV drama of its kind in China, "Legendary of Cycling" combines such elements as youth, inspirations, deduction and cycling. The production of the TV series scheduled to start in 2020. Real-time and on-the-spot shots of a Tour de France event will be included in the TV drama. For both the Tour de France brand and Activation Group, the innovative and pragmatic IP-based operating model for marketing will open up a new and sustainable consumer market.Revolutionizing the traditional business model of the industry and unlocking the huge potential of the market for sports and entertainment IPAs an integrated marketing specialist in Greater China, Activation Group provides experiential marketing, digital marketing, branding and public relations services, and aims to expand the Chinese market for sports and entertainment IP. Activation Group and Amaury Sport Organization reached an agreement in 2016 under which the former was authorized by the latter to exclusively host the Tour de France SKODA China Critérium for 11 years. The income from this unique sports IP-based business model is generated from the sponsors of the Tour de France, media affiliates, ticket sales revenue, the royalties of the surrounding merchandise sales, the TV and online broadcast revenues, and the subsidies from local Chinese municipal governments due to the role played by Activation Group in boosting business of the local hotel and tourism industries.A similar business model has also been applied to Activation Group's another IP project, LaLiga. Activation Group has obtained the exclusive rights to operate the LaLiga club brand for ten years since 2016. The projects being planned include the opening of the LaLiga Experience Center, inviting the LaLiga team to assist in the youth training program and the production of the online drama "The Emergence of First Love", etc. The aim is to construct a 360-degree high-end football experience platform. The LaLiga Club, designed by Activation Group, will organize visits by LaLiga coaches and stars, reality shows and set up experience centers. The club will also use technologies for interactive experiences such as augmented reality ("AR") and virtual reality ("VR") and mobile applications to expand business, sell derivative products and even organize competitions and form teams for club members and assist in arranging a league championship, etc. By using the internationally-renowned LaLiga's resources to further expand the Group's sports and entertainment IP business, Activation Group is well-positioned to tap the huge potential of the market.Mr. Steve Lau Kam Yiu, Co-chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Activation Group, said, "Capturing the attention and admiration of cycling fans around the world in China is exhilarating. Activation Group is proud to introduce Tour de France, an internationally renowned sporting event to China. We are also excited bringing in sports and entertainment IP into the Group. The success of attaining the rights to host regional competitions for two major international sporting competitions not only indicated the recognition and trust by our partners but also our strength and experience in launching sporting events of international level. Activation Group's global and strategic outlook, its collaborations with future partners in new Chinese regions, along with the joining of sports and entertainment IP, demonstrate impressive prospects for the business."Activation Group's integrated marketing services continue to create and enhance brand value for customers. Customers can benefit from the Group's rich experience in marketing, digital marketing, brand promotion and public relations services. Activation Group has a strong international luxury brand customer base, an impressive track record and rich industry experience. On this basis, the Group's IP business can expect to expand its operations of international IP which, in turn, can result in synergy and rapid growth of its IP services. Not limiting itself to sports IP, Activation Group also grasps the opportunity to develop an entertainment IP. In 2019, Activation Group and the international entertainment production company, Stufish Productions, jointly established Stufish Asia in 2017 and operated the live stunt program "Elekron" in Macau. With its innovative strategy and high-performance execution, Activation Group is the industry leader in the experiential marketing of high-end and luxury brands in Greater China. It is based in Shanghai and its strategically chosen cities of Beijing, Hong Kong and Singapore. Activation Group has the advantage to fully tap the market potential of Greater China and Southeast Asia.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191116005032/en/CONTACT: Further enquiries, please contact:iPR OgilvyCallis Lau / Molisa Lau / Vivian Ng / Camellia JohnsonTelephone?(852) 2136 6952 / 2136 6953 / 3920 7651 / 3920 7640Email ?molisa.lau@iprogilvy.comFax ?(852) 3170 6606http://www.businesswire.comGraphic Mr. Steve Lau (first on the left), Co-chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Activation Group, and Yann Le Moenner, Chief Executive Officer of Amaury Sport Organization (A.S.O.), with Egan Bernal (middle), Tour de France 2019 champion.

FCC bans use of federal funds in purchases of Chinese telecomStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeNovember 23, 2019 SaturdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MARKETS; Pg. 1Length: 466 wordsByline: Jean GarciaBodyUS lawmakers and intelligence officials have long fretted over Huawei's close relationship with the Chinese government and the attendant risks of high-tech espionage. The FCC's order mostly affects small, rural companies, as larger US carriers do not use equipment from those Chinese companies. "Rural schools, hospitals, and libraries will feel the effects", the company said in a statement.Huawei reiterated its desire to work with the FCC to lay to rest concerns over national security and ensure "best practices" are used in US telecommunications systems.The U.S. government has instituted a series of actions aimed at barring American companies from purchasing Huawei and ZTE equipment.The FCC will deny funds to any U.S. carriers or internet service providers that buy components from China's Huawei and ZTE.Congressional action in 2018 barred the Federal government from buying Huawei products, and earlier this year, the Trump administration issued an executive order putting in place some restrictions on the ability of us firms to sell goods to the Chinese companies.Klopp reveals Salah playing through the pain barrierVan Dijk withdrew from the Netherlands squad in midweek, citing "personal reasons", while Salah was not included in Egypt's squad at all.The executive order would invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a law that gives the president the authority to regulate commerce in response to a national emergency that threatens the United States.Huawei said in a prepared statement that its new designation as a national security threat is "based on selective information, innuendo, and mistaken assumptions".Congress has been considering legislation to authorize up to $1 billion for providers to replace network equipment from the Chinese companies. Competition in the market (especially 5G networks) will be weakened, and ordinary consumers will have to pay a higher price for network services. They say the equipment may have backdoors that could allow the Chinese government to meddle with US critical network infrastructure or open the door to massive, crippling data theft. This sentiment was echoed by the U.S. Department of Justice Attorney General Bill Barr in a November 13th letter to the FCC chairman.As for replacing existing equipment, the FCC is asking for comment on how to help rural telecoms financially. They argued that Chinese firms are legally required to assist with spying and that public funds shouldn't be used to "endanger national security" with companies that could be forced to install surveillance backdoors or spread malware. This is in a move to put a check on Chinese tech companies including Huawei and ZTE. She said there needs to be a "coordinated national plan" for securing next-generation cellular networks, known as 5G.Load-Date: November 24, 2019End of Document

China reportedly threatens tiny Faeroe Islands over HuaweiAssociated Press Financial WireDecember 11, 2019 Wednesday 4:37 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 429 wordsByline: By JAN M. OLSEN, Associated PressDateline: COPENHAGEN, Denmark BodyCOPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) - Danish media are reporting that the Chinese government threatened to cancel a trade deal with the tiny Faeroe Islands if the country does not agree to use internet networks supplied by Chinese tech company Huawei.Huawei is at the center of a global cybersecurity debate, with the U.S. pushing allies in Europe and elsewhere to avoid the company over fears it could allow the Chinese government to snoop on consumers. Huawei denies that.It's part of a broader global battle between China and the U.S. over trade and technological supremacy, and control over the market for new, superfast 5G wireless equipment is considered key.Danish media cited an audio recording made Nov. 15 by the local broadcaster as it prepared to interview the islands' trade minister. The hot mic recording picked up a private conversation between the minister, Helgi Abrahamsen, and his aide.In it, the aide allegedly explains to the minister how the Chinese ambassador, Feng Tie, had in a meeting four days earlier threatened to pull a trade deal if the Faeroe telecoms operator did not choose Huawei to build its 5G mobile network.The Faeroe broadcaster had planned to broadcast the audio but a local court quickly issued an injunction - requested by the Faeroe government. The injunction banned the airing of the recording, claiming it might damage relations between China and the country, a tiny nation of barely 50,000 people that is part of Denmark but enjoys broad autonomy.In Denmark, broadcaster DR and daily Berlingske reported Tuesday about the case. DR said it "is familiar with the contents of the audio file," but declined to specify whether it had heard it directly. Berlingske could not be immediately reached for more information.Bardur Nielsen, the Faeroe Islands' premier who attended the Nov. 11 meeting with the Chinese ambassador, has said he will not discuss the case. The Chinese embassy could not be reached for comment.China's state-run paper Global Times cited the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying, as saying that the claims "are completely false and have ulterior motives."Huawei, the world's biggest maker of mobile network gear, said it "was not aware of any meeting between the Chinese ambassador and Faeroese politicians in November as reported."On Tuesday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said it was up to the Faeroe Islands, located midway between Scotland and Iceland, to decide who should provide the 5G network but they are welcome to seek advice in Denmark.___Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report.Load-Date: December 12, 2019End of Document

FCC Chairman Pai Issues Remarks at Council on Foreign RelationsTargeted News ServiceNovember 5, 2019 Tuesday 8:24 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2136 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyThe Federal Communications Commission issued the following remarks by Chairman Ajit Pai at the Council on Foreign Relations:"Last week, I was in Egypt as part of the U.S. delegation to the World Radiocommunication Conference. Today, I'm at the Council on Foreign Relations. And tonight, I'm hoping to see my beloved home-state Kansas Jayhawks play Duke in Madison Square Garden. I'm afraid my decision to be Mike Pompeo for Halloween has gone too far."It's fair to say that a CFR appearance by the Chairman of the FCC is out of the ordinary. But these are extraordinary times. We're at a pivotal moment in the evolution of communications technology. Across America and around the world, private companies have begun rolling out the next generation of wireless technology--commonly known as 5G."These networks will bring exponential increases in speed, responsiveness, and capacity. They will enable new and improved services and applications that will grow our economy and improve our standard of living--from connected cars to telemedicine to precision agriculture."Another way to think about our 5G future is that we are moving to a world where everything will be connected. Ericsson projects that an additional 13 billion devices will come online between now and 2024. Some call this future the Internet of Things. Others call it the Fourth Industrial Revolution. I call it transformative."The United States is poised to seize these opportunities. At the FCC, we're implementing a plan to Facilitate America's Superiority in 5G Technology. The 5G FAST Plan is already helping ensure that our nation leads the way in 5G deployment. We're making more spectrum available for 5G. We're making it easier for carriers to deploy wireless infrastructure. And we're modernizing our rules to encourage the deployment of fiber to carry wireless traffic once it comes off the airwaves."But for all the opportunities that 5G will unlock, it will also create new challenges. Chief among these is the main subject of my remarks: network security."When 5G is embedded in almost every aspect of our society and economy--from businesses to homes, hospitals to transportation networks, manufacturing to the electrical grid--that means securing our networks will become much more important and much more difficult."A recent Council on Foreign Relations white paper explained well how 5G will change the cybersecurity landscape. It said, '5G networks will expand the number and scale of potential vulnerabilities, increase incentives for malicious actors to exploit those vulnerabilities, and make it difficult to detect malicious cyber activity.'"An important part of network security is the integrity of the communications supply chain--that is, the process by which products and services are manufactured, distributed, sold, and ultimately integrated into our communications networks."For years, U.S. government officials have expressed concern about the national security threats posed by certain foreign communications equipment providers. Hidden 'backdoors' to our networks in routers, switches, and other network equipment can allow hostile foreign powers to inject viruses and other malware, steal Americans' private data, spy on U.S. companies, and more."The equipment at the heart of 5G networks currently comes from just a few global suppliers. And the largest right now is the Chinese company Huawei. This is a major concern."Huawei positions itself as a private company. But it has significant ties to the Chinese government, namely, the Communist Party, and China's military. Moreover, Chinese law requires all companies subject to its jurisdiction to comply with requests from the country's intelligence services. These requests cannot be disclosed to any third parties, such as Huawei's customers in China or abroad. That means China could compel Huawei to spy on foreign individuals and businesses and prevent Huawei from disclosing such surveillance requests."You don't have to look hard to find evidence that the Chinese government is willing and able to use its growing influence over global commerce to advance its own interests. In the past month alone, Chinese officials pressured the National Basketball Association to stamp out criticism from anyone within the NBA of the country's policies in Hong Kong. Gaming company Blizzard Entertainment, which is partially owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent, suspended a professional gamer for speaking out in support of Hong Kong protestors. And Apple, which has extensive business operations in China, removed the Taiwanese flag emoji for iPhone users in Hong Kong and Macau."These cases reflect a disturbing and growing pattern of behavior by the Chinese government. They also raise a broader concern about the security of the United States. If China is willing to use its leverage over basketball, e-sports, and emojis, imagine what could happen if we let Chinese companies' equipment into tomorrow's 5G wireless networks. This would open the door to surveillance, espionage, and other harms--stakes much higher than sports and entertainment."For too many years, some have dismissed this concern as hypothetical, or as a smokescreen for protectionism. But if there is a silver lining to the episodes of the past month, it is that millions of Americans have now come to understand that the threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party are comprehensive and all too real."Even before these latest developments, however, there was no shortage of red flags about Huawei."Earlier this year, the Justice Department charged Huawei officials with fraud and theft of trade secrets from T-Mobile. The indictment stated that Huawei offered bonuses to employees who succeeded in stealing confidential information from other companies. In announcing the charges, FBI Director Christopher Wray described Huawei's transgressions as 'brazen and persistent.'"Independent technical experts have similarly raised concerns. A report issued earlier this year by the cybersecurity firm Finite State found that a majority of the Huawei firmware images they analyzed had at least one potential backdoor."And earlier this year, the United Kingdom's Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre Oversight Board issued a damning assessment of the company. It found that a lack of 'basic engineering competence and cyber security hygiene' makes Huawei equipment vulnerable to just about anyone, 'bringing significantly increased risk to UK operators.'"On top of all that, the Chinese government subsidizes Huawei, enabling it to undercut its competitors on price when bidding on contracts, even if the quality is lacking. Whether this violates World Trade Organization rules and other laws I'll leave to the trade lawyers, but this practice demonstrates the Chinese government's strategic determination: choose Huawei as a national champion, make it a key component in its Belt and Road Initiative, and crush foreign competitors by any means necessary."For our part, when it comes to 5G and America's security, we cannot afford to take a risk and hope for the best. The stakes are too high."So what can we do to secure our networks?"First, we need to make sure that the equipment going into 5G networks is from trusted vendors--that the companies entering this space won't risk our national security, threaten our economic security, or undermine our values."This type of upfront solution is just common sense. Making the right choices when deployment is beginning is much easier than trying to correct mistakes once network construction and operation is well underway."And the good news is that we're seeing a government-wide effort to carry this out."In 2018, Congress passed a law prohibiting federal agencies from purchasing telecommunications equipment or services that would pose a national security risk, including from Huawei."In May of this year, the President issued an Executive Order to prohibit the purchase and installation of telecommunications equipment in the United States deemed a security threat. The Department of Commerce was charged with developing regulations, and proposed rules are due to be released soon."And at the FCC, we're doing our part. In two weeks, the FCC will vote on prohibiting those that receive money from our annual $8.5 billion Universal Service Fund from using it to purchase equipment or services from companies--like Huawei--that pose a threat to the security of our communications networks."But it's not enough to ensure that risky equipment won't be installed into the networks of the future. That's why we're also working to secure existing networks."America's largest telecom providers have generally refrained from installing Chinese equipment, but others, particularly some rural wireless carriers, currently have Chinese equipment in their networks. This poses an unacceptable risk. So at our November public meeting, the FCC will also vote on launching a process to remove and replace such equipment from USF-funded communications networks. My plan calls first for an assessment to find out exactly how much equipment from Huawei and another Chinese company, ZTE, is in these networks, followed by financial assistance to help these carriers make the transition to more trusted vendors. We'll seek public input on how big this 'rip and replace' program needs to be and how best to finance it. Our goal is to close security gaps in a fiscally responsible way."The third thing we need to continue to do is to engage with our international partners. We need to remind our allies that decisions impacting 5G security need to be made with the long term in mind. Focusing too heavily on short-term considerations could result in choices that are pennywise but dollar foolish."The more that we can work together and make security decisions based on shared principles, the safer that our 5G networks will be. When I meet with my foreign counterparts, I stress the importance of 5G security. And I have done that personally and extensively over the past year. Both as part of a cross-Administration team and solely on behalf of the FCC, I've visited and have spoken with senior leadership in Bahrain, Germany, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the United Arab Emirates, and have met with decision-makers from many other countries, such as Brazil, India, Chile and Australia."And this May, I was honored to be part of the U.S. delegation at a 5G security forum in Prague, where more than 140 representatives from 32 countries came together to build a consensus approach for protecting next-generation networks. We developed a set of recommendations called the 'Prague Proposals.' This security framework is based on the principles of competition, transparency, and the rule of law."Having spent the past week meeting with other government officials at the World Radiocommunication Conference in Egypt, I'm encouraged that these principles are gaining traction. There's growing awareness of the importance of supply chain integrity. Indeed, in the last twelve months, we've seen allies like Japan, Australia, and New Zealand take action to prevent equipment from unsafe vendors into their networks."Strong international alliances will also be helpful with the standard-setting process for 5G, which is still ongoing. One key focus will be true interoperability, so network operators can stitch together bits and pieces from different vendors. This will keep any one equipment provider from gaining too much market power. At the same time, it would open more opportunities for software providers."The fourth and final thing that I will highlight this morning is the need to leverage our nation's leadership in software to mitigate security risks. If we can virtualize functions of the radio access network, we can not only reduce the cost of deploying 5G networks but reduce reliance on foreign equipment manufacturers. I am encouraged by the work that American companies are currently doing in this area and hope to see significant breakthroughs soon. As I and my colleagues at sister agencies have made clear to our counterparts in foreign countries, America's current leadership in 5G, and our support of virtualized networks of the future, demonstrate that the choice between 5G development and security is a false one--now and going forward. A country need not choose between the two. And the United States certainly will not do so."Ultimately, the Chinese government's increasingly brazen actions to leverage its commercial influence and stifle free expression should be a wake-up call for the United States. They remind us that action is needed--now--to secure America's 5G networks. The FCC and our federal partners are doing just that. And we are on track for a strong and secure 5G future."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6918895 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 7, 2019End of Document

ROB'S RUNDOWN: WEEK OF NOVEMBER 18 NOVEMBER 22, 2019States News ServiceNovember 22, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 6123 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Ohio Senator Rob Portman:This week, Senator Portman Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), unveiled a new bipartisan report titled Threats to the U.S. Research Enterprise: China's Talent Recruitment Plans . The report documents how American taxpayers have been unwittingly funding the rise of China's economy and military over the last two decades while federal agencies have done little to stop it. Portman delivered opening remarks at a bipartisan hearing entitled "Securing the U.S. Research Enterprise from China's Talent Recruitment Plans." During the hearing, Assistant Director of the Counterintelligence Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) John Brown confirmed that the FBI should have taken more rapid and comprehensive action in addressing China's strategic plan to acquire knowledge and intellectual property from researchers, scientists, and the U.S. private sector through their talent recruitment programs. A number of the nation's media outlets have highlighted the new bipartisan report, with the Wall Street Journal editorial board calling for more transparency in regard to Chinese talent recruitment programs in the United States. On the Senate floor, Portman discussed the findings of the report and insisted that the U.S. must do more to stop theft of taxpayer-funded research and intellectual property. In addition, Portman delivered remarks on the Senate floor urging his Senate colleagues to support his bipartisan legislation to rename NASA's Plum Brook Station, the agency's test facility in Sandusky, Ohio, after Neil Armstrong. Last week the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee approved the legislation that Portman and Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) introduced the legislation in September. Plum Brook is part of the NASA Glenn Research Center based in Cleveland, Ohio. It houses unique world-class facilities that conduct critical and innovative ground tests for the international aerospace community. The legislation now awaits action on the Senate floor.Finally, this week the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee approved Portman's bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act, legislation that would address the nearly $12 billion deferred maintenance backlog at the National Park Service (NPS). The bill, which has been praised by key stakeholders, would establish the "National Park Service Legacy Restoration Fund" from existing unobligated revenues the government receives from on and offshore energy development to fund deferred maintenance projects at NPS sites across the country. For a more detailed look at Senator Portman's week, please see the following: Monday, November 18, 2019 Toledo Blade Editorial Board Endorses Portman's Deepfake Report ActIn an editorial titled "Deep Six Deep Fakes," the Toledo Blade editorial board called for passage of Senator Portman's Deepfake Report Act, bipartisan legislation directing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct an annual study of deepfakes and other types of similar content. Deepfakes are hyper-realistic, digital manipulations of real content that depict events that did not actually occur. The legislation requires DHS to assess the technology used to generate deepfakes, the uses of deepfakes by foreign and domestic entities, and available countermeasures to deepfakes, to help policymakers and the public better understand the threats deepfakes pose to our national security and election security. The Deepfake Report Act passed the Senate in October and now awaits action from the House of Representatives. The Toledo Blade editorial states: "So-called "deep-fake" videos threaten to undermine our trust in genuine news and spread misinformation. That's why the Deepfake Report Act, co-sponsored by Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman, is an important first step in protecting the public's capacity to trust what it sees online... The House of Representatives should follow the Senate's lead and embrace the bipartisan [Deepfake Report Act], and President Trump should sign it." Excerpts of the editorial can be found here and the full editorial can be found here. In Cincinnati, Portman Meets with Members of the Ohio Alliance of Recovery ProvidersPortman met with members of the Ohio Alliance of Recovery Providers (OARP) and discussed efforts to combat the drug crisis. The OARP is an organization made up of thirty-four addiction treatment providers, working to increase access to treatment and develop a recovery-oriented system of care for all Ohioans. "I had a productive meeting today with members from the Ohio Alliance of Recovery Providers to discuss how the drug epidemic is impacting communities in Southwest Ohio," said Portman . "This organization is a wonderful example of how community leaders can work together to find innovative ways to help their citizens and their community. I will continue to work to increase access to care for Ohioans battling addiction and to ensure that providers aren't penalized for offering services like transportation or childcare for individuals receiving treatment." Portman, Carper Bipartisan Report Reveals Lack of Federal Response to China's Talent Recruitment PlansSenators Portman and Tom Carper (D-DE), the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), unveiled a new bipartisan report titled Threats to the U.S. Research Enterprise: China's Talent Recruitment Plans . The report documents how American taxpayers have been unwittingly funding the rise of China's economy and military over the last two decades while federal agencies have done little to stop it. The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations will hold a hearing on the report tomorrow, November 19, 2019, at 10:00 am. A livestream of the hearing will be available here. Starting in the late 1990s through its "talent recruitment plans," China began recruiting U.S.-based scientists and researchers and incentivizing them to transfer U.S. taxpayer-funded intellectual property to China for China's own economic and military gain. China pledged to spend 15 percent of its GDP, more than $2 trillion, on improving human resources from 2008 to 2020. The Subcommittee investigated China's most prominent talent recruitment plan: The Thousand Talents Plan (TTP). Launched in 2008, TTP incentivizes individuals engaged in research and development to transmit the knowledge and research they gain in the United States to China in exchange for salaries, research funding, lab space, and other incentives. Over the course of an eight-month investigation, the Subcommittee examined seven federal agencies' efforts to combat the theft of American taxpayer-funded research and technology through Chinese talent recruitment programs. While China has a strategic plan to acquire knowledge and intellectual property from researchers, scientists, and the U.S. private sector, the U.S. government does not have a comprehensive strategy to combat this threat. The seven federal agencies reviewed by PSI include the Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, Department of Energy, State Department, Department of Commerce, and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. "This report reveals that American taxpayers have been unwittingly funding the rise of China's economy and military over the last two decades by detailing not only the lengths and expense China has gone to in order to steal American intellectual property, but also the shocking fact that our own federal agencies have done little to stop their actions despite being aware of China's talent plans," said Senator Portman. "These talent plans are a win-win for China. China wins twice. First, the American taxpayer funds China's research and development. Second, China uses that research to improve its economic and military status. This is unacceptable and I look forward to working with Senator Carper on bipartisan legislation to end this abuse of American research, intellectual property, and taxpayer money."Portman, Bipartisan Colleagues Introduce Bill to End Cosmetics Animal TestingSenators Portman, Martha McSally (R-AZ), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) today introduced the Humane Cosmetics Act, which would phase out the sale of cosmetic products developed using animal testing and make it unlawful to conduct cosmetic animal testing in the U.S. with limited exceptions. "I'm proud to support this bipartisan legislation as it requires cosmetic companies to verify the safety of their products without the use of animal testing. While nearly 600 cosmetic companies already use alternatives to animal testing, this legislation would build on that progress by expediting the consideration of other reliable testing alternatives. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation so that our cosmetics industry can continue to create safe products for consumers without testing on animals," said Portman. Tuesday, November 19, 2019 Committee Approves Portman, Warner, Alexander, King Legislation to Address National Park Service Maintenance BacklogSenators Portman, Mark Warner (D-VA), Lamar Alexander (R-TN), and Angus King (I-ME) announced the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee has approved their bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act, legislation that would address the nearly $12 billion deferred maintenance backlog at the National Park Service (NPS). The bill, which has been praised by key stakeholders, would establish the "National Park Service Legacy Restoration Fund" from existing unobligated revenues the government receives from on and offshore energy development to fund deferred maintenance projects at NPS sites across the country. Congressman Rob Bishop (R-UT) and Derek Kilmer (D-WA) have led similar legislation in the House of Representatives. The legislation now awaits action on the Senate floor. "For more than a century, the National Park Service has been inspiring Americans to explore the natural beauty of our country," Portman said. "But in order to keep that work going, we need to ensure that they have the necessary resources to maintain our national parks. This bill will create the Legacy Restoration Fund to provide the National Park Service with funds for deferred maintenance projects like the more than $100 million in maintenance backlog at Ohio's eight national parks. I'd like to thank Senators Warner, Alexander, and King as well as the cosponsors of his legislation for their leadership on this issue and I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to get this legislation signed into law so that the National Park Service can continue preserving American treasures."Portman Opening Statement at Bipartisan PSI Oversight Hearing Highlights Lack of Federal Response to China's Talent Recruitment ProgramsPortman, Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), delivered opening remarks at a bipartisan hearing entitled "Securing the U.S. Research Enterprise from China's Talent Recruitment Plans."

The hearing focused on the new bipartisan report which documents how American taxpayers have been unwittingly funding the rise of China's economy and military over the last two decades while federal agencies have done little to stop it. Assistant Director Brown stated: "...we always seek new ways to improve our effectiveness. With our present-day knowledge of the threat from Chinese talent plans, we wish we had taken more rapid and comprehensive action in the past, and the time to make up for that is now. We appreciate the conclusions of your report and we welcome your questions..."His full testimony as prepared for delivery can be found here and video can be found here.White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Praises Portman's PSI Report on China's Talent Recruitment ProgramsPortman held a bipartisan hearing entitled "Securing the U.S. Research Enterprise from China's Talent Recruitment Plans". The hearing focused on the new bipartisan report which documents how American taxpayers have been unwittingly funding the rise of China's economy and military over the last two decades while federal agencies have done little to stop it. In response to the report, Dr. Kelvin Droegemeier, Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy issued a statement praising Portman's efforts to bring light to this issue and committing to working towards a solution at the federal level. "The report from HSGAC's subcommittee on PSI and today's hearing contributes to the important work the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has been leading through our Joint Committee on Research Environments," said Dr. Kelvin Droegemeier, Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. "Research must be done ethically and without foreign government influence. I'd like to thank Sen. Rob Portman for his great work in elevating this issue and I look forward to shaping a solution that will ensure research integrity for industry, academia, and federal agencies." Wednesday, November 20, 2019 Following Portman's PSI Report, Wall Street Journal Editorial Board Calls for Transparency in Chinese Talent Recruitment ProgramsIn an editorial titled "China's Bid on American Science," the Wall Street Journal editorial board called for more transparency in regard to Chinese talent recruitment programs in the United States. This is in response to Senator Portman's new bipartisan report from the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which he chairs, that documents how American taxpayers have been unwittingly funding the rise of China's economy and military over the last two decades while federal agencies have done little to stop it. Portman held a hearing yesterday to highlight these findings. At the hearing, an expert from the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) admitted that the FBI should have taken more rapid and comprehensive action in addressing China's strategic plan to acquire knowledge and intellectual property from researchers, scientists, and the U.S. private sector through their talent recruitment programs.The Wall Street Journal editorial states: "That's the disturbing finding of a report this week from Ohio Republican Rob Portman's Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. It found the U.S. government is funding research for hundreds of scientists at American universities and labs who are effectively under contract to turn over their findings to China... There is a need for more transparency about Chinese subsidies for research in the U.S. and the demands China places on recipients. The challenge for U.S. law enforcement and the scientific community is to stop theft and deception without compromising the intellectual openness that has made the U.S. a scientific leader."

At Hearing, Portman Secures Commitment from State Department Nominee to Address Visas for China's Talent Recruitment Programs, Hold North Korea Accountable for Human Rights Violations, and Utilize GlobalDuring a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing today, Portman secured a commitment from the nominee to be Deputy Secretary of State, Stephen Biegun, that, if confirmed, he would ensure that the State Department works to address the issue of China stealing intellectual property, specifically through their talent recruitment programs. Senator Portman's new bipartisan report from the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which he chairs, documents how American taxpayers have been unwittingly funding the rise of China's economy and military over the last two decades while federal agencies have done little to stop it.Mr. Biegun also committed to hold North Korea accountable for their ongoing human rights violations. Portman has consistently maintained that we must never forget how the North Korean leader Kim Jung Un's regime wrongfully imprisoned and horribly mistreated Ohio-native, Otto Warmbier. Finally, Mr. Biegun committed to fully utilizing the Global Engagement Center, which was tasked with leading U.S. government efforts to counter propaganda and disinformation from countries like Russia and China through legislation that Portman and Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) wrote and successfully passed in 2016. Excerpts of his questioning can be found here and a video can be found here.House Passes Portman, Udall Bill to Ensure Remaining Stamps to Promote Wildlife Conservation Are SoldSenators Portman and Tom Udall (D-NM) announced the House of Representatives has passed their bipartisan Multinational Species Conservation Funds Semipostal Stamp Reauthorization Act, legislation which would require the U.S. Postal Service to sell the approximately 50 million remaining Saving Vanishing Species Stamps left in stock. Senators Tom Carper (D-DE), Dianna Feinstein (D-CA), Ed Markey (D-MA), and Gary Peters (D-MI) are original cosponsors of this legislation. The House companion bill is led by Representatives William Lacy Clay and Jeff Fortenberry. The legislation awaits action in the Senate. When the program began in 2011, the U.S. Postal Service printed 100 million stamps to help promote wildlife conservation and this legislation would require the U.S. Postal Service to sell the approximately 50 million remaining stamps left in stock. "We owe it to our future generations to preserve our planet's rich wildlife and natural resources so that they can continue to be enjoyed," said Portman. "This successful stamp program has raised millions of dollars to fund conservation without any taxpayer money. I'm glad my colleagues in the House have passed this legislation and strongly urge my colleagues in the Senate to take up and pass this legislation to ensure that every last stamp is sold." Portman Statement on the Grassley/Alexander Multiemployer Pension Reform Plan ReleaseSenator Portman released the following statement upon the introduction of the new Multiemployer Pension Recapitalization and Reform Plan released by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-TN): "Today is a positive step forward in our efforts to reform the multiemployer pension system on behalf of workers, retirees, and employers. I'd like to thank Chairmen Grassley and Alexander putting forward a constructive framework based on shared responsibility whereby the federal government, employers, workers and retirees all contribute to the solution. This shared responsibility framework represents the type of comprehensive and permanent solution that will help protect earned pensions, save taxpayers money, prevent the insolvency of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), and alleviate pressure on our economy. Without proactive action, the PBGC will become insolvent by 2025, and at least 1.3 million pensions will be reduced by more than 90 percent, including over 60,000 in Ohio. In addition, the PBGC's insolvency could force hundreds of Ohio small businesses to close." "I believe this proposal can provide the foundation for a bipartisan solution, but it will require some changes. As Chairman of the Subcommittee with jurisdiction over multiemployer pension reform, I look forward to learning about how this proposal can be improved in the coming weeks based on technical feedback from PBGC, CBO, and stakeholders in the multiemployer system. I will continue to work with Senator Brown and all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to produce a truly impactful, lasting bipartisan solution." Thursday, November 21, 2019 Widespread Coverage Highlights Portman Report on Lack of Federal Response to China's Talent Recruitment PlansA number of the nation's media outlets are highlighting Senator Portman's new bipartisan report from the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which he chairs, that documents how American taxpayers have been unwittingly funding the rise of China's economy and military over the last two decades while federal agencies have done little to stop it. Portman held a hearing on Tuesday to highlight these findings. At the hearing, the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) admitted that the agency should have taken more rapid and comprehensive action in addressing China's strategic plan to acquire knowledge and intellectual property from researchers, scientists, and the U.S. private sector through their talent recruitment programs. Excerpts of the coverage can be found here.Portman Announces Support for Resolution Recognizing Armenian GenocidePortman announced his support for the Senate resolution expressing that it is the policy of the United States to recognize and commemorate the Armenian Genocide. The Armenian Genocide refers to the horrific and systemic killing of Armenian Christians living in the Ottoman Empire from spring 1915 through 1923. There were approximately 1.5 million Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire in 1915. At least 664,000 and possibly as many as 1.5 million died during the genocide, either in massacres and individual killings, or from ill treatment, exposure, and starvation. The historic evidence and eyewitness accounts of the systemic removal and murder of Armenian Christians stand in stark contrast to Turkey's continual and resolute denial of the genocide. Similar legislation passed the House of Representatives in October by the overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 405-11. Portman released the following statement: "I am proud to join my Senate colleagues in cosponsoring this bipartisan resolution commemorating the memory of the Armenian genocide. As the large, vibrant and patriotic Armenian community in Ohio will tell you, we must never forget the atrocities of the Armenian genocide. This resolution is not only about recognizing the problems and tragedies of the past, but it is also a reminder that we must stand strong and resist any and all persecution of minority populations." On Senate Floor, Portman Urges Passage of Legislation to Rename NASA's Plum Brook Station Test Facility After Neil ArmstrongOn the Senate floor, Portman urged his Senate colleagues to support his bipartisan legislation to rename NASA's Plum Brook Station, the agency's test facility in Sandusky, Ohio, after Neil Armstrong. Last week the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee approved the legislation that Portman and Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) introduced the legislation in September. Plum Brook is part of the NASA Glenn Research Center based in Cleveland, Ohio. It houses unique world-class facilities that conduct critical and innovative ground tests for the international aerospace community. The legislation now awaits action on the Senate floor.In July, in advance of the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, Senators Portman and Brown announced their intention to rename the facility. Prior to the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, Portman paid tribute to his friend, Ohio-native Neil Armstrong in a video, as well as on the Senate floor. In August, Portman accompanied NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine in a visit to NASA's Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field in Cleveland and Plum Brook Station in Sandusky to view progress on the agency's Artemis Program -- its multi-year plan to return American astronauts to the Moon and eventually send manned missions to Mars.A transcript of his remarks is here and a video can be found here.On Senate Floor, Portman Says U.S. Must Do More to Stop Theft of Taxpayer-Funded Research and Intellectual PropertyOn the Senate floor, Portman highlighted a new bipartisan report released by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which he chairs, that documents how American taxpayers have been unwittingly funding the rise of China's economy and military over the last two decades while federal agencies have done little to stop it. Portman held a hearing on Tuesday to highlight these findings. At the hearing, the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) admitted that the agency should have taken more rapid and comprehensive action in addressing China's strategic plan to acquire knowledge and intellectual property from researchers, scientists, and the U.S. private sector through their talent recruitment programs.A transcript of his remarks is here and a video can be found here. Friday, November 22, 2019 Portman, Stabenow Introduce RECYCLE Act to Improve RecyclingSenators Portman and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) introduced new legislation S. 2941, the RECYCLE Act to create a new federal grant program through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to help educate households and consumers about their residential and community recycling programs. This legislation will help increase recycling rates and reduce contamination in the recycling stream. U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Todd Young (R-IN) are original cosponsors of this legislation. Reports have indicated that consumer confusion on how to properly recycle is one of the top recycling challenges, and that education and outreach both increase participation in recycling and decrease contamination. According to EPA, the recycling rate in the U.S. is 35.2 percent and $9 billion worth of recyclable materials are thrown away each year, which presents a big opportunity to improve our nation's recycling systems. In addition, recycling offers numerous environmental and economic benefits, including diverting materials from landfills, using less energy to reprocess recycled material - which reduces emissions - and creating jobs. EPA's 2016 Recycling Economic Information (REI) Report found that recycling supports more than 757,000 jobs and $6.7 billion annually in tax revenues."Education and outreach is a key pillar to improving recycling rates and reducing contamination in our recycling stream," said Senator Portman. "Reports have indicated that one-third of materials that households put into their recycling bins end up in landfills and are not actually recycled. This is in part because there is confusion about what can actually be recycled, which leads to contamination of materials that could otherwise be recycled but instead are landfilled. Education is a key component in both increasing the amount of material that is being recycled and ensuring that the material being put into community and residential recycling programs is actually being recycled. I am pleased to be introducing the RECYCLE Act with Senator Stabenow today, and look forward to working with my colleagues to get it across the finish line." SOCIAL MEDIA China's Bid on American Science It's well-known by now that American companies doing business in China often have their technology stolen through mandatory joint-venture agreements with Chinese firms. That's one cause in the Trump Administration's trade war. But China's campaign of research and intellectual-property theft against the U.S. is also being conducted by American residents on American shores.That's the disturbing finding of a report this week from Ohio Republican Rob Portman's Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. It found the U.S. government is funding research for hundreds of scientists at American universities and labs who are effectively under contract to turn over their findings to China.The report focuses on China's Thousand Talents Program, or TTP, which was conceived in 2008 to recruit scientists based abroad to catapult China into the technological vanguard. Scientists recruited by the program work at universities across the U.S. but are often prohibited from disclosing their affiliation.TTP members may return to China after conducting taxpayer-funded research in the U.S. and bring intellectual property and research findings with them. Or they may maintain "shadow labs" in China and use their U.S. government grants to advance science there while also on the payroll of a U.S. university. The research sometimes has national-security applications as in one case where a TTP scientist attempted to steal "design information for the F-22 and JSF-35 military jet engines."The theft here is not from U.S. corporations but from taxpayers. The U.S. government spends $150 billion a year supporting biology, chemistry, physics and engineering through the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Energy. Researchers and academics apply for grants from these institutions to fund their labs. Yet fraud is extensive and U.S. funds have "contributed to China's global rise over the last 20 years," according to the report.Grant-making institutions have traditionally been lax in verifying information in applications, relying instead on universities that employ the grantees to ensure the integrity of the process. Yet the report says the FBI failed "to effectively warn the U.S. academic community of the threat of Chinese talent recruitment plans." The State Department lacks needed tools to vet foreign scientists coming to work in the U.S.Espionage and research theft have long been a problem as the U.S. is the world's technological leader and it rightly welcomes immigrants and foreign nationals from across the world. The U.S. needs that talent. Yet China appears to be running an organized and often secret campaign to exploit the openness of American institutions to make a bid for technological and military dominance.This does not mean that every Chinese student is a spy, or that Chinese-Americans should be suspected of dual loyalties. But there is a need for more transparency about Chinese subsidies for research in the U.S. and the demands China places on recipients. The challenge for U.S. law enforcement and the scientific community is to stop theft and deception without compromising the intellectual openness that has made the U.S. a scientific leader.(China's Bid on American Science. Wall Street Journal. November 20, 2019) Our tax dollars shouldn't go to fuel China's rise When U.S. taxpayers send their hard-earned money to the government, they shouldn't worry that it's being used to fuel economic and military growth in China. But that's exactly what's happening today.Every year, more than $150 billion in U.S. taxpayer money goes towards cutting-edge research conducted at our excellent network of universities and research institutions, helping us remain the global leader in science and technology.However, based on an eight-month bipartisan investigation by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations that I chair, China has worked to exploit our U.S. research systems for their own gain. Our report reveals how the American taxpayer has, in effect, unwittingly footed the bill for research that has gone to China to advance national security and economic interests over the past two decades while our own federal agencies have done little to stop it.Our investigation found that the Chinese government has used more than 200 so-called 'talent programs,' most notably their 'Thousand Talents Plan' to recruit American scientists and researchers to strategically acquire intellectual property from both America's public and private sectors, including advances in artificial intelligence and 5G technology.Since 2008, China has used its Thousand Talents Plan with large salaries and "shadow labs" to recruit more than 7,000 researchers from institutions in the U.S. and elsewhere. In exchange, these researchers sign legally binding contracts that can require them to hide their participation in the program from their research institution.This runs counter to U.S. regulations requiring federal grant recipients to disclose any funding they receive from non-U.S. sources. What's worse, the contracts sometimes require the researchers to acquire research from their government-funded labs and transfer it to China. In one case we found, a Thousand Talents Plan member used research created at a U.S. lab to file a patent under the name of a Chinese company, effectively stealing the U.S. government-funded research and claiming it for China.These talent recruitment programs are a win-win for China. First, U.S. taxpayers are funding this research, not China. Second, China uses that research it would not otherwise have to advance its own economic and military interest. The federal government has been aware of this problem for years, but has done nothing to correct it.Despite China publicly announcing the Thousand Talents Plan in 2008, it was not until last year that FBI headquarters took control of the response to the threat posed by the program. In response to our report, the FBI admitted that they wished that they had "taken more rapid and comprehensive action in the past" to address these talent programs.Likewise, the State Department, which issues visas to foreign researchers who can be Thousand Talents members, rarely denies visas to those it thinks may steal our research.Meanwhile, despite spending more than $150 billion of taxpayer money per year funding research and development, our federal grant-making agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Energy, and the National Science Foundation, don't coordinate how they award, track, and monitor those funds. That leaves our research dollars vulnerable.U.S. universities and research institutions must also take some responsibility for this problem. If universities can vet employees for scientific rigor or allegations of plagiarism, they can also vet for financial conflicts of interests and foreign sources of funding. These are complicated risks that the U.S. research community and the federal government must better understand.I am pleased to see that the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy has been a leader in working with federal agencies and U.S. research institutions to help them better respond to these threats. I plan to work with the White House, national research agencies, universities, and the State Department on legislative solutions to protect our research. I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to stop China's exploitation of our taxpayer-supported research.(Our tax dollars shouldn't go to fuel China's rise. Highland County Press.

Mr. Votek will continue to serve as interim CEO and President and as a member of the Company's Board of Directors.Ms. Wolfe most recently served as a Partner at Ernst & Young since 2011 and as its Central Region Real Estate Hospitality & Construction leader from 2017 to November 2019.17:50SUPN Supernus Pharma provides update on results from first Phase III study of SPN-810 for treatment of Impulsive Aggression in patients with ADHD (22.69 -0.14)In early November 2019, the company reported top-line results from the Phase III P301 trial in patients 6 to 11 years. The study was a placebo controlled, parallel group clinical trial in patients diagnosed with ADHD. Patients receiving SPN-810 36 mg showed a median percent reduction of 58.6% in the average weekly frequency of impulsive aggression (IA) episodes from baseline that was not statistically significant (p=0.092) compared to placebo. These results are based on the combined analysis of data from stages 1 and 2 in the study. In stage 1 (interim analysis stage), the median percent reduction was 60.0%, which was statistically significant (p=0.029) compared to placebo. However, in stage 2 of the P301 study, post the interim analysis, the increase in variability in the 36 mg treatment arm seems to have adversely impacted the results in the combined analysis.After conducting further analysis on the P301 data, the company believes that the high variability in the 36 mg treatment arm was primarily due to 6 patients out of 135 that had a mild IA condition with a baseline score of 6 episodes or less per week. In the placebo arm, there were 7 patients with the same mild IA condition. By excluding these subjects from the placebo and the 36 mg treatment arm, the primary analysis (combined stage 1 and 2 data) of the P301 data on the primary endpoint results in a p value of 0.017 for the treatment arm compared to placebo. This positive result is also confirmed by the sensitivity analysis on the primary endpoint with a p value of 0.044.The company plans on finalizing the statistical plan (SAP) for the second Phase III P302 study in patients 6 to 11 years old taking into consideration the exclusion of patients with 6 or less episodes of IA per week. The Company will be submitting the SAP to the FDA and expects data from the P302 study in the first quarter of 2020.17:44VAC Marriot Vacations raises quarterly cash dividend to $0.54/share from $0.45/share (123.66 -0.18)17:28EPRT Essential Properties Realty Trust increases quarterly cash dividend to $0.23/share from $0.22/share (25.83 -0.08)17:26BMY Bristol-Myers and Acceleron (XLRN) announce presentations of Reblozyl data at ASH (61.28 +1.33)Bristol-Myers Squibb and Acceleron Pharma announced that data evaluating the erythroid maturation agent (EMA) Reblozyl (luspatercept-aamt) in patients with anemia associated with a range of serious and rare blood diseases were presented at the 2019 ASH Annual Meeting.

These updated data from the ALCYONE study also demonstrated that the addition of daratumumab to VMP resulted in higher rates of minimal residual disease negativity. These data are the first OS results from the ALCYONE study and are being featured during an oral session at the 2019 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting. The data were simultaneously published in The Lancet.The most common Grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurring in at least 3% for daratumumab-VMP compared to the VMP arm were neutropenia (40.2% vs. 39%), thrombocytopenia (34.7% vs. 37.9%), anemia (17.3% vs. 19.8%) and pneumonia (13% vs. 4.2%). Grade 5 TEAEs were 6.9% in the daratumumab-VMP treatment arm compared with 5.6% in the VMP arm, and discontinuation due to TEAEs was 6.9% vs. 9.3%. The rate of invasive second primary malignancy was 4.9% in the daratumumab-VMP treatment arm compared with 4.5% in the VMP arm. No new safety concerns were identified.Additionally, follow-up data from the Phase 3 MAIA study showed significant progression-free survival benefit continued for three years following daratumumab treatment.17:13AES AES increases quarterly common stock dividend to $0.1433/share from $0.1365/share (18.79 +0.07)17:11UPWK Upwork announces intended departure of CEO Stephane Kasriel; appoints Hayden Brown as CEO, effective January 1; reaffirms guidance (11.15 -0.17)Stephane Kasriel, President & CEO, has informed the Board of his decision to step down at year end 2019, and the Board has appointed Hayden Brown, current Chief Marketing & Product Officer, to succeed Kasriel as President & CEO, effective January 1, 2020.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.4%, the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.4%, and the Russell 2000 declined 0.3%.The lack of conviction was understandable considering that there was no reported progress on the U.S.-China trade front ahead of the Dec. 15 tariffs, which would presumably upset the market if they went into effect without a Phase One deal. There is still some time left this week to strike a deal, but the trade uncertainty helped keep risk sentiment in check.Losses were made most prevalent in the S&P 500 health care (-0.7%), utilities (-0.5%), and information technology (-0.5%) sectors. The latter was pressured by Apple (AAPL 266.92, -3.79, -1.4%), which pulled back from record territory. Conversely, the consumer staples (+0.2%), real estate (+0.1%), and consumer discretionary (+0.1%) sectors finished higher.Other key events this week will include policy decisions from both the Fed and ECB, a UK election, and reports on consumer prices and retail sales for November. Strikingly, the CBOE Volatility Index spiked 16.5% to 15.86, as demand for downside protection increased in anticipation for any disappoints.Corporate news didn't move the needle, but M&A activity and analyst recommendations did contribute to some notable stock reactions.In the biotech space, ArQule (ARQL 19.71, +10.04, +103.9%) agreed to be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.72, -0.13, -0.2%) for about $2.7 billion in cash.

The first session of the week was very quiet, and it followed an overnight affair that was just as subdued. Economic data received overnight painted a mixed picture, as China reported a smaller than expected trade surplus for November (actual $38.73 bln; expected $46.30 bln) while Japan's Q3 GDP growth was revised up to 0.4% from 0.1%. Treasuries started the cash session with modest gains, climbing toward their intraday highs from Friday shortly after the open. However, the rest of the session saw a slow return to today's opening levels. The U.S. Treasury sold $38 bln in 3-yr notes to solid demand, as the high yield stopped through the when issued yield by 0.2 bps while the bid-to-cover ratio and indirect takedown were above average. The U.S. Dollar Index faced some morning pressure but returned to little changed as the day went on, reclaiming its 200-day moving average (97.65) in the process. Yield Check: 2-yr: -1 bp to 1.62% 3-yr: -1 bp to 1.64% 5-yr: UNCH at 1.67% 10-yr: -1 bp to 1.83% 30-yr: -2 bps to 2.26%News: The House of Representatives could vote on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on December 18, according to CNBC. The Bank for International Settlements published its latest quarterly review, which noted that structural issues rather than temporary factors were responsible for the mid-September shortage in the funding market that prompted the Fed to begin conducting daily reverse repurchases. The BIS added that liquidity demand from hedge funds exacerbated the funding stress. Financial Times reported that the Chinese government has ordered the removal of all foreign computer equipment and software from government offices. The Bank of Japan will reportedly lower its assessment of industrial production due to prolonged weakness. Former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker died on Sunday. China's November trade surplus totaled $38.73 bln (expected $46.30 bln; last $43.02 bln). Exports fell 1.1% yr/yr (expected 1.0%; last -0.8%) while imports rose 0.3% yr/yr (expected -1.8%; last -6.2%). Japan's Q3 GDP rose 0.4% qtr/qtr (expected 0.2%; last 0.1%), growing 1.8% yr/yr (expected 0.7%; last 0.2%).

IMGN632 displays a well tolerated safety profile and activity at doses up to and including 0.09 mg/kg per cycle. The most common treatment-related adverse event was infusion-related reactions (24% all grades, 8% grade 3); none required IMGN632 discontinuation. Single dose-limiting toxicities were seen at the highest dose levels tested (0.18-0.45 mg/kg): three reversible cases of veno-occlusive disease and one prolonged neutropenia; no patterns of hepatotoxicity or cytopenias occurred with doses below 0.18 mg/kg. Although no maximum tolerated dose was determined on either schedule, based on the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic data generated, the dose and schedule of 0.045 mg/kg given on day 1 every 3 weeks has been selected as the monotherapy recommended Phase 2 dose. AML Efficacy Across all dose levels and both schedules, of the patients assessable for efficacy (n=71), 38 (54%) had a reduction in bone marrow blasts and 13 (18%) achieved an objective response, including 2 complete remissions (CR) and 10 with incomplete recovery (CRi) and one morphologic leukemia free state (MLFS) in heavily pretreated patients. The vast majority of these responders (92%) had failed prior intensive therapies, including 3 with prior transplant, 69% had failed 2-3 prior lines of therapy, and 54% had an adverse risk classification. At the dose and schedule selected as the recommended Phase 2 dose (0.045 mg/kg Q3W), a 40% response rate was seen in relapsed and refractory patients with de novo AML, including 1 CR, 4 CRi, and 1 MLFS (with subsequent conversion to CRi). BPDCN Efficacy 3 of 9 (33%) evaluable relapsed/refractory BPDCN patients achieved a response after a 1-2 doses of 0.045 mg/kg IMGN632 (1 CR, 1 CRi, and 1 partial remission); all three patients had received prior SL-401 (tagraxofusp-erzs), two had received intense multi-agent chemotherapy, and one had prior stem cell transplant.14:49GILD Gilead Sciences & CIBMTR announce findings from ongoing post-marketing study evaluating safety and efficacy of Yescarta in adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (67.79 +0.71)In this analysis, efficacy and safety of Yescarta were comparable to that observed in the ZUMA-1 trial, despite a larger proportion of older, more difficult-to-treat patients in the real-world setting. The findings were presented today at the 61st American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting & Exposition, held in Orlando from December 7--10, 2019.14:48NVS Novartis AG Kymriah demonstrates consistent efficacy and safety outcomes in US patients when used in real-world setting (92.60 +0.53)Efficacy in DLBCL confirmed results seen in the pivotal trial despite treatment of a broader population, including older and more heavily pretreated patients.Fewer known CAR-T cell therapy adverse events for patients with DLBCL, specifically rates of high-grade cytokine release syndrome (4%) and neurologic events (5%), were observed compared with the pivotal clinical trials.In children and young adults with ALL, efficacy outcomes were similar and safety outcomes appear to be more favorable compared to the pivotal trial.14:48GMDA Gamida Cell announces updated results from Phase 1 clinical study of GDA-201 (4.75 -0.35)The co announced updated results from a Phase 1 clinical study of GDA-201, an investigational, natural killer (NK) cell-based cancer immunotherapy for the treatment of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM), at the 61st Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH), which is being held December 7--10 in Orlando, FL. Data from 22 patients in the ongoing study showed GDA-201 in combination with monoclonal antibodies was generally well tolerated and demonstrated early evidence of clinical activity in heavily pre-treated patients, including five complete responses observed among nine patients with NHL. Gamida Cell plans to initiate a Phase 1/2 multi-dose, multi-center study of GDA-201 in patients with NHL in 2020.14:46GILD Gilead Sciences announces primary results from ZUMA-2 -- 93% of patients treated with Investigational KTE-X19 achieved response, including 67% with a complete response (67.30 +0.22)The co announced primary results from ZUMA-2, a global, multicenter, single-arm, open-label Phase 2 study of KTE-X19, an investigational CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, in adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). After a single infusion of KTE-X19, the best objective response via independent radiologic central review (n=60 evaluable for efficacy analysis) was 93 percent, with 67 percent of patients having achieved a complete response. These findings were presented today at the 61st American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting & Exposition, in Orlando from December 7--10, 2019.With a median follow-up of 12.3 months (range: 7.0 to 32.3 months) at the time of data cutoff, 57 percent of patients remained in an ongoing response. Of the first 28 patients treated (minimum follow-up of 24 months), 43 percent were alive and remained in continued remission without additional therapy. The 12-month estimates of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 61 percent and 83 percent, respectively. Median duration of response, PFS and OS were not yet reached. Among the 68 patients evaluable for safety, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events were observed in 91 percent and 63 percent of patients, respectively. Grade 3 or higher CRS and neurologic events were seen in 15 percent and 31 percent of patients, respectively. No Grade 5 CRS or neurologic events occurred.14:42TALKX Market Briefing: Buyers a reluctant bunchThere has been a steady deterioration in the major indices since about 10:15 a.m. ET. The downward trend hasn't been sparked by any specific news catalyst; rather, it is largely a case of absent buyers today, which is making it easier to pressure prices lower.Their reluctance to push things further is understandable given how far things have been pushed already and given that the world is on the cusp of learning if the U.S. is going to implement a tariff on a $160 billion tranche of imported Chinese goods on December 15.Should that tariff be implemented, it is thought that the stock market would not react well. Accordingly, given how far the market has come, the near-term risk-reward dynamic is seen as being skewed to the risk side of things at the moment. Strikingly, the CBOE Volatility Index is up 11.7% to 15.21.Apple (AAPL 267.28, -3.43, -1.3%), which was up 20.9% since the end of September, is an influential laggard today.The consumer staples (+0.2%), consumer discretionary (+0.2% 0, and rel estate (+0.1%) sectors are the only sectors trading higher. The major indices are all down between 0.2-0.3%.14:33COMDX Energy Settlement PricesFeb Crude Oil futures fell $0.06 (-0.1%) to $59.04/barrel Jan Natural Gas $0.12 lower (-5.31%) at $2.21/MMBtu Jan RBOB Gasoline settled $0.01 higher (0.46%) at $1.6549/gallon Jan Heating oil futures settled $0.01 lower (-0.39%) at $1.9445/gallon14:27SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- PG&E (PCG) gains following wildfire settlement agreement -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersBNTX (28.99 +18.96%): The October IPO extends to new all-time highs on higher than average volume amid an active session for the biotech sector, which today digests a bevy of clinical updates and several premium acquisitions, including those of ArQule (ARQL) and Synthorx (THOR), which are active in the oncology space.PCG (11.25 +16.61%): Reached a settlement to resolve individual claims connected to losses from the 2015 Butte Fire, the 2017 Northern California Wildfires, and the 2018 Camp Fire valued at approx. $13.5 bln, resolving all claims arising from those fires; the settlement is to be implemented pursuant to co's Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization. Co, "with all major wildfire claims now on a path to be resolved and the total amount of wildfire liabilities determined," will now amend and finalize that plan. At two-month highs.AM (5.15 +14.8%): Announced that it will repurchase $100 mln of shares from Antero Resources (AR). Additionally, co and AR have agreed to a growth incentive fee program. Due to additional optimization of the midstream infrastructure buildout, co is now targeting a 2020 capital program of approx. $300-325 mln, a 22% reduction vs the previous target. Co targets net debt to adj. EBITDA in the mid-to-high 3-times range in 2020.Mid Cap LosersKOS (5.24 -13.25%): The stock, trading with above 3x average volume, sank to eleven-month lows early in the session, though it has since moderated those losses. In sector news, shares of Tullow Oil (TUWLF) plummeted overseas after that company, among other updates, including the announcement of the departures of its CEO and its Exploration Director, reset its forward-looking guidance, now forecasting 2020 Group production to average between 70,000-80,000 bpd, and noted that production performance has been significantly below expectations at the TEN and Jubilee fields in Ghana. Co is also active in Ghana and is a partner in production at the TEN and Jubilee fields. BPMC (71.18 -9.3%): Announced initial data from the Phase 2 PIONEER trial of avapritinib in patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis; initial data from the dose-finding Part 1 of the trial showed "rapid and robust reductions in serum tryptase" in patients treated with 25, 50, or 100 mg of avapritinib once daily. All doses of avapritinib tested were well-tolerated; there was one Grade 3 cognitive effect reported in the 100 mg cohort, and the event was resolved following dose modification. Co announced top-line results from the EXPLORER trial; among other results, top-line efficacy data as of a data cutoff of August 30 showed a centrally confirmed ORR of 77% in 48 patients evaluable for response. Top-line safety results were generally consistent with previously reported data. After the data cutoff, one patient with SM and an associated hematologic neoplasm of myelodysplastic syndrome had a Grade 5 intracranial bleed. PGNY (27.81 -8.79%): Continued volatility.14:23MDB MongoDB will report third quarter results this afternoon (131.32 +0.15)MongoDB (MDB) will report fiscal 2020 third quarter (October) results this afternoon, and management will host a call at 17:00.MongoDB is the leading non-relational (or NoSQL) database platform that is heralded by developers. The next-generation database company's freemium "land and expand" business model has led to explosive growth.The company has beaten estimates and guided revenue above consensus in each of its first eight quarterly reports as a public company since its IPO in October 2017.Management guided for a third quarter adjusted net loss of $0.29-0.27/share with revenue up 52% to $98-100.Revenue growth is expected to slow to 24% in the fourth quarter given increasingly difficult comparisons after revenue grew 85% in the fourth quarter last year. MongoDB has guided for a fiscal 2020 adjusted net loss of $1.11-1.06/share with revenue up ~48% to $390-395 mln.Last quarter, revenue grew 67% while total customers grew ~6% sequentially and 103% yr/yr to over 15,000. MongoDB Atlas, the company's managed cloud database-as-a-service offering, grew customers 7% sequentially and 149% yr/yr to over 13,200. Atlas revenue was up over 240% yr/yr and represented 37% of total revenue for the quarter, which does weigh on gross margins.The stock fell in response to earnings despite strong results as the 20x forward revenue multiple seemed to have already priced in the company's strong position.The $7.3 bln valuation now represents ~17x forward revenue estimates. The stock has consolidated for the last six months and is currently attempting to hold the 50-DMA.14:09SUMRX Earnings Out This Afternoon/Tomorrow MorningThis Afternoon: CDMO CASY CHWY ROAD MDB PHR SFIX TOL MTNTomorrow Morning: AZO CMD CONN DBI HDS14:00SCANX Large cap notable movers of interest -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable large cap movers of interest ($10 bln - $200 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Large Cap GainersZM (66.33 +5.72%): Shares display relative strength as they bounce back from last week's 16% slide.

(24.27 -0.67)Chewy (CHWY) is set to report Q3 earnings tonight after the close with a conference call set for 5pmET.Current Capital IQ consensus stands at a loss of ($0.13) per share on revenues of $1.20 bln.GuidanceQ3 revenues in the range of $1.19-1.21 bln.2020 revenues in the range of $4,75-4.80 bln. 2020 EBITDA Margin improvement in the range of 420-450 bps.The StoryShares of CHWY fell to post-IPO lows following the release of Q2 results. CHWY outpaced revenue expectations as revenue growth was 43% (49% in autoship). The issue was the shortfall on the bottom line as it missed EPS consensus for the second straight quarter. Higher than expected SG&A costs in Q2 were one of the reasons why the stock sold off post Q2 results. Some of the increase was driven by non-recurring items like fulfillment center build outs and public company costs. Operating Expenses increased 55% yr/yr compared to the 43% top line growth. CHWY was able to improve gross margins by 300 bps, EBITDA margins increased 410 bps yr/yr. However this only led to a small increase to the low end of its EBITDA outlook.The good news is investor expectations around earnings has been dampened which leaves upside surprise potential for this evening. Two pedestrian quarters with bottom line misses and a cautious note from Cleveland Research saying sales were tracking 'softer' than expected has reigned in the outlook. The company's float stands at 44 mln shares and 32% of this is short interest which leaves it susceptible to a squeeze. Trader's need to be aware that the lock up expiration looms on December 11. Parent company PetSmart owns approx 67% of the shares with hedge funds owning approx 20%. Shares of CHWY opened at $36 on June 14 but have been on a downward trend since opening up for trade. Shares hit a post-IPO low of $21.68 on November 11. Since then it has been able to recover approx 10% to rally into its 50-sma ($24.36) ahead of tonight's print. CHWY will need to surprise to the upside, particularly on its cost management side, in order to shake out some of the shorts. But that lock up expiration lingers, similat to what we saw at Crowdsrike (CRWD) which will make it tough to squeeze.Q2 RecapReported Q2 (Jul) loss of $0.21 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.11 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.10). Revenues rose 43.1% year/year to $1.15 bln vs the $1.13 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Gross margin of 23.6 percent expanded 300 basis points year-over-year and in line with expectations. Net loss of $82.9 million, including a non-cash share-based compensation charge of $43.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA(1) loss of $29.2 million improved 45 percent year-over-year.Adjusted EBITDA margin of (2.5) percent expanded 410 basis points year-over-year and in line with expectations.13:39COMDX Metals Settlement PricesFeb gold settled today's session down $0.20 (0.01%) at $1464.9/oz Mar silver settled today's session $0.04 higher (0.24%) at $16.65/oz Mar copper settled $0.03 higher (1.01%) at $2.7575/lb13:15OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:CLF Dec 9 calls are seeing interest with the underlying stock up 5% following positive mention in Barrons (volume: 36.7K, open int: 1570, implied vol: ~55%, prev day implied vol: 44%).

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is unchanged.December 15 is fast approaching, and the market is hoping that the U.S. and China can reach a deal to possibly delay the tariffs scheduled to hit that day. Scattered throughout this week will be policy decisions from the Fed and ECB, as well as reports on consumer inflation and retail sales for November.In the meantime, it's been tough for the market to gain any traction amid the losses in Apple (AAPL 265.26, -5.44, -2.0%) and the S&P 500 health care sector (-0.5%). Conversely, the S&P 500 communication services (+0.3%) and consumer discretionary (+0.3%) sectors have provided some support.M&A activity seen some huge premiums, especially in the biotech space. ArQule (ARQL 19.70, +10.04, +103.4%) will be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for about $2.7 billion. Synthorx (THOR 67.66, +42.63, +170.3%) will be acquired by French company Sanofi (SNY 45.35, -0.68, -1.5%) for about $2.4 billion.

At all-time highs. ARQL (19.7 +103.83%): To be acquired by Merck (MRK) for a premium $20/share in cash, representing an approximate total equity value of approx. $2.7 bln; Merck sees co's assets strengthening Merck's pipeline, most notably co's ARQ 531, which Merck names as "a compelling candidate for the treatment of B-cell malignancies." Co also today announced final Phase 1 clinical results for ARQ 531 in patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies; ARQ 531 reportedly demonstrated substantial anti-tumor activity and a manageable safety profile, and the data set "confirms the potential utility of ARQ 531 for the treatment of [...] heavily pretreated CLL patients," according to co's management. At multi-year highs. FTSV (26.48 +83.38%): Presented updated magrolimab clinical data in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. In higher-risk MDS, the ORR was 92%, including a complete response rate of 50%, while in untreated AML, the ORR was 64%, among other data. Co, with FDA guidance, has developed a protocol that will allow it "two distinct opportunities to achieve an accelerated approval" while remaining on-track to file an initial BLA in Q4 of 2021. Also announced preclinical proof-of-concept data for its novel all antibody conditioning regimen, comprised of FSI-174 and magrolimab, for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Reaches new all-time highs.Small Cap LosersDTIL (10.21 -48.07%): After spiking to record highs early in the session, the stock now gives up the majority of a substantial run higher that it had netted since mid-November. The volatility follows co's announcement of updated interim clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1 trial of PBCAR0191, its lead investigational allogeneic CAR T cell therapy candidate. Of nine patients treated with PBCAR0191, seven had objective evidence of tumor shrinkage at any timepoint. In the R/R non-Hodgkin lymphoma cohort, four of six patients achieved an objective response at day 28+, including three partial responses (two patients treated at Dose Level 1 and one at DL2) and one complete response (treated at DL2); the remaining two NHL patients achieved early responses at day 14 -- both patients had evidence of disease progression at day 28. In the B-ALL cohort treated at DL2, one of three patients achieved a complete response at day 28+; the remaining two patients did not respond at day 28. The trial is ongoing; treatment of patients at a third dose level recently commenced.DPLO (3.95 -32.1%): Agreed to be acquired by UnitedHealth's (UNH) OptumRx for $4.00/share through a cash tender offer, following a careful review of strategic options by co's Board of Directors. The stock had established new record lows below $3 in mid-November following co's issuance of Q3 results, at which time co's pursuit of a comprehensive strategic alternatives process remained ongoing; by Friday's close, the stock had improved by circa +139% from those lows. TVTY (19.7 -13%): Pulls back to multi-week lows on above average volume after disclosing that the employment relationship between co and its COO, Dawn M. Zier, has been mutually terminated and that co has entered into a Separation and Release Agreement with Ms. Zier that provides that she will receive those payments and benefits that she is entitled to under her employment agreement in respect of a termination without cause.

That outperformance is remarkable because it flies in the face of Goldman Sachs downgrading the stock to Sell from Neutral and slashing its price target to $12 from $17.Strikingly, Macy's has already exceeded its average daily volume less than two hours into the trading session. That heavy volume and the positive turn in the stock on a seemingly negative development are likely byproducts of the following factors:Investor belief that the Goldman Sachs analyst isn't breaking any new ground with the basis for the downgrade (secular headwinds weighing on comps and profitability). Shares of M were down 49% for the year before today's downgrade.Short-covering activity, which is often triggered when a beaten-up stock makes a counter-intuitive move.Momentum trading as speculators see an opportunity to force a short squeeze.Macy's is the picture of a tax-loss selling candidate, but the flip side of that understanding is that many tax-loss selling candidates are seen as good, bargain-hunting opportunities after the tax-loss selling is complete. The stock's resilience to selling interest today is apt to be helping its candidacy as a short-term, speculative rebound play.11:09TALKX Market Briefing: A mixed state of affairsThe stock market is mixed, and little changed, in today's early action. Buyers have reined in their efforts after Friday's post-employment report rally and ahead of a batch of key macro developments that will unfold this week, the most notable of which is the possible implementation of tariffs on Sunday of ~$160 billion worth of imported goods from China, most of which are consumer-oriented goods.Tucked in between will be the FOMC meeting, the ECB meeting, the UK election, and CPI and Retail Sales reports for November.Today, then, has the markings thus far of a wait-and-see day, yet the underlying bullish bias can still be described as bullish given the overall lack of selling interest with the market sitting close to an all-time high.The consumer discretionary sector (+0.3%), led by Amazon.com (AMZN 1758.58, +6.98, +0.4%), is today's bet-performing sector followed by the communication services sector (+0.2%), which is led by Alphabet (GOOG 1350.61, +9.99, +0.8%) and Facebook (FB 202.50, +1.45, +0.7%).Six sectors are up and five sectors are down in a reflection of the mixed state of things, which is also reflected in the recognition that the biggest sector winner is up just 0.3% while the biggest sector loser (industrials) is down just 0.2%.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.05%; the S&P 500 is flat; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000 are both down 0.1%.11:03APRE Aprea Therapeutics presents results from US and French Phase Ib/II clinical trials of APR-246 and azacitidine at ASH (29.62 +3.57)The trials evaluate the safety and efficacy of APR-246 in combination with azacitidine (AZA) for the treatment of TP53 mutated MDS and AML.U.S. Phase Ib/II clinical trial in patients with TP53 Mutant Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML):As of the data cutoff, the overall response rate (ORR) in 33 evaluable MDS patients was 88%, with a 61% complete remission (CR) rate, by International Working Group (IWG) criteria. With a median duration of follow-up of 10.8 months, the median duration of response was 8.4 months and the median duration of CR was 7.3 months. Seventeen (52%) evaluable MDS patients discontinued therapy to pursue stem cell transplant. Median overall survival (OS) for all enrolled patients (n=55) was 10.8 months. Median OS in responding patients versus non-responders was 13.7 vs. 3.9 months. Adverse events, regardless of causality, were mostly grade 1/2. Grade 3+ adverse events occurring in > or =20% of patients were limited to cytopenias and infection, consistent with underlying hematopoietic malignancies, and no exacerbation of the expected AZA-related safety profile has been observed.French Phase Ib/II clinical trial in MDS and AML:As of the data cutoff, the ORR in 24 evaluable MDS patients was 74%, with a 66% CR rate, based on IWG criteria. With a median duration of follow-up of 6.4 months, the median OS for all enrolled patients (n=53) had not been reached. In addition, all responding patients were alive at data cutoff. Relative to baseline, mutant TP53 variant allele frequency was significantly decreased in responding patients and undetectable in all patients who achieved a CR.10:44FTSV Forty Seven announces presentation of foundational preclinical data supporting development of FSI-174 in combination with magrolimab as novel all antibody conditioning regimen for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (24.81 +10.37)Forty Seven today announced preclinical proof-of-concept data for its novel all antibody conditioning regimen, comprised of FSI-174, its anti-cKIT antibody, and magrolimab, its anti-CD47 antibody. Preclinical studies in a non-human primate (NHP) model showed that the combination of FSI-174 and magrolimab significantly depleted hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from the bone marrow, with no dose limiting toxicities. The data will be presented in a poster session at the 61st American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.In the preclinical data presented at ASH, FSI-174 demonstrated binding affinity to both human and NHP cKIT receptors, and induced phagocytosis as well as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, FSI-174 was well-tolerated when administered to NHPs as a single agent, with no dose-limiting toxicities. The no-observed-adverse-effect level was established at 50 mg/kg, the highest dose tested. When administered together, FSI-174 and magrolimab demonstrated a synergistic benefit, promoting the highest level of phagocytosis of cKIT expressing target cells and inducing significant HSC depletion nine days after infusion compared to placebo.Forty Seven expects to complete investigational new drug-enabling studies by the end of 2019, and subject to approval of the IND by the FDA, plans to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating FSI-174 in healthy volunteers in the first quarter of 2020.10:39MRK Merck and Seven and Eight BioPharmaceuticals sign clinical research collaboration agreement (88.59 -0.26)Seven and Eight BioPharmaceuticals has signed a clinical research collaboration agreement with Merck, through a subsidiary, to explore the combination of Seven and Eight's BDB001, an immune modulator targeting toll-like receptors (TLR) 7 and 8, and Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), in treating patients with advanced solid tumors. Under the terms of the agreement, Seven and Eight will sponsor and be responsible for the conduct of the clinical study.10:36ATRA Atara Biotherapeutics reports updated long-term clinical results from multicenter Expanded Access Protocol study of tab-cel for patients with EBV+ PTLD (14.72 +0.73)Atara Biotherapeutics presented long-term clinical results from a multicenter Expanded Access Protocol (EAP) study of tab-cel (tabelecleucel) for patients with Epstein-Barr virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (EBV+ PTLD) at the ASH Annual Meeting & Exposition. Results from this analysis demonstrate a high overall response rate, short time to response, and favorable estimated long-term overall survival rates for tab-cel in patients with EBV+ PTLD following hematopoietic cell transplant or solid organ transplant who have failed rituximab-based therapy. Tab-cel was generally well-tolerated in all patients with EBV+ PTLD and other EBV-associated diseases.Safety analyses were presented for all patients treated with tab-cel (n=61; n=26 EBV+ PTLD and n=35 patients with other EBV-associated diseases). Consistent with prior studies, tab-cel was generally well-tolerated in all patients, and no tab-cel related adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred. Three graft versus host disease adverse events were reported, all in patients with prior allogeneic HCT. No other adverse events of special interest including cytokine release syndrome were reported.Median time to response of one month was seen in both EBV+ PTLD patient cohorts. In responders, two-year estimated overall survival rate was 86% for HCT (n=7) and 100% for SOT (n=10) with no patient deaths attributable to PTLD progression. Similar outcomes were observed in the EAP-201 subgroup of EBV+ PTLD patients (n=22) with adequate ECOG performance status, no CNS disease and no PLTD-related ventilatory support who would have likely met the eligibility criteria for Atara's ongoing tab-cel Phase 3 studies. Overall response rate was 55% and 82%, with a two-year estimated overall survival of 79% and 81%, in the HCT (n=11) and SOT (n=11) cohorts, respectively.10:32ACHN Achillion Pharma reports "positive" data from Phase 2 dose-finding study of danicopan at ASH (6.19 +0.02)Achillion Pharma today reported top-line data from a dose-finding Phase 2 trial assessing the safety and effectiveness of its oral small molecule factor D inhibitor danicopan (ACH-4471) in combination with intravenous eculizumab in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) patients who have an inadequate response to C5 monotherapy.The primary endpoint of the trial was an increase in hemoglobin from baseline. A mean increase of 2.4 g/dL at 24 weeks of treatment was achieved in this proof-of-concept trial. Danicopan, in combination with eculizumab, resulted in a significant reduction in blood transfusions with 10 patients receiving 34 transfusions (58 units) in the 6 months prior to screening to 1 patient receiving 1 transfusion (2 units) during the 24-week trial.In addition to improvements in hemoglobin and transfusions, there were also meaningful improvements in markers of hemolysis including bilirubin, reticulocytes, and PNH red blood clone size (%).In this clinical trial, danicopan was generally well tolerated. All treatment emergent adverse events were considered mild to moderate in severity except for Grade 3 severe adverse events that occurred in two patients. Both patients had resolution of their events, remained on danicopan, and completed the study.The company plans to initiate a global Phase 3 trial in early 2020.10:28NKTR Nektar Therapeutics announces presentation of new preclinical data for NKTR-255 at ASH (22.25 +1.80)NKTR-255 is an interleukin-15 (IL-15) receptor agonist that is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical study in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Details of the preclinical data presentations at ASH are as follows and are available on the scientific section of Nektar's website."The preclinical data being recognized at ASH demonstrate NKTR-255's promise in hematological malignancies through its potential to restore both NK cell and memory CD8 T cell compartments in patients," said Loui Madakamutil, Ph.D., SVP and Head of Discovery and Research at Nektar Therapeutics. "In studies presented by the laboratory of Dr. Nikhil Munshi at Dana-Farber, NKTR-255 enhanced the number and function of NK and CD8+ effector memory T cell populations in peripheral blood and bone marrow from patients with multiple myeloma and, also increased expression of activating receptors found on those NK cells. Separately, researchers from the laboratory of Dr. Cameron Turtle at Fred Hutchinson demonstrated NKTR-255 prevented tumor growth and increased survival of CAR T cells when added to a CD19-targeted CAR T cell regimen in models of B cell lymphoma. This preclinical data reinforces the basis of our ongoing clinical trial evaluating the potential of NKTR-255 in patients with multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."10:23XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (59.57 -0.18)The energy sector (-0.3%) displays relative weakness in the early going of today's session. Today's early underperformance comes after the sector gained 1.5% last week, finishing ahead of the remaining ten groups. Factors contributing to the underperformance:Pressure on the price of oil. WTI crude is down $0.27, or 0.5%, at $58.93/bbl. Granted, the energy component has climbed off its overnight low of $58.23 in recent trade, but it remains in negative territory, weighing on the energy sector. China reported a smaller than expected trade surplus for November, which supports the argument that the Chinese economy continues slowing down. This will continue posing a headwind to global growth. Pullback after last week's show of relative strength.Notable movers:Marathon Petroleum (MPC 58.95, -1.26, -2.1%): weakest sector component after being downgraded to Neutral from Overweight at JP Morgan. Chevron (CVX 117.27, -0.74, -0.6%): downgraded to Neutral from Buy at Citigroup. HollyFrontier (HFC 50.40, -0.54, -1.1%): trading at a three-month low. Occidental Petroleum (OXY 37.71, -0.51, -1.3%): on the verge of falling to a fresh 2019 low. Chevron (CVX 117.31, -0.70, -0.6%): looking to remain above its 50-day moving average (117.39). Baker Hughes (BKR 22.64, +0.43, +1.9%): showing relative strength in a weak sector.10:19CNST Constellation Pharmaceuticals provides updated preliminary data from MANIFEST clinical trial with CPI-0610 (56.82 +13.12)MANIFEST is an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of the company's bromodomain and extra-terminal domain protein inhibitor CPI-0610 in patients with myelofibrosis (MF). Arm 3 is evaluating CPI-0610 in combination with ruxolitinib in JAK-inhibitor-nave MF patients. Arms 1 and 2 are studying CPI-0610 as a monotherapy or in combination with ruxolitinib in ruxolitinib-resistant or -intolerant MF patients. Results include:Preliminary data showed continuing signs of activity across a broad range of parameters, suggesting possible disease-modifying effects of CPI-0610.In the first-line treatment arm, 12 out of 15 (80%) evaluable JAK-inhibitor-nave patients treated with a CPI-0610 / ruxolitinib combination achieved at least a 35% spleen volume response (SVR35) at 12 weeks. The median percent change in spleen volume reduction was -49.7%. Ten out of 14 (71%) evaluable patients achieved at least a 50% improvement in Total Symptom Score (TSS50) at 12 weeks. The median percent change in TSS at 12 weeks was -60.3%.Clinical activity, including SVR35 responses, TSS50 responses, and conversion from transfusion dependence to transfusion independence, was seen at 24 weeks in patients in the second-line treatment arm who added CPI-0610 to ruxolitinib, suggesting that treatment with CPI-0610 may have durable effects.CPI-0610 in combination with ruxolitinib in JAK-inhibitor-nave patients was generally well tolerated. No adverse events led to study discontinuation. Three patients (10%) had greater than or equal to Grade 3 anemia. One patient (3.3%) had Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, which was reversible. CPI-0610 as monotherapy or in combination with ruxolitinib in ruxolitinib-refractory or -intolerant patients (Arms 1 and 2) was generally well tolerated. The most common hematologic adverse event was thrombocytopenia.Constellation continues to enroll patients in MANIFEST. As a result of encouraging preliminary data, Constellation expanded Arm 3 of MANIFEST for JAK-inhibitor-nave patients from 43 to up to 101 patients. The company also expanded Cohort 2A, for TD ruxolitinib-resistant or -intolerant patients adding CPI-0610 to ruxolitinib, from 16 to up to 60 patients. Constellation has started planning for a randomized, active-controlled, pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial studying the combination of CPI-0610 and ruxolitinib versus ruxolitinib and placebo in JAK-inhibitor-nave patients with MF. The company expects this clinical trial to start in 2020.An investor event to discuss the MANIFEST update at ASH is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. EST today.10:18AGIO Agios Pharma presents updated data for mitapivat from extension phase of DRIVE PK Phase 2 study in patients with pyruvate kinase deficiency (44.64 +3.70)Agios Pharma today reported new data from the extension phase of the DRIVE PK Phase 2 study of mitapivat (AG-348) in adults with pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency at the 2019 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.In the extension phase, patients treated with mitapivat doses >25 mg twice daily in the core period undergo a dose taper and continue on a dose that maintained their Hb level at no lower than 1.0 g/dL below their pre-taper level. As of the March 27, 2019 data cutoff, 18 of the 36 patients remain in the extension phase with a median treatment duration of 35.6 months (range 28.7-41.9). For the 18 patients in the extension phase, improvements in hemoglobin and other markers of hemolysis including reticulocytes, indirect bilirubin, and haptoglobin achieved during the core period were sustained during the extension period up to 42 months, as of the data cutoff. Adverse events for patients who continued in the study (n=18) were comparable in the core and extension periods. In the extension, the most common AEs were headache (39%), insomnia (28%), fatigue (28%), and nasopharyngitis (28%). No new safety signals were identified in the extension period.The cumulative safety profile, says the company, continues to support long-term twice daily dosing of mitapivat.Mitapivat is an investigational, first-in-class, oral, small molecule allosteric activator of wild-type and a variety of mutated pyruvate kinase-R (PKR) enzymes that directly targets the underlying metabolic defect in PK deficiency, a rare, potentially debilitating, hemolytic anemia. In addition, data was shared from the Agios-sponsored Natural History Study of PK deficiency that detailed the comorbidities and complications associated with the disease and the impact of transfusion history.10:13OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:CLF Dec 9 calls are seeing interest following positive mention in Barrons with 3720 contracts trading vs. open int of 1570, pushing implied vol up around 6 points to ~50%.

The study was designed in two parts: Part A to establish an initial priming dose with flat dosing regimens and Part B to escalate dosing on subsequent administrations to the priming dose. Prophylactic treatment for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was mandated prior to each dose of XmAb13676. XmAb13676 was generally well tolerated, and a priming dose of 45 mcg/kg was chosen for continued dose escalation in Part B for patients with NHL. Safety was evaluated in all 53 patients. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were pyrexia (55%), CRS (53%), and anemia (41%). CRS was more frequent and generally higher grade on the first dose. Three patients (6%) experienced Grade 3 or 4 CRS on the first dose, all prior to the implementation of step-up dosing. AEs consistent with the symptoms of CRS, but not reported as such, were observed in an additional 23% of patients and were mild to moderate in severity.10:09SGEN Seattle Genetics and Takeda Pharma (TAK) announce additional analyses of results from ECHELON-1 and ECHELON-2 frontline phase 3 trials of ADCETRIS (116.36 -1.14)These analyses were presented at the 61st Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology. ADCETRIS (brentuximab vedotin) is an antibody-drug conjugate directed to CD30, a defining marker of classical Hodgkin lymphoma and expressed on the surface of several types of peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL). The ECHELON-1 analysis highlighted a four-year update of the phase 3 clinical trial in a poster presentation.ECHELON-1 is evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with AVD compared to ABVD in patients with Stage III or IV frontline classical Hodgkin lymphoma.As previously reported, the ECHELON-1 trial achieved its primary endpoint with the combination of ADCETRIS plus AVD resulting in a statistically significant improvement in modified progression-free survival compared to the control arm of ABVD as assessed by independent review facility. A four-year post-hoc exploratory analysis was conducted to examine PFS outcomes per investigator assessment in the intent-to-treat population of 1,334 patients, including results by PET2 status, age, stage and prognostic risk scores. Results include: The four-year PFS rate for patients in the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm was 81.7% compared to 75.1% in the ABVD arm, a difference of 6.6%. This represents a 31% reduction in the risk of progression or death. Median follow-up time was 48.4 months. A PFS benefit at four-years for ADCETRIS plus AVD was observed for all patients independent of PET2 status, including in patients who are less than 60 years old.Consistent improvement in PFS was observed among patients treated with ADCETRIS plus AVD compared with ABVD across the majority of pre-specified subgroups.As previously reported for the primary analysis, on the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm, peripheral neuropathy events were observed in 67% of patients compared to 43% in the ABVD arm. The four-year update shows that among patients with peripheral neuropathy, 83% in the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm and 84% in the ABVD arm reported complete resolution or improvement at last follow-up. The ECHELON-2 phase 3 clinical trial data were presented in an oral session at ASH and focused on the outcomes of the subset of patients who underwent consolidative stem cell transplant. ECHELON-2 is evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with CHP compared to CHOP in frontline CD30-expressing PTCL.As previously reported, the ECHELON-2 trial met its primary endpoint with the combination of ADCETRIS plus CHP resulting in a statistically significant improvement in PFS versus the control arm of CHOP per blinded independent central review. A post-hoc exploratory analysis evaluated the impact of consolidative stem cell transplant in the ECHELON-2 study for the patients who achieved CR treated with ADCETRIS plus CHP. In the ADCETRIS plus CHP arm, this included 38 patients in CR who received a stem cell transplant and 76 patients in CR who did not. Key findings of this analysis include:The PFS estimate favored the use of stem cell transplant (HR, 0.38; [95% CI: 0.18, 0.82]). After a median follow-up time of 35.9 months, the three-year PFS rate for the 38 patients who received a stem cell transplant was 76.1%. After a median follow-up time of 41.6 months, the three-year PFS rate for the 76 patients who did not receive a stem cell transplant was 53.3%. As previously reported, the safety profile of ADCETRIS plus CHP in the ECHELON-2 trial was comparable to CHOP and consistent with the established safety profile of ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy.10:08SWTX SpringWorks Therapeutics' collaborator GlaxoSmithKline presented data evaluating SpringWorks' nirogacestat alone and in combination with GlaxoSmithKline's belantamab mafodotin (27.00 +2.48)The data demonstrated that treatment of BCMA-expressing cancer cell lines with nirogacestat led to significantly increased levels of cell surface expression of BCMA and corresponding decreases in shedding of BCMA, as measured by levels of soluble BCMA. Further, the combination of nirogacestat and belantamab mafodotin resulted in synergistic increases in cancer cell killing as compared to belantamab mafodotin alone, with an up to ~3,000-fold improvement in cytotoxicity.09:40WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Stock market opens little changedThe major indices begin the day little changed.

It is the Company's intention to resume the Advantage Loan program as soon as management is confident its stated policies and procedures are being followed. However, it is presently difficult to estimate how long this suspension might last.The Advantage Loan program is a material component of the Bank's total loan originations. While it is difficult to quantify the financial impact of the program's temporary suspension, management anticipates a reduced level of near-term loan originations, slower overall loan portfolio growth, and less loan sales. However, management does not anticipate any credit related issues from previous loans made under the program due to the substantial amount of equity required for each borrower and the resulting strong collateral package for each loan. In order to mitigate the operational and financial impact of the Advantage Loan program's temporary suspension, the Company will continue to work on initiatives to diversify its overall loan production. Such initiatives include expanding the Bank's commercial lending efforts, including multifamily, tenant-in-common, construction, and commercial and industrial loans.

Weiss, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are highly encouraged by the first clinical data presented from our once daily, BTK inhibitor, TG-1701, which has demonstrated superior selectivity for BTK compared to ibrutinib in an in vitro whole kinome screening. The data presented today show that TG-1701 is an active BTK inhibitor as a single agent and that the combination of U2 plus TG-1701 has been generally well tolerated and active with 6 of 7 patients responding to the triple therapy at 100 mg QD, the lowest dose of TG-1701 tested. We look forward to continuing dose escalation of TG-1701 in the combination arm and identifying the optimal dose for this therapy." Mr. Weiss continued, "Our goal has always been to develop the best possible combination treatment options for patients, and we are excited to present the first data from a triple combination study in which all of the agents are being developed by TG. We believe this proprietary combination has the potential to enhance the results of BTK inhibitor therapy alone and offer patients early and deep responses with a tolerable safety profile."08:02GALT Galectin Therapeutics announces publication of results from its NASH-CX Phase 2 clinical trial in NASH cirrhosis in the peer-reviewed journal Gastroenterology (2.99 )The paper outlines that in a phase 2b study of 162 patients with NASH, cirrhosis, and portal hypertension, one year of biweekly infusion of belapectin was safe but not associated with significant reduction in HVPG or fibrosis, compared with placebo. However, in a subgroup analysis of patients without esophageal varices, 2 mg/kg belapectin (GR-MD-02) did reduce HVPG and development of varices. This subgroup analysis suggests that there may be benefits from belapectin in patients with NASH cirrhosis without esophageal varices. Further, if this observation can be reproduced in subsequent studies, belapectin may have a role in the management of patients with NASH cirrhosis and portal hypertension but no varices.08:01REPL Replimune names Jean M.

This was comparable to historical data with multiple doses of busulfan conditioning.CD117-ADC was well tolerated in non-human primates with no evidence of the often severe side effects seen with busulfan conditioning, including veno-occlusive disease, weight loss, diarrhea, mucositis, vomiting, pulmonary fibrosis or seizures.07:42TPX Tempur Sealy Int'l determines that it will record a charge of $30 mln (before tax) in Q4 in connection with the bankruptcy of one of its customers (85.89 )On December 6, 2019, Tempur Sealy determined that it will record a charge of $30 mln (before tax) in the fourth quarter of 2019, in connection with the bankruptcy of one of its customers, Mattress PAL Holding, LLC, and the resulting significant liquidity issues of Mattress PAL's affiliates (collectively, "Mattress1One"). On April 7, 2019, Mattress PAL filed a voluntary petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code ("Chapter 11 Proceedings"). On December 5, the Bankruptcy Court orally granted Mattress PAL's request to convert the Chapter 11 Proceedings to a Chapter 7 liquidation case. The company plans to treat this charge, which does not involve any cash payments, as an adjustment in calculating adjusted EBITDA under the company's senior secured credit agreement. Mattress1One represented less than 1% of the company's global net sales in 2019, and the company does not expect this charge, or the loss of Mattress1One as a customer, to have a material impact on the company's 2019 guidance, 2020 outlook, or current or future liquidity.07:37IEP Icahn Enterprises commences private placement of Senior Notes due 2027 (61.61 )The proceeds from the offering will be used for general limited partnership purposes.07:35MBIO Mustang Bio highlights presentation of updated Phase 1/2 clinical data for MB-107 lentiviral gene therapy for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (3.85 )Lentiviral Gene Therapy with Low Dose Busulfan for Infants with X-SCID Results in the Development of a Functional Normal Immune System: Interim Results of an Ongoing Phase I/II Clinical Study Lentiviral gene therapy using low dose busulfan conditioning has been well tolerated, with no serious adverse events other than hematologic related to busulfanAll 11 patients had robust hematopoietic recovery within 3-4 weeks post cell infusion without blood product support Nine patients, with a follow up of greater than 3 months, achieved normal-for-age T-cell and natural killer (NK)-cell numbers within 3-4 months post gene therapy Five patients are off intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy thus far, of whom 3 responded to vaccines Median vector copy number (VCN) at 12 months post-gene therapy in seven patients, who have been followed for more than 12 months, was 2.25 VCN/cell (range: 1.24-3.03) in T cells, 0.34 VCN/cell (range: 0.23-1.25) in B cells, 1.55 VCN/cell (range 1.27-3.39) in NK cells, and 0.08 VCN/cell (range: 0.03-0.76) in myeloid cells in peripheral blood, and 0.10 (range: 0.05-0.66) in CD34+ bone marrow cells, respectivelyEnhanced Transduction Lentivector Gene Therapy for Treatment of Older Patients with X-Linked Severe Combined ImmunodeficiencyEarly outcome data for five older children and young adults with XSCID who received the lentivector (also known as lentiviral) gene therapy as salvage therapy after having previously received haplo-identical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as infants without chemotherapy-based conditioning were previously reported and published in Science Translational Medicine. By 2016, three additional patients were treated, and the cohort of eight patients (referred to as Cohort A) has now been followed for 3 to 7 years. Among Cohort A, gradual clinical benefit in the clearance of chronic norovirus and associated improved abdominal complaints, malabsorption, growth and IgG production were observed, and four patients were able to cease immunoglobulin replacement therapy.While the results were positive, the relatively inefficient transduction of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) required large quantities of vector. This resulted in relatively low VCN in myeloid cells in some patients, with delayed immune cell recovery and persistent clinical disease, especially in the last patient treated (patient 8). To address this, NIH developed a refined enhanced transduction (ET) procedure consisting of a single overnight transduction after 48 hours pre-stimulation in cytokines (Stem cell factor, Thrombopoietin, Flt3-ligand; 100ng/mL) and incorporated transduction enhancers LentiBoost 1:100 and dimethyl prostaglandin 2 (dmPGE2; 1uM).The presentation at the 2019 ASH Annual Meeting included data from six patients (referred to as Cohort B) treated by NIH, including re-treatment of patient 8. The patients, who were aged 12 to 36, had significant problems with donor T cell infiltration of liver, bone marrow and kidneys, and were nearly absent of B and NK cells. The enhanced transduction procedure achieved much greater transduction efficiencies than were observed in Cohort A, with greater than 10-fold less vector, and resulted in faster immune reconstitution and more significant clinical benefit by 3 months.07:33AR Antero Resources highlights agreements expected to reduce its gathering, processing and transportation costs by approximately $350 mln over the next four years, commences asset sale program targeting $750 mln to $1 bln in proceeds to be completed in 2020 (2.19 )The agreements include a growth incentive fee program with Antero Midstream Corporation (AM) that aligns with the Company's current 8% to 10% compound annual production growth plan through 2021 and additional agreements with other third party midstream providers.

The growth incentive fee program aligns with Antero Resources' current 8% to 10% compound annual net production growth plan in 2020 and 2021. The share repurchase and growth incentive fee reduction transactions have been negotiated and recommended by the Conflicts Committees of Antero Midstream and Antero Resources and approved by both Boards of Directors.Due to additional optimization of the midstream infrastructure buildout, Antero Midstream is now targeting a 2020 capital program of approximately $300 to $325 million. This represents a $75 to $100 million, or 22% reduction, compared to the previous target of $375 to $425 million. Antero Resources' previously announced preliminary 2020 target of 110 to 120 completions in 2020, with an average lateral length of 12,100 feet is unchanged.

All response-evaluable patients experienced tumor reduction (complete response + partial response + stable disease) following treatment with ADCETRIS in combination with OPDIVO. Median duration of response was not yet reached and the maximum duration of response was 22 months and ongoing (95% CI: 7.06, -). The most common treatment-related adverse events of any grade occurring in at least 20 percent of patients were fatigue, diarrhea, pyrexia, infusion related reaction, peripheral motor neuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy and increase in lipase. One treatment-related serious adverse event was pyrexia. Fifty-seven percent of patients (12/21) had at least one treatment-related adverse event greater than or equal to Grade 3, most commonly increase in lipase (24 percent, 5/21), peripheral motor neuropathy and peripheral sensory neuropathy (each 14 percent, 3/21), and fatigue and hyponatremia (each 10 percent, 2/21). Two-Year Follow-up Results from the Phase 1-2 Study of Brentuximab Vedotin in Combination with Nivolumab in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (Abstract #238, oral presentation at 2:45 p.m. ET on Saturday, December 7, 2019) Of the 91 treated patients, 85 percent (77/91) had an objective response, including 67 percent (61/91) with a complete response, 16 patients with a partial response and six patients had stable disease. Of the 91 treated patients, 67 patients received an ASCT per trial protocol with no additional salvage therapy. For all treated patients, the two-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 79 percent (95% CI: 68%, 87%). For the 67 patients who received an ASCT per trial protocol, the two-year PFS was 92 percent (95% CI: 80%, 97%). Median follow-up for all treated patients was 24.2 months (range 1.8-41.7) and the median PFS was not reached. Estimated overall survival at two years was 94 percent (95% CI: 85%, 97%) and median overall survival was not yet reached. Peripheral immune signatures were consistent with an activated T-cell response. Prior to ASCT, the most common adverse events of any grade occurring in more than 20 percent of patients were nausea, infusion related reaction, fatigue, diarrhea, pruritus, headache, vomiting and pyrexia. Other adverse events included peripheral neuropathy in 16 patients (18 percent) and neutropenia in six patients (7 percent). Two patients (2 percent) discontinued treatment due to adverse events, Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy and increased gamma-glutamyltransferase. Serious adverse events occurred in 14 patients (15 percent), including pneumonia, pneumonitis and pyrexia (two patients each); and Grade 3 Guillain-Barre syndrome (one patient).06:52GILD Gilead Sciences reports Long-term data from ZUMA-1 demonstrating about half of refractory large b-cell lymphoma patients were alive three years after Yescarta treatment (67.08 )Co announced new data from the ZUMA-1 trial of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) in adult patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma. These results included updated overall survival data from the pivotal phase 2 study after three years following a single infusion of Yescarta, as well as an analysis from a separate safety management cohort of patients receiving early steroid intervention for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events. Updated results from a separate ZUMA-1 safety management study (Cohort 4) were also presented at the meeting (Abstract #243). In this analysis, patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma treated with Yescarta received earlier steroid intervention, beginning when patients experienced Grade 1 neurologic events or experienced Grade 1 CRS with no improvement after three days of supportive care. Patients could receive optional bridging chemotherapy prior to Yescarta infusion. In the analysis, 41 patients had received Yescarta, with a median follow-up of 8.7 months; 73% of patients received corticosteroids and 76% received tocilizumab. Earlier steroid use appeared to decrease the percentage of patients with Grade > or =3 CRS (2%) and neurologic events (17%), each of which were numerically lower than rates in the registrational cohorts of ZUMA-1 (13% CRS, 31% neurologic events). There were no Grade 4 or 5 CRS or neurologic events and no Grade 5 AEs related to Yescarta in Cohort 4. Objective response rate per investigator assessment was 73% in Cohort 4, with 51% of patients achieving a complete response. The median duration of response was 8.9 months. Fifty-four percent of patients in this cohort remained in an ongoing response with at least six months of follow-up after Yescarta infusion. Median OS in Cohort 4 has not been reached.06:51CRTX Cortexyme reports new data revealing link between bacterial pathogen and genetic risk for Alzheimer's Disease (28.31 )Co announced the presentation of new data supporting the on-target activity of COR388, its lead investigational medicine, and linking the "gingipain hypothesis" for Alzheimer's disease (AD) to the significance of the APOE gene as a major risk factor for the disease.Gingipains from P. gingivalis cleave ApoE proteins and have a preference for cleaving ApoE4; and COR388, a gingipain inhibitor, prevents this. In in vitro experiments, cells infected with P. gingivalis exhibited gingipain-dependent ApoE cleavage activity that generated ApoE fragments similar to what was seen in the brains and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, uninfected cells had no significant ApoE protein-cleaving activity. Furthermore, P. gingivalis gingipains cleaved ApoE4 more readily than ApoE3. Finally, in the infected cells, COR388 alone was sufficient to block ApoE fragmentation. In a Phase 1b trial, COR388 reduced ApoE fragments in CSF. Cortexyme's Phase 1 clinical development program for COR388 included cohorts of healthy volunteers and subjects with Alzheimer's disease. In addition to assessing safety and initial clinical activity, investigators also assessed the level of ApoE fragmentation in the CSF of nine subjects with Alzheimer's disease. Six subjects received 50mg of COR388 twice daily while three subjects received placebo. After 28 days, a statistically significant decrease in ApoE fragments (both ApoE4 and ApoE3) was observed in subjects treated with COR388 versus those treated with placebo.06:51EGRX Eagle Pharma commences dosing in pilot study for novel estrogen receptor antagonist product candidate (56.43 )The company has commenced dosing in a pilot clinical study to assess the unique characteristics of its fulvestrant product candidate, which has the potential to enhance estrogen receptor ("ER") inhibition and improve outcomes for patients with ER-positive breast cancer.

All results are as of the data cutoff date of August 26, 2019.Groups A and B:As of the data cutoff date, seven out of nine total patients in Groups A and B (five out of seven in Group A and two out of two in Group B) did not require regular RBC transfusions post-treatment. Overall, patients in Groups A and B experienced a reduction, but not complete elimination of VOC and ACS events at two years post-treatment, suggesting that the levels of gene therapy-derived hemoglobin may have been sufficient to reduce but not eliminate continued sickle-related disease manifestations. Group C As of the data cutoff date, 17 patients were treated with LentiGlobin for SCD in Group C, with the longest follow-up at 21 months; none required regular RBC transfusions post-treatment. In patients with six or more months of follow-up (n=12), median levels of gene therapy-derived anti-sickling hemoglobin, HbAT87Q, were at least 40% of total hemoglobin. Total hemoglobin and HbAT87Q levels ranged from 9.3 -- 15.2 g/dL and 2.7 -- 9.0 g/dL, respectively, at last visit. Treatment with LentiGlobin for SCD reduced key markers of hemolysis, including reticulocyte counts, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and total bilirubin concentration, which suggests that treatment is improving biological markers of the disease. Among the nine patients with at least six months of follow-up who had four or more VOC or ACS events in the two years prior to treatment, there was a 99% reduction in annualized rate of VOC and ACS. There were no reports of ACS or serious VOC at up to 21 months post-treatment in these patients. As previously reported, there was one non-serious Grade 2 VOC was observed in a patient approximately 3.5 months post-LentiGlobin for SCD treatment.HGB-206 Exploratory Assays bluebird bio presented results from exploratory assays in samples from a subset of patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD from Groups A, B and C, to assess the relationship between drug product characteristics and RBC physiology. To demonstrate the pancellular expression of the gene therapy derived anti-sickling Hb, HbAT87Q, bluebird bio developed an assay that enables detection of HbAT87Q and HbS protein in individual RBCs. In 12 patients who had at least six months of follow-up, the proportion of RBCs positive for HbAT87Q at the last study visit was more than 70% in all cases; with more than 90% of RBCs positive for HbAT87Q in four patients.On average, HbAT87Q present in RBCs of patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD was within the range of non-sickling adult Hb, HbA, present in the RBCs from people with sickle cell trait. The RBCs also resembled sickle cell trait RBCs with regard to propensity to sickle under low oxygen conditions. Sickling of RBCs from patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD was significantly less than that seen in untreated patients with SCD.06:49MNK Mallinckrodt plc presents data on a novel predictive model to identify infants at risk for infantile spasms (3.41 )Co announced findings on the use of a novel predictive model designed to more quickly identify infants with infantile spasms (IS), a rare seizure disorder that typically occurs between three and seven months of age. Key FindingsDeductive models developed to identify the combinations of variables that predict IS prior to diagnosis and during the treatment pathway: 557 patients had =2 symptoms pertaining to IS -- seizures, developmental delay, lack of eye contact and lack of muscle tone -- and a moderate or high severity ED visit. In this group, 55 percent of patients (n=304) had an IS diagnosis within a median 0.8 months of the triggering event. The most notable deductive combinations focused on pre-diagnosis of IS. MethodsThe study utilized data from the Symphony Health Integrated Dataverse database to identify triggers for early identification of IS patients from medical and pharmacy claims from 10.8 million patients under 2 years of age between May 2017 and April 2018. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) procedure codes were evaluated to identify the codes most likely to predict a subsequent diagnosis of IS. Researchers also used input from IS medical experts to determine the clinical, electrographic, radiologic, procedural and medication variables that may predict IS development.06:48SGMO Sangamo Therapeutics announces preliminary results from first three patients treated in Phase 1/2 THALES study evaluating investigational ST-400 ex vivo gene-edited cell therapy in transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (11.66 )The three patients treated with ST-400 experienced prompt hematopoietic reconstitution, demonstrating neutrophil engraftment in 14-22 days and platelet engraftment in 22-35 days (Table 1). No emerging clonal hematopoiesis has to date been observed by on-target indel pattern monitoring in the three treated patients. Reported adverse events (AEs) are consistent with the known toxicities of mobilization, apheresis, and myeloablative busulfan conditioning. One serious adverse event (SAE) related to ST-400 was reported. As previously disclosed, Patient 1 experienced hypersensitivity during ST-400 infusion considered by the investigator to be likely related to the product cryoprotectant excipient, DMSO, and which resolved by the end of the infusion.06:47LITE Lumentum to offer $850 mln aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2026 (72.08 )Lumentum intends to use approximately $196 million of the net proceeds of the offering to repay in full all amounts outstanding under its term loan credit facility, and a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to purchase up to approximately $200 million of its common stock concurrently with the pricing of this offering in privately negotiated transactions effected through the initial purchaser of the notes or its affiliates as its agent.

Fourteen patients were evaluable at one month.AUTO3 was well-tolerated, with no patients experiencing > or = Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with primary infusion and 1 of 14 experiencing Grade 3 neurotoxicity that resolved swiftly with steroids. There were no pembrolizumab immune-related toxicities and the majority of grade 3 or higher adverse events were hematological. Low levels of serum cytokines are consistent with the observed low levels of CRS and neurotoxicity. Across all tested doses 5 patients achieved a complete response, with 4 of 5 complete responses ongoing, the longest at 18 months. All CRs were achieved without need for steroid or tocilizumab-based management of the patients or ICU level care.AUTO3 -- (Poster) - Phase 1/2 AMELIA clinical trial of AUTO3 in patients with relapsed/refractory pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pALL) (Abstract # 2620)AUTO3 was well-tolerated overall, with no patients experiencing = Grade 3 CRS and no patients experiencing > or = Grade 2 neurotoxicity, in doses > or =3x106 /kg CAR-T cells. No AUTO3-related deaths were reported.Among the 10 CAR T-nave patients, at a median follow-up time of 9.7 months (range 1.8- 18), 9 of 10 patients (90%) achieved a complete response, and 8 of 10 (80%) achieved complete molecular remission by PCR. Estimated overall survival at 12 months was 100%. There are 2 ongoing patients in complete molecular remission at 12 and 15 months post-AUTO3 infusion, respectively. The most common cause of relapse was due to loss of CAR T-cell persistence. The median persistence of CAR-T cells in blood was 170 days.06:29STOK Stoke Therapeutics presents new preclinical data on STK-001 for the treatment of Dravet syndrome (28.98 )Data from studies in non-human primates (NHP) showed STK-001 distributed throughout the brain and achieved target engagement and increased Nav1.1 protein expression throughout the cortex after a single intrathecal injection. Safety findings showed STK-001 to be well-tolerated at the two intrathecal dose levels studied. These data were presented in a poster session at the American Epilepsy Society (AES) Annual Meeting in Baltimore.Stoke plans to submit an investigational new drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in early 2020 and, subject to acceptance of the IND, plans to initiate a Phase 1/2 single-ascending dose study in children and adolescents with Dravet syndrome in the first half of 2020.06:28FATE Fate Therapeutics presents new in vivo preclinical data for FT596 -- company plans to initiate enrollment of first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in rarly 2020 (13.67 )FT596 is the first cellular immunotherapy engineered with three active anti-tumor components to be cleared for clinical investigation by the FDA. In addition to a proprietary CAR targeting CD19, FT596 expresses a novel high-affinity, non-cleavable CD16 (hnCD16) Fc receptor that has been modified to augment antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, enabling coincident targeting of CD19 and additional tumor-associated antigens such as CD20. FT596 also expresses an interleukin-15 receptor fusion (IL-15RF), a potent cytokine complex that promotes survival, proliferation and trans-activation of NK cells and CD8 T cells without the need for systemic cytokine support. Together, these features of FT596 are intended to maximize potency and minimize toxicity in treated patients. The Company plans to initiate enrollment of a first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in early 2020.New preclinical data presented at ASH showed that FT596 administered as a monotherapy exhibited durable tumor clearance and extended survival in vivo similar to primary CAR T cells in a humanized mouse model of CD19+ lymphoma. Additionally, when combined with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab, FT596 showed enhanced killing of CD20+ lymphoma cells in vivo as compared to rituximab alone. These data confirm previously presented in vitro findings that demonstrate the unique multi-antigen targeting functionality of FT596, and the product candidate's potential to effectively overcome CD19 antigen escape.The Company also announced that, in preparation for Phase 1 initiation, it had recently completed GMP production of FT596. In a single small-scale manufacturing campaign, the Company produced over 300 cryopreserved, infusion-ready doses of FT596 at a cost of approximately $2,500 per dose. The Company's iPSC product platform unites stem cell biology and precision genetic engineering to create renewable master engineered iPSC lines that can be repeatedly used to mass produce cancer-fighting immune cells, replacing the high production costs, weeks of manufacturing time, and complex manufacturing processes required for current-generation CAR T-cell immunotherapies with a lower-cost, easier-to-manufacture, well-characterized, off-the-shelf product that has the potential to reach many more patients.06:27SGMO Sangamo Therapeutics and Pfizer (PFE) report updated Phase 1/2 results showing sustained increased Factor VIII activity through 44 weeks (11.66 )Sangamo Therapeutics (SGMO) and Pfizer (PFE) announced updated follow-up results from the Phase 1/2 Alta study evaluating investigational SB-525 gene therapy in patients with severe hemophilia A. The data showed that SB-525 was generally well tolerated and demonstrated sustained increased Factor VIII (FVIII) levels following treatment with SB-525 through to 44 weeks, the extent of follow-up for the longest treated patient in the 3e13 vg/kg dose cohort.06:27KURA Kura Oncology provides clinical and regulatory updates for lead drug candidate, tipifarnib, in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (15.61 )In June 2019, Kura reported that the primary efficacy endpoint was achieved in each of the expansion cohorts in its Phase 2 trial of tipifarnib in relapsed or refractory PTCL: 1) patients with AITL, an aggressive form of T-cell lymphoma often characterized by high levels of CXCL12 expression, and 2) patients with PTCL who lack a single nucleotide variation in the 3'-untranslated region of the CXCL12 gene. Given the high level of activity observed among AITL patients, Kura continued to enroll patients to acquire more experience regarding safety and tolerability in this population. Based upon the 2016 revision of the World Health Organization classification of lymphoid neoplasms1, AITL and AITL-like histologies represent approximately one-third of all PTCL cases.As of the November 11, 2019 data cutoff date, a total of 26 patients with relapsed or refractory AITL were enrolled in all stages of the trial. Among the 20 patients evaluable for efficacy, five achieved a complete response (CR) and five achieved a partial response (PR), for an objective response rate (ORR) of 50% on an evaluable basis and 38% on an intent-to-treat basis. In addition, three patients experienced disease stabilization. Patients had a median of three prior regimens (range 1-7).Next-generation sequencing of 19 available patient biopsies showed that 10 (53%) carried C336R/Q386E variants in the killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) 3DL2, an immune checkpoint receptor. Four of the 10 patients with KIR3DL2 variants achieved a CR and three achieved a PR, for a CR rate of 40% and an ORR of 70%. This compares to a CR rate of 11% and an ORR of 22% among the nine AITL patients with KIR3DL2 wild type.Regulatory Update: Following FDA feedback from an end-of-Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting, Kura plans to initiate a Phase 2 registration-directed trial of tipifarnib in patients with relapsed or refractory AITL and related lymphomas in 2020. The multi-center, single-arm trial will target enrollment of 128 patients with AITL and AITL-like histologies who are relapsed or refractory to at least one prior systemic cytotoxic therapy.06:26PTLA Portola Pharma presents new interim results from ongoing Phase 2a study of cerdulatinib in patients with specific subtypes of T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (29.21 )As of the November 12, 2019 cut-off date, 64 PTCL patients and 40 CTCL patients treated with cerdulatinib as a single agent were evaluable for response. The overall response rate (ORR) was 34% in the PTCL cohort and 43% in the CTCL cohort. Among the subset of patients in the PTCL cohort with AITL, the ORR was 52% and the complete response rate (CR) was 37%.Among the 64 patients in the PTCL cohort, 14 patients (22%) achieved a CR and eight patients (12%) achieved a partial response (PR). In the subgroup of 27 patients with AITL, 10 patients (37%) achieved a CR, and four patients (15%) achieved a PR. The median duration of response is eight months for all PTCL patients and is greater than nine months in AITL patients. Follow-up is ongoing. Among the 40 patients in the CTCL cohort, three patients (8%) achieved a CR and 14 patients (35%) achieved a PR. Importantly, rapid improvements in pruritus, or severe itching -- a common and often serious condition associated with CTCL -- have been observed, as measured by the Likert scale.Cerdulatinib demonstrated good tolerability in both PTCL and CTCL. The most common Grade 3 or greater adverse events across the PTCL and CTCL cohorts with a frequency > 5% were lipase increase (25%), amylase increase (19%), neutropenia (12%), anemia (10%), diarrhea (8%), sepsis/bacteremia (6%), and febrile neutropenia (4%). The lipase and amylase changes were generally asymptomatic and not associated with pancreatitis.06:25XENE Xenon Pharmaceuticals provides updates on partnered neurology pipeline programs (13.95 )Xenon Pharmaceuticals announced that it will provide updates on its partnered epilepsy programs at the American Epilepsy Society Annual Meeting.Overview of clinical stage XEN901 and Related Patient Survey to be Presented in the "Genetic Epilepsies -- Updates in the Science and Diagnosis" on December 8th.Pre-clinical work suggests selective sodium channel inhibitors that reduce action potential firing in excitatory neurons, while sparing inhibitory interneurons, may provide promising drug profile.06:25IMV IMV presents updated results from SPiReL at ASH (2.83 )The poster, which included additional data collected between the abstract submission and the presentation, continued to demonstrate a favorable therapeutic profile and treatment-associated clinical benefit in r/r DLBCL patients who received the DPX-Survivac combination regimen.06:24QURE uniQure presents updated clinical data on three patients treated in ongoing Phase IIb study of etranacogene dezaparvovec; additionally presents up to 4 years of follow-up data on the 10 patients in the Phase I/II trial of AMT-060 (66.05 )At Least One Year of Stable, Therapeutic Levels of FIX Activity in Patients Treated with Etranacogene Dezaparvovec: Featured in a poster presentation at ASH, the 52 weeks of follow-up data show that all three patients have stabilized and sustained FIX activity at therapeutic levels after the one-time administration of etranacogene dezaparvovec. Mean FIX activity for the three patients at 52 weeks after administration was 41% of normal, with the first patient achieving FIX activity of 50% of normal, the second patient achieving FIX activity of 31% of normal and the third patient achieving FIX activity of 41% of normal. The second and third patients had previously screen-failed and were excluded from another gene therapy study due to pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to a different AAV vector. Reported FIX activity was measured using an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay performed at a central laboratory.At one year after dosing, no patient in the study has reported any bleeding events. All patients have remained free of prophylaxis after receiving etranacogene dezaparvovec. One patient, who had earlier in the study undergone hip surgery due to a pre-existing condition, experienced back pain and treated himself with a single infusion of factor replacement, which was later determined by the patient and the investigator to be unrelated to a bleed. No other FIX infusions were reported by any patient.Stable FIX Expression and Durable Reductions in Bleeding and FIX Consumption for up to 4 Years Following AMT-060 Gene Therapy:In the ongoing Phase I/II study of AMT-060, all 10 patients continue to show long-term clinical benefit, including sustained increases in FIX activity, reduced usage of FIX replacement therapy, and decreased bleeding frequency. At up to 4 years of follow-up, AMT-060 continues to be well-tolerated, with no new serious adverse events and no development of inhibitors since the last reported data.All five patients in the second dose cohort of 2x1013 gc/kg (the dose being studied in the ongoing Phase III HOPE-B study of etranacogene dezaparvovec) continue to be free of routine FIX replacement therapy at 3.5 years after treatment. Based on the six months of data collected during the fourth year of follow-up, the mean annualized bleeding rate was zero compared to an average of 4 bleeds during the year prior to treatment, representing a 100% reduction. During this same period, the usage of FIX replacement therapy also declined 100% compared to the year prior to treatment. Mean FIX activity over 3.5 years was 7.5%.06:22FATE Fate Therapeutics reports clinical data from Landmark Phase 1 studies; no dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients (13.67 )Fate Therapeutics announced initial clinical data for its FT516 and FT500 off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived natural killer (NK) cell product candidates.No morphologic evidence of leukemia and complete neutrophil recovery observed in first patient treated with FT516 Monotherapy for AML following first dosing cycleNo dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients treated with FT500 for advanced solid tumorsFavorable FT500 Phase 1 Safety, Tolerability and Immunogenicity profile validates novel multi-dose treatment paradigm for off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived NK cell products.06:22BMY Bristol-Myers presents data from multiple studies evaluating lisocabtagene maraleucel at ASH (59.95 )These studies included an evaluation of liso-cel in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) (TRANSCEND CLL 004); a study in second-line patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients who were ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) (PILOT); and a separate analysis of patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma who received liso-cel in the outpatient setting across three studies."The results in relapsed or refractory CLL and SLL demonstrated a high rate of durable complete responses achieved in heavily pre-treated patients, including patients who have failed ibrutinib and venetoclax. We are encouraged by the potential of liso-cel to treat second-line relapsed or refractory large B-cell NHL patients who are not able to undergo a stem cell transplant. Finally, the analysis evaluating liso-cel administered in the outpatient setting demonstrates that not all patients require hospitalization and that the safety and efficacy profile across a variety of types of clinical sites is consistent."06:20LLY Eli Lilly presents interim clinical data from the LOXO-305 global Phase 1/2 BRUIN dose escalation trial (119.64 )At all doses studied, LOXO-305 delivered objective responses in patients who had received diverse prior therapies and had exhibited varied molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance.Of 16 CLL patients enrolled, there were 10 responders (8 partial responses, 2 partial response with ongoing lymphocytosis) among 13 patients eligible for response assessment, resulting in a 77% ORR. All patients with CLL have demonstrated tumor reduction, with evidence of deepening response over time. Responses were observed in patients with acquired resistance to prior BTK therapy (those with and without C481S mutations), in patients who were intolerant to prior BTK therapy, and in patients with acquired resistance to prior BCL2 therapy (including one with a known BCL G101V mutation). As expected, LOXO-305 treatment causes acute lymphocytosis, which resolves over time -- a well described pharmacodynamic response associated with effective BTK inhibition. Of the three CLL patients not yet eligible for response assessment (one with the BTK C481S mutation), all three have demonstrated lymphocytosis early in cycle 1. All CLL responding patients remain in response, and all CLL patients remain on study. Of eight MCL patients enrolled, there were three responses (1 complete response, 2 partial responses) among six patients eligible for response assessment, resulting in a 50% ORR. Two of the responders had progressed on prior BTK therapy (but without a documented C481x mutation). All MCL responding patients remain in response and on study. Three MCL patients discontinued therapy in cycle 1 due to progressive disease.Most treatment-emergent adverse events were Grade 1 in severity with the most commonly reported events, regardless of attribution, being fatigue (25% total: 21% Grade 1, 4% Grade 2) and diarrhea (18% total: 14% Grade 1, 4% Grade 2). Two adverse events > or =Grade 3 were attributed to LOXO-305 (Grade 3 leukocytosis and Grade 3 transient neutropenia). No dose limiting toxicities were reported and an MTD had not been reached.06:19AZN AstraZeneca reports full results from Phase III ELEVATE TN trial (47.68 )AstraZeneca presented results from the interim analysis of the Phase III ELEVATE TN trial, showing that CALQUENCE (acalabrutinib) combined with obinutuzumab or as monotherapy significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab, a standard chemo-immunotherapy treatment, in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia.In an exploratory analysis, CALQUENCE in combination or alone demonstrated consistent PFS improvements across most pre-specified subgroups of patients with high-risk disease characteristics, including the unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable gene (IGHV), del(11q) and complex karyotype. Overall, the safety and tolerability profile of CALQUENCE observed in the ELEVATE TN trial was consistent with its known profile.06:19BGNE BeiGene presents clinical data from three trials of its BTK inhibitor BRUKINSA at ASH (186.92 )In two oral presentations of BRUKINSA in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), the drug candidate demonstrated consistent safety and a high overall response rate (ORR); in the poster presentation of BRUKINSA combined with BeiGene's investigational anti-PD-1 antibody tislelizumab in patients with previously treated B-cell malignancies, the combination treatment showed preliminary efficacy and was generally well tolerated."The results presented today on BRUKINSA, a BTK inhibitor designed to maximize target occupancy and minimize off-target binding, demonstrated robust clinical activity and a safety profile consistent with what we've observed to date in our clinical trials, including safety data that supported the recent U.S. FDA accelerated approval in patients with previously treated mantle cell lymphoma," said Jane Huang, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, hematology at BeiGene. "CLL or SLL is the most common type of leukemia in adults, and despite the advancements of BTK inhibitor therapy for these cancers, there remains a need for highly selective BTK inhibitors capable of promoting long-term responses, and with a safety profile that is tolerable over time. The results presented here today further demonstrate the potential for BRUKINSA to help people living with these persistent, life-threatening cancers."06:18RCKT Rocket Pharmaceuticals presents "encouraging" preliminary results from its Phase 1 trial of commercial-grade RP-L102 'Process B' for Fanconi Anemia (22.37 )Results presented in the poster highlight preliminary Phase 1 data from two pediatric patients (age 5 and 6 years) who were treated with "Process B" RP-L102 prior to the development of severe bone marrow failure and are in ongoing follow-up. Drug product was successfully manufactured using "Process B" optimization, including transduction enhancers, commercial-grade vector, and modified cell processing. "Process B" drug product is manufactured to commercial grade standards, allowing for consistent drug product across patients and a vector copy number (VCN) two to three fold higher than that administered to optimally-treated "Process A" patients.Once transduced, drug product was infused fresh into patients without any prior conditioning regimen. To evaluate transduction efficiency, an analysis of the proportion of the MMC-resistant colony forming cells was conducted. Both patients exhibited early signs of engraftment based on peripheral blood, VCN and/or MMC-resistance. Preliminary phenotypic correction was also apparent in both patients, as evidenced by stabilization or increases in blood cell lineages. No safety or tolerability issues have been reported.06:18ABBV AbbVie reports new results from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE clinical trial showing the potential of this fixed-duration combination therapy (86.98 )AbbVie announced new data from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE (PCYC-1142) clinical trial, evaluating IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) in combination with VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO (venetoclax) in previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Results showed that patients who received up to 12 cycles of the combination regimen achieved high rates of undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD) in both peripheral blood (PB; 75% of patients) and in bone marrow (BM; 72% of patients). Safety data were consistent with the known safety profiles of IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO used as individual therapies.Results showed uMRD -- defined as less than 1 CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes (MRD<0.01%) by flow cytometry of PB or BM samples -- was achieved at any time after baseline in PB for 75% of patients (122 of 163 patients) and in BM for 72% (111 of 155 patients). The proportion of patients who had uMRD in PB increased over time from 57% after 6 cycles, 68% after 9 cycles, and 73% after 12 cycles of IMBRUVICA plus VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO. The high rates of uMRD in BM were consistent across high-risk subgroups, including in patients with del(17p), del(17p) or TP53 mutation, del(11q), complex karyotype, and unmutated IGHV status. In patients with uMRD in PB with matched BM samples, 93% of patients had uMRD in both PB and BM. With median follow-up of 14.7 months, 3 patients (2%) experienced disease progression.06:17OBSV ObsEva reports positive Phase 3 trial results from PRIMROSE 2 trial of linzagolix for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids (4.57 )The responder rate was 93.9% (p <0.001) for women receiving 200 mg with ABT and 56.7% for women receiving 100 mg without ABT (p <0.001), compared to 29.4% in the placebo group. Both doses achieved significant rates of amenorrhea (p <0.001), reduction in pain (p <0.001), and improvement in quality of life (p <0.001). Additionally, significant improvement (p <0.001) in hemoglobin levels, a reduction in number of days of bleeding and reduction in uterine volume were observed. Furthermore, a significant reduction in fibroid volume was also observed for the 200 mg dose with ABT (p <0.008).The overall safety profile was in line with expectations and confirmed that linzagolix was well-tolerated. The most frequently observed adverse events (occurring in > 5% of patients) were headache, hot flushes, and anemia. Mean percentage change from baseline in BMD was consistent with previous clinical data."We look forward to the results from our second pivotal study, PRIMROSE 1 conducted in the US, in Q2 2020. Assuming positive results, we expect that it would lead to a Marketing Authorization Application submission with the European Medicines Agency by year-end 2020 and a New Drug Application submission with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by Q1 2021."06:16THOR Synthorx to be acquired by Sanofi (SNY) for $68/share in cash (25.03 )Under the terms of the merger agreement, Sanofi will commence a cash tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Synthorx common stock for $68 per share in cash for a total enterprise value of approximately $2.35 billion.

While the DOJ and SEC conduct separate investigations, the same facts have been shared by Ericsson with both authorities. The resolution relates to historical FCPA breaches ending Q1 2017. While the Company had a compliance program and a supporting control framework, they were not adequately implemented. Specifically, certain employees in some markets, some of whom were executives in those markets, acted in bad faith and knowingly failed to implement sufficient controls. They were able to enter into transactions for illegitimate purposes and, together with people under their influence, used sophisticated schemes in order to hide their wrongdoing.Separately, Ericsson agreed to resolve civil charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) relating to allegations of violations of the bribery and accounting provisions of the FCPA. Ericsson agreed to the entry of a judgment enjoining it from future violations of the FCPA and it agreed to pay a financial sanction of $458,380,000, plus pre-judgment interest of $81,540,000.As part of the settlement, Ericsson has agreed to engage an independent compliance monitor for a period of three years while the Company continues to undertake significant reforms to strengthen its Ethics & Compliance program.The combined payment of $1.06 b.

Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD16:19WTRE Watford Holdings agrees to purchase Axeria IARD; terms not disclosed (26.47 +0.25)Axeria IARD is a property and casualty insurance company based in France.

BEIJING CONTROLS CHINESE CITIZENS THROUGH FAMILY, EDUCATION, AND SPEECHStates News ServiceDecember 24, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 617 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for the National Interest (former the Nixon Center):You may have read about China's practice of foot-binding. It's an ancient custom dating back to the supposedly pleasing aesthetic sense of the 10th century.To improve their marriage prospects, women would bind their feet with bandages from an early age to stunt the growth of them.The tradition was damaging to the development of the body, yet was accepted and practiced. Fortunately, the practice has since been condemned and discontinued.But communist China has adopted other methods of suppressing the growth of the individual by attacking three bedrock institutions of society; namely, the family, the school, and free speech.In 1980, communist China announced a "one child" policy to prevent a population "crisis." Chinese families were limited to only one child or faced severe penalties. The punishments included heavy fines, forced sterilizations, forced abortions, or even infanticide.Throughout the 35 years of the one-child policy, there were a recorded 196 million sterilizations and 336 million abortions. (That 336 million figure is greater than the entire population of the United States.)Since 2015, communist China has amended the policy to allow another baby to be born without the Chinese Communist Party intervening. The abortion rate, however, remains above 24.2 for every 1,000 babies born.Communist China also controls the populace through its school system. The Communist Party has complete power over education, so much so that school principals are either members of the party or operate under the direction of a party member.This close monitoring of schools allows communist China to indoctrinate children at a young age into Communist Party propaganda.Lenora Chu, author of "Little Soldiers," writes that Chinese classrooms for grade-school students resemble barracks more than learning centers.The curriculum is so strict that students fear speaking out of line. They "learn" to parrot Chinese Communist Party guidelines as gospel.As if to underscore the point, the founder of a communist grade school in Henan stated in an interview: "Maoist thought is God."Chu says that the government explicitly bans "discussion of democracy, freedom of speech, and past mistakes of the Communist Party." Other bans include Google, Facebook, Instagram, The Wall Street Journal, and The Economist.There seems to be no limits to the censorship. Both "South Park" cartoons and "Winnie the Pooh" children's stories are forbiddenthe former for criticizing the Chinese government; the latter for vaguely resembling President Xi Jinping.Nothing seems to lie outside the Communist Party's grasp. Suppression has become oppression.Yet, in Hong Kong, the people demonstrate.The demonstrations forced the government of Hong Kong to take a full-page advertisement in The Wall Street Journal proclaiming that Hong Kong remains a "free society." It lists nine different freedoms, ranging from freedom of speech and freedom of the press to freedom of religious belief.Hong Kong may comfort itself with ads, and it might comfort others. But the truth is that its freedoms are under serious threat.It's under threat from the communist government in Beijing, which is worried and weak, and whose tools of oppression will not work in Hong Kong the way they worked 30 years ago in Tiananmen Square.Beijing is reduced to hoping that Hong Kongers eventually will tire of their protests. That's a baseless hope, however, because it doesn't recognize the innate desire for freedom that exists within every human being and inspires the brave people of Hong Kong to demonstrate until their city is fully free.Load-Date: December 27, 2019End of Document

CHINESE NATIONAL WHO WORKED AT MONSANTO INDICTED ON ECONOMIC ESPIONAGE CHARGESStates News ServiceNovember 21, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 560 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: ST. LOUIS, Mo. BodyThe following information was released by the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District Of Missouri:Haitao Xiang, 42, formerly of Chesterfield, Missouri, was indicted today by a federal grand jury on one count of conspiracy to commit economic espionage, three counts of economic espionage, one count of conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets, and three counts of theft of trade secrets.According to the indictment, Xiang was employed by Monsanto and its subsidiary, The Climate Corporation, from 2008 to 2017, where he worked as an imaging scientist. Monsanto and The Climate Corporation developed a digital, on-line farming software platform that was used by farmers to collect, store, and visualize critical agricultural field data and increase and improve agricultural productivity for farmers. A critical component to the platform was a proprietary predictive algorithm referred to as the Nutrient Optimizer. Monsanto and The Climate Corporation considered the Nutrient Optimizer a valuable trade secret and their intellectual property."The indictment alleges another example of the Chinese government using Talent Plans to encourage employees to steal intellectual property from their U.S. employers," said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers. "Xiang promoted himself to the Chinese government based on his experience at Monsanto. Within a year of being selected as a Talent Plan recruit, he quit his job, bought a one-way ticket to China, and was caught at the airport with a copy of the company's proprietary algorithm before he could spirit it away.""The revolutionary technology at the core of this case represents both the best of American ingenuity and why the Chinese government is so desperate to steal it for themselves" said Assistant Director John Brown. "The FBI is committed to working with a host of partners to stop individuals, like the defendant in this case, from engaging in economic espionage to acquire information and technology for a foreign government that is either unable or unwilling to compete on a level playing field. Our country's economic security is our national security, and the FBI will always do everything in our power to protect it.""Stealing trade secrets can destroy a business," said Special Agent in Charge Richard Quinn of the FBI St. Louis Division. "When done at the behest of a foreign government, it threatens our nation's economic security because it robs our companies of their market share and competitive advantage."In June 2017, the day after leaving employment with Monsanto and The Climate Corporation, Xiang bought a one-way plane ticket to China. Before he could board his flight, Xiang was intercepted at the airport by federal officials who seized copies on the Nutrient Optimizer.If convicted, each espionage charge carries up to 15 years in prison and a $5,000,000 fine. Each theft of trade secrets charges carries up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.The FBI is investigating this case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Drake and Trial Attorneys Heather Schmidt and Heather Alpino in the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section of the National Security Division are handling this case.An indictment is a formal accusation of criminal conduct, not evidence. A defendant is presumed innocent unless convicted through due process of law.Load-Date: November 22, 2019End of Document

A Future to Expect: International S&T Community Expresses High Hope in Cooperation with Peers in ChinaPR NewswireDecember 5, 2019 Thursday 8:42 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 823 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Dec. 4, 2019 BodyPR Newswire2019 marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People Republic of China.Science and Technology Daily took the chance to interview a group of international leaders in the scientific arena and reviewed China's development history in the area and their personal stories. They also expressed high expectations for future cooperation with China.Scientific and technological development is driving China's growth momentumKazuki Okimura, the principal fellow of JST, spoke highly of the significant improvements of China in his bylined article: "China has built a highly developed transportation network of high-speed railways and highways, whose mileages are ten times than that of Japan today. New airports and ports are springing up everywhere, equipped with the most innovative and smart technologies. China's communications networks and grid system is also among the world's top tier. China is becoming a largest yet most efficient economy in the world's history."Wang Lin, analyst of Clarivate in Asia-Pacific, sorted out the progress of China's basic scientific research from the perspective of global literature data. "Since the 1980s, China has made remarkable achievements in a large number of disciplines. China ranks first in the world in papers in materials science, second in agricultural sciences, chemistry, computer science, engineering, environment and ecology, geosciences, mathematics, and physics. In 2006, China overtook the UK for the first time in the output of scientific papers, ranking second in the world, just behind the U.S."However, China's contribution to the global community through scientific papers is only a tip of the iceberg. How does the global science community see China's development and the source of such momentum?Phil Coates, director of the Polymer Interdisciplinary Research Center at the University of Bradford and professor of the Royal Academy of Engineering, shared his viewpoint in an interview with Science and Technology Daily reporter: that currently, the efforts of supporting scientific research from the Chinese government are there for all to see."Chinese governments, from Beijing to local authorities, all attach great importance to and strongly support scientific and technological development, especially basic discipline research," said Ali Mohammad, an Iranian mathematician at Anhui University who agreed with Professor Coates. "When I talk to different mathematicians around the world, including American mathematicians, they are saying, 'If you wish to do research now, go to China.'""Highly anticipated" -- the common word academia comment on the future cooperation with China (second subtitle)Sir Paul Nath, distinguished British biologist, Nobel Prize laureate, and a foreign academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, told the reporter that science is the common language for the whole human being; international S&T cooperation is not only important to science and technology development but also an essential way to promote friendship between countries.Vialatte Philippe, the head of the science and technology section of the EU Delegation to China, commented, "China is developing at an unprecedented speed in technology innovation." He expects to see more China-Europe cooperation in S&T innovation under the "Horizon Europe" framework in the future."China and France have been highly open and excellent partners in the pharmaceutical industry," said Alain Mérieux, President of Fondation Mérieux. "It is simply wrong for countries to block scientific and technological exchanges for political reasons. France will always play a major role in exchanging with China (in the western community). The two countries will continue to forge win-win cooperation in many key areas, including civil nuclear energy, biology, etc.""The win-win cooperation between Uzbekistan and China in science and technology is benefiting the whole world," said Stanislav Prokopchuk, the reporter from the Uryadovy Kuryer. He added, "Ukraine and China have profound cooperation potentials in basic science and applied technology; we are looking with great expectation for a combined effort in building research and innovation center in the future."Aleksandar Titkov, Head of Science and Education Projects Group at Sputnik News Agency and Radio, commented that the increasing number of jointed projects between higher educational institutions in the two countries would "create more common interests and mutual benefits." Moris Topaz, the renowned Israeli medical expert and recipient of the "China Friendship Award," said, "The medical field is unique in its diversity, which has the great potential for cooperation between Chinese and Israeli counterparts." View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/a-future-to-expect-international-st-community-expresses-high-hope-in-cooperation-with-peers-in-china-300970021.htmlSOURCE Science and Technology DailyCONTACT: Fang Linlin, +86-139-1199-5172, fangll@staily.comLoad-Date: December 6, 2019End of Document

CRB-402 is a two-part Phase 1 study of bb21217 in adults with R/RMM with a projected final enrollment of 74 patients. The dose escalation part of CRB-402 is complete, and the dose expansion part of the study is ongoing.As of the data cutoff, the adverse events observed with bb21217 were consistent with known toxicities of CAR T therapies, regardless of dose level. Of the 38 treated patients, the most common Grade 3/4 toxicities include neutropenia (82%), leukopenia (55%), thrombocytopenia (55%), anemia (50%), lymphopenia (34%), hypophosphatemia (21%), hyponatremia (13%), and febrile neutropenia (11%). Grade 3/4 infections were reported in seven patients (18%). Twenty-five of 38 patients (66%) developed bb21217-related cytokine release syndrome (CRS); 12 Grade 1, 11 Grade 2, one Grade 3 and one Grade 5 (death). The fatal CRS event occurred at the 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells dose level, after 15 days of follow-up. Nine of 38 (24%) patients developed neurotoxicity; three Grade 1, three Grade 2, two Grade 3 (one with vertigo/dizziness and one with encephalopathy) and one Grade 4 (encephalopathy, previously reported). For the one patient previously reported with Grade 4 neurotoxicity, Grade 3 CRS was also reported, and both have resolved.As of the data cutoff, 33 of the 38 patients were evaluable for clinical response as defined per the International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria for multiple myeloma.Twelve patients were evaluable in the 150 x 106 CAR+ T cells cohort, with a median follow-up of 17.6 months. Ten of 12 evaluable patients in the 150 x 106 CAR+ T cells cohort demonstrated clinical response, including four with a stringent complete response (sCR) or complete response (CR), and six with a very good partial response (VGPR). Among the ten confirmed responders, the median duration of response was 11.1 months. As of the data cutoff, follow-up within the two higher dose cohorts remains early, and none of the confirmed responders have experienced disease progression. In the 300 x 106 CAR+ T cells cohort, 14 patients were evaluable for response, and six of the 14 evaluable patients demonstrated clinical response, including four with a VGPR and two with a partial response (PR), with a median follow-up of four months. In the 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells cohort, seven patients were evaluable for response, and four of the seven evaluable patients demonstrated clinical response, including one with a sCR, two with a VGPR, and one with a PR, with a median follow-up of 3.3 months.18:06EDIT Editas Medicine reports in vivo proof-of-concept data for EDIT-301 at ASH (30.32 -0.60)Editas Medicine today announced in vivo proof-of-concept data supporting the development of EDIT-301 as a potentially best-in-class, durable medicine to treat sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. EDIT-301 is the first experimental medicine in development using Cas12a (formerly known as Cpf1).In this study, when EDIT-301 was infused into NBSGW mice, HbF levels in human red blood cells were increased by approximately 50 percentage points above background at 16 weeks post-engraftment with pancellular distribution and no lineage skewing. These elevated HbF levels were observed after editing with Cas12a which created an editing profile that enriched genomic changes that favored high and persistent HbF levels.17:53NLY Annaly Capital Mgmt appoints Serena Wolfe as CFO, effective December 9 (9.43 +0.03)Glenn Votek, the company's CFO and interim CEO and President, has stepped down from his role as CFO. Mr. Votek will continue to serve as interim CEO and President and as a member of the Company's Board of Directors.Ms. Wolfe most recently served as a Partner at Ernst & Young since 2011 and as its Central Region Real Estate Hospitality & Construction leader from 2017 to November 2019.17:50SUPN Supernus Pharma provides update on results from first Phase III study of SPN-810 for treatment of Impulsive Aggression in patients with ADHD (22.69 -0.14)In early November 2019, the company reported top-line results from the Phase III P301 trial in patients 6 to 11 years. The study was a placebo controlled, parallel group clinical trial in patients diagnosed with ADHD. Patients receiving SPN-810 36 mg showed a median percent reduction of 58.6% in the average weekly frequency of impulsive aggression (IA) episodes from baseline that was not statistically significant (p=0.092) compared to placebo. These results are based on the combined analysis of data from stages 1 and 2 in the study. In stage 1 (interim analysis stage), the median percent reduction was 60.0%, which was statistically significant (p=0.029) compared to placebo. However, in stage 2 of the P301 study, post the interim analysis, the increase in variability in the 36 mg treatment arm seems to have adversely impacted the results in the combined analysis.After conducting further analysis on the P301 data, the company believes that the high variability in the 36 mg treatment arm was primarily due to 6 patients out of 135 that had a mild IA condition with a baseline score of 6 episodes or less per week. In the placebo arm, there were 7 patients with the same mild IA condition. By excluding these subjects from the placebo and the 36 mg treatment arm, the primary analysis (combined stage 1 and 2 data) of the P301 data on the primary endpoint results in a p value of 0.017 for the treatment arm compared to placebo. This positive result is also confirmed by the sensitivity analysis on the primary endpoint with a p value of 0.044.The company plans on finalizing the statistical plan (SAP) for the second Phase III P302 study in patients 6 to 11 years old taking into consideration the exclusion of patients with 6 or less episodes of IA per week. The Company will be submitting the SAP to the FDA and expects data from the P302 study in the first quarter of 2020.17:44VAC Marriot Vacations raises quarterly cash dividend to $0.54/share from $0.45/share (123.66 -0.18)17:28EPRT Essential Properties Realty Trust increases quarterly cash dividend to $0.23/share from $0.22/share (25.83 -0.08)17:26BMY Bristol-Myers and Acceleron (XLRN) announce presentations of Reblozyl data at ASH (61.28 +1.33)Bristol-Myers Squibb and Acceleron Pharma announced that data evaluating the erythroid maturation agent (EMA) Reblozyl (luspatercept-aamt) in patients with anemia associated with a range of serious and rare blood diseases were presented at the 2019 ASH Annual Meeting. Data from investigational uses of luspatercept-aamt included the initial results from a phase 2 study in myelofibrosis-associated anemia; initial results "showed promising clinical activity." As a result of the phase 2 study, the companies plan to initiate a pivotal, phase 3 study called INDEPENDENCE in 2020 in patients with myelofibrosis-associated anemia who are being treated with JAK inhibitor therapy and who require RBC transfusions. Presentations also included updated results from two pivotal phase 3 studies presented at last year's ASH meeting -- the MEDALIST study and the BELIEVE study.17:21TRWH Twin River Worldwide appoints Soohyung Kim as Board Chairy (23.60 -0.28)John E.

Through this approach, Raney supplies wall panels, roof trusses, roof decking, interior wall framing, and other select building materials and then partners with sub-contractors to install these products in approximately three thousand homes per year to its production builder customers across Florida. Raney has annual revenue of approx. $140 mln.17:17JNJ Johnson & Johnson's Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies announce overall survival results from Phase 3 ALCYONE study (140.50 +0.12)Overall survival (OS) results from the Phase 3 ALCYONE study showed that the addition of Darzalex (daratumumab) to bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone (D-VMP) improved OS in patients with newly diagnosed, transplant-ineligible multiple myeloma, with a 40% reduction in the risk of death compared to VMP alone. These updated data from the ALCYONE study also demonstrated that the addition of daratumumab to VMP resulted in higher rates of minimal residual disease negativity. These data are the first OS results from the ALCYONE study and are being featured during an oral session at the 2019 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting. The data were simultaneously published in The Lancet.The most common Grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurring in at least 3% for daratumumab-VMP compared to the VMP arm were neutropenia (40.2% vs. 39%), thrombocytopenia (34.7% vs. 37.9%), anemia (17.3% vs. 19.8%) and pneumonia (13% vs. 4.2%).

The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.4%, the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.4%, and the Russell 2000 declined 0.3%.The lack of conviction was understandable considering that there was no reported progress on the U.S.-China trade front ahead of the Dec. 15 tariffs, which would presumably upset the market if they went into effect without a Phase One deal. There is still some time left this week to strike a deal, but the trade uncertainty helped keep risk sentiment in check.Losses were made most prevalent in the S&P 500 health care (-0.7%), utilities (-0.5%), and information technology (-0.5%) sectors. The latter was pressured by Apple (AAPL 266.92, -3.79, -1.4%), which pulled back from record territory. Conversely, the consumer staples (+0.2%), real estate (+0.1%), and consumer discretionary (+0.1%) sectors finished higher.Other key events this week will include policy decisions from both the Fed and ECB, a UK election, and reports on consumer prices and retail sales for November. Strikingly, the CBOE Volatility Index spiked 16.5% to 15.86, as demand for downside protection increased in anticipation for any disappoints.Corporate news didn't move the needle, but M&A activity and analyst recommendations did contribute to some notable stock reactions.In the biotech space, ArQule (ARQL 19.71, +10.04, +103.9%) agreed to be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.72, -0.13, -0.2%) for about $2.7 billion in cash.

The first session of the week was very quiet, and it followed an overnight affair that was just as subdued. Economic data received overnight painted a mixed picture, as China reported a smaller than expected trade surplus for November (actual $38.73 bln; expected $46.30 bln) while Japan's Q3 GDP growth was revised up to 0.4% from 0.1%. Treasuries started the cash session with modest gains, climbing toward their intraday highs from Friday shortly after the open. However, the rest of the session saw a slow return to today's opening levels. The U.S. Treasury sold $38 bln in 3-yr notes to solid demand, as the high yield stopped through the when issued yield by 0.2 bps while the bid-to-cover ratio and indirect takedown were above average. The U.S. Dollar Index faced some morning pressure but returned to little changed as the day went on, reclaiming its 200-day moving average (97.65) in the process. Yield Check: 2-yr: -1 bp to 1.62% 3-yr: -1 bp to 1.64% 5-yr: UNCH at 1.67% 10-yr: -1 bp to 1.83% 30-yr: -2 bps to 2.26%News: The House of Representatives could vote on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on December 18, according to CNBC. The Bank for International Settlements published its latest quarterly review, which noted that structural issues rather than temporary factors were responsible for the mid-September shortage in the funding market that prompted the Fed to begin conducting daily reverse repurchases. The BIS added that liquidity demand from hedge funds exacerbated the funding stress. Financial Times reported that the Chinese government has ordered the removal of all foreign computer equipment and software from government offices. The Bank of Japan will reportedly lower its assessment of industrial production due to prolonged weakness. Former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker died on Sunday. China's November trade surplus totaled $38.73 bln (expected $46.30 bln; last $43.02 bln). Exports fell 1.1% yr/yr (expected 1.0%; last -0.8%) while imports rose 0.3% yr/yr (expected -1.8%; last -6.2%). Japan's Q3 GDP rose 0.4% qtr/qtr (expected 0.2%; last 0.1%), growing 1.8% yr/yr (expected 0.7%; last 0.2%). The latest set of election polls from the U.K. suggest that Conservatives will win majority on Thursday with a margin between 9 and 15 percentage points. Eurozone's December Sentix Investor Confidence rose to 0.7 from -4.5 (expected -4.9). Germany's October trade surplus totaled EUR20.60 bln (expected surplus of EUR19.00 bln; last surplus of EUR19.20 bln).

IMGN632 displays a well tolerated safety profile and activity at doses up to and including 0.09 mg/kg per cycle. The most common treatment-related adverse event was infusion-related reactions (24% all grades, 8% grade 3); none required IMGN632 discontinuation. Single dose-limiting toxicities were seen at the highest dose levels tested (0.18-0.45 mg/kg): three reversible cases of veno-occlusive disease and one prolonged neutropenia; no patterns of hepatotoxicity or cytopenias occurred with doses below 0.18 mg/kg. Although no maximum tolerated dose was determined on either schedule, based on the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic data generated, the dose and schedule of 0.045 mg/kg given on day 1 every 3 weeks has been selected as the monotherapy recommended Phase 2 dose. AML Efficacy Across all dose levels and both schedules, of the patients assessable for efficacy (n=71), 38 (54%) had a reduction in bone marrow blasts and 13 (18%) achieved an objective response, including 2 complete remissions (CR) and 10 with incomplete recovery (CRi) and one morphologic leukemia free state (MLFS) in heavily pretreated patients. The vast majority of these responders (92%) had failed prior intensive therapies, including 3 with prior transplant, 69% had failed 2-3 prior lines of therapy, and 54% had an adverse risk classification. At the dose and schedule selected as the recommended Phase 2 dose (0.045 mg/kg Q3W), a 40% response rate was seen in relapsed and refractory patients with de novo AML, including 1 CR, 4 CRi, and 1 MLFS (with subsequent conversion to CRi). BPDCN Efficacy 3 of 9 (33%) evaluable relapsed/refractory BPDCN patients achieved a response after a 1-2 doses of 0.045 mg/kg IMGN632 (1 CR, 1 CRi, and 1 partial remission); all three patients had received prior SL-401 (tagraxofusp-erzs), two had received intense multi-agent chemotherapy, and one had prior stem cell transplant.14:49GILD Gilead Sciences & CIBMTR announce findings from ongoing post-marketing study evaluating safety and efficacy of Yescarta in adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (67.79 +0.71)In this analysis, efficacy and safety of Yescarta were comparable to that observed in the ZUMA-1 trial, despite a larger proportion of older, more difficult-to-treat patients in the real-world setting. The findings were presented today at the 61st American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting & Exposition, held in Orlando from December 7--10, 2019.14:48NVS Novartis AG Kymriah demonstrates consistent efficacy and safety outcomes in US patients when used in real-world setting (92.60 +0.53)Efficacy in DLBCL confirmed results seen in the pivotal trial despite treatment of a broader population, including older and more heavily pretreated patients.Fewer known CAR-T cell therapy adverse events for patients with DLBCL, specifically rates of high-grade cytokine release syndrome (4%) and neurologic events (5%), were observed compared with the pivotal clinical trials.In children and young adults with ALL, efficacy outcomes were similar and safety outcomes appear to be more favorable compared to the pivotal trial.14:48GMDA Gamida Cell announces updated results from Phase 1 clinical study of GDA-201 (4.75 -0.35)The co announced updated results from a Phase 1 clinical study of GDA-201, an investigational, natural killer (NK) cell-based cancer immunotherapy for the treatment of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM), at the 61st Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH), which is being held December 7--10 in Orlando, FL. Data from 22 patients in the ongoing study showed GDA-201 in combination with monoclonal antibodies was generally well tolerated and demonstrated early evidence of clinical activity in heavily pre-treated patients, including five complete responses observed among nine patients with NHL. Gamida Cell plans to initiate a Phase 1/2 multi-dose, multi-center study of GDA-201 in patients with NHL in 2020.14:46GILD Gilead Sciences announces primary results from ZUMA-2 -- 93% of patients treated with Investigational KTE-X19 achieved response, including 67% with a complete response (67.30 +0.22)The co announced primary results from ZUMA-2, a global, multicenter, single-arm, open-label Phase 2 study of KTE-X19, an investigational CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, in adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). After a single infusion of KTE-X19, the best objective response via independent radiologic central review (n=60 evaluable for efficacy analysis) was 93 percent, with 67 percent of patients having achieved a complete response. These findings were presented today at the 61st American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting & Exposition, in Orlando from December 7--10, 2019.With a median follow-up of 12.3 months (range: 7.0 to 32.3 months) at the time of data cutoff, 57 percent of patients remained in an ongoing response. Of the first 28 patients treated (minimum follow-up of 24 months), 43 percent were alive and remained in continued remission without additional therapy. The 12-month estimates of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 61 percent and 83 percent, respectively. Median duration of response, PFS and OS were not yet reached. Among the 68 patients evaluable for safety, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events were observed in 91 percent and 63 percent of patients, respectively. Grade 3 or higher CRS and neurologic events were seen in 15 percent and 31 percent of patients, respectively. No Grade 5 CRS or neurologic events occurred.14:42TALKX Market Briefing: Buyers a reluctant bunchThere has been a steady deterioration in the major indices since about 10:15 a.m. ET. The downward trend hasn't been sparked by any specific news catalyst; rather, it is largely a case of absent buyers today, which is making it easier to pressure prices lower.Their reluctance to push things further is understandable given how far things have been pushed already and given that the world is on the cusp of learning if the U.S. is going to implement a tariff on a $160 billion tranche of imported Chinese goods on December 15.Should that tariff be implemented, it is thought that the stock market would not react well. Accordingly, given how far the market has come, the near-term risk-reward dynamic is seen as being skewed to the risk side of things at the moment. Strikingly, the CBOE Volatility Index is up 11.7% to 15.21.Apple (AAPL 267.28, -3.43, -1.3%), which was up 20.9% since the end of September, is an influential laggard today.The consumer staples (+0.2%), consumer discretionary (+0.2% 0, and rel estate (+0.1%) sectors are the only sectors trading higher.

Co, "with all major wildfire claims now on a path to be resolved and the total amount of wildfire liabilities determined," will now amend and finalize that plan. At two-month highs.AM (5.15 +14.8%): Announced that it will repurchase $100 mln of shares from Antero Resources (AR). Additionally, co and AR have agreed to a growth incentive fee program. Due to additional optimization of the midstream infrastructure buildout, co is now targeting a 2020 capital program of approx. $300-325 mln, a 22% reduction vs the previous target. Co targets net debt to adj. EBITDA in the mid-to-high 3-times range in 2020.Mid Cap LosersKOS (5.24 -13.25%): The stock, trading with above 3x average volume, sank to eleven-month lows early in the session, though it has since moderated those losses. In sector news, shares of Tullow Oil (TUWLF) plummeted overseas after that company, among other updates, including the announcement of the departures of its CEO and its Exploration Director, reset its forward-looking guidance, now forecasting 2020 Group production to average between 70,000-80,000 bpd, and noted that production performance has been significantly below expectations at the TEN and Jubilee fields in Ghana. Co is also active in Ghana and is a partner in production at the TEN and Jubilee fields. BPMC (71.18 -9.3%): Announced initial data from the Phase 2 PIONEER trial of avapritinib in patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis; initial data from the dose-finding Part 1 of the trial showed "rapid and robust reductions in serum tryptase" in patients treated with 25, 50, or 100 mg of avapritinib once daily. All doses of avapritinib tested were well-tolerated; there was one Grade 3 cognitive effect reported in the 100 mg cohort, and the event was resolved following dose modification. Co announced top-line results from the EXPLORER trial; among other results, top-line efficacy data as of a data cutoff of August 30 showed a centrally confirmed ORR of 77% in 48 patients evaluable for response. Top-line safety results were generally consistent with previously reported data. After the data cutoff, one patient with SM and an associated hematologic neoplasm of myelodysplastic syndrome had a Grade 5 intracranial bleed. PGNY (27.81 -8.79%): Continued volatility.14:23MDB MongoDB will report third quarter results this afternoon (131.32 +0.15)MongoDB (MDB) will report fiscal 2020 third quarter (October) results this afternoon, and management will host a call at 17:00.MongoDB is the leading non-relational (or NoSQL) database platform that is heralded by developers. The next-generation database company's freemium "land and expand" business model has led to explosive growth.The company has beaten estimates and guided revenue above consensus in each of its first eight quarterly reports as a public company since its IPO in October 2017.Management guided for a third quarter adjusted net loss of $0.29-0.27/share with revenue up 52% to $98-100.Revenue growth is expected to slow to 24% in the fourth quarter given increasingly difficult comparisons after revenue grew 85% in the fourth quarter last year. MongoDB has guided for a fiscal 2020 adjusted net loss of $1.11-1.06/share with revenue up ~48% to $390-395 mln.Last quarter, revenue grew 67% while total customers grew ~6% sequentially and 103% yr/yr to over 15,000. MongoDB Atlas, the company's managed cloud database-as-a-service offering, grew customers 7% sequentially and 149% yr/yr to over 13,200. Atlas revenue was up over 240% yr/yr and represented 37% of total revenue for the quarter, which does weigh on gross margins.The stock fell in response to earnings despite strong results as the 20x forward revenue multiple seemed to have already priced in the company's strong position.The $7.3 bln valuation now represents ~17x forward revenue estimates. The stock has consolidated for the last six months and is currently attempting to hold the 50-DMA.14:09SUMRX Earnings Out This Afternoon/Tomorrow MorningThis Afternoon: CDMO CASY CHWY ROAD MDB PHR SFIX TOL MTNTomorrow Morning: AZO CMD CONN DBI HDS14:00SCANX Large cap notable movers of interest -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable large cap movers of interest ($10 bln - $200 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Large Cap GainersZM (66.33 +5.72%): Shares display relative strength as they bounce back from last week's 16% slide.

(24.27 -0.67)Chewy (CHWY) is set to report Q3 earnings tonight after the close with a conference call set for 5pmET.Current Capital IQ consensus stands at a loss of ($0.13) per share on revenues of $1.20 bln.GuidanceQ3 revenues in the range of $1.19-1.21 bln.2020 revenues in the range of $4,75-4.80 bln. 2020 EBITDA Margin improvement in the range of 420-450 bps.The StoryShares of CHWY fell to post-IPO lows following the release of Q2 results. CHWY outpaced revenue expectations as revenue growth was 43% (49% in autoship). The issue was the shortfall on the bottom line as it missed EPS consensus for the second straight quarter. Higher than expected SG&A costs in Q2 were one of the reasons why the stock sold off post Q2 results. Some of the increase was driven by non-recurring items like fulfillment center build outs and public company costs. Operating Expenses increased 55% yr/yr compared to the 43% top line growth. CHWY was able to improve gross margins by 300 bps, EBITDA margins increased 410 bps yr/yr. However this only led to a small increase to the low end of its EBITDA outlook.The good news is investor expectations around earnings has been dampened which leaves upside surprise potential for this evening. Two pedestrian quarters with bottom line misses and a cautious note from Cleveland Research saying sales were tracking 'softer' than expected has reigned in the outlook. The company's float stands at 44 mln shares and 32% of this is short interest which leaves it susceptible to a squeeze. Trader's need to be aware that the lock up expiration looms on December 11. Parent company PetSmart owns approx 67% of the shares with hedge funds owning approx 20%. Shares of CHWY opened at $36 on June 14 but have been on a downward trend since opening up for trade. Shares hit a post-IPO low of $21.68 on November 11. Since then it has been able to recover approx 10% to rally into its 50-sma ($24.36) ahead of tonight's print. CHWY will need to surprise to the upside, particularly on its cost management side, in order to shake out some of the shorts. But that lock up expiration lingers, similat to what we saw at Crowdsrike (CRWD) which will make it tough to squeeze.Q2 RecapReported Q2 (Jul) loss of $0.21 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.11 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.10). Revenues rose 43.1% year/year to $1.15 bln vs the $1.13 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Gross margin of 23.6 percent expanded 300 basis points year-over-year and in line with expectations. Net loss of $82.9 million, including a non-cash share-based compensation charge of $43.8 million.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is unchanged.December 15 is fast approaching, and the market is hoping that the U.S. and China can reach a deal to possibly delay the tariffs scheduled to hit that day. Scattered throughout this week will be policy decisions from the Fed and ECB, as well as reports on consumer inflation and retail sales for November.In the meantime, it's been tough for the market to gain any traction amid the losses in Apple (AAPL 265.26, -5.44, -2.0%) and the S&P 500 health care sector (-0.5%). Conversely, the S&P 500 communication services (+0.3%) and consumer discretionary (+0.3%) sectors have provided some support.M&A activity seen some huge premiums, especially in the biotech space. ArQule (ARQL 19.70, +10.04, +103.4%) will be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for about $2.7 billion. Synthorx (THOR 67.66, +42.63, +170.3%) will be acquired by French company Sanofi (SNY 45.35, -0.68, -1.5%) for about $2.4 billion.

At all-time highs. ARQL (19.7 +103.83%): To be acquired by Merck (MRK) for a premium $20/share in cash, representing an approximate total equity value of approx. $2.7 bln; Merck sees co's assets strengthening Merck's pipeline, most notably co's ARQ 531, which Merck names as "a compelling candidate for the treatment of B-cell malignancies." Co also today announced final Phase 1 clinical results for ARQ 531 in patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies; ARQ 531 reportedly demonstrated substantial anti-tumor activity and a manageable safety profile, and the data set "confirms the potential utility of ARQ 531 for the treatment of [...] heavily pretreated CLL patients," according to co's management. At multi-year highs. FTSV (26.48 +83.38%): Presented updated magrolimab clinical data in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. In higher-risk MDS, the ORR was 92%, including a complete response rate of 50%, while in untreated AML, the ORR was 64%, among other data. Co, with FDA guidance, has developed a protocol that will allow it "two distinct opportunities to achieve an accelerated approval" while remaining on-track to file an initial BLA in Q4 of 2021. Also announced preclinical proof-of-concept data for its novel all antibody conditioning regimen, comprised of FSI-174 and magrolimab, for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Reaches new all-time highs.Small Cap LosersDTIL (10.21 -48.07%): After spiking to record highs early in the session, the stock now gives up the majority of a substantial run higher that it had netted since mid-November. The volatility follows co's announcement of updated interim clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1 trial of PBCAR0191, its lead investigational allogeneic CAR T cell therapy candidate. Of nine patients treated with PBCAR0191, seven had objective evidence of tumor shrinkage at any timepoint. In the R/R non-Hodgkin lymphoma cohort, four of six patients achieved an objective response at day 28+, including three partial responses (two patients treated at Dose Level 1 and one at DL2) and one complete response (treated at DL2); the remaining two NHL patients achieved early responses at day 14 -- both patients had evidence of disease progression at day 28. In the B-ALL cohort treated at DL2, one of three patients achieved a complete response at day 28+; the remaining two patients did not respond at day 28. The trial is ongoing; treatment of patients at a third dose level recently commenced.DPLO (3.95 -32.1%): Agreed to be acquired by UnitedHealth's (UNH) OptumRx for $4.00/share through a cash tender offer, following a careful review of strategic options by co's Board of Directors. The stock had established new record lows below $3 in mid-November following co's issuance of Q3 results, at which time co's pursuit of a comprehensive strategic alternatives process remained ongoing; by Friday's close, the stock had improved by circa +139% from those lows. TVTY (19.7 -13%): Pulls back to multi-week lows on above average volume after disclosing that the employment relationship between co and its COO, Dawn M. Zier, has been mutually terminated and that co has entered into a Separation and Release Agreement with Ms. Zier that provides that she will receive those payments and benefits that she is entitled to under her employment agreement in respect of a termination without cause.

That outperformance is remarkable because it flies in the face of Goldman Sachs downgrading the stock to Sell from Neutral and slashing its price target to $12 from $17.Strikingly, Macy's has already exceeded its average daily volume less than two hours into the trading session. That heavy volume and the positive turn in the stock on a seemingly negative development are likely byproducts of the following factors:Investor belief that the Goldman Sachs analyst isn't breaking any new ground with the basis for the downgrade (secular headwinds weighing on comps and profitability). Shares of M were down 49% for the year before today's downgrade.Short-covering activity, which is often triggered when a beaten-up stock makes a counter-intuitive move.Momentum trading as speculators see an opportunity to force a short squeeze.Macy's is the picture of a tax-loss selling candidate, but the flip side of that understanding is that many tax-loss selling candidates are seen as good, bargain-hunting opportunities after the tax-loss selling is complete. The stock's resilience to selling interest today is apt to be helping its candidacy as a short-term, speculative rebound play.11:09TALKX Market Briefing: A mixed state of affairsThe stock market is mixed, and little changed, in today's early action. Buyers have reined in their efforts after Friday's post-employment report rally and ahead of a batch of key macro developments that will unfold this week, the most notable of which is the possible implementation of tariffs on Sunday of ~$160 billion worth of imported goods from China, most of which are consumer-oriented goods.Tucked in between will be the FOMC meeting, the ECB meeting, the UK election, and CPI and Retail Sales reports for November.Today, then, has the markings thus far of a wait-and-see day, yet the underlying bullish bias can still be described as bullish given the overall lack of selling interest with the market sitting close to an all-time high.The consumer discretionary sector (+0.3%), led by Amazon.com (AMZN 1758.58, +6.98, +0.4%), is today's bet-performing sector followed by the communication services sector (+0.2%), which is led by Alphabet (GOOG 1350.61, +9.99, +0.8%) and Facebook (FB 202.50, +1.45, +0.7%).Six sectors are up and five sectors are down in a reflection of the mixed state of things, which is also reflected in the recognition that the biggest sector winner is up just 0.3% while the biggest sector loser (industrials) is down just 0.2%.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.05%; the S&P 500 is flat; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000 are both down 0.1%.11:03APRE Aprea Therapeutics presents results from US and French Phase Ib/II clinical trials of APR-246 and azacitidine at ASH (29.62 +3.57)The trials evaluate the safety and efficacy of APR-246 in combination with azacitidine (AZA) for the treatment of TP53 mutated MDS and AML.U.S. Phase Ib/II clinical trial in patients with TP53 Mutant Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML):As of the data cutoff, the overall response rate (ORR) in 33 evaluable MDS patients was 88%, with a 61% complete remission (CR) rate, by International Working Group (IWG) criteria. With a median duration of follow-up of 10.8 months, the median duration of response was 8.4 months and the median duration of CR was 7.3 months. Seventeen (52%) evaluable MDS patients discontinued therapy to pursue stem cell transplant. Median overall survival (OS) for all enrolled patients (n=55) was 10.8 months. Median OS in responding patients versus non-responders was 13.7 vs. 3.9 months. Adverse events, regardless of causality, were mostly grade 1/2. Grade 3+ adverse events occurring in > or =20% of patients were limited to cytopenias and infection, consistent with underlying hematopoietic malignancies, and no exacerbation of the expected AZA-related safety profile has been observed.French Phase Ib/II clinical trial in MDS and AML:As of the data cutoff, the ORR in 24 evaluable MDS patients was 74%, with a 66% CR rate, based on IWG criteria. With a median duration of follow-up of 6.4 months, the median OS for all enrolled patients (n=53) had not been reached. In addition, all responding patients were alive at data cutoff. Relative to baseline, mutant TP53 variant allele frequency was significantly decreased in responding patients and undetectable in all patients who achieved a CR.10:44FTSV Forty Seven announces presentation of foundational preclinical data supporting development of FSI-174 in combination with magrolimab as novel all antibody conditioning regimen for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (24.81 +10.37)Forty Seven today announced preclinical proof-of-concept data for its novel all antibody conditioning regimen, comprised of FSI-174, its anti-cKIT antibody, and magrolimab, its anti-CD47 antibody. Preclinical studies in a non-human primate (NHP) model showed that the combination of FSI-174 and magrolimab significantly depleted hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from the bone marrow, with no dose limiting toxicities. The data will be presented in a poster session at the 61st American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.In the preclinical data presented at ASH, FSI-174 demonstrated binding affinity to both human and NHP cKIT receptors, and induced phagocytosis as well as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, FSI-174 was well-tolerated when administered to NHPs as a single agent, with no dose-limiting toxicities. The no-observed-adverse-effect level was established at 50 mg/kg, the highest dose tested. When administered together, FSI-174 and magrolimab demonstrated a synergistic benefit, promoting the highest level of phagocytosis of cKIT expressing target cells and inducing significant HSC depletion nine days after infusion compared to placebo.Forty Seven expects to complete investigational new drug-enabling studies by the end of 2019, and subject to approval of the IND by the FDA, plans to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating FSI-174 in healthy volunteers in the first quarter of 2020.10:39MRK Merck and Seven and Eight BioPharmaceuticals sign clinical research collaboration agreement (88.59 -0.26)Seven and Eight BioPharmaceuticals has signed a clinical research collaboration agreement with Merck, through a subsidiary, to explore the combination of Seven and Eight's BDB001, an immune modulator targeting toll-like receptors (TLR) 7 and 8, and Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), in treating patients with advanced solid tumors. Under the terms of the agreement, Seven and Eight will sponsor and be responsible for the conduct of the clinical study.10:36ATRA Atara Biotherapeutics reports updated long-term clinical results from multicenter Expanded Access Protocol study of tab-cel for patients with EBV+ PTLD (14.72 +0.73)Atara Biotherapeutics presented long-term clinical results from a multicenter Expanded Access Protocol (EAP) study of tab-cel (tabelecleucel) for patients with Epstein-Barr virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (EBV+ PTLD) at the ASH Annual Meeting & Exposition. Results from this analysis demonstrate a high overall response rate, short time to response, and favorable estimated long-term overall survival rates for tab-cel in patients with EBV+ PTLD following hematopoietic cell transplant or solid organ transplant who have failed rituximab-based therapy. Tab-cel was generally well-tolerated in all patients with EBV+ PTLD and other EBV-associated diseases.Safety analyses were presented for all patients treated with tab-cel (n=61; n=26 EBV+ PTLD and n=35 patients with other EBV-associated diseases). Consistent with prior studies, tab-cel was generally well-tolerated in all patients, and no tab-cel related adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred. Three graft versus host disease adverse events were reported, all in patients with prior allogeneic HCT. No other adverse events of special interest including cytokine release syndrome were reported.Median time to response of one month was seen in both EBV+ PTLD patient cohorts. In responders, two-year estimated overall survival rate was 86% for HCT (n=7) and 100% for SOT (n=10) with no patient deaths attributable to PTLD progression. Similar outcomes were observed in the EAP-201 subgroup of EBV+ PTLD patients (n=22) with adequate ECOG performance status, no CNS disease and no PLTD-related ventilatory support who would have likely met the eligibility criteria for Atara's ongoing tab-cel Phase 3 studies. Overall response rate was 55% and 82%, with a two-year estimated overall survival of 79% and 81%, in the HCT (n=11) and SOT (n=11) cohorts, respectively.10:32ACHN Achillion Pharma reports "positive" data from Phase 2 dose-finding study of danicopan at ASH (6.19 +0.02)Achillion Pharma today reported top-line data from a dose-finding Phase 2 trial assessing the safety and effectiveness of its oral small molecule factor D inhibitor danicopan (ACH-4471) in combination with intravenous eculizumab in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) patients who have an inadequate response to C5 monotherapy.The primary endpoint of the trial was an increase in hemoglobin from baseline. A mean increase of 2.4 g/dL at 24 weeks of treatment was achieved in this proof-of-concept trial. Danicopan, in combination with eculizumab, resulted in a significant reduction in blood transfusions with 10 patients receiving 34 transfusions (58 units) in the 6 months prior to screening to 1 patient receiving 1 transfusion (2 units) during the 24-week trial.In addition to improvements in hemoglobin and transfusions, there were also meaningful improvements in markers of hemolysis including bilirubin, reticulocytes, and PNH red blood clone size (%).In this clinical trial, danicopan was generally well tolerated. All treatment emergent adverse events were considered mild to moderate in severity except for Grade 3 severe adverse events that occurred in two patients. Both patients had resolution of their events, remained on danicopan, and completed the study.The company plans to initiate a global Phase 3 trial in early 2020.10:28NKTR Nektar Therapeutics announces presentation of new preclinical data for NKTR-255 at ASH (22.25 +1.80)NKTR-255 is an interleukin-15 (IL-15) receptor agonist that is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical study in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Details of the preclinical data presentations at ASH are as follows and are available on the scientific section of Nektar's website."The preclinical data being recognized at ASH demonstrate NKTR-255's promise in hematological malignancies through its potential to restore both NK cell and memory CD8 T cell compartments in patients," said Loui Madakamutil, Ph.D., SVP and Head of Discovery and Research at Nektar Therapeutics. "In studies presented by the laboratory of Dr. Nikhil Munshi at Dana-Farber, NKTR-255 enhanced the number and function of NK and CD8+ effector memory T cell populations in peripheral blood and bone marrow from patients with multiple myeloma and, also increased expression of activating receptors found on those NK cells. Separately, researchers from the laboratory of Dr. Cameron Turtle at Fred Hutchinson demonstrated NKTR-255 prevented tumor growth and increased survival of CAR T cells when added to a CD19-targeted CAR T cell regimen in models of B cell lymphoma. This preclinical data reinforces the basis of our ongoing clinical trial evaluating the potential of NKTR-255 in patients with multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."10:23XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (59.57 -0.18)The energy sector (-0.3%) displays relative weakness in the early going of today's session. Today's early underperformance comes after the sector gained 1.5% last week, finishing ahead of the remaining ten groups. Factors contributing to the underperformance:Pressure on the price of oil. WTI crude is down $0.27, or 0.5%, at $58.93/bbl. Granted, the energy component has climbed off its overnight low of $58.23 in recent trade, but it remains in negative territory, weighing on the energy sector. China reported a smaller than expected trade surplus for November, which supports the argument that the Chinese economy continues slowing down. This will continue posing a headwind to global growth. Pullback after last week's show of relative strength.Notable movers:Marathon Petroleum (MPC 58.95, -1.26, -2.1%): weakest sector component after being downgraded to Neutral from Overweight at JP Morgan. Chevron (CVX 117.27, -0.74, -0.6%): downgraded to Neutral from Buy at Citigroup. HollyFrontier (HFC 50.40, -0.54, -1.1%): trading at a three-month low. Occidental Petroleum (OXY 37.71, -0.51, -1.3%): on the verge of falling to a fresh 2019 low. Chevron (CVX 117.31, -0.70, -0.6%): looking to remain above its 50-day moving average (117.39). Baker Hughes (BKR 22.64, +0.43, +1.9%): showing relative strength in a weak sector.10:19CNST Constellation Pharmaceuticals provides updated preliminary data from MANIFEST clinical trial with CPI-0610 (56.82 +13.12)MANIFEST is an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of the company's bromodomain and extra-terminal domain protein inhibitor CPI-0610 in patients with myelofibrosis (MF). Arm 3 is evaluating CPI-0610 in combination with ruxolitinib in JAK-inhibitor-nave MF patients. Arms 1 and 2 are studying CPI-0610 as a monotherapy or in combination with ruxolitinib in ruxolitinib-resistant or -intolerant MF patients. Results include:Preliminary data showed continuing signs of activity across a broad range of parameters, suggesting possible disease-modifying effects of CPI-0610.In the first-line treatment arm, 12 out of 15 (80%) evaluable JAK-inhibitor-nave patients treated with a CPI-0610 / ruxolitinib combination achieved at least a 35% spleen volume response (SVR35) at 12 weeks. The median percent change in spleen volume reduction was -49.7%. Ten out of 14 (71%) evaluable patients achieved at least a 50% improvement in Total Symptom Score (TSS50) at 12 weeks. The median percent change in TSS at 12 weeks was -60.3%.Clinical activity, including SVR35 responses, TSS50 responses, and conversion from transfusion dependence to transfusion independence, was seen at 24 weeks in patients in the second-line treatment arm who added CPI-0610 to ruxolitinib, suggesting that treatment with CPI-0610 may have durable effects.CPI-0610 in combination with ruxolitinib in JAK-inhibitor-nave patients was generally well tolerated. No adverse events led to study discontinuation. Three patients (10%) had greater than or equal to Grade 3 anemia. One patient (3.3%) had Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, which was reversible. CPI-0610 as monotherapy or in combination with ruxolitinib in ruxolitinib-refractory or -intolerant patients (Arms 1 and 2) was generally well tolerated. The most common hematologic adverse event was thrombocytopenia.Constellation continues to enroll patients in MANIFEST. As a result of encouraging preliminary data, Constellation expanded Arm 3 of MANIFEST for JAK-inhibitor-nave patients from 43 to up to 101 patients. The company also expanded Cohort 2A, for TD ruxolitinib-resistant or -intolerant patients adding CPI-0610 to ruxolitinib, from 16 to up to 60 patients. Constellation has started planning for a randomized, active-controlled, pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial studying the combination of CPI-0610 and ruxolitinib versus ruxolitinib and placebo in JAK-inhibitor-nave patients with MF. The company expects this clinical trial to start in 2020.An investor event to discuss the MANIFEST update at ASH is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. EST today.10:18AGIO Agios Pharma presents updated data for mitapivat from extension phase of DRIVE PK Phase 2 study in patients with pyruvate kinase deficiency (44.64 +3.70)Agios Pharma today reported new data from the extension phase of the DRIVE PK Phase 2 study of mitapivat (AG-348) in adults with pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency at the 2019 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.In the extension phase, patients treated with mitapivat doses >25 mg twice daily in the core period undergo a dose taper and continue on a dose that maintained their Hb level at no lower than 1.0 g/dL below their pre-taper level. As of the March 27, 2019 data cutoff, 18 of the 36 patients remain in the extension phase with a median treatment duration of 35.6 months (range 28.7-41.9). For the 18 patients in the extension phase, improvements in hemoglobin and other markers of hemolysis including reticulocytes, indirect bilirubin, and haptoglobin achieved during the core period were sustained during the extension period up to 42 months, as of the data cutoff. Adverse events for patients who continued in the study (n=18) were comparable in the core and extension periods. In the extension, the most common AEs were headache (39%), insomnia (28%), fatigue (28%), and nasopharyngitis (28%). No new safety signals were identified in the extension period.The cumulative safety profile, says the company, continues to support long-term twice daily dosing of mitapivat.Mitapivat is an investigational, first-in-class, oral, small molecule allosteric activator of wild-type and a variety of mutated pyruvate kinase-R (PKR) enzymes that directly targets the underlying metabolic defect in PK deficiency, a rare, potentially debilitating, hemolytic anemia. In addition, data was shared from the Agios-sponsored Natural History Study of PK deficiency that detailed the comorbidities and complications associated with the disease and the impact of transfusion history.10:13OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:CLF Dec 9 calls are seeing interest following positive mention in Barrons with 3720 contracts trading vs. open int of 1570, pushing implied vol up around 6 points to ~50%.

The study was designed in two parts: Part A to establish an initial priming dose with flat dosing regimens and Part B to escalate dosing on subsequent administrations to the priming dose. Prophylactic treatment for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was mandated prior to each dose of XmAb13676. XmAb13676 was generally well tolerated, and a priming dose of 45 mcg/kg was chosen for continued dose escalation in Part B for patients with NHL. Safety was evaluated in all 53 patients. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were pyrexia (55%), CRS (53%), and anemia (41%). CRS was more frequent and generally higher grade on the first dose. Three patients (6%) experienced Grade 3 or 4 CRS on the first dose, all prior to the implementation of step-up dosing. AEs consistent with the symptoms of CRS, but not reported as such, were observed in an additional 23% of patients and were mild to moderate in severity.10:09SGEN Seattle Genetics and Takeda Pharma (TAK) announce additional analyses of results from ECHELON-1 and ECHELON-2 frontline phase 3 trials of ADCETRIS (116.36 -1.14)These analyses were presented at the 61st Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology. ADCETRIS (brentuximab vedotin) is an antibody-drug conjugate directed to CD30, a defining marker of classical Hodgkin lymphoma and expressed on the surface of several types of peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL). The ECHELON-1 analysis highlighted a four-year update of the phase 3 clinical trial in a poster presentation.ECHELON-1 is evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with AVD compared to ABVD in patients with Stage III or IV frontline classical Hodgkin lymphoma.As previously reported, the ECHELON-1 trial achieved its primary endpoint with the combination of ADCETRIS plus AVD resulting in a statistically significant improvement in modified progression-free survival compared to the control arm of ABVD as assessed by independent review facility. A four-year post-hoc exploratory analysis was conducted to examine PFS outcomes per investigator assessment in the intent-to-treat population of 1,334 patients, including results by PET2 status, age, stage and prognostic risk scores. Results include: The four-year PFS rate for patients in the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm was 81.7% compared to 75.1% in the ABVD arm, a difference of 6.6%. This represents a 31% reduction in the risk of progression or death. Median follow-up time was 48.4 months. A PFS benefit at four-years for ADCETRIS plus AVD was observed for all patients independent of PET2 status, including in patients who are less than 60 years old.Consistent improvement in PFS was observed among patients treated with ADCETRIS plus AVD compared with ABVD across the majority of pre-specified subgroups.As previously reported for the primary analysis, on the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm, peripheral neuropathy events were observed in 67% of patients compared to 43% in the ABVD arm. The four-year update shows that among patients with peripheral neuropathy, 83% in the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm and 84% in the ABVD arm reported complete resolution or improvement at last follow-up. The ECHELON-2 phase 3 clinical trial data were presented in an oral session at ASH and focused on the outcomes of the subset of patients who underwent consolidative stem cell transplant. ECHELON-2 is evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with CHP compared to CHOP in frontline CD30-expressing PTCL.As previously reported, the ECHELON-2 trial met its primary endpoint with the combination of ADCETRIS plus CHP resulting in a statistically significant improvement in PFS versus the control arm of CHOP per blinded independent central review. A post-hoc exploratory analysis evaluated the impact of consolidative stem cell transplant in the ECHELON-2 study for the patients who achieved CR treated with ADCETRIS plus CHP. In the ADCETRIS plus CHP arm, this included 38 patients in CR who received a stem cell transplant and 76 patients in CR who did not. Key findings of this analysis include:The PFS estimate favored the use of stem cell transplant (HR, 0.38; [95% CI: 0.18, 0.82]). After a median follow-up time of 35.9 months, the three-year PFS rate for the 38 patients who received a stem cell transplant was 76.1%. After a median follow-up time of 41.6 months, the three-year PFS rate for the 76 patients who did not receive a stem cell transplant was 53.3%. As previously reported, the safety profile of ADCETRIS plus CHP in the ECHELON-2 trial was comparable to CHOP and consistent with the established safety profile of ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy.10:08SWTX SpringWorks Therapeutics' collaborator GlaxoSmithKline presented data evaluating SpringWorks' nirogacestat alone and in combination with GlaxoSmithKline's belantamab mafodotin (27.00 +2.48)The data demonstrated that treatment of BCMA-expressing cancer cell lines with nirogacestat led to significantly increased levels of cell surface expression of BCMA and corresponding decreases in shedding of BCMA, as measured by levels of soluble BCMA. Further, the combination of nirogacestat and belantamab mafodotin resulted in synergistic increases in cancer cell killing as compared to belantamab mafodotin alone, with an up to ~3,000-fold improvement in cytotoxicity.09:40WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Stock market opens little changedThe major indices begin the day little changed.

It is the Company's intention to resume the Advantage Loan program as soon as management is confident its stated policies and procedures are being followed. However, it is presently difficult to estimate how long this suspension might last.The Advantage Loan program is a material component of the Bank's total loan originations. While it is difficult to quantify the financial impact of the program's temporary suspension, management anticipates a reduced level of near-term loan originations, slower overall loan portfolio growth, and less loan sales. However, management does not anticipate any credit related issues from previous loans made under the program due to the substantial amount of equity required for each borrower and the resulting strong collateral package for each loan. In order to mitigate the operational and financial impact of the Advantage Loan program's temporary suspension, the Company will continue to work on initiatives to diversify its overall loan production. Such initiatives include expanding the Bank's commercial lending efforts, including multifamily, tenant-in-common, construction, and commercial and industrial loans.

Weiss, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are highly encouraged by the first clinical data presented from our once daily, BTK inhibitor, TG-1701, which has demonstrated superior selectivity for BTK compared to ibrutinib in an in vitro whole kinome screening. The data presented today show that TG-1701 is an active BTK inhibitor as a single agent and that the combination of U2 plus TG-1701 has been generally well tolerated and active with 6 of 7 patients responding to the triple therapy at 100 mg QD, the lowest dose of TG-1701 tested. We look forward to continuing dose escalation of TG-1701 in the combination arm and identifying the optimal dose for this therapy." Mr. Weiss continued, "Our goal has always been to develop the best possible combination treatment options for patients, and we are excited to present the first data from a triple combination study in which all of the agents are being developed by TG. We believe this proprietary combination has the potential to enhance the results of BTK inhibitor therapy alone and offer patients early and deep responses with a tolerable safety profile."08:02GALT Galectin Therapeutics announces publication of results from its NASH-CX Phase 2 clinical trial in NASH cirrhosis in the peer-reviewed journal Gastroenterology (2.99 )The paper outlines that in a phase 2b study of 162 patients with NASH, cirrhosis, and portal hypertension, one year of biweekly infusion of belapectin was safe but not associated with significant reduction in HVPG or fibrosis, compared with placebo. However, in a subgroup analysis of patients without esophageal varices, 2 mg/kg belapectin (GR-MD-02) did reduce HVPG and development of varices. This subgroup analysis suggests that there may be benefits from belapectin in patients with NASH cirrhosis without esophageal varices. Further, if this observation can be reproduced in subsequent studies, belapectin may have a role in the management of patients with NASH cirrhosis and portal hypertension but no varices.08:01REPL Replimune names Jean M.

This was comparable to historical data with multiple doses of busulfan conditioning.CD117-ADC was well tolerated in non-human primates with no evidence of the often severe side effects seen with busulfan conditioning, including veno-occlusive disease, weight loss, diarrhea, mucositis, vomiting, pulmonary fibrosis or seizures.07:42TPX Tempur Sealy Int'l determines that it will record a charge of $30 mln (before tax) in Q4 in connection with the bankruptcy of one of its customers (85.89 )On December 6, 2019, Tempur Sealy determined that it will record a charge of $30 mln (before tax) in the fourth quarter of 2019, in connection with the bankruptcy of one of its customers, Mattress PAL Holding, LLC, and the resulting significant liquidity issues of Mattress PAL's affiliates (collectively, "Mattress1One"). On April 7, 2019, Mattress PAL filed a voluntary petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code ("Chapter 11 Proceedings"). On December 5, the Bankruptcy Court orally granted Mattress PAL's request to convert the Chapter 11 Proceedings to a Chapter 7 liquidation case. The company plans to treat this charge, which does not involve any cash payments, as an adjustment in calculating adjusted EBITDA under the company's senior secured credit agreement. Mattress1One represented less than 1% of the company's global net sales in 2019, and the company does not expect this charge, or the loss of Mattress1One as a customer, to have a material impact on the company's 2019 guidance, 2020 outlook, or current or future liquidity.07:37IEP Icahn Enterprises commences private placement of Senior Notes due 2027 (61.61 )The proceeds from the offering will be used for general limited partnership purposes.07:35MBIO Mustang Bio highlights presentation of updated Phase 1/2 clinical data for MB-107 lentiviral gene therapy for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (3.85 )Lentiviral Gene Therapy with Low Dose Busulfan for Infants with X-SCID Results in the Development of a Functional Normal Immune System: Interim Results of an Ongoing Phase I/II Clinical Study Lentiviral gene therapy using low dose busulfan conditioning has been well tolerated, with no serious adverse events other than hematologic related to busulfanAll 11 patients had robust hematopoietic recovery within 3-4 weeks post cell infusion without blood product support Nine patients, with a follow up of greater than 3 months, achieved normal-for-age T-cell and natural killer (NK)-cell numbers within 3-4 months post gene therapy Five patients are off intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy thus far, of whom 3 responded to vaccines Median vector copy number (VCN) at 12 months post-gene therapy in seven patients, who have been followed for more than 12 months, was 2.25 VCN/cell (range: 1.24-3.03) in T cells, 0.34 VCN/cell (range: 0.23-1.25) in B cells, 1.55 VCN/cell (range 1.27-3.39) in NK cells, and 0.08 VCN/cell (range: 0.03-0.76) in myeloid cells in peripheral blood, and 0.10 (range: 0.05-0.66) in CD34+ bone marrow cells, respectivelyEnhanced Transduction Lentivector Gene Therapy for Treatment of Older Patients with X-Linked Severe Combined ImmunodeficiencyEarly outcome data for five older children and young adults with XSCID who received the lentivector (also known as lentiviral) gene therapy as salvage therapy after having previously received haplo-identical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as infants without chemotherapy-based conditioning were previously reported and published in Science Translational Medicine. By 2016, three additional patients were treated, and the cohort of eight patients (referred to as Cohort A) has now been followed for 3 to 7 years. Among Cohort A, gradual clinical benefit in the clearance of chronic norovirus and associated improved abdominal complaints, malabsorption, growth and IgG production were observed, and four patients were able to cease immunoglobulin replacement therapy.While the results were positive, the relatively inefficient transduction of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) required large quantities of vector. This resulted in relatively low VCN in myeloid cells in some patients, with delayed immune cell recovery and persistent clinical disease, especially in the last patient treated (patient 8). To address this, NIH developed a refined enhanced transduction (ET) procedure consisting of a single overnight transduction after 48 hours pre-stimulation in cytokines (Stem cell factor, Thrombopoietin, Flt3-ligand; 100ng/mL) and incorporated transduction enhancers LentiBoost 1:100 and dimethyl prostaglandin 2 (dmPGE2; 1uM).The presentation at the 2019 ASH Annual Meeting included data from six patients (referred to as Cohort B) treated by NIH, including re-treatment of patient 8. The patients, who were aged 12 to 36, had significant problems with donor T cell infiltration of liver, bone marrow and kidneys, and were nearly absent of B and NK cells. The enhanced transduction procedure achieved much greater transduction efficiencies than were observed in Cohort A, with greater than 10-fold less vector, and resulted in faster immune reconstitution and more significant clinical benefit by 3 months.07:33AR Antero Resources highlights agreements expected to reduce its gathering, processing and transportation costs by approximately $350 mln over the next four years, commences asset sale program targeting $750 mln to $1 bln in proceeds to be completed in 2020 (2.19 )The agreements include a growth incentive fee program with Antero Midstream Corporation (AM) that aligns with the Company's current 8% to 10% compound annual production growth plan through 2021 and additional agreements with other third party midstream providers.

The growth incentive fee program aligns with Antero Resources' current 8% to 10% compound annual net production growth plan in 2020 and 2021. The share repurchase and growth incentive fee reduction transactions have been negotiated and recommended by the Conflicts Committees of Antero Midstream and Antero Resources and approved by both Boards of Directors.Due to additional optimization of the midstream infrastructure buildout, Antero Midstream is now targeting a 2020 capital program of approximately $300 to $325 million. This represents a $75 to $100 million, or 22% reduction, compared to the previous target of $375 to $425 million. Antero Resources' previously announced preliminary 2020 target of 110 to 120 completions in 2020, with an average lateral length of 12,100 feet is unchanged.

All response-evaluable patients experienced tumor reduction (complete response + partial response + stable disease) following treatment with ADCETRIS in combination with OPDIVO. Median duration of response was not yet reached and the maximum duration of response was 22 months and ongoing (95% CI: 7.06, -). The most common treatment-related adverse events of any grade occurring in at least 20 percent of patients were fatigue, diarrhea, pyrexia, infusion related reaction, peripheral motor neuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy and increase in lipase. One treatment-related serious adverse event was pyrexia. Fifty-seven percent of patients (12/21) had at least one treatment-related adverse event greater than or equal to Grade 3, most commonly increase in lipase (24 percent, 5/21), peripheral motor neuropathy and peripheral sensory neuropathy (each 14 percent, 3/21), and fatigue and hyponatremia (each 10 percent, 2/21). Two-Year Follow-up Results from the Phase 1-2 Study of Brentuximab Vedotin in Combination with Nivolumab in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (Abstract #238, oral presentation at 2:45 p.m. ET on Saturday, December 7, 2019) Of the 91 treated patients, 85 percent (77/91) had an objective response, including 67 percent (61/91) with a complete response, 16 patients with a partial response and six patients had stable disease. Of the 91 treated patients, 67 patients received an ASCT per trial protocol with no additional salvage therapy. For all treated patients, the two-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 79 percent (95% CI: 68%, 87%). For the 67 patients who received an ASCT per trial protocol, the two-year PFS was 92 percent (95% CI: 80%, 97%). Median follow-up for all treated patients was 24.2 months (range 1.8-41.7) and the median PFS was not reached. Estimated overall survival at two years was 94 percent (95% CI: 85%, 97%) and median overall survival was not yet reached. Peripheral immune signatures were consistent with an activated T-cell response. Prior to ASCT, the most common adverse events of any grade occurring in more than 20 percent of patients were nausea, infusion related reaction, fatigue, diarrhea, pruritus, headache, vomiting and pyrexia. Other adverse events included peripheral neuropathy in 16 patients (18 percent) and neutropenia in six patients (7 percent). Two patients (2 percent) discontinued treatment due to adverse events, Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy and increased gamma-glutamyltransferase. Serious adverse events occurred in 14 patients (15 percent), including pneumonia, pneumonitis and pyrexia (two patients each); and Grade 3 Guillain-Barre syndrome (one patient).06:52GILD Gilead Sciences reports Long-term data from ZUMA-1 demonstrating about half of refractory large b-cell lymphoma patients were alive three years after Yescarta treatment (67.08 )Co announced new data from the ZUMA-1 trial of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) in adult patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma. These results included updated overall survival data from the pivotal phase 2 study after three years following a single infusion of Yescarta, as well as an analysis from a separate safety management cohort of patients receiving early steroid intervention for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events. Updated results from a separate ZUMA-1 safety management study (Cohort 4) were also presented at the meeting (Abstract #243). In this analysis, patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma treated with Yescarta received earlier steroid intervention, beginning when patients experienced Grade 1 neurologic events or experienced Grade 1 CRS with no improvement after three days of supportive care. Patients could receive optional bridging chemotherapy prior to Yescarta infusion. In the analysis, 41 patients had received Yescarta, with a median follow-up of 8.7 months; 73% of patients received corticosteroids and 76% received tocilizumab. Earlier steroid use appeared to decrease the percentage of patients with Grade > or =3 CRS (2%) and neurologic events (17%), each of which were numerically lower than rates in the registrational cohorts of ZUMA-1 (13% CRS, 31% neurologic events). There were no Grade 4 or 5 CRS or neurologic events and no Grade 5 AEs related to Yescarta in Cohort 4. Objective response rate per investigator assessment was 73% in Cohort 4, with 51% of patients achieving a complete response. The median duration of response was 8.9 months. Fifty-four percent of patients in this cohort remained in an ongoing response with at least six months of follow-up after Yescarta infusion. Median OS in Cohort 4 has not been reached.06:51CRTX Cortexyme reports new data revealing link between bacterial pathogen and genetic risk for Alzheimer's Disease (28.31 )Co announced the presentation of new data supporting the on-target activity of COR388, its lead investigational medicine, and linking the "gingipain hypothesis" for Alzheimer's disease (AD) to the significance of the APOE gene as a major risk factor for the disease.Gingipains from P. gingivalis cleave ApoE proteins and have a preference for cleaving ApoE4; and COR388, a gingipain inhibitor, prevents this. In in vitro experiments, cells infected with P. gingivalis exhibited gingipain-dependent ApoE cleavage activity that generated ApoE fragments similar to what was seen in the brains and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, uninfected cells had no significant ApoE protein-cleaving activity. Furthermore, P. gingivalis gingipains cleaved ApoE4 more readily than ApoE3. Finally, in the infected cells, COR388 alone was sufficient to block ApoE fragmentation. In a Phase 1b trial, COR388 reduced ApoE fragments in CSF. Cortexyme's Phase 1 clinical development program for COR388 included cohorts of healthy volunteers and subjects with Alzheimer's disease. In addition to assessing safety and initial clinical activity, investigators also assessed the level of ApoE fragmentation in the CSF of nine subjects with Alzheimer's disease. Six subjects received 50mg of COR388 twice daily while three subjects received placebo. After 28 days, a statistically significant decrease in ApoE fragments (both ApoE4 and ApoE3) was observed in subjects treated with COR388 versus those treated with placebo.06:51EGRX Eagle Pharma commences dosing in pilot study for novel estrogen receptor antagonist product candidate (56.43 )The company has commenced dosing in a pilot clinical study to assess the unique characteristics of its fulvestrant product candidate, which has the potential to enhance estrogen receptor ("ER") inhibition and improve outcomes for patients with ER-positive breast cancer.

All results are as of the data cutoff date of August 26, 2019.Groups A and B:As of the data cutoff date, seven out of nine total patients in Groups A and B (five out of seven in Group A and two out of two in Group B) did not require regular RBC transfusions post-treatment. Overall, patients in Groups A and B experienced a reduction, but not complete elimination of VOC and ACS events at two years post-treatment, suggesting that the levels of gene therapy-derived hemoglobin may have been sufficient to reduce but not eliminate continued sickle-related disease manifestations. Group C As of the data cutoff date, 17 patients were treated with LentiGlobin for SCD in Group C, with the longest follow-up at 21 months; none required regular RBC transfusions post-treatment. In patients with six or more months of follow-up (n=12), median levels of gene therapy-derived anti-sickling hemoglobin, HbAT87Q, were at least 40% of total hemoglobin. Total hemoglobin and HbAT87Q levels ranged from 9.3 -- 15.2 g/dL and 2.7 -- 9.0 g/dL, respectively, at last visit. Treatment with LentiGlobin for SCD reduced key markers of hemolysis, including reticulocyte counts, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and total bilirubin concentration, which suggests that treatment is improving biological markers of the disease. Among the nine patients with at least six months of follow-up who had four or more VOC or ACS events in the two years prior to treatment, there was a 99% reduction in annualized rate of VOC and ACS. There were no reports of ACS or serious VOC at up to 21 months post-treatment in these patients. As previously reported, there was one non-serious Grade 2 VOC was observed in a patient approximately 3.5 months post-LentiGlobin for SCD treatment.HGB-206 Exploratory Assays bluebird bio presented results from exploratory assays in samples from a subset of patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD from Groups A, B and C, to assess the relationship between drug product characteristics and RBC physiology. To demonstrate the pancellular expression of the gene therapy derived anti-sickling Hb, HbAT87Q, bluebird bio developed an assay that enables detection of HbAT87Q and HbS protein in individual RBCs. In 12 patients who had at least six months of follow-up, the proportion of RBCs positive for HbAT87Q at the last study visit was more than 70% in all cases; with more than 90% of RBCs positive for HbAT87Q in four patients.On average, HbAT87Q present in RBCs of patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD was within the range of non-sickling adult Hb, HbA, present in the RBCs from people with sickle cell trait. The RBCs also resembled sickle cell trait RBCs with regard to propensity to sickle under low oxygen conditions. Sickling of RBCs from patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD was significantly less than that seen in untreated patients with SCD.06:49MNK Mallinckrodt plc presents data on a novel predictive model to identify infants at risk for infantile spasms (3.41 )Co announced findings on the use of a novel predictive model designed to more quickly identify infants with infantile spasms (IS), a rare seizure disorder that typically occurs between three and seven months of age. Key FindingsDeductive models developed to identify the combinations of variables that predict IS prior to diagnosis and during the treatment pathway: 557 patients had =2 symptoms pertaining to IS -- seizures, developmental delay, lack of eye contact and lack of muscle tone -- and a moderate or high severity ED visit. In this group, 55 percent of patients (n=304) had an IS diagnosis within a median 0.8 months of the triggering event. The most notable deductive combinations focused on pre-diagnosis of IS. MethodsThe study utilized data from the Symphony Health Integrated Dataverse database to identify triggers for early identification of IS patients from medical and pharmacy claims from 10.8 million patients under 2 years of age between May 2017 and April 2018. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) procedure codes were evaluated to identify the codes most likely to predict a subsequent diagnosis of IS. Researchers also used input from IS medical experts to determine the clinical, electrographic, radiologic, procedural and medication variables that may predict IS development.06:48SGMO Sangamo Therapeutics announces preliminary results from first three patients treated in Phase 1/2 THALES study evaluating investigational ST-400 ex vivo gene-edited cell therapy in transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (11.66 )The three patients treated with ST-400 experienced prompt hematopoietic reconstitution, demonstrating neutrophil engraftment in 14-22 days and platelet engraftment in 22-35 days (Table 1). No emerging clonal hematopoiesis has to date been observed by on-target indel pattern monitoring in the three treated patients. Reported adverse events (AEs) are consistent with the known toxicities of mobilization, apheresis, and myeloablative busulfan conditioning. One serious adverse event (SAE) related to ST-400 was reported. As previously disclosed, Patient 1 experienced hypersensitivity during ST-400 infusion considered by the investigator to be likely related to the product cryoprotectant excipient, DMSO, and which resolved by the end of the infusion.06:47LITE Lumentum to offer $850 mln aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2026 (72.08 )Lumentum intends to use approximately $196 million of the net proceeds of the offering to repay in full all amounts outstanding under its term loan credit facility, and a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to purchase up to approximately $200 million of its common stock concurrently with the pricing of this offering in privately negotiated transactions effected through the initial purchaser of the notes or its affiliates as its agent.

POMPEO: US REMAINS 'DEEPLY TROUBLED' BY CHINA'S MISTREATMENT OF UIGHUR AND OTHER MUSLIM MINORITIESStates News ServiceDecember 20, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 376 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Tuesday that the United States remains concerned about reports of China's harsh treatment of relatives of Uighur Muslim activists and survivors of Chinese internment camps.In a statement released by the State Department, Pompeo said the U.S. is still "deeply troubled" by reports that the Chinese government has reportedly "harassed, imprisoned, or arbitrarily detained family members of Uighur Muslim activists and survivors of Xinjiang internment camps who have made their stories public."The top U.S. diplomat said some of the "abuses occurred shortly after meetings with senior State Department officials."Jailed Uighur Tohti Wins European Parliament Sakharov Rights AwardIlham Tohti, the outspoken former professor of economics at a Beijing university was sentenced in 2014 by Chinese courts in a trial that provoked an outcry from foreign governments and human rights organisationsOver the past few years, China has established complexes in Xinjiang that it maintains are "vocational training centers" designed to combat terrorism and extremism and to teach new skills.Beijing denies any mistreatment of the Uighurs and maintains that the detainees are at the complexes voluntarily.Many world leaders have criticized China for setting up the complexes, where the U.N. says at least 1 million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims have been detained.The U.S. government and human rights groups estimate 10 percent of the Uighur population is under detention.The nonpartisan research group the Australian Strategic Policy Institute estimates there are 143 camps where Uighurs are detained.The New York-based Human Rights Watch has accused China of committing "rampant abuses," including torture.The U.S. last month broadened its trade blacklist to include top Chinese artificial intelligence startup companies. It also announced visa restrictions against Chinese government and Communist Party officials it believes are behind the detention or abuse of Muslim minorities in the region.Pompeo also Tuesday called on Beijing to "cease all harassment of Uighurs living outside China...and to allow families to communicate freely without repercussions."Load-Date: December 20, 2019End of Document

A company sold Chinese-made surveillance equipment to the US with 'Made in the USA' labels, feds allegeCNN WireNovember 8, 2019 Friday 10:21 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 617 wordsDateline: (CNN) Body (CNN) --  A New York-based technology company sold Chinese-made surveillance equipment to the US government while falsely claiming the products were made in the United States -- a scheme that directly undermined national security, federal prosecutors have alleged.Aventura Technologies, based in the Long Island town of Commack, for years sold surveillance cameras and other equipment used on US military installations, prosecutors alleged in a criminal complaint unsealed Thursday in federal court. Its clients included private sector companiesAventura -- unbeknownst to the US government -- imported millions of dollars worth of equipment from China that was labeled and "passed off ... as American made," Richard P. Donoghue, US attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said Thursday.Aventura claimed it made the equipment, the complaint says. It adds the company was paid $88 million since November 2010."Because of misrepresentations made to the US government, Aventura was paid tens of millions of dollars for Chinese manufactured surveillance systems that ended up on Army and Air Force bases, in Department of Energy facilities, on Navy installations and even on US aircraft carriers," Donoghue said.He added that the alleged scheme had been going on for more than 13 years and "the owners and operators of Aventura grew rich trading our national security for personal profit."Seven employees or former employees have been charged with conspiracy to commit fraud, unlawful importation and money laundering. They include Jack Cabasso, the company's founder and managing director.CNN has reached out to Aventura and the arrested employees for statements. Some of them have declined to comment while others didn't immediately respond.Cybersecurity riskCourt documents say the fraud resulted in a serious cyber security risk since the software deployed into US systems was known to have vulnerabilities and could potentially allow hackers to access these networks and obtain sensitive data."Obviously when you have Chinese-made cameras with (Chinese) software loaded into them networked into sensitive installations such as Army bases, Navy bases, Department of Energy facilities, and even American aircraft carriers, that causes great concern for our national security," Donoghue said."Had we known that this was Chinese software, we may have been able to take steps to patch it and address that risk but because this was masked and we did not know this was Chinese software, in many instances those steps were not taken," he added.He said there "are no allegations in the complaint about the Chinese government itself and we're not making any today."Fraud and money laundering schemeThe tech company also portrayed itself to the US government as a female-owned small business in order to obtain contracts set aside for such businesses, prosecutors said.Jack Cabasso's wife, Frances Cabasso, is listed on nearly all relevant paperwork as the CEO and majority owner of Aventura. But court documents say she plays virtually no role in the operation of the business, and that in reality it is controlled by her husband. She was among the seven charged.Aventura was also involved in a money-laundering scheme, according to court documents. The government's investigation revealed the Cabassos transferred money to shell companies, which in turn made numerous payments to benefit themselves and their relatives. Aventura describes itself on its website as an "innovative designer, developer and manufacturer of security hardware, software and peripheral products for government, military and enterprise since 1999."TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.4%, the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.4%, and the Russell 2000 declined 0.3%.The lack of conviction was understandable considering that there was no reported progress on the U.S.-China trade front ahead of the Dec. 15 tariffs, which would presumably upset the market if they went into effect without a Phase One deal. There is still some time left this week to strike a deal, but the trade uncertainty helped keep risk sentiment in check.Losses were made most prevalent in the S&P 500 health care (-0.7%), utilities (-0.5%), and information technology (-0.5%) sectors. The latter was pressured by Apple (AAPL 266.92, -3.79, -1.4%), which pulled back from record territory. Conversely, the consumer staples (+0.2%), real estate (+0.1%), and consumer discretionary (+0.1%) sectors finished higher.Other key events this week will include policy decisions from both the Fed and ECB, a UK election, and reports on consumer prices and retail sales for November. Strikingly, the CBOE Volatility Index spiked 16.5% to 15.86, as demand for downside protection increased in anticipation for any disappoints.Corporate news didn't move the needle, but M&A activity and analyst recommendations did contribute to some notable stock reactions.In the biotech space, ArQule (ARQL 19.71, +10.04, +103.9%) agreed to be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.72, -0.13, -0.2%) for about $2.7 billion in cash.

The first session of the week was very quiet, and it followed an overnight affair that was just as subdued. Economic data received overnight painted a mixed picture, as China reported a smaller than expected trade surplus for November (actual $38.73 bln; expected $46.30 bln) while Japan's Q3 GDP growth was revised up to 0.4% from 0.1%. Treasuries started the cash session with modest gains, climbing toward their intraday highs from Friday shortly after the open. However, the rest of the session saw a slow return to today's opening levels. The U.S. Treasury sold $38 bln in 3-yr notes to solid demand, as the high yield stopped through the when issued yield by 0.2 bps while the bid-to-cover ratio and indirect takedown were above average. The U.S. Dollar Index faced some morning pressure but returned to little changed as the day went on, reclaiming its 200-day moving average (97.65) in the process. Yield Check: 2-yr: -1 bp to 1.62% 3-yr: -1 bp to 1.64% 5-yr: UNCH at 1.67% 10-yr: -1 bp to 1.83% 30-yr: -2 bps to 2.26%News: The House of Representatives could vote on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on December 18, according to CNBC. The Bank for International Settlements published its latest quarterly review, which noted that structural issues rather than temporary factors were responsible for the mid-September shortage in the funding market that prompted the Fed to begin conducting daily reverse repurchases. The BIS added that liquidity demand from hedge funds exacerbated the funding stress. Financial Times reported that the Chinese government has ordered the removal of all foreign computer equipment and software from government offices. The Bank of Japan will reportedly lower its assessment of industrial production due to prolonged weakness. Former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker died on Sunday. China's November trade surplus totaled $38.73 bln (expected $46.30 bln; last $43.02 bln). Exports fell 1.1% yr/yr (expected 1.0%; last -0.8%) while imports rose 0.3% yr/yr (expected -1.8%; last -6.2%). Japan's Q3 GDP rose 0.4% qtr/qtr (expected 0.2%; last 0.1%), growing 1.8% yr/yr (expected 0.7%; last 0.2%). The latest set of election polls from the U.K. suggest that Conservatives will win majority on Thursday with a margin between 9 and 15 percentage points. Eurozone's December Sentix Investor Confidence rose to 0.7 from -4.5 (expected -4.9). Germany's October trade surplus totaled EUR20.60 bln (expected surplus of EUR19.00 bln; last surplus of EUR19.20 bln).

IMGN632 displays a well tolerated safety profile and activity at doses up to and including 0.09 mg/kg per cycle. The most common treatment-related adverse event was infusion-related reactions (24% all grades, 8% grade 3); none required IMGN632 discontinuation. Single dose-limiting toxicities were seen at the highest dose levels tested (0.18-0.45 mg/kg): three reversible cases of veno-occlusive disease and one prolonged neutropenia; no patterns of hepatotoxicity or cytopenias occurred with doses below 0.18 mg/kg. Although no maximum tolerated dose was determined on either schedule, based on the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic data generated, the dose and schedule of 0.045 mg/kg given on day 1 every 3 weeks has been selected as the monotherapy recommended Phase 2 dose. AML Efficacy Across all dose levels and both schedules, of the patients assessable for efficacy (n=71), 38 (54%) had a reduction in bone marrow blasts and 13 (18%) achieved an objective response, including 2 complete remissions (CR) and 10 with incomplete recovery (CRi) and one morphologic leukemia free state (MLFS) in heavily pretreated patients. The vast majority of these responders (92%) had failed prior intensive therapies, including 3 with prior transplant, 69% had failed 2-3 prior lines of therapy, and 54% had an adverse risk classification. At the dose and schedule selected as the recommended Phase 2 dose (0.045 mg/kg Q3W), a 40% response rate was seen in relapsed and refractory patients with de novo AML, including 1 CR, 4 CRi, and 1 MLFS (with subsequent conversion to CRi). BPDCN Efficacy 3 of 9 (33%) evaluable relapsed/refractory BPDCN patients achieved a response after a 1-2 doses of 0.045 mg/kg IMGN632 (1 CR, 1 CRi, and 1 partial remission); all three patients had received prior SL-401 (tagraxofusp-erzs), two had received intense multi-agent chemotherapy, and one had prior stem cell transplant.14:49GILD Gilead Sciences & CIBMTR announce findings from ongoing post-marketing study evaluating safety and efficacy of Yescarta in adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (67.79 +0.71)In this analysis, efficacy and safety of Yescarta were comparable to that observed in the ZUMA-1 trial, despite a larger proportion of older, more difficult-to-treat patients in the real-world setting. The findings were presented today at the 61st American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting & Exposition, held in Orlando from December 7--10, 2019.14:48NVS Novartis AG Kymriah demonstrates consistent efficacy and safety outcomes in US patients when used in real-world setting (92.60 +0.53)Efficacy in DLBCL confirmed results seen in the pivotal trial despite treatment of a broader population, including older and more heavily pretreated patients.Fewer known CAR-T cell therapy adverse events for patients with DLBCL, specifically rates of high-grade cytokine release syndrome (4%) and neurologic events (5%), were observed compared with the pivotal clinical trials.In children and young adults with ALL, efficacy outcomes were similar and safety outcomes appear to be more favorable compared to the pivotal trial.14:48GMDA Gamida Cell announces updated results from Phase 1 clinical study of GDA-201 (4.75 -0.35)The co announced updated results from a Phase 1 clinical study of GDA-201, an investigational, natural killer (NK) cell-based cancer immunotherapy for the treatment of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM), at the 61st Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH), which is being held December 7--10 in Orlando, FL. Data from 22 patients in the ongoing study showed GDA-201 in combination with monoclonal antibodies was generally well tolerated and demonstrated early evidence of clinical activity in heavily pre-treated patients, including five complete responses observed among nine patients with NHL. Gamida Cell plans to initiate a Phase 1/2 multi-dose, multi-center study of GDA-201 in patients with NHL in 2020.14:46GILD Gilead Sciences announces primary results from ZUMA-2 -- 93% of patients treated with Investigational KTE-X19 achieved response, including 67% with a complete response (67.30 +0.22)The co announced primary results from ZUMA-2, a global, multicenter, single-arm, open-label Phase 2 study of KTE-X19, an investigational CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, in adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). After a single infusion of KTE-X19, the best objective response via independent radiologic central review (n=60 evaluable for efficacy analysis) was 93 percent, with 67 percent of patients having achieved a complete response. These findings were presented today at the 61st American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting & Exposition, in Orlando from December 7--10, 2019.With a median follow-up of 12.3 months (range: 7.0 to 32.3 months) at the time of data cutoff, 57 percent of patients remained in an ongoing response. Of the first 28 patients treated (minimum follow-up of 24 months), 43 percent were alive and remained in continued remission without additional therapy. The 12-month estimates of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 61 percent and 83 percent, respectively. Median duration of response, PFS and OS were not yet reached. Among the 68 patients evaluable for safety, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events were observed in 91 percent and 63 percent of patients, respectively. Grade 3 or higher CRS and neurologic events were seen in 15 percent and 31 percent of patients, respectively. No Grade 5 CRS or neurologic events occurred.14:42TALKX Market Briefing: Buyers a reluctant bunchThere has been a steady deterioration in the major indices since about 10:15 a.m. ET. The downward trend hasn't been sparked by any specific news catalyst; rather, it is largely a case of absent buyers today, which is making it easier to pressure prices lower.Their reluctance to push things further is understandable given how far things have been pushed already and given that the world is on the cusp of learning if the U.S. is going to implement a tariff on a $160 billion tranche of imported Chinese goods on December 15.Should that tariff be implemented, it is thought that the stock market would not react well. Accordingly, given how far the market has come, the near-term risk-reward dynamic is seen as being skewed to the risk side of things at the moment. Strikingly, the CBOE Volatility Index is up 11.7% to 15.21.Apple (AAPL 267.28, -3.43, -1.3%), which was up 20.9% since the end of September, is an influential laggard today.The consumer staples (+0.2%), consumer discretionary (+0.2% 0, and rel estate (+0.1%) sectors are the only sectors trading higher.

Co, "with all major wildfire claims now on a path to be resolved and the total amount of wildfire liabilities determined," will now amend and finalize that plan. At two-month highs.AM (5.15 +14.8%): Announced that it will repurchase $100 mln of shares from Antero Resources (AR). Additionally, co and AR have agreed to a growth incentive fee program. Due to additional optimization of the midstream infrastructure buildout, co is now targeting a 2020 capital program of approx. $300-325 mln, a 22% reduction vs the previous target. Co targets net debt to adj. EBITDA in the mid-to-high 3-times range in 2020.Mid Cap LosersKOS (5.24 -13.25%): The stock, trading with above 3x average volume, sank to eleven-month lows early in the session, though it has since moderated those losses. In sector news, shares of Tullow Oil (TUWLF) plummeted overseas after that company, among other updates, including the announcement of the departures of its CEO and its Exploration Director, reset its forward-looking guidance, now forecasting 2020 Group production to average between 70,000-80,000 bpd, and noted that production performance has been significantly below expectations at the TEN and Jubilee fields in Ghana. Co is also active in Ghana and is a partner in production at the TEN and Jubilee fields. BPMC (71.18 -9.3%): Announced initial data from the Phase 2 PIONEER trial of avapritinib in patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis; initial data from the dose-finding Part 1 of the trial showed "rapid and robust reductions in serum tryptase" in patients treated with 25, 50, or 100 mg of avapritinib once daily. All doses of avapritinib tested were well-tolerated; there was one Grade 3 cognitive effect reported in the 100 mg cohort, and the event was resolved following dose modification. Co announced top-line results from the EXPLORER trial; among other results, top-line efficacy data as of a data cutoff of August 30 showed a centrally confirmed ORR of 77% in 48 patients evaluable for response. Top-line safety results were generally consistent with previously reported data. After the data cutoff, one patient with SM and an associated hematologic neoplasm of myelodysplastic syndrome had a Grade 5 intracranial bleed.

The next-generation database company's freemium "land and expand" business model has led to explosive growth.The company has beaten estimates and guided revenue above consensus in each of its first eight quarterly reports as a public company since its IPO in October 2017.Management guided for a third quarter adjusted net loss of $0.29-0.27/share with revenue up 52% to $98-100.Revenue growth is expected to slow to 24% in the fourth quarter given increasingly difficult comparisons after revenue grew 85% in the fourth quarter last year. MongoDB has guided for a fiscal 2020 adjusted net loss of $1.11-1.06/share with revenue up ~48% to $390-395 mln.Last quarter, revenue grew 67% while total customers grew ~6% sequentially and 103% yr/yr to over 15,000. MongoDB Atlas, the company's managed cloud database-as-a-service offering, grew customers 7% sequentially and 149% yr/yr to over 13,200. Atlas revenue was up over 240% yr/yr and represented 37% of total revenue for the quarter, which does weigh on gross margins.The stock fell in response to earnings despite strong results as the 20x forward revenue multiple seemed to have already priced in the company's strong position.The $7.3 bln valuation now represents ~17x forward revenue estimates. The stock has consolidated for the last six months and is currently attempting to hold the 50-DMA.14:09SUMRX Earnings Out This Afternoon/Tomorrow MorningThis Afternoon: CDMO CASY CHWY ROAD MDB PHR SFIX TOL MTNTomorrow Morning: AZO CMD CONN DBI HDS14:00SCANX Large cap notable movers of interest -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable large cap movers of interest ($10 bln - $200 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Large Cap GainersZM (66.33 +5.72%): Shares display relative strength as they bounce back from last week's 16% slide.

(24.27 -0.67)Chewy (CHWY) is set to report Q3 earnings tonight after the close with a conference call set for 5pmET.Current Capital IQ consensus stands at a loss of ($0.13) per share on revenues of $1.20 bln.GuidanceQ3 revenues in the range of $1.19-1.21 bln.2020 revenues in the range of $4,75-4.80 bln. 2020 EBITDA Margin improvement in the range of 420-450 bps.The StoryShares of CHWY fell to post-IPO lows following the release of Q2 results. CHWY outpaced revenue expectations as revenue growth was 43% (49% in autoship). The issue was the shortfall on the bottom line as it missed EPS consensus for the second straight quarter. Higher than expected SG&A costs in Q2 were one of the reasons why the stock sold off post Q2 results. Some of the increase was driven by non-recurring items like fulfillment center build outs and public company costs. Operating Expenses increased 55% yr/yr compared to the 43% top line growth. CHWY was able to improve gross margins by 300 bps, EBITDA margins increased 410 bps yr/yr. However this only led to a small increase to the low end of its EBITDA outlook.The good news is investor expectations around earnings has been dampened which leaves upside surprise potential for this evening. Two pedestrian quarters with bottom line misses and a cautious note from Cleveland Research saying sales were tracking 'softer' than expected has reigned in the outlook. The company's float stands at 44 mln shares and 32% of this is short interest which leaves it susceptible to a squeeze. Trader's need to be aware that the lock up expiration looms on December 11. Parent company PetSmart owns approx 67% of the shares with hedge funds owning approx 20%. Shares of CHWY opened at $36 on June 14 but have been on a downward trend since opening up for trade. Shares hit a post-IPO low of $21.68 on November 11. Since then it has been able to recover approx 10% to rally into its 50-sma ($24.36) ahead of tonight's print. CHWY will need to surprise to the upside, particularly on its cost management side, in order to shake out some of the shorts. But that lock up expiration lingers, similat to what we saw at Crowdsrike (CRWD) which will make it tough to squeeze.Q2 RecapReported Q2 (Jul) loss of $0.21 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.11 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.10). Revenues rose 43.1% year/year to $1.15 bln vs the $1.13 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Gross margin of 23.6 percent expanded 300 basis points year-over-year and in line with expectations. Net loss of $82.9 million, including a non-cash share-based compensation charge of $43.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA(1) loss of $29.2 million improved 45 percent year-over-year.Adjusted EBITDA margin of (2.5) percent expanded 410 basis points year-over-year and in line with expectations.13:39COMDX Metals Settlement PricesFeb gold settled today's session down $0.20 (0.01%) at $1464.9/oz Mar silver settled today's session $0.04 higher (0.24%) at $16.65/oz Mar copper settled $0.03 higher (1.01%) at $2.7575/lb13:15OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:CLF Dec 9 calls are seeing interest with the underlying stock up 5% following positive mention in Barrons (volume: 36.7K, open int: 1570, implied vol: ~55%, prev day implied vol: 44%).

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is unchanged.December 15 is fast approaching, and the market is hoping that the U.S. and China can reach a deal to possibly delay the tariffs scheduled to hit that day. Scattered throughout this week will be policy decisions from the Fed and ECB, as well as reports on consumer inflation and retail sales for November.In the meantime, it's been tough for the market to gain any traction amid the losses in Apple (AAPL 265.26, -5.44, -2.0%) and the S&P 500 health care sector (-0.5%). Conversely, the S&P 500 communication services (+0.3%) and consumer discretionary (+0.3%) sectors have provided some support.M&A activity seen some huge premiums, especially in the biotech space. ArQule (ARQL 19.70, +10.04, +103.4%) will be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for about $2.7 billion. Synthorx (THOR 67.66, +42.63, +170.3%) will be acquired by French company Sanofi (SNY 45.35, -0.68, -1.5%) for about $2.4 billion. Both are cash deals.Elsewhere, Texas Capital (TCBI 62.92, +5.03, +8.9%) and Independent Bank Group (IBTX 61.01, +1.75, +3.0%) have agreed to a $5.5 billion all-stock merger of equals.Separately, shares of Macy's (M 15.58, +0.43, +2.8%) have defied a downgrade to Sell at Goldman Sachs. Qorvo (QRVO 109.40, +2.78, +2.6%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.86, +2.53, +2.5%) were "double" upgraded to Buy from Underperform at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Overall losses are very modest, but there has been a noticeable increase in hedging interest and an uptick in defensive positioning. The CBOE Volatility Index is up 9.4% to 14.90, while the benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.82%.Investors did not receive any notable economic data.12:55SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ARQL (51.13 mln +103.83%), ACB (25.3 mln +4.94%), DHR (15.9 mln -0.26%), DPLO (14.31 mln -32.01%), CGC (13.75 mln +13.62%)Materials: FCX (18.84 mln +4.39%)Industrials: GE (13.66 mln -0.81%)Consumer Discretionary: M (23.44 mln +2.77%), NIO (22.42 mln -3.54%), F (11.26 mln -0.03%)Information Technology: AAPL (16.52 mln -1.96%), AMD (16.34 mln -1.01%)Financials: BAC (14.35 mln -0.5%), ITUB (12.41 mln +2.09%)Energy: CHK (37.97 mln +3.16%), KOS (14.66 mln -13.41%), SWN (12.99 mln -0.49%), AR (12.22 mln +25.11%)Utilities: PCG (28.32 mln +17.2%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: THOR (29.66x +170.22%), ARQL (21.4x +103.83%), FATE (8.02x +41.99%), DPLO (7.89x -32.01%), ABEO (6.19x +0.85%), TGTX (3.91x +25.37%), RCKT (3.43x -1.27%), PDLI (2.93x +22.03%), DHR (2.72x -0.26%), SGMO (2.54x -8.32%), BLUE (2.29x -5.29%)Industrials: DY (2.16x -5.63%)Consumer Discretionary: BIG (2.57x +5.51%)Information Technology: LPL (2.34x +10.75%)Financials: IBTX (7.6x +3.8%), TCBI (4.63x +9.29%), AB (2.93x -2.02%), USIG (2.43x +0.14%)Energy: KOS (2.41x -13.41%), KLXE (2.33x +13.56%)12:55SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (70) outpacing new lows (13) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: A, ACEL, ACN, ADUS, ALLE, ANSS, ARQL, ARVN, AVP, BBIO, BBY, BHC, BOLD, BRMK, BXMT, CARE, CASY, CBRE, CDAY, CIM, CMC, CODI, COF, CZZ, DAR, DCPH, DEA, DEI, DKS, DOCU, DTIL, EIDX, EPZM, FMC, FTSV, GBT, GCO, GL, GMRE, GOOGL, INFO, INSG, INSP, INSW, KDMN, KRYS, LAMR, LPG, LULU, MCO, MPW, NKE, OSK, QRVO, RCKT, RS, RYI, SPXC, SSW, STWD, SWKS, TBBK, THC, THOR, TNK, VCTR, VICI, VRTX, WWD, XBITStocks that traded to 52 week lows: AGX, BNFT, CERS, GCI, MNRL, NVEE, OSTK, OXY, PBT, S, SIGA, SYRS, TRXCThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: POWLETFs that traded to 52 week highs: EWK, EWN, FAN, IBB, IYK, JO, OEF, PALL, PBD, QAI, SEA, XBIETFs that traded to 52 week lows: UNG12:54SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: THOR (67.64 +170.22%), ARQL (19.7 +103.83%), FATE (19.41 +41.99%), TGTX (8.93 +25.37%), PDLI (3.6 +22.03%), DERM (9.01 +14.34%), DVAX (6.49 +13.86%), CGC (21.19 +13.62%), NKTR (23.07 +12.81%), ITCI (11.23 +10.1%)Consumer Discretionary: HOME (6.23 +9.88%)Information Technology: LPL (6.9 +10.75%)Energy: AR (2.74 +25.11%), AM (5.3 +18.14%), KLXE (6.28 +13.56%), ALTM (2.25 +10.05%), SDRL (1.29 +9.32%)Utilities: PCG (11.31 +17.2%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: DPLO (3.95 -32.01%), TVTY (19.9 -12.1%), TBIO (9.1 -8.91%), ATNX (16.26 -8.39%), SGMO (10.69 -8.32%), BPMC (72.09 -8.14%), GBT (74.15 -6.55%), CRSP (68.33 -5.58%), ATRS (4.62 -5.52%), BLUE (75.22 -5.29%), ACAD (48.71 -5.23%)Materials: IFF (134.39 -5.39%)Industrials: DY (48.07 -5.63%)Consumer Discretionary: GTX (10.25 -11.71%), MCFT (15.18 -5.36%)Information Technology: SMAR (42.07 -5.8%)Financials: JT (1.46 -5.81%)Energy: KOS (5.23 -13.41%), CCJ (9.21 -5.78%)Consumer Staples: DF (0.06 -7.89%)12:54SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Synthorx (THOR) soars upon premium acquisition agreement -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersTHOR (67.55 +169.88%): To be acquired by Sanofi (SNY) for a premium $68/share in cash, representing an aggregate equity value of approx. $2.5 bln, as Sanofi seeks to enhance its position in oncology and in immuno-oncology through the addition of co's THOR-707, said to have potential to become the best-in-class IL-2 therapeutic for the treatment of solid tumors, and co's other earlier-stage cytokine programs to its pipeline. At all-time highs. ARQL (19.7 +103.83%): To be acquired by Merck (MRK) for a premium $20/share in cash, representing an approximate total equity value of approx. $2.7 bln; Merck sees co's assets strengthening Merck's pipeline, most notably co's ARQ 531, which Merck names as "a compelling candidate for the treatment of B-cell malignancies." Co also today announced final Phase 1 clinical results for ARQ 531 in patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies; ARQ 531 reportedly demonstrated substantial anti-tumor activity and a manageable safety profile, and the data set "confirms the potential utility of ARQ 531 for the treatment of [...] heavily pretreated CLL patients," according to co's management. At multi-year highs. FTSV (26.48 +83.38%): Presented updated magrolimab clinical data in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. In higher-risk MDS, the ORR was 92%, including a complete response rate of 50%, while in untreated AML, the ORR was 64%, among other data. Co, with FDA guidance, has developed a protocol that will allow it "two distinct opportunities to achieve an accelerated approval" while remaining on-track to file an initial BLA in Q4 of 2021. Also announced preclinical proof-of-concept data for its novel all antibody conditioning regimen, comprised of FSI-174 and magrolimab, for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Reaches new all-time highs.Small Cap LosersDTIL (10.21 -48.07%): After spiking to record highs early in the session, the stock now gives up the majority of a substantial run higher that it had netted since mid-November. The volatility follows co's announcement of updated interim clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1 trial of PBCAR0191, its lead investigational allogeneic CAR T cell therapy candidate. Of nine patients treated with PBCAR0191, seven had objective evidence of tumor shrinkage at any timepoint. In the R/R non-Hodgkin lymphoma cohort, four of six patients achieved an objective response at day 28+, including three partial responses (two patients treated at Dose Level 1 and one at DL2) and one complete response (treated at DL2); the remaining two NHL patients achieved early responses at day 14 -- both patients had evidence of disease progression at day 28. In the B-ALL cohort treated at DL2, one of three patients achieved a complete response at day 28+; the remaining two patients did not respond at day 28. The trial is ongoing; treatment of patients at a third dose level recently commenced.DPLO (3.95 -32.1%): Agreed to be acquired by UnitedHealth's (UNH) OptumRx for $4.00/share through a cash tender offer, following a careful review of strategic options by co's Board of Directors. The stock had established new record lows below $3 in mid-November following co's issuance of Q3 results, at which time co's pursuit of a comprehensive strategic alternatives process remained ongoing; by Friday's close, the stock had improved by circa +139% from those lows. TVTY (19.7 -13%): Pulls back to multi-week lows on above average volume after disclosing that the employment relationship between co and its COO, Dawn M. Zier, has been mutually terminated and that co has entered into a Separation and Release Agreement with Ms. Zier that provides that she will receive those payments and benefits that she is entitled to under her employment agreement in respect of a termination without cause.

That outperformance is remarkable because it flies in the face of Goldman Sachs downgrading the stock to Sell from Neutral and slashing its price target to $12 from $17.Strikingly, Macy's has already exceeded its average daily volume less than two hours into the trading session. That heavy volume and the positive turn in the stock on a seemingly negative development are likely byproducts of the following factors:Investor belief that the Goldman Sachs analyst isn't breaking any new ground with the basis for the downgrade (secular headwinds weighing on comps and profitability). Shares of M were down 49% for the year before today's downgrade.Short-covering activity, which is often triggered when a beaten-up stock makes a counter-intuitive move.Momentum trading as speculators see an opportunity to force a short squeeze.Macy's is the picture of a tax-loss selling candidate, but the flip side of that understanding is that many tax-loss selling candidates are seen as good, bargain-hunting opportunities after the tax-loss selling is complete. The stock's resilience to selling interest today is apt to be helping its candidacy as a short-term, speculative rebound play.11:09TALKX Market Briefing: A mixed state of affairsThe stock market is mixed, and little changed, in today's early action. Buyers have reined in their efforts after Friday's post-employment report rally and ahead of a batch of key macro developments that will unfold this week, the most notable of which is the possible implementation of tariffs on Sunday of ~$160 billion worth of imported goods from China, most of which are consumer-oriented goods.Tucked in between will be the FOMC meeting, the ECB meeting, the UK election, and CPI and Retail Sales reports for November.Today, then, has the markings thus far of a wait-and-see day, yet the underlying bullish bias can still be described as bullish given the overall lack of selling interest with the market sitting close to an all-time high.The consumer discretionary sector (+0.3%), led by Amazon.com (AMZN 1758.58, +6.98, +0.4%), is today's bet-performing sector followed by the communication services sector (+0.2%), which is led by Alphabet (GOOG 1350.61, +9.99, +0.8%) and Facebook (FB 202.50, +1.45, +0.7%).Six sectors are up and five sectors are down in a reflection of the mixed state of things, which is also reflected in the recognition that the biggest sector winner is up just 0.3% while the biggest sector loser (industrials) is down just 0.2%.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.05%; the S&P 500 is flat; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000 are both down 0.1%.11:03APRE Aprea Therapeutics presents results from US and French Phase Ib/II clinical trials of APR-246 and azacitidine at ASH (29.62 +3.57)The trials evaluate the safety and efficacy of APR-246 in combination with azacitidine (AZA) for the treatment of TP53 mutated MDS and AML.U.S. Phase Ib/II clinical trial in patients with TP53 Mutant Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML):As of the data cutoff, the overall response rate (ORR) in 33 evaluable MDS patients was 88%, with a 61% complete remission (CR) rate, by International Working Group (IWG) criteria. With a median duration of follow-up of 10.8 months, the median duration of response was 8.4 months and the median duration of CR was 7.3 months. Seventeen (52%) evaluable MDS patients discontinued therapy to pursue stem cell transplant. Median overall survival (OS) for all enrolled patients (n=55) was 10.8 months. Median OS in responding patients versus non-responders was 13.7 vs. 3.9 months. Adverse events, regardless of causality, were mostly grade 1/2. Grade 3+ adverse events occurring in > or =20% of patients were limited to cytopenias and infection, consistent with underlying hematopoietic malignancies, and no exacerbation of the expected AZA-related safety profile has been observed.French Phase Ib/II clinical trial in MDS and AML:As of the data cutoff, the ORR in 24 evaluable MDS patients was 74%, with a 66% CR rate, based on IWG criteria. With a median duration of follow-up of 6.4 months, the median OS for all enrolled patients (n=53) had not been reached. In addition, all responding patients were alive at data cutoff. Relative to baseline, mutant TP53 variant allele frequency was significantly decreased in responding patients and undetectable in all patients who achieved a CR.10:44FTSV Forty Seven announces presentation of foundational preclinical data supporting development of FSI-174 in combination with magrolimab as novel all antibody conditioning regimen for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (24.81 +10.37)Forty Seven today announced preclinical proof-of-concept data for its novel all antibody conditioning regimen, comprised of FSI-174, its anti-cKIT antibody, and magrolimab, its anti-CD47 antibody. Preclinical studies in a non-human primate (NHP) model showed that the combination of FSI-174 and magrolimab significantly depleted hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from the bone marrow, with no dose limiting toxicities. The data will be presented in a poster session at the 61st American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.In the preclinical data presented at ASH, FSI-174 demonstrated binding affinity to both human and NHP cKIT receptors, and induced phagocytosis as well as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, FSI-174 was well-tolerated when administered to NHPs as a single agent, with no dose-limiting toxicities. The no-observed-adverse-effect level was established at 50 mg/kg, the highest dose tested. When administered together, FSI-174 and magrolimab demonstrated a synergistic benefit, promoting the highest level of phagocytosis of cKIT expressing target cells and inducing significant HSC depletion nine days after infusion compared to placebo.Forty Seven expects to complete investigational new drug-enabling studies by the end of 2019, and subject to approval of the IND by the FDA, plans to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating FSI-174 in healthy volunteers in the first quarter of 2020.10:39MRK Merck and Seven and Eight BioPharmaceuticals sign clinical research collaboration agreement (88.59 -0.26)Seven and Eight BioPharmaceuticals has signed a clinical research collaboration agreement with Merck, through a subsidiary, to explore the combination of Seven and Eight's BDB001, an immune modulator targeting toll-like receptors (TLR) 7 and 8, and Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), in treating patients with advanced solid tumors. Under the terms of the agreement, Seven and Eight will sponsor and be responsible for the conduct of the clinical study.10:36ATRA Atara Biotherapeutics reports updated long-term clinical results from multicenter Expanded Access Protocol study of tab-cel for patients with EBV+ PTLD (14.72 +0.73)Atara Biotherapeutics presented long-term clinical results from a multicenter Expanded Access Protocol (EAP) study of tab-cel (tabelecleucel) for patients with Epstein-Barr virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (EBV+ PTLD) at the ASH Annual Meeting & Exposition. Results from this analysis demonstrate a high overall response rate, short time to response, and favorable estimated long-term overall survival rates for tab-cel in patients with EBV+ PTLD following hematopoietic cell transplant or solid organ transplant who have failed rituximab-based therapy. Tab-cel was generally well-tolerated in all patients with EBV+ PTLD and other EBV-associated diseases.Safety analyses were presented for all patients treated with tab-cel (n=61; n=26 EBV+ PTLD and n=35 patients with other EBV-associated diseases). Consistent with prior studies, tab-cel was generally well-tolerated in all patients, and no tab-cel related adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred. Three graft versus host disease adverse events were reported, all in patients with prior allogeneic HCT. No other adverse events of special interest including cytokine release syndrome were reported.Median time to response of one month was seen in both EBV+ PTLD patient cohorts. In responders, two-year estimated overall survival rate was 86% for HCT (n=7) and 100% for SOT (n=10) with no patient deaths attributable to PTLD progression. Similar outcomes were observed in the EAP-201 subgroup of EBV+ PTLD patients (n=22) with adequate ECOG performance status, no CNS disease and no PLTD-related ventilatory support who would have likely met the eligibility criteria for Atara's ongoing tab-cel Phase 3 studies. Overall response rate was 55% and 82%, with a two-year estimated overall survival of 79% and 81%, in the HCT (n=11) and SOT (n=11) cohorts, respectively.10:32ACHN Achillion Pharma reports "positive" data from Phase 2 dose-finding study of danicopan at ASH (6.19 +0.02)Achillion Pharma today reported top-line data from a dose-finding Phase 2 trial assessing the safety and effectiveness of its oral small molecule factor D inhibitor danicopan (ACH-4471) in combination with intravenous eculizumab in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) patients who have an inadequate response to C5 monotherapy.The primary endpoint of the trial was an increase in hemoglobin from baseline. A mean increase of 2.4 g/dL at 24 weeks of treatment was achieved in this proof-of-concept trial. Danicopan, in combination with eculizumab, resulted in a significant reduction in blood transfusions with 10 patients receiving 34 transfusions (58 units) in the 6 months prior to screening to 1 patient receiving 1 transfusion (2 units) during the 24-week trial.In addition to improvements in hemoglobin and transfusions, there were also meaningful improvements in markers of hemolysis including bilirubin, reticulocytes, and PNH red blood clone size (%).In this clinical trial, danicopan was generally well tolerated. All treatment emergent adverse events were considered mild to moderate in severity except for Grade 3 severe adverse events that occurred in two patients. Both patients had resolution of their events, remained on danicopan, and completed the study.The company plans to initiate a global Phase 3 trial in early 2020.10:28NKTR Nektar Therapeutics announces presentation of new preclinical data for NKTR-255 at ASH (22.25 +1.80)NKTR-255 is an interleukin-15 (IL-15) receptor agonist that is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical study in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Details of the preclinical data presentations at ASH are as follows and are available on the scientific section of Nektar's website."The preclinical data being recognized at ASH demonstrate NKTR-255's promise in hematological malignancies through its potential to restore both NK cell and memory CD8 T cell compartments in patients," said Loui Madakamutil, Ph.D., SVP and Head of Discovery and Research at Nektar Therapeutics. "In studies presented by the laboratory of Dr. Nikhil Munshi at Dana-Farber, NKTR-255 enhanced the number and function of NK and CD8+ effector memory T cell populations in peripheral blood and bone marrow from patients with multiple myeloma and, also increased expression of activating receptors found on those NK cells. Separately, researchers from the laboratory of Dr. Cameron Turtle at Fred Hutchinson demonstrated NKTR-255 prevented tumor growth and increased survival of CAR T cells when added to a CD19-targeted CAR T cell regimen in models of B cell lymphoma. This preclinical data reinforces the basis of our ongoing clinical trial evaluating the potential of NKTR-255 in patients with multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."10:23XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (59.57 -0.18)The energy sector (-0.3%) displays relative weakness in the early going of today's session. Today's early underperformance comes after the sector gained 1.5% last week, finishing ahead of the remaining ten groups. Factors contributing to the underperformance:Pressure on the price of oil. WTI crude is down $0.27, or 0.5%, at $58.93/bbl. Granted, the energy component has climbed off its overnight low of $58.23 in recent trade, but it remains in negative territory, weighing on the energy sector. China reported a smaller than expected trade surplus for November, which supports the argument that the Chinese economy continues slowing down. This will continue posing a headwind to global growth. Pullback after last week's show of relative strength.Notable movers:Marathon Petroleum (MPC 58.95, -1.26, -2.1%): weakest sector component after being downgraded to Neutral from Overweight at JP Morgan. Chevron (CVX 117.27, -0.74, -0.6%): downgraded to Neutral from Buy at Citigroup. HollyFrontier (HFC 50.40, -0.54, -1.1%): trading at a three-month low. Occidental Petroleum (OXY 37.71, -0.51, -1.3%): on the verge of falling to a fresh 2019 low. Chevron (CVX 117.31, -0.70, -0.6%): looking to remain above its 50-day moving average (117.39). Baker Hughes (BKR 22.64, +0.43, +1.9%): showing relative strength in a weak sector.10:19CNST Constellation Pharmaceuticals provides updated preliminary data from MANIFEST clinical trial with CPI-0610 (56.82 +13.12)MANIFEST is an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of the company's bromodomain and extra-terminal domain protein inhibitor CPI-0610 in patients with myelofibrosis (MF). Arm 3 is evaluating CPI-0610 in combination with ruxolitinib in JAK-inhibitor-nave MF patients. Arms 1 and 2 are studying CPI-0610 as a monotherapy or in combination with ruxolitinib in ruxolitinib-resistant or -intolerant MF patients. Results include:Preliminary data showed continuing signs of activity across a broad range of parameters, suggesting possible disease-modifying effects of CPI-0610.In the first-line treatment arm, 12 out of 15 (80%) evaluable JAK-inhibitor-nave patients treated with a CPI-0610 / ruxolitinib combination achieved at least a 35% spleen volume response (SVR35) at 12 weeks. The median percent change in spleen volume reduction was -49.7%. Ten out of 14 (71%) evaluable patients achieved at least a 50% improvement in Total Symptom Score (TSS50) at 12 weeks. The median percent change in TSS at 12 weeks was -60.3%.Clinical activity, including SVR35 responses, TSS50 responses, and conversion from transfusion dependence to transfusion independence, was seen at 24 weeks in patients in the second-line treatment arm who added CPI-0610 to ruxolitinib, suggesting that treatment with CPI-0610 may have durable effects.CPI-0610 in combination with ruxolitinib in JAK-inhibitor-nave patients was generally well tolerated. No adverse events led to study discontinuation. Three patients (10%) had greater than or equal to Grade 3 anemia. One patient (3.3%) had Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, which was reversible. CPI-0610 as monotherapy or in combination with ruxolitinib in ruxolitinib-refractory or -intolerant patients (Arms 1 and 2) was generally well tolerated. The most common hematologic adverse event was thrombocytopenia.Constellation continues to enroll patients in MANIFEST. As a result of encouraging preliminary data, Constellation expanded Arm 3 of MANIFEST for JAK-inhibitor-nave patients from 43 to up to 101 patients. The company also expanded Cohort 2A, for TD ruxolitinib-resistant or -intolerant patients adding CPI-0610 to ruxolitinib, from 16 to up to 60 patients. Constellation has started planning for a randomized, active-controlled, pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial studying the combination of CPI-0610 and ruxolitinib versus ruxolitinib and placebo in JAK-inhibitor-nave patients with MF. The company expects this clinical trial to start in 2020.An investor event to discuss the MANIFEST update at ASH is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. EST today.10:18AGIO Agios Pharma presents updated data for mitapivat from extension phase of DRIVE PK Phase 2 study in patients with pyruvate kinase deficiency (44.64 +3.70)Agios Pharma today reported new data from the extension phase of the DRIVE PK Phase 2 study of mitapivat (AG-348) in adults with pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency at the 2019 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.In the extension phase, patients treated with mitapivat doses >25 mg twice daily in the core period undergo a dose taper and continue on a dose that maintained their Hb level at no lower than 1.0 g/dL below their pre-taper level. As of the March 27, 2019 data cutoff, 18 of the 36 patients remain in the extension phase with a median treatment duration of 35.6 months (range 28.7-41.9). For the 18 patients in the extension phase, improvements in hemoglobin and other markers of hemolysis including reticulocytes, indirect bilirubin, and haptoglobin achieved during the core period were sustained during the extension period up to 42 months, as of the data cutoff. Adverse events for patients who continued in the study (n=18) were comparable in the core and extension periods. In the extension, the most common AEs were headache (39%), insomnia (28%), fatigue (28%), and nasopharyngitis (28%). No new safety signals were identified in the extension period.The cumulative safety profile, says the company, continues to support long-term twice daily dosing of mitapivat.Mitapivat is an investigational, first-in-class, oral, small molecule allosteric activator of wild-type and a variety of mutated pyruvate kinase-R (PKR) enzymes that directly targets the underlying metabolic defect in PK deficiency, a rare, potentially debilitating, hemolytic anemia. In addition, data was shared from the Agios-sponsored Natural History Study of PK deficiency that detailed the comorbidities and complications associated with the disease and the impact of transfusion history.10:13OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:CLF Dec 9 calls are seeing interest following positive mention in Barrons with 3720 contracts trading vs. open int of 1570, pushing implied vol up around 6 points to ~50%.

The study was designed in two parts: Part A to establish an initial priming dose with flat dosing regimens and Part B to escalate dosing on subsequent administrations to the priming dose. Prophylactic treatment for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was mandated prior to each dose of XmAb13676. XmAb13676 was generally well tolerated, and a priming dose of 45 mcg/kg was chosen for continued dose escalation in Part B for patients with NHL. Safety was evaluated in all 53 patients. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were pyrexia (55%), CRS (53%), and anemia (41%). CRS was more frequent and generally higher grade on the first dose. Three patients (6%) experienced Grade 3 or 4 CRS on the first dose, all prior to the implementation of step-up dosing. AEs consistent with the symptoms of CRS, but not reported as such, were observed in an additional 23% of patients and were mild to moderate in severity.10:09SGEN Seattle Genetics and Takeda Pharma (TAK) announce additional analyses of results from ECHELON-1 and ECHELON-2 frontline phase 3 trials of ADCETRIS (116.36 -1.14)These analyses were presented at the 61st Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology. ADCETRIS (brentuximab vedotin) is an antibody-drug conjugate directed to CD30, a defining marker of classical Hodgkin lymphoma and expressed on the surface of several types of peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL). The ECHELON-1 analysis highlighted a four-year update of the phase 3 clinical trial in a poster presentation.ECHELON-1 is evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with AVD compared to ABVD in patients with Stage III or IV frontline classical Hodgkin lymphoma.As previously reported, the ECHELON-1 trial achieved its primary endpoint with the combination of ADCETRIS plus AVD resulting in a statistically significant improvement in modified progression-free survival compared to the control arm of ABVD as assessed by independent review facility. A four-year post-hoc exploratory analysis was conducted to examine PFS outcomes per investigator assessment in the intent-to-treat population of 1,334 patients, including results by PET2 status, age, stage and prognostic risk scores. Results include: The four-year PFS rate for patients in the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm was 81.7% compared to 75.1% in the ABVD arm, a difference of 6.6%. This represents a 31% reduction in the risk of progression or death. Median follow-up time was 48.4 months. A PFS benefit at four-years for ADCETRIS plus AVD was observed for all patients independent of PET2 status, including in patients who are less than 60 years old.Consistent improvement in PFS was observed among patients treated with ADCETRIS plus AVD compared with ABVD across the majority of pre-specified subgroups.As previously reported for the primary analysis, on the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm, peripheral neuropathy events were observed in 67% of patients compared to 43% in the ABVD arm. The four-year update shows that among patients with peripheral neuropathy, 83% in the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm and 84% in the ABVD arm reported complete resolution or improvement at last follow-up. The ECHELON-2 phase 3 clinical trial data were presented in an oral session at ASH and focused on the outcomes of the subset of patients who underwent consolidative stem cell transplant. ECHELON-2 is evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with CHP compared to CHOP in frontline CD30-expressing PTCL.As previously reported, the ECHELON-2 trial met its primary endpoint with the combination of ADCETRIS plus CHP resulting in a statistically significant improvement in PFS versus the control arm of CHOP per blinded independent central review. A post-hoc exploratory analysis evaluated the impact of consolidative stem cell transplant in the ECHELON-2 study for the patients who achieved CR treated with ADCETRIS plus CHP. In the ADCETRIS plus CHP arm, this included 38 patients in CR who received a stem cell transplant and 76 patients in CR who did not. Key findings of this analysis include:The PFS estimate favored the use of stem cell transplant (HR, 0.38; [95% CI: 0.18, 0.82]). After a median follow-up time of 35.9 months, the three-year PFS rate for the 38 patients who received a stem cell transplant was 76.1%. After a median follow-up time of 41.6 months, the three-year PFS rate for the 76 patients who did not receive a stem cell transplant was 53.3%. As previously reported, the safety profile of ADCETRIS plus CHP in the ECHELON-2 trial was comparable to CHOP and consistent with the established safety profile of ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy.10:08SWTX SpringWorks Therapeutics' collaborator GlaxoSmithKline presented data evaluating SpringWorks' nirogacestat alone and in combination with GlaxoSmithKline's belantamab mafodotin (27.00 +2.48)The data demonstrated that treatment of BCMA-expressing cancer cell lines with nirogacestat led to significantly increased levels of cell surface expression of BCMA and corresponding decreases in shedding of BCMA, as measured by levels of soluble BCMA. Further, the combination of nirogacestat and belantamab mafodotin resulted in synergistic increases in cancer cell killing as compared to belantamab mafodotin alone, with an up to ~3,000-fold improvement in cytotoxicity.09:40WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Stock market opens little changedThe major indices begin the day little changed.

It is the Company's intention to resume the Advantage Loan program as soon as management is confident its stated policies and procedures are being followed. However, it is presently difficult to estimate how long this suspension might last.The Advantage Loan program is a material component of the Bank's total loan originations. While it is difficult to quantify the financial impact of the program's temporary suspension, management anticipates a reduced level of near-term loan originations, slower overall loan portfolio growth, and less loan sales. However, management does not anticipate any credit related issues from previous loans made under the program due to the substantial amount of equity required for each borrower and the resulting strong collateral package for each loan. In order to mitigate the operational and financial impact of the Advantage Loan program's temporary suspension, the Company will continue to work on initiatives to diversify its overall loan production. Such initiatives include expanding the Bank's commercial lending efforts, including multifamily, tenant-in-common, construction, and commercial and industrial loans. In addition, management will continue to review new residential loan products that meet the needs of its customers in its served markets.08:13SCANX Gapping downGapping downIn reaction to disappointing earnings/guidance:THO -4.1%M&A news:DPLO -31.7% (to be acquired by UnitedHealth's (UNH) OptumRx for $4.00/share in cash)Other news:KALV -17.7% (announced results of the Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the use of KVD001) MNRL -4.4% (commences 11 mln common stock offering; 6 mln by the co and 5 mln by the selling stockholders) SYNH -3% (approves expansion and extension of the Company's existing stock repurchase program) AUPH -2.8% (commences registered underwritten public offering of $150 mln of its common shares) ERIC -0.7% (reaches resolution on US FCPA Investigations; combined payment of $1.06 bln) LITE -0.5% (to offer $850 mln aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2026)Analyst comments:M -2.1% (downgraded to Sell at Goldman)MMM -1.3% (downgraded to Neutral at Citigroup)ORLY -1.3% (downgraded to Neutral from Buy at Goldman)08:12APEI American Public Education Board authorizes program to repurchase up to an additional $25 mln of shares of the company's common stock (25.12 )08:10SCANX Gapping upGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:N/A.M&A news:THOR +168.5% (to be acquired by Sanofi (SNY) for $68/share in cash) XBIT +136.1% (to divest Human antibody Bermekimab targeting IL-1a to Janssen) ARQL +100.6% (to be acquired by Merck (MRK) for $20 per share in cash for an approximate total equity value of $2.7 billion) RRTS +10.9% (announces the sale of its Flatbed business unit for $30 mln in cash)Other news:FATE +25.1% (reports clinical data from Landmark Phase 1 studies; no dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients; also presents new in vivo preclinical data for FT596 -- company plans to initiate enrollment of first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in rarly 2020) OBSV +22.1% (reports positive Phase 3 trial results from PRIMROSE 2 trial of linzagolix) TGTX +22.1% (presents triple therapy data from Phase I/II study of ublituximab in combination with umbralisib and venetoclax) PCG +21% (reaches agreement to resolve wildfires from 2017 and 2018) CRTX +14% (reports new data revealing link between bacterial pathogen and genetic risk for Alzheimer's Disease) AGIO +12.4% (announces that clinical proof-of-concept has been established based on preliminary analysis of Phase 2 trial of mitapivat in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia) DTIL +9.4% (announces updated interim clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1 trial of its lead investigational off-the-shelf chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy candidate, PBCAR0191) RCKT +7.3% (presents "encouraging" preliminary results from its Phase 1 trial of commercial-grade RP-L102 "Process B" for Fanconi Anemia) ALEC +6.8% (presents Phase 1 data on AL002) SGMO +5.5% (Sangamo Therapeutics and Pfizer (PFE) report updated Phase 1/2 results showing sustained increased Factor VIII activity through 44 weeks) KPTI +5.3% (reports new and updated XPOVIO data demonstrating 56% overall response) BLUE +5% (Bluebirdbio and Bristol-Myers (BMY) report "positive" top-line results from Ph 2 KarMMa study of ide-cel; met its primary endpoint and key secondary endpoint) APTO +3.9% (reports early clinical observations with CG-806 and APTO-253) CGC +3.3% (names David Klein CEO effective January 14) AM +2.9% (to repurchase $100 mln of shares from Antero Resources) CSIQ +2.8% (authorizes $150 mln share repurchase program) BMY +2.3% (presents data from multiple studies evaluating lisocabtagene maraleucel at ASH) MNK +2.1% (presents data on a novel predictive model to identify infants at risk for infantile spasms) SESN +1.7% (initiated the submission of its BLA for Vicinium for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer under Rolling Review to the FDA)MBIO +1.3% (highlights presentation of updated Phase 1/2 clinical data for MB-107 lentiviral gene therapy for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency)Analyst comments:QRVO +3.4% (upgraded to Buy from Underperform at BofA/Merrill)SWKS +2.2% (upgraded to Buy from Underpeform at BofA/Merrill)NUE +1.4% (upgraded to Buy at Longbow)STLD +1.1% (upgraded to Buy at Longbow)08:10BONDX Overnight Treasury Market SummaryRebound in ProgressU.S. Treasuries will attempt to snap their three-day skid after Treasury futures inched higher during a quiet overnight session.

Weiss, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are highly encouraged by the first clinical data presented from our once daily, BTK inhibitor, TG-1701, which has demonstrated superior selectivity for BTK compared to ibrutinib in an in vitro whole kinome screening. The data presented today show that TG-1701 is an active BTK inhibitor as a single agent and that the combination of U2 plus TG-1701 has been generally well tolerated and active with 6 of 7 patients responding to the triple therapy at 100 mg QD, the lowest dose of TG-1701 tested. We look forward to continuing dose escalation of TG-1701 in the combination arm and identifying the optimal dose for this therapy." Mr. Weiss continued, "Our goal has always been to develop the best possible combination treatment options for patients, and we are excited to present the first data from a triple combination study in which all of the agents are being developed by TG. We believe this proprietary combination has the potential to enhance the results of BTK inhibitor therapy alone and offer patients early and deep responses with a tolerable safety profile."08:02GALT Galectin Therapeutics announces publication of results from its NASH-CX Phase 2 clinical trial in NASH cirrhosis in the peer-reviewed journal Gastroenterology (2.99 )The paper outlines that in a phase 2b study of 162 patients with NASH, cirrhosis, and portal hypertension, one year of biweekly infusion of belapectin was safe but not associated with significant reduction in HVPG or fibrosis, compared with placebo. However, in a subgroup analysis of patients without esophageal varices, 2 mg/kg belapectin (GR-MD-02) did reduce HVPG and development of varices. This subgroup analysis suggests that there may be benefits from belapectin in patients with NASH cirrhosis without esophageal varices. Further, if this observation can be reproduced in subsequent studies, belapectin may have a role in the management of patients with NASH cirrhosis and portal hypertension but no varices.08:01REPL Replimune names Jean M.

This was comparable to historical data with multiple doses of busulfan conditioning.CD117-ADC was well tolerated in non-human primates with no evidence of the often severe side effects seen with busulfan conditioning, including veno-occlusive disease, weight loss, diarrhea, mucositis, vomiting, pulmonary fibrosis or seizures.07:42TPX Tempur Sealy Int'l determines that it will record a charge of $30 mln (before tax) in Q4 in connection with the bankruptcy of one of its customers (85.89 )On December 6, 2019, Tempur Sealy determined that it will record a charge of $30 mln (before tax) in the fourth quarter of 2019, in connection with the bankruptcy of one of its customers, Mattress PAL Holding, LLC, and the resulting significant liquidity issues of Mattress PAL's affiliates (collectively, "Mattress1One"). On April 7, 2019, Mattress PAL filed a voluntary petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code ("Chapter 11 Proceedings"). On December 5, the Bankruptcy Court orally granted Mattress PAL's request to convert the Chapter 11 Proceedings to a Chapter 7 liquidation case. The company plans to treat this charge, which does not involve any cash payments, as an adjustment in calculating adjusted EBITDA under the company's senior secured credit agreement.

Among Cohort A, gradual clinical benefit in the clearance of chronic norovirus and associated improved abdominal complaints, malabsorption, growth and IgG production were observed, and four patients were able to cease immunoglobulin replacement therapy.While the results were positive, the relatively inefficient transduction of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) required large quantities of vector. This resulted in relatively low VCN in myeloid cells in some patients, with delayed immune cell recovery and persistent clinical disease, especially in the last patient treated (patient 8). To address this, NIH developed a refined enhanced transduction (ET) procedure consisting of a single overnight transduction after 48 hours pre-stimulation in cytokines (Stem cell factor, Thrombopoietin, Flt3-ligand; 100ng/mL) and incorporated transduction enhancers LentiBoost 1:100 and dimethyl prostaglandin 2 (dmPGE2; 1uM).The presentation at the 2019 ASH Annual Meeting included data from six patients (referred to as Cohort B) treated by NIH, including re-treatment of patient 8. The patients, who were aged 12 to 36, had significant problems with donor T cell infiltration of liver, bone marrow and kidneys, and were nearly absent of B and NK cells. The enhanced transduction procedure achieved much greater transduction efficiencies than were observed in Cohort A, with greater than 10-fold less vector, and resulted in faster immune reconstitution and more significant clinical benefit by 3 months.07:33AR Antero Resources highlights agreements expected to reduce its gathering, processing and transportation costs by approximately $350 mln over the next four years, commences asset sale program targeting $750 mln to $1 bln in proceeds to be completed in 2020 (2.19 )The agreements include a growth incentive fee program with Antero Midstream Corporation (AM) that aligns with the Company's current 8% to 10% compound annual production growth plan through 2021 and additional agreements with other third party midstream providers.

All response-evaluable patients experienced tumor reduction (complete response + partial response + stable disease) following treatment with ADCETRIS in combination with OPDIVO. Median duration of response was not yet reached and the maximum duration of response was 22 months and ongoing (95% CI: 7.06, -). The most common treatment-related adverse events of any grade occurring in at least 20 percent of patients were fatigue, diarrhea, pyrexia, infusion related reaction, peripheral motor neuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy and increase in lipase. One treatment-related serious adverse event was pyrexia. Fifty-seven percent of patients (12/21) had at least one treatment-related adverse event greater than or equal to Grade 3, most commonly increase in lipase (24 percent, 5/21), peripheral motor neuropathy and peripheral sensory neuropathy (each 14 percent, 3/21), and fatigue and hyponatremia (each 10 percent, 2/21). Two-Year Follow-up Results from the Phase 1-2 Study of Brentuximab Vedotin in Combination with Nivolumab in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (Abstract #238, oral presentation at 2:45 p.m. ET on Saturday, December 7, 2019) Of the 91 treated patients, 85 percent (77/91) had an objective response, including 67 percent (61/91) with a complete response, 16 patients with a partial response and six patients had stable disease. Of the 91 treated patients, 67 patients received an ASCT per trial protocol with no additional salvage therapy. For all treated patients, the two-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 79 percent (95% CI: 68%, 87%). For the 67 patients who received an ASCT per trial protocol, the two-year PFS was 92 percent (95% CI: 80%, 97%). Median follow-up for all treated patients was 24.2 months (range 1.8-41.7) and the median PFS was not reached. Estimated overall survival at two years was 94 percent (95% CI: 85%, 97%) and median overall survival was not yet reached. Peripheral immune signatures were consistent with an activated T-cell response. Prior to ASCT, the most common adverse events of any grade occurring in more than 20 percent of patients were nausea, infusion related reaction, fatigue, diarrhea, pruritus, headache, vomiting and pyrexia. Other adverse events included peripheral neuropathy in 16 patients (18 percent) and neutropenia in six patients (7 percent). Two patients (2 percent) discontinued treatment due to adverse events, Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy and increased gamma-glutamyltransferase. Serious adverse events occurred in 14 patients (15 percent), including pneumonia, pneumonitis and pyrexia (two patients each); and Grade 3 Guillain-Barre syndrome (one patient).06:52GILD Gilead Sciences reports Long-term data from ZUMA-1 demonstrating about half of refractory large b-cell lymphoma patients were alive three years after Yescarta treatment (67.08 )Co announced new data from the ZUMA-1 trial of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) in adult patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma. These results included updated overall survival data from the pivotal phase 2 study after three years following a single infusion of Yescarta, as well as an analysis from a separate safety management cohort of patients receiving early steroid intervention for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events. Updated results from a separate ZUMA-1 safety management study (Cohort 4) were also presented at the meeting (Abstract #243). In this analysis, patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma treated with Yescarta received earlier steroid intervention, beginning when patients experienced Grade 1 neurologic events or experienced Grade 1 CRS with no improvement after three days of supportive care. Patients could receive optional bridging chemotherapy prior to Yescarta infusion. In the analysis, 41 patients had received Yescarta, with a median follow-up of 8.7 months; 73% of patients received corticosteroids and 76% received tocilizumab. Earlier steroid use appeared to decrease the percentage of patients with Grade > or =3 CRS (2%) and neurologic events (17%), each of which were numerically lower than rates in the registrational cohorts of ZUMA-1 (13% CRS, 31% neurologic events). There were no Grade 4 or 5 CRS or neurologic events and no Grade 5 AEs related to Yescarta in Cohort 4. Objective response rate per investigator assessment was 73% in Cohort 4, with 51% of patients achieving a complete response. The median duration of response was 8.9 months. Fifty-four percent of patients in this cohort remained in an ongoing response with at least six months of follow-up after Yescarta infusion. Median OS in Cohort 4 has not been reached.06:51CRTX Cortexyme reports new data revealing link between bacterial pathogen and genetic risk for Alzheimer's Disease (28.31 )Co announced the presentation of new data supporting the on-target activity of COR388, its lead investigational medicine, and linking the "gingipain hypothesis" for Alzheimer's disease (AD) to the significance of the APOE gene as a major risk factor for the disease.Gingipains from P. gingivalis cleave ApoE proteins and have a preference for cleaving ApoE4; and COR388, a gingipain inhibitor, prevents this. In in vitro experiments, cells infected with P. gingivalis exhibited gingipain-dependent ApoE cleavage activity that generated ApoE fragments similar to what was seen in the brains and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, uninfected cells had no significant ApoE protein-cleaving activity. Furthermore, P. gingivalis gingipains cleaved ApoE4 more readily than ApoE3. Finally, in the infected cells, COR388 alone was sufficient to block ApoE fragmentation. In a Phase 1b trial, COR388 reduced ApoE fragments in CSF. Cortexyme's Phase 1 clinical development program for COR388 included cohorts of healthy volunteers and subjects with Alzheimer's disease. In addition to assessing safety and initial clinical activity, investigators also assessed the level of ApoE fragmentation in the CSF of nine subjects with Alzheimer's disease. Six subjects received 50mg of COR388 twice daily while three subjects received placebo. After 28 days, a statistically significant decrease in ApoE fragments (both ApoE4 and ApoE3) was observed in subjects treated with COR388 versus those treated with placebo.06:51EGRX Eagle Pharma commences dosing in pilot study for novel estrogen receptor antagonist product candidate (56.43 )The company has commenced dosing in a pilot clinical study to assess the unique characteristics of its fulvestrant product candidate, which has the potential to enhance estrogen receptor ("ER") inhibition and improve outcomes for patients with ER-positive breast cancer.

All results are as of the data cutoff date of August 26, 2019.Groups A and B:As of the data cutoff date, seven out of nine total patients in Groups A and B (five out of seven in Group A and two out of two in Group B) did not require regular RBC transfusions post-treatment. Overall, patients in Groups A and B experienced a reduction, but not complete elimination of VOC and ACS events at two years post-treatment, suggesting that the levels of gene therapy-derived hemoglobin may have been sufficient to reduce but not eliminate continued sickle-related disease manifestations. Group C As of the data cutoff date, 17 patients were treated with LentiGlobin for SCD in Group C, with the longest follow-up at 21 months; none required regular RBC transfusions post-treatment. In patients with six or more months of follow-up (n=12), median levels of gene therapy-derived anti-sickling hemoglobin, HbAT87Q, were at least 40% of total hemoglobin. Total hemoglobin and HbAT87Q levels ranged from 9.3 -- 15.2 g/dL and 2.7 -- 9.0 g/dL, respectively, at last visit. Treatment with LentiGlobin for SCD reduced key markers of hemolysis, including reticulocyte counts, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and total bilirubin concentration, which suggests that treatment is improving biological markers of the disease. Among the nine patients with at least six months of follow-up who had four or more VOC or ACS events in the two years prior to treatment, there was a 99% reduction in annualized rate of VOC and ACS. There were no reports of ACS or serious VOC at up to 21 months post-treatment in these patients. As previously reported, there was one non-serious Grade 2 VOC was observed in a patient approximately 3.5 months post-LentiGlobin for SCD treatment.HGB-206 Exploratory Assays bluebird bio presented results from exploratory assays in samples from a subset of patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD from Groups A, B and C, to assess the relationship between drug product characteristics and RBC physiology. To demonstrate the pancellular expression of the gene therapy derived anti-sickling Hb, HbAT87Q, bluebird bio developed an assay that enables detection of HbAT87Q and HbS protein in individual RBCs. In 12 patients who had at least six months of follow-up, the proportion of RBCs positive for HbAT87Q at the last study visit was more than 70% in all cases; with more than 90% of RBCs positive for HbAT87Q in four patients.On average, HbAT87Q present in RBCs of patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD was within the range of non-sickling adult Hb, HbA, present in the RBCs from people with sickle cell trait. The RBCs also resembled sickle cell trait RBCs with regard to propensity to sickle under low oxygen conditions. Sickling of RBCs from patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD was significantly less than that seen in untreated patients with SCD.06:49MNK Mallinckrodt plc presents data on a novel predictive model to identify infants at risk for infantile spasms (3.41 )Co announced findings on the use of a novel predictive model designed to more quickly identify infants with infantile spasms (IS), a rare seizure disorder that typically occurs between three and seven months of age. Key FindingsDeductive models developed to identify the combinations of variables that predict IS prior to diagnosis and during the treatment pathway: 557 patients had =2 symptoms pertaining to IS -- seizures, developmental delay, lack of eye contact and lack of muscle tone -- and a moderate or high severity ED visit. In this group, 55 percent of patients (n=304) had an IS diagnosis within a median 0.8 months of the triggering event. The most notable deductive combinations focused on pre-diagnosis of IS. MethodsThe study utilized data from the Symphony Health Integrated Dataverse database to identify triggers for early identification of IS patients from medical and pharmacy claims from 10.8 million patients under 2 years of age between May 2017 and April 2018. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) procedure codes were evaluated to identify the codes most likely to predict a subsequent diagnosis of IS. Researchers also used input from IS medical experts to determine the clinical, electrographic, radiologic, procedural and medication variables that may predict IS development.06:48SGMO Sangamo Therapeutics announces preliminary results from first three patients treated in Phase 1/2 THALES study evaluating investigational ST-400 ex vivo gene-edited cell therapy in transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (11.66 )The three patients treated with ST-400 experienced prompt hematopoietic reconstitution, demonstrating neutrophil engraftment in 14-22 days and platelet engraftment in 22-35 days (Table 1). No emerging clonal hematopoiesis has to date been observed by on-target indel pattern monitoring in the three treated patients. Reported adverse events (AEs) are consistent with the known toxicities of mobilization, apheresis, and myeloablative busulfan conditioning. One serious adverse event (SAE) related to ST-400 was reported. As previously disclosed, Patient 1 experienced hypersensitivity during ST-400 infusion considered by the investigator to be likely related to the product cryoprotectant excipient, DMSO, and which resolved by the end of the infusion.06:47LITE Lumentum to offer $850 mln aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2026 (72.08 )Lumentum intends to use approximately $196 million of the net proceeds of the offering to repay in full all amounts outstanding under its term loan credit facility, and a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to purchase up to approximately $200 million of its common stock concurrently with the pricing of this offering in privately negotiated transactions effected through the initial purchaser of the notes or its affiliates as its agent.

There were no pembrolizumab immune-related toxicities and the majority of grade 3 or higher adverse events were hematological. Low levels of serum cytokines are consistent with the observed low levels of CRS and neurotoxicity. Across all tested doses 5 patients achieved a complete response, with 4 of 5 complete responses ongoing, the longest at 18 months. All CRs were achieved without need for steroid or tocilizumab-based management of the patients or ICU level care.AUTO3 -- (Poster) - Phase 1/2 AMELIA clinical trial of AUTO3 in patients with relapsed/refractory pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pALL) (Abstract # 2620)AUTO3 was well-tolerated overall, with no patients experiencing = Grade 3 CRS and no patients experiencing > or = Grade 2 neurotoxicity, in doses > or =3x106 /kg CAR-T cells. No AUTO3-related deaths were reported.Among the 10 CAR T-nave patients, at a median follow-up time of 9.7 months (range 1.8- 18), 9 of 10 patients (90%) achieved a complete response, and 8 of 10 (80%) achieved complete molecular remission by PCR. Estimated overall survival at 12 months was 100%. There are 2 ongoing patients in complete molecular remission at 12 and 15 months post-AUTO3 infusion, respectively. The most common cause of relapse was due to loss of CAR T-cell persistence. The median persistence of CAR-T cells in blood was 170 days.06:29STOK Stoke Therapeutics presents new preclinical data on STK-001 for the treatment of Dravet syndrome (28.98 )Data from studies in non-human primates (NHP) showed STK-001 distributed throughout the brain and achieved target engagement and increased Nav1.1 protein expression throughout the cortex after a single intrathecal injection. Safety findings showed STK-001 to be well-tolerated at the two intrathecal dose levels studied. These data were presented in a poster session at the American Epilepsy Society (AES) Annual Meeting in Baltimore.Stoke plans to submit an investigational new drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in early 2020 and, subject to acceptance of the IND, plans to initiate a Phase 1/2 single-ascending dose study in children and adolescents with Dravet syndrome in the first half of 2020.06:28FATE Fate Therapeutics presents new in vivo preclinical data for FT596 -- company plans to initiate enrollment of first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in rarly 2020 (13.67 )FT596 is the first cellular immunotherapy engineered with three active anti-tumor components to be cleared for clinical investigation by the FDA. In addition to a proprietary CAR targeting CD19, FT596 expresses a novel high-affinity, non-cleavable CD16 (hnCD16) Fc receptor that has been modified to augment antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, enabling coincident targeting of CD19 and additional tumor-associated antigens such as CD20. FT596 also expresses an interleukin-15 receptor fusion (IL-15RF), a potent cytokine complex that promotes survival, proliferation and trans-activation of NK cells and CD8 T cells without the need for systemic cytokine support. Together, these features of FT596 are intended to maximize potency and minimize toxicity in treated patients. The Company plans to initiate enrollment of a first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in early 2020.New preclinical data presented at ASH showed that FT596 administered as a monotherapy exhibited durable tumor clearance and extended survival in vivo similar to primary CAR T cells in a humanized mouse model of CD19+ lymphoma. Additionally, when combined with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab, FT596 showed enhanced killing of CD20+ lymphoma cells in vivo as compared to rituximab alone. These data confirm previously presented in vitro findings that demonstrate the unique multi-antigen targeting functionality of FT596, and the product candidate's potential to effectively overcome CD19 antigen escape.The Company also announced that, in preparation for Phase 1 initiation, it had recently completed GMP production of FT596. In a single small-scale manufacturing campaign, the Company produced over 300 cryopreserved, infusion-ready doses of FT596 at a cost of approximately $2,500 per dose. The Company's iPSC product platform unites stem cell biology and precision genetic engineering to create renewable master engineered iPSC lines that can be repeatedly used to mass produce cancer-fighting immune cells, replacing the high production costs, weeks of manufacturing time, and complex manufacturing processes required for current-generation CAR T-cell immunotherapies with a lower-cost, easier-to-manufacture, well-characterized, off-the-shelf product that has the potential to reach many more patients.06:27SGMO Sangamo Therapeutics and Pfizer (PFE) report updated Phase 1/2 results showing sustained increased Factor VIII activity through 44 weeks (11.66 )Sangamo Therapeutics (SGMO) and Pfizer (PFE) announced updated follow-up results from the Phase 1/2 Alta study evaluating investigational SB-525 gene therapy in patients with severe hemophilia A. The data showed that SB-525 was generally well tolerated and demonstrated sustained increased Factor VIII (FVIII) levels following treatment with SB-525 through to 44 weeks, the extent of follow-up for the longest treated patient in the 3e13 vg/kg dose cohort.06:27KURA Kura Oncology provides clinical and regulatory updates for lead drug candidate, tipifarnib, in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (15.61 )In June 2019, Kura reported that the primary efficacy endpoint was achieved in each of the expansion cohorts in its Phase 2 trial of tipifarnib in relapsed or refractory PTCL: 1) patients with AITL, an aggressive form of T-cell lymphoma often characterized by high levels of CXCL12 expression, and 2) patients with PTCL who lack a single nucleotide variation in the 3'-untranslated region of the CXCL12 gene. Given the high level of activity observed among AITL patients, Kura continued to enroll patients to acquire more experience regarding safety and tolerability in this population. Based upon the 2016 revision of the World Health Organization classification of lymphoid neoplasms1, AITL and AITL-like histologies represent approximately one-third of all PTCL cases.As of the November 11, 2019 data cutoff date, a total of 26 patients with relapsed or refractory AITL were enrolled in all stages of the trial. Among the 20 patients evaluable for efficacy, five achieved a complete response (CR) and five achieved a partial response (PR), for an objective response rate (ORR) of 50% on an evaluable basis and 38% on an intent-to-treat basis. In addition, three patients experienced disease stabilization. Patients had a median of three prior regimens (range 1-7).Next-generation sequencing of 19 available patient biopsies showed that 10 (53%) carried C336R/Q386E variants in the killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) 3DL2, an immune checkpoint receptor. Four of the 10 patients with KIR3DL2 variants achieved a CR and three achieved a PR, for a CR rate of 40% and an ORR of 70%. This compares to a CR rate of 11% and an ORR of 22% among the nine AITL patients with KIR3DL2 wild type.Regulatory Update: Following FDA feedback from an end-of-Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting, Kura plans to initiate a Phase 2 registration-directed trial of tipifarnib in patients with relapsed or refractory AITL and related lymphomas in 2020. The multi-center, single-arm trial will target enrollment of 128 patients with AITL and AITL-like histologies who are relapsed or refractory to at least one prior systemic cytotoxic therapy.06:26PTLA Portola Pharma presents new interim results from ongoing Phase 2a study of cerdulatinib in patients with specific subtypes of T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (29.21 )As of the November 12, 2019 cut-off date, 64 PTCL patients and 40 CTCL patients treated with cerdulatinib as a single agent were evaluable for response. The overall response rate (ORR) was 34% in the PTCL cohort and 43% in the CTCL cohort. Among the subset of patients in the PTCL cohort with AITL, the ORR was 52% and the complete response rate (CR) was 37%.Among the 64 patients in the PTCL cohort, 14 patients (22%) achieved a CR and eight patients (12%) achieved a partial response (PR). In the subgroup of 27 patients with AITL, 10 patients (37%) achieved a CR, and four patients (15%) achieved a PR. The median duration of response is eight months for all PTCL patients and is greater than nine months in AITL patients. Follow-up is ongoing. Among the 40 patients in the CTCL cohort, three patients (8%) achieved a CR and 14 patients (35%) achieved a PR. Importantly, rapid improvements in pruritus, or severe itching -- a common and often serious condition associated with CTCL -- have been observed, as measured by the Likert scale.Cerdulatinib demonstrated good tolerability in both PTCL and CTCL. The most common Grade 3 or greater adverse events across the PTCL and CTCL cohorts with a frequency > 5% were lipase increase (25%), amylase increase (19%), neutropenia (12%), anemia (10%), diarrhea (8%), sepsis/bacteremia (6%), and febrile neutropenia (4%). The lipase and amylase changes were generally asymptomatic and not associated with pancreatitis.06:25XENE Xenon Pharmaceuticals provides updates on partnered neurology pipeline programs (13.95 )Xenon Pharmaceuticals announced that it will provide updates on its partnered epilepsy programs at the American Epilepsy Society Annual Meeting.Overview of clinical stage XEN901 and Related Patient Survey to be Presented in the "Genetic Epilepsies -- Updates in the Science and Diagnosis" on December 8th.Pre-clinical work suggests selective sodium channel inhibitors that reduce action potential firing in excitatory neurons, while sparing inhibitory interneurons, may provide promising drug profile.06:25IMV IMV presents updated results from SPiReL at ASH (2.83 )The poster, which included additional data collected between the abstract submission and the presentation, continued to demonstrate a favorable therapeutic profile and treatment-associated clinical benefit in r/r DLBCL patients who received the DPX-Survivac combination regimen.06:24QURE uniQure presents updated clinical data on three patients treated in ongoing Phase IIb study of etranacogene dezaparvovec; additionally presents up to 4 years of follow-up data on the 10 patients in the Phase I/II trial of AMT-060 (66.05 )At Least One Year of Stable, Therapeutic Levels of FIX Activity in Patients Treated with Etranacogene Dezaparvovec: Featured in a poster presentation at ASH, the 52 weeks of follow-up data show that all three patients have stabilized and sustained FIX activity at therapeutic levels after the one-time administration of etranacogene dezaparvovec. Mean FIX activity for the three patients at 52 weeks after administration was 41% of normal, with the first patient achieving FIX activity of 50% of normal, the second patient achieving FIX activity of 31% of normal and the third patient achieving FIX activity of 41% of normal. The second and third patients had previously screen-failed and were excluded from another gene therapy study due to pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to a different AAV vector. Reported FIX activity was measured using an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay performed at a central laboratory.At one year after dosing, no patient in the study has reported any bleeding events. All patients have remained free of prophylaxis after receiving etranacogene dezaparvovec. One patient, who had earlier in the study undergone hip surgery due to a pre-existing condition, experienced back pain and treated himself with a single infusion of factor replacement, which was later determined by the patient and the investigator to be unrelated to a bleed. No other FIX infusions were reported by any patient.Stable FIX Expression and Durable Reductions in Bleeding and FIX Consumption for up to 4 Years Following AMT-060 Gene Therapy:In the ongoing Phase I/II study of AMT-060, all 10 patients continue to show long-term clinical benefit, including sustained increases in FIX activity, reduced usage of FIX replacement therapy, and decreased bleeding frequency. At up to 4 years of follow-up, AMT-060 continues to be well-tolerated, with no new serious adverse events and no development of inhibitors since the last reported data.All five patients in the second dose cohort of 2x1013 gc/kg (the dose being studied in the ongoing Phase III HOPE-B study of etranacogene dezaparvovec) continue to be free of routine FIX replacement therapy at 3.5 years after treatment. Based on the six months of data collected during the fourth year of follow-up, the mean annualized bleeding rate was zero compared to an average of 4 bleeds during the year prior to treatment, representing a 100% reduction. During this same period, the usage of FIX replacement therapy also declined 100% compared to the year prior to treatment. Mean FIX activity over 3.5 years was 7.5%.06:22FATE Fate Therapeutics reports clinical data from Landmark Phase 1 studies; no dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients (13.67 )Fate Therapeutics announced initial clinical data for its FT516 and FT500 off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived natural killer (NK) cell product candidates.No morphologic evidence of leukemia and complete neutrophil recovery observed in first patient treated with FT516 Monotherapy for AML following first dosing cycleNo dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients treated with FT500 for advanced solid tumorsFavorable FT500 Phase 1 Safety, Tolerability and Immunogenicity profile validates novel multi-dose treatment paradigm for off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived NK cell products.06:22BMY Bristol-Myers presents data from multiple studies evaluating lisocabtagene maraleucel at ASH (59.95 )These studies included an evaluation of liso-cel in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) (TRANSCEND CLL 004); a study in second-line patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients who were ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) (PILOT); and a separate analysis of patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma who received liso-cel in the outpatient setting across three studies."The results in relapsed or refractory CLL and SLL demonstrated a high rate of durable complete responses achieved in heavily pre-treated patients, including patients who have failed ibrutinib and venetoclax. We are encouraged by the potential of liso-cel to treat second-line relapsed or refractory large B-cell NHL patients who are not able to undergo a stem cell transplant. Finally, the analysis evaluating liso-cel administered in the outpatient setting demonstrates that not all patients require hospitalization and that the safety and efficacy profile across a variety of types of clinical sites is consistent."06:20LLY Eli Lilly presents interim clinical data from the LOXO-305 global Phase 1/2 BRUIN dose escalation trial (119.64 )At all doses studied, LOXO-305 delivered objective responses in patients who had received diverse prior therapies and had exhibited varied molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance.Of 16 CLL patients enrolled, there were 10 responders (8 partial responses, 2 partial response with ongoing lymphocytosis) among 13 patients eligible for response assessment, resulting in a 77% ORR. All patients with CLL have demonstrated tumor reduction, with evidence of deepening response over time. Responses were observed in patients with acquired resistance to prior BTK therapy (those with and without C481S mutations), in patients who were intolerant to prior BTK therapy, and in patients with acquired resistance to prior BCL2 therapy (including one with a known BCL G101V mutation). As expected, LOXO-305 treatment causes acute lymphocytosis, which resolves over time -- a well described pharmacodynamic response associated with effective BTK inhibition. Of the three CLL patients not yet eligible for response assessment (one with the BTK C481S mutation), all three have demonstrated lymphocytosis early in cycle 1. All CLL responding patients remain in response, and all CLL patients remain on study. Of eight MCL patients enrolled, there were three responses (1 complete response, 2 partial responses) among six patients eligible for response assessment, resulting in a 50% ORR. Two of the responders had progressed on prior BTK therapy (but without a documented C481x mutation). All MCL responding patients remain in response and on study. Three MCL patients discontinued therapy in cycle 1 due to progressive disease.Most treatment-emergent adverse events were Grade 1 in severity with the most commonly reported events, regardless of attribution, being fatigue (25% total: 21% Grade 1, 4% Grade 2) and diarrhea (18% total: 14% Grade 1, 4% Grade 2). Two adverse events > or =Grade 3 were attributed to LOXO-305 (Grade 3 leukocytosis and Grade 3 transient neutropenia). No dose limiting toxicities were reported and an MTD had not been reached.06:19AZN AstraZeneca reports full results from Phase III ELEVATE TN trial (47.68 )AstraZeneca presented results from the interim analysis of the Phase III ELEVATE TN trial, showing that CALQUENCE (acalabrutinib) combined with obinutuzumab or as monotherapy significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab, a standard chemo-immunotherapy treatment, in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia.In an exploratory analysis, CALQUENCE in combination or alone demonstrated consistent PFS improvements across most pre-specified subgroups of patients with high-risk disease characteristics, including the unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable gene (IGHV), del(11q) and complex karyotype. Overall, the safety and tolerability profile of CALQUENCE observed in the ELEVATE TN trial was consistent with its known profile.06:19BGNE BeiGene presents clinical data from three trials of its BTK inhibitor BRUKINSA at ASH (186.92 )In two oral presentations of BRUKINSA in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), the drug candidate demonstrated consistent safety and a high overall response rate (ORR); in the poster presentation of BRUKINSA combined with BeiGene's investigational anti-PD-1 antibody tislelizumab in patients with previously treated B-cell malignancies, the combination treatment showed preliminary efficacy and was generally well tolerated."The results presented today on BRUKINSA, a BTK inhibitor designed to maximize target occupancy and minimize off-target binding, demonstrated robust clinical activity and a safety profile consistent with what we've observed to date in our clinical trials, including safety data that supported the recent U.S. FDA accelerated approval in patients with previously treated mantle cell lymphoma," said Jane Huang, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, hematology at BeiGene. "CLL or SLL is the most common type of leukemia in adults, and despite the advancements of BTK inhibitor therapy for these cancers, there remains a need for highly selective BTK inhibitors capable of promoting long-term responses, and with a safety profile that is tolerable over time. The results presented here today further demonstrate the potential for BRUKINSA to help people living with these persistent, life-threatening cancers."06:18RCKT Rocket Pharmaceuticals presents "encouraging" preliminary results from its Phase 1 trial of commercial-grade RP-L102 'Process B' for Fanconi Anemia (22.37 )Results presented in the poster highlight preliminary Phase 1 data from two pediatric patients (age 5 and 6 years) who were treated with "Process B" RP-L102 prior to the development of severe bone marrow failure and are in ongoing follow-up. Drug product was successfully manufactured using "Process B" optimization, including transduction enhancers, commercial-grade vector, and modified cell processing. "Process B" drug product is manufactured to commercial grade standards, allowing for consistent drug product across patients and a vector copy number (VCN) two to three fold higher than that administered to optimally-treated "Process A" patients.Once transduced, drug product was infused fresh into patients without any prior conditioning regimen. To evaluate transduction efficiency, an analysis of the proportion of the MMC-resistant colony forming cells was conducted. Both patients exhibited early signs of engraftment based on peripheral blood, VCN and/or MMC-resistance. Preliminary phenotypic correction was also apparent in both patients, as evidenced by stabilization or increases in blood cell lineages. No safety or tolerability issues have been reported.06:18ABBV AbbVie reports new results from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE clinical trial showing the potential of this fixed-duration combination therapy (86.98 )AbbVie announced new data from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE (PCYC-1142) clinical trial, evaluating IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) in combination with VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO (venetoclax) in previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Results showed that patients who received up to 12 cycles of the combination regimen achieved high rates of undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD) in both peripheral blood (PB; 75% of patients) and in bone marrow (BM; 72% of patients). Safety data were consistent with the known safety profiles of IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO used as individual therapies.Results showed uMRD -- defined as less than 1 CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes (MRD<0.01%) by flow cytometry of PB or BM samples -- was achieved at any time after baseline in PB for 75% of patients (122 of 163 patients) and in BM for 72% (111 of 155 patients). The proportion of patients who had uMRD in PB increased over time from 57% after 6 cycles, 68% after 9 cycles, and 73% after 12 cycles of IMBRUVICA plus VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO. The high rates of uMRD in BM were consistent across high-risk subgroups, including in patients with del(17p), del(17p) or TP53 mutation, del(11q), complex karyotype, and unmutated IGHV status. In patients with uMRD in PB with matched BM samples, 93% of patients had uMRD in both PB and BM. With median follow-up of 14.7 months, 3 patients (2%) experienced disease progression.06:17OBSV ObsEva reports positive Phase 3 trial results from PRIMROSE 2 trial of linzagolix for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids (4.57 )The responder rate was 93.9% (p <0.001) for women receiving 200 mg with ABT and 56.7% for women receiving 100 mg without ABT (p <0.001), compared to 29.4% in the placebo group. Both doses achieved significant rates of amenorrhea (p <0.001), reduction in pain (p <0.001), and improvement in quality of life (p <0.001). Additionally, significant improvement (p <0.001) in hemoglobin levels, a reduction in number of days of bleeding and reduction in uterine volume were observed. Furthermore, a significant reduction in fibroid volume was also observed for the 200 mg dose with ABT (p <0.008).The overall safety profile was in line with expectations and confirmed that linzagolix was well-tolerated. The most frequently observed adverse events (occurring in > 5% of patients) were headache, hot flushes, and anemia. Mean percentage change from baseline in BMD was consistent with previous clinical data."We look forward to the results from our second pivotal study, PRIMROSE 1 conducted in the US, in Q2 2020. Assuming positive results, we expect that it would lead to a Marketing Authorization Application submission with the European Medicines Agency by year-end 2020 and a New Drug Application submission with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by Q1 2021."06:16THOR Synthorx to be acquired by Sanofi (SNY) for $68/share in cash (25.03 )Under the terms of the merger agreement, Sanofi will commence a cash tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Synthorx common stock for $68 per share in cash for a total enterprise value of approximately $2.35 billion.

While the DOJ and SEC conduct separate investigations, the same facts have been shared by Ericsson with both authorities. The resolution relates to historical FCPA breaches ending Q1 2017. While the Company had a compliance program and a supporting control framework, they were not adequately implemented. Specifically, certain employees in some markets, some of whom were executives in those markets, acted in bad faith and knowingly failed to implement sufficient controls. They were able to enter into transactions for illegitimate purposes and, together with people under their influence, used sophisticated schemes in order to hide their wrongdoing.Separately, Ericsson agreed to resolve civil charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) relating to allegations of violations of the bribery and accounting provisions of the FCPA. Ericsson agreed to the entry of a judgment enjoining it from future violations of the FCPA and it agreed to pay a financial sanction of $458,380,000, plus pre-judgment interest of $81,540,000.As part of the settlement, Ericsson has agreed to engage an independent compliance monitor for a period of three years while the Company continues to undertake significant reforms to strengthen its Ethics & Compliance program.The combined payment of $1.06 b.

This may just be the calm before the storm considering all the macro-related events set to take place as the week unfolds. S&P Futures saw a relative quiet beginning with only a nine point overnight range. The market is currently trading around the 3144 area, with a high of 3148.50 and a low of 3139.50. In Asia, both China and Japan finished the day marginally higher. The Shanghai struggled to gain much following lighter than expected export data that saw a 1.1% fall in November, compared to a forecast of +0.8%.The Nikkei traded around in a narrow range that culminated with a gain of 0.3%. Heavyweights such as Softbank and Sony both gained more than 1% by day's end. European markets slightly under water. The weaker than expected Export data out of China has likely kept the EU markets in check. Energy names are seeing modest weakness with Crude Oil giving back about 1% in early action.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: -2.010 yr Note: 1.82%USD/JPY: 108.49 -0.07EUR/USD: 1.1067 +0.0007Europe: FTSE -0.2% DAX 0.0% CAC -0.2%Asia: Hang Seng 0.0% Shanghai +0.1% Nikkei +0.3%Gold (1467.40 +2.30) Silver (16.65 +0.05) Crude (58.63 -0.57)17:34WRAPX This week's biggest % gainers/losersThe following are this week's top percentage gainers and losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).This week's top % gainers Healthcare: BOLD (59.25 +104.1%), AUPH (15.44 +94.46%), THOR (25.03 +39.83%), LXRX (4.87 +37.96%), RUBY (10.62 +37.92%), RCKT (22.37 +27.15%), ALLK (117.36 +23.54%), PDCO (23.51 +20.81%)Consumer Discretionary: EXPR (5.49 +39.69%), GCO (48.82 +31.45%), LE (15.05 +27.76%), BIG (25.21 +20.62%)Information Technology: SCWX (15.11 +33.25%), GTT (11.3 +27.4%), DOMO (23.39 +24.41%), DQ (45.71 +20.04%)Financials: EZPW (6.19 +20.9%)Utilities: PCG (9.65 +29.36%)This week's top % losers Healthcare: SAGE (64.46 -58.35%), CLVS (9.61 -35.63%), CARA (16.76 -35.51%), PBYI (7.88 -16.97%), TGTX (7.12 -13.06%), FATE (13.67 -12.48%)Industrials: BE (5.28 -19.02%), EAF (12.29 -12.78%)Consumer Discretionary: HOME (5.67 -33.92%), MIK (6.69 -18.22%), CHS (4.03 -15.51%)Information Technology: ESTC (63.84 -19.61%), PAGS (28.82 -15.09%), MDB (131.17 -11.79%)Utilities: JE (2.1 -22.79%)16:37ALEC Alector presents Phase 1 data on AL002 (19.76 +0.37)Alector today reported safety and biomarker data from the single ascending dose (SAD) phase of the INVOKE Phase 1 study of its product candidate, AL002, in healthy volunteers. AL002 is a monoclonal antibody intended to enhance the activity of TREM2 and is being developed by Alector for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in collaboration with its partner AbbVie (ABBV). The data were presented today at the 12th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) meeting. The AL002 presentation at CTAD showcases the first data in humans showing that a TREM2 activating antibody engages its target and demonstrates downstream activity in the CNS. The data reported today are from the study's SAD phase in 56 healthy adults, who were enrolled into nine escalating dose cohorts. AL002 was found to be generally safe and well-tolerated. AL002 reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) soluble TREM2 in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating proof-of-target engagement in the brain. AL002 elevated a biomarker for microglia activity in the CSF, indicating proof-of-mechanism. The Phase 1b portion of the study in Alzheimer's disease patients is on-going.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD16:19WTRE Watford Holdings agrees to purchase Axeria IARD; terms not disclosed (26.47 +0.25)Axeria IARD is a property and casualty insurance company based in France.

Ninety-four percent of patients were refractory to an anti-CD38 antibody and 84% percent were triple refractory (refractory to an IMiD agent, PI and anti-CD38 antibody). Results for the primary endpoint (overall response rate [ORR]) and key secondary endpoint (complete response rate [CR]), as well as duration of response (DoR) and progression-free survival (PFS) across the target dose levels and at each of the three target doses explored in the study are presented in the table below. The median follow-up duration for all subjects was 11.3 months.Overall, the safety results were consistent with those observed in the phase 1 CRB-401 study, which evaluated the preliminary safety and efficacy of ide-cel. Instances of grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in 5.5% (7/128) of patients, including one fatal CRS event. Investigator identified grade 3 or higher neurotoxicity events (iiNT) occurred in 3.1% (4/128) of patients and there were no Grade 4 iiNT events reported. Grade 3 or higher CRS and iiNT events were reported in <6% of subjects at each target dose.

Key House Committee Passes Spanberger's Bipartisan Bill to Develop National 5G Strategy, Protect U.S. ConsumersTargeted News ServiceNovember 20, 2019 Wednesday 8:21 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 752 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Virginia, issued the following news release:* * *- The Congresswoman's Legislation Would Require the Administration to Develop a Nationwide Strategy to Protect U.S. Consumers &#38; Maintain Competitiveness of U.S. Tech Firms* * *The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee today passed U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger's bipartisan legislation to protect 5G and next-generation wireless communications systems and mobile infrastructure in Central Virginia and across the United States.The Committee's passage of Spanberger's Secure 5G and Beyond Act now lays the groundwork for the bill to receive a full vote on the floor of the U.S. House. Last month, the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee passed her legislation by a unanimous vote.The Spanberger-led Secure 5G and Beyond Act would require the administration to develop a national strategy to protect U.S. consumers and assist allies and partners in maximizing the security of their 5G telecommunications systems. The national strategy would also identify additional ways to spur research and development by U.S. companies in a way that maintains access for all Americans and keeps American firms competitive."Chinese tech companies like Huawei and ZTE continue to extend their global grip on 5G communications--and their strategic ties to Chinese military and intelligence agencies present serious, pressing national security concerns for the United States and our allies. If we aren't actively working to strengthen our resilience against these threats--especially as we see the growing adoption of these technologies in our rural communities and increasing reliance on these high-speed connections--we are putting American families, businesses, and consumer data at risk," said Spanberger. "Today, I was proud to see my bill pass on a strongly bipartisan vote out of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. By developing a national, interagency strategy, this bill would help protect the online security of our citizens and our allies as we move forward into the 21st century. This bill would also put us on a path toward maintaining our competitive edge in the face of mounting Chinese dominance in the 5G space. As we look ahead to future generations of wireless communications technology, I'll keep fighting to build a consistent and evidence-based approach toward improving our defenses against future threats to our cybersecurity."Last month, the Federal Communications Commission announced its intention to place greater restrictions on Chinese telecommunications companies like Huawei and ZTE due to widespread security concerns. According to a 2018 North Atlantic Treaty Organization report, Huawei's growing influence as a leading supplier of 5G technology could be exploited by China to engage in espionage, monitor foreign corporations and governments, and support Chinese military operations.Spanberger introduced the Secure 5G and Beyond Act in May 2019. Her bill is cosponsored by U.S. Representatives Susan W. Brooks (R-IN-05), Tom O'Halleran (D-AZ-01), Francis Rooney (R-FL-19), Elissa Slotkin (D-MI-08), and Elise Stefanik (R-NY-21).The Chinese government's Made in China 2025 plan calls 5G a "strategic emerging industry." Already, Chinese tech companies own 36 percent of all 5G standard-essential patents, whereas U.S.-based companies only possess 14 percent of critical 5G patents. Earlier this year, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford called the potential risks of a Chinese-built 5G network "a critical national security issue" for the United States.Specifically, the bipartisan Secure 5G and Beyond Act would require the administration to build an interagency strategy to:- Secure 5th generation and future-generation wireless communications systems and infrastructure across the United States,- Assist U.S. allies and defense partners in maximizing the security of 5G systems and infrastructure in their countries, and- Protect the competitiveness of U.S. companies, the privacy of U.S. consumers, and the integrity of international standards-setting bodies against foreign political influence.The Secure 5G and Beyond Act is companion legislation to a bill introduced in the U.S. Senate by U.S. Senators John Cornyn (R-TX), Mark Warner (D-VA), and Richard Burr (R-NC).Click here (https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/H2881_CPT_xml.pdf) to read the full bill text.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6932281 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 20, 2019End of Document

The first session of the week was very quiet, and it followed an overnight affair that was just as subdued. Economic data received overnight painted a mixed picture, as China reported a smaller than expected trade surplus for November (actual $38.73 bln; expected $46.30 bln) while Japan's Q3 GDP growth was revised up to 0.4% from 0.1%. Treasuries started the cash session with modest gains, climbing toward their intraday highs from Friday shortly after the open. However, the rest of the session saw a slow return to today's opening levels. The U.S. Treasury sold $38 bln in 3-yr notes to solid demand, as the high yield stopped through the when issued yield by 0.2 bps while the bid-to-cover ratio and indirect takedown were above average. The U.S. Dollar Index faced some morning pressure but returned to little changed as the day went on, reclaiming its 200-day moving average (97.65) in the process. Yield Check: 2-yr: -1 bp to 1.62% 3-yr: -1 bp to 1.64% 5-yr: UNCH at 1.67% 10-yr: -1 bp to 1.83% 30-yr: -2 bps to 2.26%News: The House of Representatives could vote on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on December 18, according to CNBC. The Bank of International Settlements published its latest quarterly review, which noted that structural issues rather than temporary factors were responsible for the mid-September shortage in the funding market that prompted the Fed to begin conducting daily reverse repurchases. The BIS added that liquidity demand from hedge funds exacerbated the funding stress. Financial Times reported that the Chinese government has ordered the removal of all foreign computer equipment and software from government offices. The Bank of Japan will reportedly lower its assessment of industrial production due to prolonged weakness. Former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker died on Sunday. China's November trade surplus totaled $38.73 bln (expected $46.30 bln; last $43.02 bln). Exports fell 1.1% yr/yr (expected 1.0%; last -0.8%) while imports rose 0.3% yr/yr (expected -1.8%; last -6.2%). Japan's Q3 GDP rose 0.4% qtr/qtr (expected 0.2%; last 0.1%), growing 1.8% yr/yr (expected 0.7%; last 0.2%). The latest set of election polls from the U.K. suggest that Conservatives will win majority on Thursday with a margin between 9 and 15 percentage points. Eurozone's December Sentix Investor Confidence rose to 0.7 from -4.5 (expected -4.9). Germany's October trade surplus totaled EUR20.60 bln (expected surplus of EUR19.00 bln; last surplus of EUR19.20 bln).

IMGN632 displays a well tolerated safety profile and activity at doses up to and including 0.09 mg/kg per cycle. The most common treatment-related adverse event was infusion-related reactions (24% all grades, 8% grade 3); none required IMGN632 discontinuation. Single dose-limiting toxicities were seen at the highest dose levels tested (0.18-0.45 mg/kg): three reversible cases of veno-occlusive disease and one prolonged neutropenia; no patterns of hepatotoxicity or cytopenias occurred with doses below 0.18 mg/kg. Although no maximum tolerated dose was determined on either schedule, based on the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic data generated, the dose and schedule of 0.045 mg/kg given on day 1 every 3 weeks has been selected as the monotherapy recommended Phase 2 dose. AML Efficacy Across all dose levels and both schedules, of the patients assessable for efficacy (n=71), 38 (54%) had a reduction in bone marrow blasts and 13 (18%) achieved an objective response, including 2 complete remissions (CR) and 10 with incomplete recovery (CRi) and one morphologic leukemia free state (MLFS) in heavily pretreated patients. The vast majority of these responders (92%) had failed prior intensive therapies, including 3 with prior transplant, 69% had failed 2-3 prior lines of therapy, and 54% had an adverse risk classification. At the dose and schedule selected as the recommended Phase 2 dose (0.045 mg/kg Q3W), a 40% response rate was seen in relapsed and refractory patients with de novo AML, including 1 CR, 4 CRi, and 1 MLFS (with subsequent conversion to CRi). BPDCN Efficacy 3 of 9 (33%) evaluable relapsed/refractory BPDCN patients achieved a response after a 1-2 doses of 0.045 mg/kg IMGN632 (1 CR, 1 CRi, and 1 partial remission); all three patients had received prior SL-401 (tagraxofusp-erzs), two had received intense multi-agent chemotherapy, and one had prior stem cell transplant.14:49GILD Gilead Sciences & CIBMTR announce findings from ongoing post-marketing study evaluating safety and efficacy of Yescarta in adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (67.79 +0.71)In this analysis, efficacy and safety of Yescarta were comparable to that observed in the ZUMA-1 trial, despite a larger proportion of older, more difficult-to-treat patients in the real-world setting. The findings were presented today at the 61st American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting & Exposition, held in Orlando from December 7--10, 2019.14:48NVS Novartis AG Kymriah demonstrates consistent efficacy and safety outcomes in US patients when used in real-world setting (92.60 +0.53)Efficacy in DLBCL confirmed results seen in the pivotal trial despite treatment of a broader population, including older and more heavily pretreated patients.Fewer known CAR-T cell therapy adverse events for patients with DLBCL, specifically rates of high-grade cytokine release syndrome (4%) and neurologic events (5%), were observed compared with the pivotal clinical trials.In children and young adults with ALL, efficacy outcomes were similar and safety outcomes appear to be more favorable compared to the pivotal trial.14:48GMDA Gamida Cell announces updated results from Phase 1 clinical study of GDA-201 (4.75 -0.35)The co announced updated results from a Phase 1 clinical study of GDA-201, an investigational, natural killer (NK) cell-based cancer immunotherapy for the treatment of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM), at the 61st Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH), which is being held December 7--10 in Orlando, FL. Data from 22 patients in the ongoing study showed GDA-201 in combination with monoclonal antibodies was generally well tolerated and demonstrated early evidence of clinical activity in heavily pre-treated patients, including five complete responses observed among nine patients with NHL. Gamida Cell plans to initiate a Phase 1/2 multi-dose, multi-center study of GDA-201 in patients with NHL in 2020.14:46GILD Gilead Sciences announces primary results from ZUMA-2 -- 93% of patients treated with Investigational KTE-X19 achieved response, including 67% with a complete response (67.30 +0.22)The co announced primary results from ZUMA-2, a global, multicenter, single-arm, open-label Phase 2 study of KTE-X19, an investigational CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, in adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). After a single infusion of KTE-X19, the best objective response via independent radiologic central review (n=60 evaluable for efficacy analysis) was 93 percent, with 67 percent of patients having achieved a complete response. These findings were presented today at the 61st American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting & Exposition, in Orlando from December 7--10, 2019.With a median follow-up of 12.3 months (range: 7.0 to 32.3 months) at the time of data cutoff, 57 percent of patients remained in an ongoing response. Of the first 28 patients treated (minimum follow-up of 24 months), 43 percent were alive and remained in continued remission without additional therapy. The 12-month estimates of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 61 percent and 83 percent, respectively. Median duration of response, PFS and OS were not yet reached. Among the 68 patients evaluable for safety, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events were observed in 91 percent and 63 percent of patients, respectively. Grade 3 or higher CRS and neurologic events were seen in 15 percent and 31 percent of patients, respectively. No Grade 5 CRS or neurologic events occurred.14:42TALKX Market Briefing: Buyers a reluctant bunchThere has been a steady deterioration in the major indices since about 10:15 a.m. ET. The downward trend hasn't been sparked by any specific news catalyst; rather, it is largely a case of absent buyers today, which is making it easier to pressure prices lower.Their reluctance to push things further is understandable given how far things have been pushed already and given that the world is on the cusp of learning if the U.S. is going to implement a tariff on a $160 billion tranche of imported Chinese goods on December 15.Should that tariff be implemented, it is thought that the stock market would not react well. Accordingly, given how far the market has come, the near-term risk-reward dynamic is seen as being skewed to the risk side of things at the moment. Strikingly, the CBOE Volatility Index is up 11.7% to 15.21.Apple (AAPL 267.28, -3.43, -1.3%), which was up 20.9% since the end of September, is an influential laggard today.The consumer staples (+0.2%), consumer discretionary (+0.2% 0, and rel estate (+0.1%) sectors are the only sectors trading higher. The major indices are all down between 0.2-0.3%.14:33COMDX Energy Settlement PricesFeb Crude Oil futures fell $0.06 (-0.1%) to $59.04/barrel Jan Natural Gas $0.12 lower (-5.31%) at $2.21/MMBtu Jan RBOB Gasoline settled $0.01 higher (0.46%) at $1.6549/gallon Jan Heating oil futures settled $0.01 lower (-0.39%) at $1.9445/gallon14:27SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- PG&E (PCG) gains following wildfire settlement agreement -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersBNTX (28.99 +18.96%): The October IPO extends to new all-time highs on higher than average volume amid an active session for the biotech sector, which today digests a bevy of clinical updates and several premium acquisitions, including those of ArQule (ARQL) and Synthorx (THOR), which are active in the oncology space.PCG (11.25 +16.61%): Reached a settlement to resolve individual claims connected to losses from the 2015 Butte Fire, the 2017 Northern California Wildfires, and the 2018 Camp Fire valued at approx. $13.5 bln, resolving all claims arising from those fires; the settlement is to be implemented pursuant to co's Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization. Co, "with all major wildfire claims now on a path to be resolved and the total amount of wildfire liabilities determined," will now amend and finalize that plan. At two-month highs.AM (5.15 +14.8%): Announced that it will repurchase $100 mln of shares from Antero Resources (AR). Additionally, co and AR have agreed to a growth incentive fee program. Due to additional optimization of the midstream infrastructure buildout, co is now targeting a 2020 capital program of approx. $300-325 mln, a 22% reduction vs the previous target. Co targets net debt to adj. EBITDA in the mid-to-high 3-times range in 2020.Mid Cap LosersKOS (5.24 -13.25%): The stock, trading with above 3x average volume, sank to eleven-month lows early in the session, though it has since moderated those losses. In sector news, shares of Tullow Oil (TUWLF) plummeted overseas after that company, among other updates, including the announcement of the departures of its CEO and its Exploration Director, reset its forward-looking guidance, now forecasting 2020 Group production to average between 70,000-80,000 bpd, and noted that production performance has been significantly below expectations at the TEN and Jubilee fields in Ghana. Co is also active in Ghana and is a partner in production at the TEN and Jubilee fields. BPMC (71.18 -9.3%): Announced initial data from the Phase 2 PIONEER trial of avapritinib in patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis; initial data from the dose-finding Part 1 of the trial showed "rapid and robust reductions in serum tryptase" in patients treated with 25, 50, or 100 mg of avapritinib once daily. All doses of avapritinib tested were well-tolerated; there was one Grade 3 cognitive effect reported in the 100 mg cohort, and the event was resolved following dose modification. Co announced top-line results from the EXPLORER trial; among other results, top-line efficacy data as of a data cutoff of August 30 showed a centrally confirmed ORR of 77% in 48 patients evaluable for response. Top-line safety results were generally consistent with previously reported data. After the data cutoff, one patient with SM and an associated hematologic neoplasm of myelodysplastic syndrome had a Grade 5 intracranial bleed. PGNY (27.81 -8.79%): Continued volatility.14:23MDB MongoDB will report third quarter results this afternoon (131.32 +0.15)MongoDB (MDB) will report fiscal 2020 third quarter (October) results this afternoon, and management will host a call at 17:00.MongoDB is the leading non-relational (or NoSQL) database platform that is heralded by developers. The next-generation database company's freemium "land and expand" business model has led to explosive growth.The company has beaten estimates and guided revenue above consensus in each of its first eight quarterly reports as a public company since its IPO in October 2017.Management guided for a third quarter adjusted net loss of $0.29-0.27/share with revenue up 52% to $98-100.Revenue growth is expected to slow to 24% in the fourth quarter given increasingly difficult comparisons after revenue grew 85% in the fourth quarter last year. MongoDB has guided for a fiscal 2020 adjusted net loss of $1.11-1.06/share with revenue up ~48% to $390-395 mln.Last quarter, revenue grew 67% while total customers grew ~6% sequentially and 103% yr/yr to over 15,000. MongoDB Atlas, the company's managed cloud database-as-a-service offering, grew customers 7% sequentially and 149% yr/yr to over 13,200. Atlas revenue was up over 240% yr/yr and represented 37% of total revenue for the quarter, which does weigh on gross margins.The stock fell in response to earnings despite strong results as the 20x forward revenue multiple seemed to have already priced in the company's strong position.The $7.3 bln valuation now represents ~17x forward revenue estimates. The stock has consolidated for the last six months and is currently attempting to hold the 50-DMA.14:09SUMRX Earnings Out This Afternoon/Tomorrow MorningThis Afternoon: CDMO CASY CHWY ROAD MDB PHR SFIX TOL MTNTomorrow Morning: AZO CMD CONN DBI HDS14:00SCANX Large cap notable movers of interest -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable large cap movers of interest ($10 bln - $200 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Large Cap GainersZM (66.33 +5.72%): Shares display relative strength as they bounce back from last week's 16% slide.

(24.27 -0.67)Chewy (CHWY) is set to report Q3 earnings tonight after the close with a conference call set for 5pmET.Current Capital IQ consensus stands at a loss of ($0.13) per share on revenues of $1.20 bln.GuidanceQ3 revenues in the range of $1.19-1.21 bln.2020 revenues in the range of $4,75-4.80 bln. 2020 EBITDA Margin improvement in the range of 420-450 bps.The StoryShares of CHWY fell to post-IPO lows following the release of Q2 results. CHWY outpaced revenue expectations as revenue growth was 43% (49% in autoship). The issue was the shortfall on the bottom line as it missed EPS consensus for the second straight quarter. Higher than expected SG&A costs in Q2 were one of the reasons why the stock sold off post Q2 results. Some of the increase was driven by non-recurring items like fulfillment center build outs and public company costs. Operating Expenses increased 55% yr/yr compared to the 43% top line growth. CHWY was able to improve gross margins by 300 bps, EBITDA margins increased 410 bps yr/yr. However this only led to a small increase to the low end of its EBITDA outlook.The good news is investor expectations around earnings has been dampened which leaves upside surprise potential for this evening. Two pedestrian quarters with bottom line misses and a cautious note from Cleveland Research saying sales were tracking 'softer' than expected has reigned in the outlook. The company's float stands at 44 mln shares and 32% of this is short interest which leaves it susceptible to a squeeze. Trader's need to be aware that the lock up expiration looms on December 11. Parent company PetSmart owns approx 67% of the shares with hedge funds owning approx 20%. Shares of CHWY opened at $36 on June 14 but have been on a downward trend since opening up for trade. Shares hit a post-IPO low of $21.68 on November 11. Since then it has been able to recover approx 10% to rally into its 50-sma ($24.36) ahead of tonight's print. CHWY will need to surprise to the upside, particularly on its cost management side, in order to shake out some of the shorts. But that lock up expiration lingers, similat to what we saw at Crowdsrike (CRWD) which will make it tough to squeeze.Q2 RecapReported Q2 (Jul) loss of $0.21 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.11 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.10). Revenues rose 43.1% year/year to $1.15 bln vs the $1.13 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Gross margin of 23.6 percent expanded 300 basis points year-over-year and in line with expectations. Net loss of $82.9 million, including a non-cash share-based compensation charge of $43.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA(1) loss of $29.2 million improved 45 percent year-over-year.Adjusted EBITDA margin of (2.5) percent expanded 410 basis points year-over-year and in line with expectations.13:39COMDX Metals Settlement PricesFeb gold settled today's session down $0.20 (0.01%) at $1464.9/oz Mar silver settled today's session $0.04 higher (0.24%) at $16.65/oz Mar copper settled $0.03 higher (1.01%) at $2.7575/lb13:15OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:CLF Dec 9 calls are seeing interest with the underlying stock up 5% following positive mention in Barrons (volume: 36.7K, open int: 1570, implied vol: ~55%, prev day implied vol: 44%).

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is unchanged.December 15 is fast approaching, and the market is hoping that the U.S. and China can reach a deal to possibly delay the tariffs scheduled to hit that day. Scattered throughout this week will be policy decisions from the Fed and ECB, as well as reports on consumer inflation and retail sales for November.In the meantime, it's been tough for the market to gain any traction amid the losses in Apple (AAPL 265.26, -5.44, -2.0%) and the S&P 500 health care sector (-0.5%). Conversely, the S&P 500 communication services (+0.3%) and consumer discretionary (+0.3%) sectors have provided some support.M&A activity seen some huge premiums, especially in the biotech space. ArQule (ARQL 19.70, +10.04, +103.4%) will be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for about $2.7 billion. Synthorx (THOR 67.66, +42.63, +170.3%) will be acquired by French company Sanofi (SNY 45.35, -0.68, -1.5%) for about $2.4 billion. Both are cash deals.Elsewhere, Texas Capital (TCBI 62.92, +5.03, +8.9%) and Independent Bank Group (IBTX 61.01, +1.75, +3.0%) have agreed to a $5.5 billion all-stock merger of equals.Separately, shares of Macy's (M 15.58, +0.43, +2.8%) have defied a downgrade to Sell at Goldman Sachs. Qorvo (QRVO 109.40, +2.78, +2.6%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.86, +2.53, +2.5%) were "double" upgraded to Buy from Underperform at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Overall losses are very modest, but there has been a noticeable increase in hedging interest and an uptick in defensive positioning. The CBOE Volatility Index is up 9.4% to 14.90, while the benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.82%.Investors did not receive any notable economic data.12:55SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ARQL (51.13 mln +103.83%), ACB (25.3 mln +4.94%), DHR (15.9 mln -0.26%), DPLO (14.31 mln -32.01%), CGC (13.75 mln +13.62%)Materials: FCX (18.84 mln +4.39%)Industrials: GE (13.66 mln -0.81%)Consumer Discretionary: M (23.44 mln +2.77%), NIO (22.42 mln -3.54%), F (11.26 mln -0.03%)Information Technology: AAPL (16.52 mln -1.96%), AMD (16.34 mln -1.01%)Financials: BAC (14.35 mln -0.5%), ITUB (12.41 mln +2.09%)Energy: CHK (37.97 mln +3.16%), KOS (14.66 mln -13.41%), SWN (12.99 mln -0.49%), AR (12.22 mln +25.11%)Utilities: PCG (28.32 mln +17.2%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: THOR (29.66x +170.22%), ARQL (21.4x +103.83%), FATE (8.02x +41.99%), DPLO (7.89x -32.01%), ABEO (6.19x +0.85%), TGTX (3.91x +25.37%), RCKT (3.43x -1.27%), PDLI (2.93x +22.03%), DHR (2.72x -0.26%), SGMO (2.54x -8.32%), BLUE (2.29x -5.29%)Industrials: DY (2.16x -5.63%)Consumer Discretionary: BIG (2.57x +5.51%)Information Technology: LPL (2.34x +10.75%)Financials: IBTX (7.6x +3.8%), TCBI (4.63x +9.29%), AB (2.93x -2.02%), USIG (2.43x +0.14%)Energy: KOS (2.41x -13.41%), KLXE (2.33x +13.56%)12:55SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (70) outpacing new lows (13) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: A, ACEL, ACN, ADUS, ALLE, ANSS, ARQL, ARVN, AVP, BBIO, BBY, BHC, BOLD, BRMK, BXMT, CARE, CASY, CBRE, CDAY, CIM, CMC, CODI, COF, CZZ, DAR, DCPH, DEA, DEI, DKS, DOCU, DTIL, EIDX, EPZM, FMC, FTSV, GBT, GCO, GL, GMRE, GOOGL, INFO, INSG, INSP, INSW, KDMN, KRYS, LAMR, LPG, LULU, MCO, MPW, NKE, OSK, QRVO, RCKT, RS, RYI, SPXC, SSW, STWD, SWKS, TBBK, THC, THOR, TNK, VCTR, VICI, VRTX, WWD, XBITStocks that traded to 52 week lows: AGX, BNFT, CERS, GCI, MNRL, NVEE, OSTK, OXY, PBT, S, SIGA, SYRS, TRXCThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: POWLETFs that traded to 52 week highs: EWK, EWN, FAN, IBB, IYK, JO, OEF, PALL, PBD, QAI, SEA, XBIETFs that traded to 52 week lows: UNG12:54SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: THOR (67.64 +170.22%), ARQL (19.7 +103.83%), FATE (19.41 +41.99%), TGTX (8.93 +25.37%), PDLI (3.6 +22.03%), DERM (9.01 +14.34%), DVAX (6.49 +13.86%), CGC (21.19 +13.62%), NKTR (23.07 +12.81%), ITCI (11.23 +10.1%)Consumer Discretionary: HOME (6.23 +9.88%)Information Technology: LPL (6.9 +10.75%)Energy: AR (2.74 +25.11%), AM (5.3 +18.14%), KLXE (6.28 +13.56%), ALTM (2.25 +10.05%), SDRL (1.29 +9.32%)Utilities: PCG (11.31 +17.2%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: DPLO (3.95 -32.01%), TVTY (19.9 -12.1%), TBIO (9.1 -8.91%), ATNX (16.26 -8.39%), SGMO (10.69 -8.32%), BPMC (72.09 -8.14%), GBT (74.15 -6.55%), CRSP (68.33 -5.58%), ATRS (4.62 -5.52%), BLUE (75.22 -5.29%), ACAD (48.71 -5.23%)Materials: IFF (134.39 -5.39%)Industrials: DY (48.07 -5.63%)Consumer Discretionary: GTX (10.25 -11.71%), MCFT (15.18 -5.36%)Information Technology: SMAR (42.07 -5.8%)Financials: JT (1.46 -5.81%)Energy: KOS (5.23 -13.41%), CCJ (9.21 -5.78%)Consumer Staples: DF (0.06 -7.89%)12:54SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Synthorx (THOR) soars upon premium acquisition agreement -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersTHOR (67.55 +169.88%): To be acquired by Sanofi (SNY) for a premium $68/share in cash, representing an aggregate equity value of approx. $2.5 bln, as Sanofi seeks to enhance its position in oncology and in immuno-oncology through the addition of co's THOR-707, said to have potential to become the best-in-class IL-2 therapeutic for the treatment of solid tumors, and co's other earlier-stage cytokine programs to its pipeline.

Nomura initiated coverage of the stock with a Buy rating on November 8 while Raymond James initiated coverage with an Outperform rating on October 8. The company has a long history of expanding margins. AZO's gross margin hit a record of 53.72% in Q3 before ticking down to 53.65% in Q4. Another uptick in gross margin would be welcomed by investors. The stock hit a record high on November 29, extending this year's gain to 41.7%. Today, the stock trades within 1.0% of its November high.AutoZone trades at 17.6x forward earnings expectations, which represents a premium to Advance Auto Parts (AAP 151.76, -2.86, -1.9%) but a discount to O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY 443.57, -2.00, -0.5%).11:30BONDX New SupplyTreasury Auction Preview$38 bln 3-year Treasury note auction (results at 13:00 ET) Prior auction results: High yield: 1.630% Bid-to-cover: 2.60 Indirect bid: 53.3% Direct bid: 16.9% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.059% Bid-to-cover: 2.50 Indirect bid: 47.1% Direct bid: 16.5%11:29M Macy's shakes off analyst downgrade (15.43 +0.28)Shares of department store retailer Macy's (M 15.43, +0.28, +1.8%) are outperforming today in an otherwise flat market. That outperformance is remarkable because it flies in the face of Goldman Sachs downgrading the stock to Sell from Neutral and slashing its price target to $12 from $17.Strikingly, Macy's has already exceeded its average daily volume less than two hours into the trading session. That heavy volume and the positive turn in the stock on a seemingly negative development are likely byproducts of the following factors:Investor belief that the Goldman Sachs analyst isn't breaking any new ground with the basis for the downgrade (secular headwinds weighing on comps and profitability). Shares of M were down 49% for the year before today's downgrade.Short-covering activity, which is often triggered when a beaten-up stock makes a counter-intuitive move.Momentum trading as speculators see an opportunity to force a short squeeze.Macy's is the picture of a tax-loss selling candidate, but the flip side of that understanding is that many tax-loss selling candidates are seen as good, bargain-hunting opportunities after the tax-loss selling is complete. The stock's resilience to selling interest today is apt to be helping its candidacy as a short-term, speculative rebound play.11:09TALKX Market Briefing: A mixed state of affairsThe stock market is mixed, and little changed, in today's early action. Buyers have reined in their efforts after Friday's post-employment report rally and ahead of a batch of key macro developments that will unfold this week, the most notable of which is the possible implementation of tariffs on Sunday of ~$160 billion worth of imported goods from China, most of which are consumer-oriented goods.Tucked in between will be the FOMC meeting, the ECB meeting, the UK election, and CPI and Retail Sales reports for November.Today, then, has the markings thus far of a wait-and-see day, yet the underlying bullish bias can still be described as bullish given the overall lack of selling interest with the market sitting close to an all-time high.The consumer discretionary sector (+0.3%), led by Amazon.com (AMZN 1758.58, +6.98, +0.4%), is today's bet-performing sector followed by the communication services sector (+0.2%), which is led by Alphabet (GOOG 1350.61, +9.99, +0.8%) and Facebook (FB 202.50, +1.45, +0.7%).Six sectors are up and five sectors are down in a reflection of the mixed state of things, which is also reflected in the recognition that the biggest sector winner is up just 0.3% while the biggest sector loser (industrials) is down just 0.2%.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.05%; the S&P 500 is flat; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000 are both down 0.1%.11:03APRE Aprea Therapeutics presents results from US and French Phase Ib/II clinical trials of APR-246 and azacitidine at ASH (29.62 +3.57)The trials evaluate the safety and efficacy of APR-246 in combination with azacitidine (AZA) for the treatment of TP53 mutated MDS and AML.U.S. Phase Ib/II clinical trial in patients with TP53 Mutant Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML):As of the data cutoff, the overall response rate (ORR) in 33 evaluable MDS patients was 88%, with a 61% complete remission (CR) rate, by International Working Group (IWG) criteria. With a median duration of follow-up of 10.8 months, the median duration of response was 8.4 months and the median duration of CR was 7.3 months. Seventeen (52%) evaluable MDS patients discontinued therapy to pursue stem cell transplant. Median overall survival (OS) for all enrolled patients (n=55) was 10.8 months. Median OS in responding patients versus non-responders was 13.7 vs. 3.9 months. Adverse events, regardless of causality, were mostly grade 1/2. Grade 3+ adverse events occurring in > or =20% of patients were limited to cytopenias and infection, consistent with underlying hematopoietic malignancies, and no exacerbation of the expected AZA-related safety profile has been observed.French Phase Ib/II clinical trial in MDS and AML:As of the data cutoff, the ORR in 24 evaluable MDS patients was 74%, with a 66% CR rate, based on IWG criteria. With a median duration of follow-up of 6.4 months, the median OS for all enrolled patients (n=53) had not been reached. In addition, all responding patients were alive at data cutoff. Relative to baseline, mutant TP53 variant allele frequency was significantly decreased in responding patients and undetectable in all patients who achieved a CR.10:44FTSV Forty Seven announces presentation of foundational preclinical data supporting development of FSI-174 in combination with magrolimab as novel all antibody conditioning regimen for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (24.81 +10.37)Forty Seven today announced preclinical proof-of-concept data for its novel all antibody conditioning regimen, comprised of FSI-174, its anti-cKIT antibody, and magrolimab, its anti-CD47 antibody. Preclinical studies in a non-human primate (NHP) model showed that the combination of FSI-174 and magrolimab significantly depleted hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from the bone marrow, with no dose limiting toxicities. The data will be presented in a poster session at the 61st American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.In the preclinical data presented at ASH, FSI-174 demonstrated binding affinity to both human and NHP cKIT receptors, and induced phagocytosis as well as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, FSI-174 was well-tolerated when administered to NHPs as a single agent, with no dose-limiting toxicities. The no-observed-adverse-effect level was established at 50 mg/kg, the highest dose tested. When administered together, FSI-174 and magrolimab demonstrated a synergistic benefit, promoting the highest level of phagocytosis of cKIT expressing target cells and inducing significant HSC depletion nine days after infusion compared to placebo.Forty Seven expects to complete investigational new drug-enabling studies by the end of 2019, and subject to approval of the IND by the FDA, plans to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating FSI-174 in healthy volunteers in the first quarter of 2020.10:39MRK Merck and Seven and Eight BioPharmaceuticals sign clinical research collaboration agreement (88.59 -0.26)Seven and Eight BioPharmaceuticals has signed a clinical research collaboration agreement with Merck, through a subsidiary, to explore the combination of Seven and Eight's BDB001, an immune modulator targeting toll-like receptors (TLR) 7 and 8, and Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), in treating patients with advanced solid tumors. Under the terms of the agreement, Seven and Eight will sponsor and be responsible for the conduct of the clinical study.10:36ATRA Atara Biotherapeutics reports updated long-term clinical results from multicenter Expanded Access Protocol study of tab-cel for patients with EBV+ PTLD (14.72 +0.73)Atara Biotherapeutics presented long-term clinical results from a multicenter Expanded Access Protocol (EAP) study of tab-cel (tabelecleucel) for patients with Epstein-Barr virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (EBV+ PTLD) at the ASH Annual Meeting & Exposition. Results from this analysis demonstrate a high overall response rate, short time to response, and favorable estimated long-term overall survival rates for tab-cel in patients with EBV+ PTLD following hematopoietic cell transplant or solid organ transplant who have failed rituximab-based therapy. Tab-cel was generally well-tolerated in all patients with EBV+ PTLD and other EBV-associated diseases.Safety analyses were presented for all patients treated with tab-cel (n=61; n=26 EBV+ PTLD and n=35 patients with other EBV-associated diseases). Consistent with prior studies, tab-cel was generally well-tolerated in all patients, and no tab-cel related adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred. Three graft versus host disease adverse events were reported, all in patients with prior allogeneic HCT. No other adverse events of special interest including cytokine release syndrome were reported.Median time to response of one month was seen in both EBV+ PTLD patient cohorts. In responders, two-year estimated overall survival rate was 86% for HCT (n=7) and 100% for SOT (n=10) with no patient deaths attributable to PTLD progression. Similar outcomes were observed in the EAP-201 subgroup of EBV+ PTLD patients (n=22) with adequate ECOG performance status, no CNS disease and no PLTD-related ventilatory support who would have likely met the eligibility criteria for Atara's ongoing tab-cel Phase 3 studies. Overall response rate was 55% and 82%, with a two-year estimated overall survival of 79% and 81%, in the HCT (n=11) and SOT (n=11) cohorts, respectively.10:32ACHN Achillion Pharma reports "positive" data from Phase 2 dose-finding study of danicopan at ASH (6.19 +0.02)Achillion Pharma today reported top-line data from a dose-finding Phase 2 trial assessing the safety and effectiveness of its oral small molecule factor D inhibitor danicopan (ACH-4471) in combination with intravenous eculizumab in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) patients who have an inadequate response to C5 monotherapy.The primary endpoint of the trial was an increase in hemoglobin from baseline. A mean increase of 2.4 g/dL at 24 weeks of treatment was achieved in this proof-of-concept trial. Danicopan, in combination with eculizumab, resulted in a significant reduction in blood transfusions with 10 patients receiving 34 transfusions (58 units) in the 6 months prior to screening to 1 patient receiving 1 transfusion (2 units) during the 24-week trial.In addition to improvements in hemoglobin and transfusions, there were also meaningful improvements in markers of hemolysis including bilirubin, reticulocytes, and PNH red blood clone size (%).In this clinical trial, danicopan was generally well tolerated. All treatment emergent adverse events were considered mild to moderate in severity except for Grade 3 severe adverse events that occurred in two patients. Both patients had resolution of their events, remained on danicopan, and completed the study.The company plans to initiate a global Phase 3 trial in early 2020.10:28NKTR Nektar Therapeutics announces presentation of new preclinical data for NKTR-255 at ASH (22.25 +1.80)NKTR-255 is an interleukin-15 (IL-15) receptor agonist that is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical study in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Details of the preclinical data presentations at ASH are as follows and are available on the scientific section of Nektar's website."The preclinical data being recognized at ASH demonstrate NKTR-255's promise in hematological malignancies through its potential to restore both NK cell and memory CD8 T cell compartments in patients," said Loui Madakamutil, Ph.D., SVP and Head of Discovery and Research at Nektar Therapeutics. "In studies presented by the laboratory of Dr. Nikhil Munshi at Dana-Farber, NKTR-255 enhanced the number and function of NK and CD8+ effector memory T cell populations in peripheral blood and bone marrow from patients with multiple myeloma and, also increased expression of activating receptors found on those NK cells. Separately, researchers from the laboratory of Dr. Cameron Turtle at Fred Hutchinson demonstrated NKTR-255 prevented tumor growth and increased survival of CAR T cells when added to a CD19-targeted CAR T cell regimen in models of B cell lymphoma. This preclinical data reinforces the basis of our ongoing clinical trial evaluating the potential of NKTR-255 in patients with multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."10:23XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (59.57 -0.18)The energy sector (-0.3%) displays relative weakness in the early going of today's session. Today's early underperformance comes after the sector gained 1.5% last week, finishing ahead of the remaining ten groups. Factors contributing to the underperformance:Pressure on the price of oil. WTI crude is down $0.27, or 0.5%, at $58.93/bbl. Granted, the energy component has climbed off its overnight low of $58.23 in recent trade, but it remains in negative territory, weighing on the energy sector. China reported a smaller than expected trade surplus for November, which supports the argument that the Chinese economy continues slowing down. This will continue posing a headwind to global growth. Pullback after last week's show of relative strength.Notable movers:Marathon Petroleum (MPC 58.95, -1.26, -2.1%): weakest sector component after being downgraded to Neutral from Overweight at JP Morgan. Chevron (CVX 117.27, -0.74, -0.6%): downgraded to Neutral from Buy at Citigroup. HollyFrontier (HFC 50.40, -0.54, -1.1%): trading at a three-month low. Occidental Petroleum (OXY 37.71, -0.51, -1.3%): on the verge of falling to a fresh 2019 low. Chevron (CVX 117.31, -0.70, -0.6%): looking to remain above its 50-day moving average (117.39). Baker Hughes (BKR 22.64, +0.43, +1.9%): showing relative strength in a weak sector.10:19CNST Constellation Pharmaceuticals provides updated preliminary data from MANIFEST clinical trial with CPI-0610 (56.82 +13.12)MANIFEST is an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of the company's bromodomain and extra-terminal domain protein inhibitor CPI-0610 in patients with myelofibrosis (MF). Arm 3 is evaluating CPI-0610 in combination with ruxolitinib in JAK-inhibitor-nave MF patients. Arms 1 and 2 are studying CPI-0610 as a monotherapy or in combination with ruxolitinib in ruxolitinib-resistant or -intolerant MF patients. Results include:Preliminary data showed continuing signs of activity across a broad range of parameters, suggesting possible disease-modifying effects of CPI-0610.In the first-line treatment arm, 12 out of 15 (80%) evaluable JAK-inhibitor-nave patients treated with a CPI-0610 / ruxolitinib combination achieved at least a 35% spleen volume response (SVR35) at 12 weeks. The median percent change in spleen volume reduction was -49.7%. Ten out of 14 (71%) evaluable patients achieved at least a 50% improvement in Total Symptom Score (TSS50) at 12 weeks. The median percent change in TSS at 12 weeks was -60.3%.Clinical activity, including SVR35 responses, TSS50 responses, and conversion from transfusion dependence to transfusion independence, was seen at 24 weeks in patients in the second-line treatment arm who added CPI-0610 to ruxolitinib, suggesting that treatment with CPI-0610 may have durable effects.CPI-0610 in combination with ruxolitinib in JAK-inhibitor-nave patients was generally well tolerated. No adverse events led to study discontinuation. Three patients (10%) had greater than or equal to Grade 3 anemia. One patient (3.3%) had Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, which was reversible. CPI-0610 as monotherapy or in combination with ruxolitinib in ruxolitinib-refractory or -intolerant patients (Arms 1 and 2) was generally well tolerated. The most common hematologic adverse event was thrombocytopenia.Constellation continues to enroll patients in MANIFEST. As a result of encouraging preliminary data, Constellation expanded Arm 3 of MANIFEST for JAK-inhibitor-nave patients from 43 to up to 101 patients. The company also expanded Cohort 2A, for TD ruxolitinib-resistant or -intolerant patients adding CPI-0610 to ruxolitinib, from 16 to up to 60 patients. Constellation has started planning for a randomized, active-controlled, pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial studying the combination of CPI-0610 and ruxolitinib versus ruxolitinib and placebo in JAK-inhibitor-nave patients with MF. The company expects this clinical trial to start in 2020.An investor event to discuss the MANIFEST update at ASH is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. EST today.10:18AGIO Agios Pharma presents updated data for mitapivat from extension phase of DRIVE PK Phase 2 study in patients with pyruvate kinase deficiency (44.64 +3.70)Agios Pharma today reported new data from the extension phase of the DRIVE PK Phase 2 study of mitapivat (AG-348) in adults with pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency at the 2019 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.In the extension phase, patients treated with mitapivat doses >25 mg twice daily in the core period undergo a dose taper and continue on a dose that maintained their Hb level at no lower than 1.0 g/dL below their pre-taper level. As of the March 27, 2019 data cutoff, 18 of the 36 patients remain in the extension phase with a median treatment duration of 35.6 months (range 28.7-41.9). For the 18 patients in the extension phase, improvements in hemoglobin and other markers of hemolysis including reticulocytes, indirect bilirubin, and haptoglobin achieved during the core period were sustained during the extension period up to 42 months, as of the data cutoff. Adverse events for patients who continued in the study (n=18) were comparable in the core and extension periods. In the extension, the most common AEs were headache (39%), insomnia (28%), fatigue (28%), and nasopharyngitis (28%). No new safety signals were identified in the extension period.The cumulative safety profile, says the company, continues to support long-term twice daily dosing of mitapivat.Mitapivat is an investigational, first-in-class, oral, small molecule allosteric activator of wild-type and a variety of mutated pyruvate kinase-R (PKR) enzymes that directly targets the underlying metabolic defect in PK deficiency, a rare, potentially debilitating, hemolytic anemia. In addition, data was shared from the Agios-sponsored Natural History Study of PK deficiency that detailed the comorbidities and complications associated with the disease and the impact of transfusion history.10:13OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:CLF Dec 9 calls are seeing interest following positive mention in Barrons with 3720 contracts trading vs. open int of 1570, pushing implied vol up around 6 points to ~50%.

The study was designed in two parts: Part A to establish an initial priming dose with flat dosing regimens and Part B to escalate dosing on subsequent administrations to the priming dose. Prophylactic treatment for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was mandated prior to each dose of XmAb13676. XmAb13676 was generally well tolerated, and a priming dose of 45 mcg/kg was chosen for continued dose escalation in Part B for patients with NHL. Safety was evaluated in all 53 patients. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were pyrexia (55%), CRS (53%), and anemia (41%). CRS was more frequent and generally higher grade on the first dose. Three patients (6%) experienced Grade 3 or 4 CRS on the first dose, all prior to the implementation of step-up dosing. AEs consistent with the symptoms of CRS, but not reported as such, were observed in an additional 23% of patients and were mild to moderate in severity.10:09SGEN Seattle Genetics and Takeda Pharma (TAK) announce additional analyses of results from ECHELON-1 and ECHELON-2 frontline phase 3 trials of ADCETRIS (116.36 -1.14)These analyses were presented at the 61st Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology. ADCETRIS (brentuximab vedotin) is an antibody-drug conjugate directed to CD30, a defining marker of classical Hodgkin lymphoma and expressed on the surface of several types of peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL). The ECHELON-1 analysis highlighted a four-year update of the phase 3 clinical trial in a poster presentation.ECHELON-1 is evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with AVD compared to ABVD in patients with Stage III or IV frontline classical Hodgkin lymphoma.As previously reported, the ECHELON-1 trial achieved its primary endpoint with the combination of ADCETRIS plus AVD resulting in a statistically significant improvement in modified progression-free survival compared to the control arm of ABVD as assessed by independent review facility. A four-year post-hoc exploratory analysis was conducted to examine PFS outcomes per investigator assessment in the intent-to-treat population of 1,334 patients, including results by PET2 status, age, stage and prognostic risk scores. Results include: The four-year PFS rate for patients in the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm was 81.7% compared to 75.1% in the ABVD arm, a difference of 6.6%. This represents a 31% reduction in the risk of progression or death. Median follow-up time was 48.4 months. A PFS benefit at four-years for ADCETRIS plus AVD was observed for all patients independent of PET2 status, including in patients who are less than 60 years old.Consistent improvement in PFS was observed among patients treated with ADCETRIS plus AVD compared with ABVD across the majority of pre-specified subgroups.As previously reported for the primary analysis, on the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm, peripheral neuropathy events were observed in 67% of patients compared to 43% in the ABVD arm. The four-year update shows that among patients with peripheral neuropathy, 83% in the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm and 84% in the ABVD arm reported complete resolution or improvement at last follow-up. The ECHELON-2 phase 3 clinical trial data were presented in an oral session at ASH and focused on the outcomes of the subset of patients who underwent consolidative stem cell transplant. ECHELON-2 is evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with CHP compared to CHOP in frontline CD30-expressing PTCL.As previously reported, the ECHELON-2 trial met its primary endpoint with the combination of ADCETRIS plus CHP resulting in a statistically significant improvement in PFS versus the control arm of CHOP per blinded independent central review. A post-hoc exploratory analysis evaluated the impact of consolidative stem cell transplant in the ECHELON-2 study for the patients who achieved CR treated with ADCETRIS plus CHP. In the ADCETRIS plus CHP arm, this included 38 patients in CR who received a stem cell transplant and 76 patients in CR who did not. Key findings of this analysis include:The PFS estimate favored the use of stem cell transplant (HR, 0.38; [95% CI: 0.18, 0.82]). After a median follow-up time of 35.9 months, the three-year PFS rate for the 38 patients who received a stem cell transplant was 76.1%. After a median follow-up time of 41.6 months, the three-year PFS rate for the 76 patients who did not receive a stem cell transplant was 53.3%. As previously reported, the safety profile of ADCETRIS plus CHP in the ECHELON-2 trial was comparable to CHOP and consistent with the established safety profile of ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy.10:08SWTX SpringWorks Therapeutics' collaborator GlaxoSmithKline presented data evaluating SpringWorks' nirogacestat alone and in combination with GlaxoSmithKline's belantamab mafodotin (27.00 +2.48)The data demonstrated that treatment of BCMA-expressing cancer cell lines with nirogacestat led to significantly increased levels of cell surface expression of BCMA and corresponding decreases in shedding of BCMA, as measured by levels of soluble BCMA. Further, the combination of nirogacestat and belantamab mafodotin resulted in synergistic increases in cancer cell killing as compared to belantamab mafodotin alone, with an up to ~3,000-fold improvement in cytotoxicity.09:40WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Stock market opens little changedThe major indices begin the day little changed.

It is the Company's intention to resume the Advantage Loan program as soon as management is confident its stated policies and procedures are being followed. However, it is presently difficult to estimate how long this suspension might last.The Advantage Loan program is a material component of the Bank's total loan originations. While it is difficult to quantify the financial impact of the program's temporary suspension, management anticipates a reduced level of near-term loan originations, slower overall loan portfolio growth, and less loan sales. However, management does not anticipate any credit related issues from previous loans made under the program due to the substantial amount of equity required for each borrower and the resulting strong collateral package for each loan. In order to mitigate the operational and financial impact of the Advantage Loan program's temporary suspension, the Company will continue to work on initiatives to diversify its overall loan production. Such initiatives include expanding the Bank's commercial lending efforts, including multifamily, tenant-in-common, construction, and commercial and industrial loans. In addition, management will continue to review new residential loan products that meet the needs of its customers in its served markets.08:13SCANX Gapping downGapping downIn reaction to disappointing earnings/guidance:THO -4.1%M&A news:DPLO -31.7% (to be acquired by UnitedHealth's (UNH) OptumRx for $4.00/share in cash)Other news:KALV -17.7% (announced results of the Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the use of KVD001) MNRL -4.4% (commences 11 mln common stock offering; 6 mln by the co and 5 mln by the selling stockholders) SYNH -3% (approves expansion and extension of the Company's existing stock repurchase program) AUPH -2.8% (commences registered underwritten public offering of $150 mln of its common shares) ERIC -0.7% (reaches resolution on US FCPA Investigations; combined payment of $1.06 bln) LITE -0.5% (to offer $850 mln aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2026)Analyst comments:M -2.1% (downgraded to Sell at Goldman)MMM -1.3% (downgraded to Neutral at Citigroup)ORLY -1.3% (downgraded to Neutral from Buy at Goldman)08:12APEI American Public Education Board authorizes program to repurchase up to an additional $25 mln of shares of the company's common stock (25.12 )08:10SCANX Gapping upGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:N/A.M&A news:THOR +168.5% (to be acquired by Sanofi (SNY) for $68/share in cash) XBIT +136.1% (to divest Human antibody Bermekimab targeting IL-1a to Janssen) ARQL +100.6% (to be acquired by Merck (MRK) for $20 per share in cash for an approximate total equity value of $2.7 billion) RRTS +10.9% (announces the sale of its Flatbed business unit for $30 mln in cash)Other news:FATE +25.1% (reports clinical data from Landmark Phase 1 studies; no dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients; also presents new in vivo preclinical data for FT596 -- company plans to initiate enrollment of first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in rarly 2020) OBSV +22.1% (reports positive Phase 3 trial results from PRIMROSE 2 trial of linzagolix) TGTX +22.1% (presents triple therapy data from Phase I/II study of ublituximab in combination with umbralisib and venetoclax) PCG +21% (reaches agreement to resolve wildfires from 2017 and 2018) CRTX +14% (reports new data revealing link between bacterial pathogen and genetic risk for Alzheimer's Disease) AGIO +12.4% (announces that clinical proof-of-concept has been established based on preliminary analysis of Phase 2 trial of mitapivat in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia) DTIL +9.4% (announces updated interim clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1 trial of its lead investigational off-the-shelf chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy candidate, PBCAR0191) RCKT +7.3% (presents "encouraging" preliminary results from its Phase 1 trial of commercial-grade RP-L102 "Process B" for Fanconi Anemia) ALEC +6.8% (presents Phase 1 data on AL002) SGMO +5.5% (Sangamo Therapeutics and Pfizer (PFE) report updated Phase 1/2 results showing sustained increased Factor VIII activity through 44 weeks) KPTI +5.3% (reports new and updated XPOVIO data demonstrating 56% overall response) BLUE +5% (Bluebirdbio and Bristol-Myers (BMY) report "positive" top-line results from Ph 2 KarMMa study of ide-cel; met its primary endpoint and key secondary endpoint) APTO +3.9% (reports early clinical observations with CG-806 and APTO-253) CGC +3.3% (names David Klein CEO effective January 14) AM +2.9% (to repurchase $100 mln of shares from Antero Resources) CSIQ +2.8% (authorizes $150 mln share repurchase program) BMY +2.3% (presents data from multiple studies evaluating lisocabtagene maraleucel at ASH) MNK +2.1% (presents data on a novel predictive model to identify infants at risk for infantile spasms) SESN +1.7% (initiated the submission of its BLA for Vicinium for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer under Rolling Review to the FDA)MBIO +1.3% (highlights presentation of updated Phase 1/2 clinical data for MB-107 lentiviral gene therapy for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency)Analyst comments:QRVO +3.4% (upgraded to Buy from Underperform at BofA/Merrill)SWKS +2.2% (upgraded to Buy from Underpeform at BofA/Merrill)NUE +1.4% (upgraded to Buy at Longbow)STLD +1.1% (upgraded to Buy at Longbow)08:10BONDX Overnight Treasury Market SummaryRebound in ProgressU.S. Treasuries will attempt to snap their three-day skid after Treasury futures inched higher during a quiet overnight session.

Weiss, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are highly encouraged by the first clinical data presented from our once daily, BTK inhibitor, TG-1701, which has demonstrated superior selectivity for BTK compared to ibrutinib in an in vitro whole kinome screening. The data presented today show that TG-1701 is an active BTK inhibitor as a single agent and that the combination of U2 plus TG-1701 has been generally well tolerated and active with 6 of 7 patients responding to the triple therapy at 100 mg QD, the lowest dose of TG-1701 tested. We look forward to continuing dose escalation of TG-1701 in the combination arm and identifying the optimal dose for this therapy." Mr. Weiss continued, "Our goal has always been to develop the best possible combination treatment options for patients, and we are excited to present the first data from a triple combination study in which all of the agents are being developed by TG. We believe this proprietary combination has the potential to enhance the results of BTK inhibitor therapy alone and offer patients early and deep responses with a tolerable safety profile."08:02GALT Galectin Therapeutics announces publication of results from its NASH-CX Phase 2 clinical trial in NASH cirrhosis in the peer-reviewed journal Gastroenterology (2.99 )The paper outlines that in a phase 2b study of 162 patients with NASH, cirrhosis, and portal hypertension, one year of biweekly infusion of belapectin was safe but not associated with significant reduction in HVPG or fibrosis, compared with placebo. However, in a subgroup analysis of patients without esophageal varices, 2 mg/kg belapectin (GR-MD-02) did reduce HVPG and development of varices. This subgroup analysis suggests that there may be benefits from belapectin in patients with NASH cirrhosis without esophageal varices. Further, if this observation can be reproduced in subsequent studies, belapectin may have a role in the management of patients with NASH cirrhosis and portal hypertension but no varices.08:01REPL Replimune names Jean M.

This was comparable to historical data with multiple doses of busulfan conditioning.CD117-ADC was well tolerated in non-human primates with no evidence of the often severe side effects seen with busulfan conditioning, including veno-occlusive disease, weight loss, diarrhea, mucositis, vomiting, pulmonary fibrosis or seizures.07:42TPX Tempur Sealy Int'l determines that it will record a charge of $30 mln (before tax) in Q4 in connection with the bankruptcy of one of its customers (85.89 )On December 6, 2019, Tempur Sealy determined that it will record a charge of $30 mln (before tax) in the fourth quarter of 2019, in connection with the bankruptcy of one of its customers, Mattress PAL Holding, LLC, and the resulting significant liquidity issues of Mattress PAL's affiliates (collectively, "Mattress1One"). On April 7, 2019, Mattress PAL filed a voluntary petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code ("Chapter 11 Proceedings"). On December 5, the Bankruptcy Court orally granted Mattress PAL's request to convert the Chapter 11 Proceedings to a Chapter 7 liquidation case. The company plans to treat this charge, which does not involve any cash payments, as an adjustment in calculating adjusted EBITDA under the company's senior secured credit agreement. Mattress1One represented less than 1% of the company's global net sales in 2019, and the company does not expect this charge, or the loss of Mattress1One as a customer, to have a material impact on the company's 2019 guidance, 2020 outlook, or current or future liquidity.07:37IEP Icahn Enterprises commences private placement of Senior Notes due 2027 (61.61 )The proceeds from the offering will be used for general limited partnership purposes.07:35MBIO Mustang Bio highlights presentation of updated Phase 1/2 clinical data for MB-107 lentiviral gene therapy for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (3.85 )Lentiviral Gene Therapy with Low Dose Busulfan for Infants with X-SCID Results in the Development of a Functional Normal Immune System: Interim Results of an Ongoing Phase I/II Clinical Study Lentiviral gene therapy using low dose busulfan conditioning has been well tolerated, with no serious adverse events other than hematologic related to busulfanAll 11 patients had robust hematopoietic recovery within 3-4 weeks post cell infusion without blood product support Nine patients, with a follow up of greater than 3 months, achieved normal-for-age T-cell and natural killer (NK)-cell numbers within 3-4 months post gene therapy Five patients are off intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy thus far, of whom 3 responded to vaccines Median vector copy number (VCN) at 12 months post-gene therapy in seven patients, who have been followed for more than 12 months, was 2.25 VCN/cell (range: 1.24-3.03) in T cells, 0.34 VCN/cell (range: 0.23-1.25) in B cells, 1.55 VCN/cell (range 1.27-3.39) in NK cells, and 0.08 VCN/cell (range: 0.03-0.76) in myeloid cells in peripheral blood, and 0.10 (range: 0.05-0.66) in CD34+ bone marrow cells, respectivelyEnhanced Transduction Lentivector Gene Therapy for Treatment of Older Patients with X-Linked Severe Combined ImmunodeficiencyEarly outcome data for five older children and young adults with XSCID who received the lentivector (also known as lentiviral) gene therapy as salvage therapy after having previously received haplo-identical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as infants without chemotherapy-based conditioning were previously reported and published in Science Translational Medicine. By 2016, three additional patients were treated, and the cohort of eight patients (referred to as Cohort A) has now been followed for 3 to 7 years. Among Cohort A, gradual clinical benefit in the clearance of chronic norovirus and associated improved abdominal complaints, malabsorption, growth and IgG production were observed, and four patients were able to cease immunoglobulin replacement therapy.While the results were positive, the relatively inefficient transduction of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) required large quantities of vector. This resulted in relatively low VCN in myeloid cells in some patients, with delayed immune cell recovery and persistent clinical disease, especially in the last patient treated (patient 8). To address this, NIH developed a refined enhanced transduction (ET) procedure consisting of a single overnight transduction after 48 hours pre-stimulation in cytokines (Stem cell factor, Thrombopoietin, Flt3-ligand; 100ng/mL) and incorporated transduction enhancers LentiBoost 1:100 and dimethyl prostaglandin 2 (dmPGE2; 1uM).The presentation at the 2019 ASH Annual Meeting included data from six patients (referred to as Cohort B) treated by NIH, including re-treatment of patient 8. The patients, who were aged 12 to 36, had significant problems with donor T cell infiltration of liver, bone marrow and kidneys, and were nearly absent of B and NK cells. The enhanced transduction procedure achieved much greater transduction efficiencies than were observed in Cohort A, with greater than 10-fold less vector, and resulted in faster immune reconstitution and more significant clinical benefit by 3 months.07:33AR Antero Resources highlights agreements expected to reduce its gathering, processing and transportation costs by approximately $350 mln over the next four years, commences asset sale program targeting $750 mln to $1 bln in proceeds to be completed in 2020 (2.19 )The agreements include a growth incentive fee program with Antero Midstream Corporation (AM) that aligns with the Company's current 8% to 10% compound annual production growth plan through 2021 and additional agreements with other third party midstream providers.

All response-evaluable patients experienced tumor reduction (complete response + partial response + stable disease) following treatment with ADCETRIS in combination with OPDIVO. Median duration of response was not yet reached and the maximum duration of response was 22 months and ongoing (95% CI: 7.06, -). The most common treatment-related adverse events of any grade occurring in at least 20 percent of patients were fatigue, diarrhea, pyrexia, infusion related reaction, peripheral motor neuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy and increase in lipase. One treatment-related serious adverse event was pyrexia. Fifty-seven percent of patients (12/21) had at least one treatment-related adverse event greater than or equal to Grade 3, most commonly increase in lipase (24 percent, 5/21), peripheral motor neuropathy and peripheral sensory neuropathy (each 14 percent, 3/21), and fatigue and hyponatremia (each 10 percent, 2/21). Two-Year Follow-up Results from the Phase 1-2 Study of Brentuximab Vedotin in Combination with Nivolumab in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (Abstract #238, oral presentation at 2:45 p.m. ET on Saturday, December 7, 2019) Of the 91 treated patients, 85 percent (77/91) had an objective response, including 67 percent (61/91) with a complete response, 16 patients with a partial response and six patients had stable disease. Of the 91 treated patients, 67 patients received an ASCT per trial protocol with no additional salvage therapy. For all treated patients, the two-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 79 percent (95% CI: 68%, 87%). For the 67 patients who received an ASCT per trial protocol, the two-year PFS was 92 percent (95% CI: 80%, 97%). Median follow-up for all treated patients was 24.2 months (range 1.8-41.7) and the median PFS was not reached. Estimated overall survival at two years was 94 percent (95% CI: 85%, 97%) and median overall survival was not yet reached. Peripheral immune signatures were consistent with an activated T-cell response. Prior to ASCT, the most common adverse events of any grade occurring in more than 20 percent of patients were nausea, infusion related reaction, fatigue, diarrhea, pruritus, headache, vomiting and pyrexia. Other adverse events included peripheral neuropathy in 16 patients (18 percent) and neutropenia in six patients (7 percent). Two patients (2 percent) discontinued treatment due to adverse events, Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy and increased gamma-glutamyltransferase. Serious adverse events occurred in 14 patients (15 percent), including pneumonia, pneumonitis and pyrexia (two patients each); and Grade 3 Guillain-Barre syndrome (one patient).06:52GILD Gilead Sciences reports Long-term data from ZUMA-1 demonstrating about half of refractory large b-cell lymphoma patients were alive three years after Yescarta treatment (67.08 )Co announced new data from the ZUMA-1 trial of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) in adult patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma. These results included updated overall survival data from the pivotal phase 2 study after three years following a single infusion of Yescarta, as well as an analysis from a separate safety management cohort of patients receiving early steroid intervention for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events. Updated results from a separate ZUMA-1 safety management study (Cohort 4) were also presented at the meeting (Abstract #243). In this analysis, patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma treated with Yescarta received earlier steroid intervention, beginning when patients experienced Grade 1 neurologic events or experienced Grade 1 CRS with no improvement after three days of supportive care. Patients could receive optional bridging chemotherapy prior to Yescarta infusion. In the analysis, 41 patients had received Yescarta, with a median follow-up of 8.7 months; 73% of patients received corticosteroids and 76% received tocilizumab. Earlier steroid use appeared to decrease the percentage of patients with Grade > or =3 CRS (2%) and neurologic events (17%), each of which were numerically lower than rates in the registrational cohorts of ZUMA-1 (13% CRS, 31% neurologic events). There were no Grade 4 or 5 CRS or neurologic events and no Grade 5 AEs related to Yescarta in Cohort 4. Objective response rate per investigator assessment was 73% in Cohort 4, with 51% of patients achieving a complete response. The median duration of response was 8.9 months. Fifty-four percent of patients in this cohort remained in an ongoing response with at least six months of follow-up after Yescarta infusion. Median OS in Cohort 4 has not been reached.06:51CRTX Cortexyme reports new data revealing link between bacterial pathogen and genetic risk for Alzheimer's Disease (28.31 )Co announced the presentation of new data supporting the on-target activity of COR388, its lead investigational medicine, and linking the "gingipain hypothesis" for Alzheimer's disease (AD) to the significance of the APOE gene as a major risk factor for the disease.Gingipains from P. gingivalis cleave ApoE proteins and have a preference for cleaving ApoE4; and COR388, a gingipain inhibitor, prevents this. In in vitro experiments, cells infected with P. gingivalis exhibited gingipain-dependent ApoE cleavage activity that generated ApoE fragments similar to what was seen in the brains and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, uninfected cells had no significant ApoE protein-cleaving activity. Furthermore, P. gingivalis gingipains cleaved ApoE4 more readily than ApoE3. Finally, in the infected cells, COR388 alone was sufficient to block ApoE fragmentation. In a Phase 1b trial, COR388 reduced ApoE fragments in CSF. Cortexyme's Phase 1 clinical development program for COR388 included cohorts of healthy volunteers and subjects with Alzheimer's disease. In addition to assessing safety and initial clinical activity, investigators also assessed the level of ApoE fragmentation in the CSF of nine subjects with Alzheimer's disease. Six subjects received 50mg of COR388 twice daily while three subjects received placebo. After 28 days, a statistically significant decrease in ApoE fragments (both ApoE4 and ApoE3) was observed in subjects treated with COR388 versus those treated with placebo.06:51EGRX Eagle Pharma commences dosing in pilot study for novel estrogen receptor antagonist product candidate (56.43 )The company has commenced dosing in a pilot clinical study to assess the unique characteristics of its fulvestrant product candidate, which has the potential to enhance estrogen receptor ("ER") inhibition and improve outcomes for patients with ER-positive breast cancer. The results of the pilot study will inform the design of the company's pivotal trial, which Eagle expects to commence in 2020.06:51BLUE Bluebirdbio presents new data from ongoing Phase 1/2 HGB-206 study of investigational LentiGlobin gene therapy for sickle cell disease (79.42 )HGB-206 is an ongoing, Phase 1/2 open-label study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LentiGlobin gene therapy for SCD that includes three treatment cohorts: Groups A, B, and C. All results are as of the data cutoff date of August 26, 2019.Groups A and B:As of the data cutoff date, seven out of nine total patients in Groups A and B (five out of seven in Group A and two out of two in Group B) did not require regular RBC transfusions post-treatment. Overall, patients in Groups A and B experienced a reduction, but not complete elimination of VOC and ACS events at two years post-treatment, suggesting that the levels of gene therapy-derived hemoglobin may have been sufficient to reduce but not eliminate continued sickle-related disease manifestations. Group C As of the data cutoff date, 17 patients were treated with LentiGlobin for SCD in Group C, with the longest follow-up at 21 months; none required regular RBC transfusions post-treatment. In patients with six or more months of follow-up (n=12), median levels of gene therapy-derived anti-sickling hemoglobin, HbAT87Q, were at least 40% of total hemoglobin. Total hemoglobin and HbAT87Q levels ranged from 9.3 -- 15.2 g/dL and 2.7 -- 9.0 g/dL, respectively, at last visit. Treatment with LentiGlobin for SCD reduced key markers of hemolysis, including reticulocyte counts, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and total bilirubin concentration, which suggests that treatment is improving biological markers of the disease. Among the nine patients with at least six months of follow-up who had four or more VOC or ACS events in the two years prior to treatment, there was a 99% reduction in annualized rate of VOC and ACS. There were no reports of ACS or serious VOC at up to 21 months post-treatment in these patients. As previously reported, there was one non-serious Grade 2 VOC was observed in a patient approximately 3.5 months post-LentiGlobin for SCD treatment.HGB-206 Exploratory Assays bluebird bio presented results from exploratory assays in samples from a subset of patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD from Groups A, B and C, to assess the relationship between drug product characteristics and RBC physiology. To demonstrate the pancellular expression of the gene therapy derived anti-sickling Hb, HbAT87Q, bluebird bio developed an assay that enables detection of HbAT87Q and HbS protein in individual RBCs. In 12 patients who had at least six months of follow-up, the proportion of RBCs positive for HbAT87Q at the last study visit was more than 70% in all cases; with more than 90% of RBCs positive for HbAT87Q in four patients.On average, HbAT87Q present in RBCs of patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD was within the range of non-sickling adult Hb, HbA, present in the RBCs from people with sickle cell trait. The RBCs also resembled sickle cell trait RBCs with regard to propensity to sickle under low oxygen conditions. Sickling of RBCs from patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD was significantly less than that seen in untreated patients with SCD.06:49MNK Mallinckrodt plc presents data on a novel predictive model to identify infants at risk for infantile spasms (3.41 )Co announced findings on the use of a novel predictive model designed to more quickly identify infants with infantile spasms (IS), a rare seizure disorder that typically occurs between three and seven months of age. Key FindingsDeductive models developed to identify the combinations of variables that predict IS prior to diagnosis and during the treatment pathway: 557 patients had =2 symptoms pertaining to IS -- seizures, developmental delay, lack of eye contact and lack of muscle tone -- and a moderate or high severity ED visit. In this group, 55 percent of patients (n=304) had an IS diagnosis within a median 0.8 months of the triggering event. The most notable deductive combinations focused on pre-diagnosis of IS. MethodsThe study utilized data from the Symphony Health Integrated Dataverse database to identify triggers for early identification of IS patients from medical and pharmacy claims from 10.8 million patients under 2 years of age between May 2017 and April 2018. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) procedure codes were evaluated to identify the codes most likely to predict a subsequent diagnosis of IS. Researchers also used input from IS medical experts to determine the clinical, electrographic, radiologic, procedural and medication variables that may predict IS development.06:48SGMO Sangamo Therapeutics announces preliminary results from first three patients treated in Phase 1/2 THALES study evaluating investigational ST-400 ex vivo gene-edited cell therapy in transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (11.66 )The three patients treated with ST-400 experienced prompt hematopoietic reconstitution, demonstrating neutrophil engraftment in 14-22 days and platelet engraftment in 22-35 days (Table 1). No emerging clonal hematopoiesis has to date been observed by on-target indel pattern monitoring in the three treated patients. Reported adverse events (AEs) are consistent with the known toxicities of mobilization, apheresis, and myeloablative busulfan conditioning. One serious adverse event (SAE) related to ST-400 was reported. As previously disclosed, Patient 1 experienced hypersensitivity during ST-400 infusion considered by the investigator to be likely related to the product cryoprotectant excipient, DMSO, and which resolved by the end of the infusion.06:47LITE Lumentum to offer $850 mln aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2026 (72.08 )Lumentum intends to use approximately $196 million of the net proceeds of the offering to repay in full all amounts outstanding under its term loan credit facility, and a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to purchase up to approximately $200 million of its common stock concurrently with the pricing of this offering in privately negotiated transactions effected through the initial purchaser of the notes or its affiliates as its agent.

In addition, there was a 61 percent probability that patients who achieved a CR would maintain it after five years.06:38AGIO Agios Pharma announces that clinical proof-of-concept has been established based on preliminary analysis of Phase 2 trial of mitapivat in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (40.94 )The Phase 2 study has enrolled 12 of the intended 17 patients (nine with -thalassemia and three with a-thalassemia). As of the November 14, 2019 data cutoff date, eight patients, all with -thalassemia, were evaluable for the primary endpoint of a hemoglobin increase of =1.0 g/dL from baseline in at least one assessment during Weeks 4-12. All eight patients were treated with 50 mg of mitapivat twice daily for the first six weeks and escalated to 100 mg twice daily, and all patients remain on treatment (range 12.4-34.3 weeks). Seven of eight efficacy evaluable patients achieved a hemoglobin increase of =1.0 g/dL, and for responders the mean hemoglobin increase from baseline was 1.76 g/dL (range, 0.9--3.3 g/dL) during Weeks 4-12. The majority of adverse events were Grade 1 or 2 and consistent with previously published Phase 2 data for mitapivat in patients with pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency. Updated results from the Phase 2 thalassemia study will be presented at a medical meeting in the first half of 2020.06:38PRNB Principia Biopharma reports positive data of PRN1008 for Immune Thrombocytopenia in ongoing Phase 1/2 Trial (37.39 )Co announced consistent positive data from an ongoing Phase 1/2 trial of its investigational treatment, PRN1008, in 31 highly treatment-resistant and refractory patients (median of six prior therapies) with immune thrombocytopenia.Of the 31 patients, 39 percent (80 percent confidence interval (CI) 28, 50), irrespective of dose and duration of treatment, achieved the trial's primary endpoint of =2 consecutive platelet counts of =50,000/L, separated by at least five days, and increased by =20,000/L from baseline, without requiring rescue medication. In addition, 45 percent (80 percent CI 34, 57) of enrolled patients achieved any two platelet counts =50,000/L. Most patients who achieved the primary endpoint had a platelet count >30,000/L by the first week of treatment. Preliminary data on 13 patients treated at higher doses (300mg and 400mg twice daily) and who had completed at least 12 weeks of therapy, demonstrated a response rate of 54 percent (80 percent CI 37, 70) and 62 percent (80 percent CI 44, 77) for both endpoints respectively. To date PRN1008 has been well-tolerated at all doses studied, whether given as a monotherapy or with allowed concomitant ITP therapy (thrombopoietin and steroids), with no reported treatment related bleeding or thrombotic events. Related treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 35 percent of patients and were all grade 1 or 2.06:37ZIOP ZIOPHARM presents pre-clinical data of Rapid Personalized Manufacture (5.16 )Data were presented today in the poster presentation "Rapid Personalized Manufacture (RPM) of Sleeping Beauty System-generated NY-ESO-1-specific TCR-T Cells Co-Expressing Membrane-bound IL-15 Yields Antitumor Responses" and demonstrated:T cells can be genetically modified with the Sleeping Beauty system to express TCR and mbIL15T cells expressing TCR and mbIL15 exhibited superior anti-tumor effects compared with TCR-modified T cells without mbIL15T cells expressing TCR and mbIL15 are infused the day after gene transfer per RPMLow-dose of T cells genetically modified per RPM to express TCR and mbIL15 exhibit anti-tumor effectsT cells expressing TCR and mbIL15 persist in mouse model06:36TGTX TG Therapeutics presents triple therapy data from Phase I/II study of ublituximab in combination with umbralisib and venetoclax in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (7.12 )Title: A Phase 1/2 Study of Umbralisib, Ublituximab and Venetoclax in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)Overall response rate (ORR) of 87% (20/23) after U2 induction period at cycle 3, prior to introduction of venetoclax, in relapsed/refractory CLL patients, including patients refractory to ibrutinibU2 induction appeared to reduce venetoclax TLS risk, with no patients remaining as TLS high-risk following 3 cycles of U213 patients treated for >7 cycles and 9 patients for > 12 cycles: 100% ORR (13/13) after cycle 7 for the triple combination 100% ORR (9/9) including 44% Complete Response (CR) after cycle 12 for the combination100% (9/9) of patients had undetectable minimal residual disease (MRD) (<0.01%) in peripheral blood after 12 cycles of therapy; and78% (7/9) of patients who completed 12 cycles of therapy had undetectable MRD in bone marrow and have stopped therapy No patients (n = 27) have progressed to date with a median follow-up of 6.4 monthsTriple combination was generally well tolerated with no events of TLS observed06:36TAK Takeda Pharma presents Phase 3 TOURMALINE-AL1 results (20.26 )Co announced that results of the TOURMALINE-AL1 trial. Key findings, to be presented by Dr. Angela Dispenzieri, include: The first of two primary endpoints was not met in TOURMALINE-AL1. Hematologic responses were seen in 53% versus 51% of patients receiving NINLARO plus dexamethasone versus physician's choice (odds ratio 1.10 [95% CI 0.60-2.01], p=0.762).Complete response (CR) rate was 26% in the NINLARO plus dexamethasone arm versus 18% in the physician's choice arm. The second primary endpoint, two-year vital organ deterioration or death, was not mature at the time of analysis.Safety data includes: Drug-related adverse events (AE) were experienced by 82% of patients receiving NINLARO plus dexamethasone compared to 81% of patients receiving physician's choice. Serious adverse events (SAE) were experienced by 47% of patients in the NINLARO plus dexamethasone arm compared to 33% in the physician's choice arm.06:34BPMC Blueprint Medicines announces initial data from Phase 2 PIONEER clinical trial of avapritinib in patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis (78.48 )Initial data from the dose-finding Part 1 of the PIONEER trial showed rapid and robust reductions in serum tryptase, a well-established measure of mast cell burden, in patients treated with 25 mg, 50 mg or 100 mg of avapritinib once daily (QD). All dose levels of avapritinib tested were well-tolerated, and no patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse event (AE).Blueprint Medicines plans to report additional data from Part 1 of the PIONEER trial that will inform the selection of a recommended Part 2 dose (RP2D), including the change in patient-reported disease symptoms as measured by the Indolent SM Symptom Assessment Form (ISM-SAF), in the first quarter of 2020. The registration-enabling Part 2 of the PIONEER trial is anticipated to initiate patient screening in the first half of 2020.06:34REGN Regeneron Pharma announces initial clinical data for REGN5458 in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma (372.26 )Results were presented today at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting from the first two dose groups (3 mg and 6 mg weekly doses). Patients had a median of seven lines of prior systemic therapy, and all had failed CD38 antibody treatment. Responses were observed in 4 of 7 (57%) patients, including 3 of 4 (75%) in the 6 mg dose group. In the 6 mg dose group, 2 patients (50%) were also minimal residual disease (MRD) negative, meaning that no cancer cells were detectable in their bone marrow.As of data cutoff, there have been no neurotoxicity, dose-limiting toxicities or treatment discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs). The most common treatment-emergent AEs were lymphopenia (n=5), anemia (n=4) and thrombocytopenia and cytokine release syndrome (n=3 each). Grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent AEs were seen in 5 patients and included lymphopenia (n=3), hypertension (n=2) and anemia, atrial fibrillation, fatigue, febrile neutropenia, pain in extremity, septic shock and thrombocytopenia (n=1 each).06:33STZ Constellation Brands names Garth Hankinson Executive Vice President and CFO (183.65 )Co announces that Garth Hankinson has been promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective January 13, 2020.

The results from the pharmacokinetic and occupancy studies for the first seven patients have been in-line with expectations. The Company anticipates that a dose that achieves maximum target occupancy will be achieved in the next one or two dose cohorts. CPI-818 has been shown to bind covalently to ITK at low nanomolar concentrations without reacting with other kinases. In vitro studies demonstrated selective cytotoxicity to Sezary cells (malignant cells from patients with CTCL), while sparing normal T-cells, in three subjects not enrolled in the study. Preclinical murine models of lymphoproliferative and autoimmune disease showed CPI-818 inhibited the development of lymph node and spleen enlargement by preventing proliferation of abnormal T-cells. Treatment with CPI-818 led to regression of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly in animals with established disease.06:32CGC Canopy Growth names David Klein CEO effective January 14 (18.65 )In his current role as executive vice president and chief financial officer at Constellation Brands, David oversees all aspects of the company's finance operations, all mergers and acquisitions, as well as the company's information technology function.The appointment of David Klein follows a thorough recruitment process overseen by a special Hiring Committee of the Board using global recruitment company Heidrick & Struggles, which saw a wide variety of exceptional candidates vetted and interviewed.

Fourteen patients were evaluable at one month.AUTO3 was well-tolerated, with no patients experiencing > or = Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with primary infusion and 1 of 14 experiencing Grade 3 neurotoxicity that resolved swiftly with steroids. There were no pembrolizumab immune-related toxicities and the majority of grade 3 or higher adverse events were hematological. Low levels of serum cytokines are consistent with the observed low levels of CRS and neurotoxicity. Across all tested doses 5 patients achieved a complete response, with 4 of 5 complete responses ongoing, the longest at 18 months. All CRs were achieved without need for steroid or tocilizumab-based management of the patients or ICU level care.AUTO3 -- (Poster) - Phase 1/2 AMELIA clinical trial of AUTO3 in patients with relapsed/refractory pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pALL) (Abstract # 2620)AUTO3 was well-tolerated overall, with no patients experiencing = Grade 3 CRS and no patients experiencing > or = Grade 2 neurotoxicity, in doses > or =3x106 /kg CAR-T cells. No AUTO3-related deaths were reported.Among the 10 CAR T-nave patients, at a median follow-up time of 9.7 months (range 1.8- 18), 9 of 10 patients (90%) achieved a complete response, and 8 of 10 (80%) achieved complete molecular remission by PCR. Estimated overall survival at 12 months was 100%. There are 2 ongoing patients in complete molecular remission at 12 and 15 months post-AUTO3 infusion, respectively. The most common cause of relapse was due to loss of CAR T-cell persistence. The median persistence of CAR-T cells in blood was 170 days.06:29STOK Stoke Therapeutics presents new preclinical data on STK-001 for the treatment of Dravet syndrome (28.98 )Data from studies in non-human primates (NHP) showed STK-001 distributed throughout the brain and achieved target engagement and increased Nav1.1 protein expression throughout the cortex after a single intrathecal injection. Safety findings showed STK-001 to be well-tolerated at the two intrathecal dose levels studied. These data were presented in a poster session at the American Epilepsy Society (AES) Annual Meeting in Baltimore.Stoke plans to submit an investigational new drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in early 2020 and, subject to acceptance of the IND, plans to initiate a Phase 1/2 single-ascending dose study in children and adolescents with Dravet syndrome in the first half of 2020.06:28FATE Fate Therapeutics presents new in vivo preclinical data for FT596 -- company plans to initiate enrollment of first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in rarly 2020 (13.67 )FT596 is the first cellular immunotherapy engineered with three active anti-tumor components to be cleared for clinical investigation by the FDA. In addition to a proprietary CAR targeting CD19, FT596 expresses a novel high-affinity, non-cleavable CD16 (hnCD16) Fc receptor that has been modified to augment antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, enabling coincident targeting of CD19 and additional tumor-associated antigens such as CD20. FT596 also expresses an interleukin-15 receptor fusion (IL-15RF), a potent cytokine complex that promotes survival, proliferation and trans-activation of NK cells and CD8 T cells without the need for systemic cytokine support. Together, these features of FT596 are intended to maximize potency and minimize toxicity in treated patients. The Company plans to initiate enrollment of a first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in early 2020.New preclinical data presented at ASH showed that FT596 administered as a monotherapy exhibited durable tumor clearance and extended survival in vivo similar to primary CAR T cells in a humanized mouse model of CD19+ lymphoma. Additionally, when combined with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab, FT596 showed enhanced killing of CD20+ lymphoma cells in vivo as compared to rituximab alone. These data confirm previously presented in vitro findings that demonstrate the unique multi-antigen targeting functionality of FT596, and the product candidate's potential to effectively overcome CD19 antigen escape.The Company also announced that, in preparation for Phase 1 initiation, it had recently completed GMP production of FT596. In a single small-scale manufacturing campaign, the Company produced over 300 cryopreserved, infusion-ready doses of FT596 at a cost of approximately $2,500 per dose. The Company's iPSC product platform unites stem cell biology and precision genetic engineering to create renewable master engineered iPSC lines that can be repeatedly used to mass produce cancer-fighting immune cells, replacing the high production costs, weeks of manufacturing time, and complex manufacturing processes required for current-generation CAR T-cell immunotherapies with a lower-cost, easier-to-manufacture, well-characterized, off-the-shelf product that has the potential to reach many more patients.06:27SGMO Sangamo Therapeutics and Pfizer (PFE) report updated Phase 1/2 results showing sustained increased Factor VIII activity through 44 weeks (11.66 )Sangamo Therapeutics (SGMO) and Pfizer (PFE) announced updated follow-up results from the Phase 1/2 Alta study evaluating investigational SB-525 gene therapy in patients with severe hemophilia A. The data showed that SB-525 was generally well tolerated and demonstrated sustained increased Factor VIII (FVIII) levels following treatment with SB-525 through to 44 weeks, the extent of follow-up for the longest treated patient in the 3e13 vg/kg dose cohort.06:27KURA Kura Oncology provides clinical and regulatory updates for lead drug candidate, tipifarnib, in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (15.61 )In June 2019, Kura reported that the primary efficacy endpoint was achieved in each of the expansion cohorts in its Phase 2 trial of tipifarnib in relapsed or refractory PTCL: 1) patients with AITL, an aggressive form of T-cell lymphoma often characterized by high levels of CXCL12 expression, and 2) patients with PTCL who lack a single nucleotide variation in the 3'-untranslated region of the CXCL12 gene. Given the high level of activity observed among AITL patients, Kura continued to enroll patients to acquire more experience regarding safety and tolerability in this population. Based upon the 2016 revision of the World Health Organization classification of lymphoid neoplasms1, AITL and AITL-like histologies represent approximately one-third of all PTCL cases.As of the November 11, 2019 data cutoff date, a total of 26 patients with relapsed or refractory AITL were enrolled in all stages of the trial. Among the 20 patients evaluable for efficacy, five achieved a complete response (CR) and five achieved a partial response (PR), for an objective response rate (ORR) of 50% on an evaluable basis and 38% on an intent-to-treat basis. In addition, three patients experienced disease stabilization. Patients had a median of three prior regimens (range 1-7).Next-generation sequencing of 19 available patient biopsies showed that 10 (53%) carried C336R/Q386E variants in the killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) 3DL2, an immune checkpoint receptor. Four of the 10 patients with KIR3DL2 variants achieved a CR and three achieved a PR, for a CR rate of 40% and an ORR of 70%. This compares to a CR rate of 11% and an ORR of 22% among the nine AITL patients with KIR3DL2 wild type.Regulatory Update: Following FDA feedback from an end-of-Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting, Kura plans to initiate a Phase 2 registration-directed trial of tipifarnib in patients with relapsed or refractory AITL and related lymphomas in 2020. The multi-center, single-arm trial will target enrollment of 128 patients with AITL and AITL-like histologies who are relapsed or refractory to at least one prior systemic cytotoxic therapy.06:26PTLA Portola Pharma presents new interim results from ongoing Phase 2a study of cerdulatinib in patients with specific subtypes of T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (29.21 )As of the November 12, 2019 cut-off date, 64 PTCL patients and 40 CTCL patients treated with cerdulatinib as a single agent were evaluable for response. The overall response rate (ORR) was 34% in the PTCL cohort and 43% in the CTCL cohort. Among the subset of patients in the PTCL cohort with AITL, the ORR was 52% and the complete response rate (CR) was 37%.Among the 64 patients in the PTCL cohort, 14 patients (22%) achieved a CR and eight patients (12%) achieved a partial response (PR). In the subgroup of 27 patients with AITL, 10 patients (37%) achieved a CR, and four patients (15%) achieved a PR. The median duration of response is eight months for all PTCL patients and is greater than nine months in AITL patients. Follow-up is ongoing. Among the 40 patients in the CTCL cohort, three patients (8%) achieved a CR and 14 patients (35%) achieved a PR. Importantly, rapid improvements in pruritus, or severe itching -- a common and often serious condition associated with CTCL -- have been observed, as measured by the Likert scale.Cerdulatinib demonstrated good tolerability in both PTCL and CTCL. The most common Grade 3 or greater adverse events across the PTCL and CTCL cohorts with a frequency > 5% were lipase increase (25%), amylase increase (19%), neutropenia (12%), anemia (10%), diarrhea (8%), sepsis/bacteremia (6%), and febrile neutropenia (4%). The lipase and amylase changes were generally asymptomatic and not associated with pancreatitis.06:25XENE Xenon Pharmaceuticals provides updates on partnered neurology pipeline programs (13.95 )Xenon Pharmaceuticals announced that it will provide updates on its partnered epilepsy programs at the American Epilepsy Society Annual Meeting.Overview of clinical stage XEN901 and Related Patient Survey to be Presented in the "Genetic Epilepsies -- Updates in the Science and Diagnosis" on December 8th.Pre-clinical work suggests selective sodium channel inhibitors that reduce action potential firing in excitatory neurons, while sparing inhibitory interneurons, may provide promising drug profile.06:25IMV IMV presents updated results from SPiReL at ASH (2.83 )The poster, which included additional data collected between the abstract submission and the presentation, continued to demonstrate a favorable therapeutic profile and treatment-associated clinical benefit in r/r DLBCL patients who received the DPX-Survivac combination regimen.06:24QURE uniQure presents updated clinical data on three patients treated in ongoing Phase IIb study of etranacogene dezaparvovec; additionally presents up to 4 years of follow-up data on the 10 patients in the Phase I/II trial of AMT-060 (66.05 )At Least One Year of Stable, Therapeutic Levels of FIX Activity in Patients Treated with Etranacogene Dezaparvovec: Featured in a poster presentation at ASH, the 52 weeks of follow-up data show that all three patients have stabilized and sustained FIX activity at therapeutic levels after the one-time administration of etranacogene dezaparvovec. Mean FIX activity for the three patients at 52 weeks after administration was 41% of normal, with the first patient achieving FIX activity of 50% of normal, the second patient achieving FIX activity of 31% of normal and the third patient achieving FIX activity of 41% of normal. The second and third patients had previously screen-failed and were excluded from another gene therapy study due to pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to a different AAV vector. Reported FIX activity was measured using an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay performed at a central laboratory.At one year after dosing, no patient in the study has reported any bleeding events. All patients have remained free of prophylaxis after receiving etranacogene dezaparvovec. One patient, who had earlier in the study undergone hip surgery due to a pre-existing condition, experienced back pain and treated himself with a single infusion of factor replacement, which was later determined by the patient and the investigator to be unrelated to a bleed. No other FIX infusions were reported by any patient.Stable FIX Expression and Durable Reductions in Bleeding and FIX Consumption for up to 4 Years Following AMT-060 Gene Therapy:In the ongoing Phase I/II study of AMT-060, all 10 patients continue to show long-term clinical benefit, including sustained increases in FIX activity, reduced usage of FIX replacement therapy, and decreased bleeding frequency. At up to 4 years of follow-up, AMT-060 continues to be well-tolerated, with no new serious adverse events and no development of inhibitors since the last reported data.All five patients in the second dose cohort of 2x1013 gc/kg (the dose being studied in the ongoing Phase III HOPE-B study of etranacogene dezaparvovec) continue to be free of routine FIX replacement therapy at 3.5 years after treatment. Based on the six months of data collected during the fourth year of follow-up, the mean annualized bleeding rate was zero compared to an average of 4 bleeds during the year prior to treatment, representing a 100% reduction. During this same period, the usage of FIX replacement therapy also declined 100% compared to the year prior to treatment. Mean FIX activity over 3.5 years was 7.5%.06:22FATE Fate Therapeutics reports clinical data from Landmark Phase 1 studies; no dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients (13.67 )Fate Therapeutics announced initial clinical data for its FT516 and FT500 off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived natural killer (NK) cell product candidates.No morphologic evidence of leukemia and complete neutrophil recovery observed in first patient treated with FT516 Monotherapy for AML following first dosing cycleNo dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients treated with FT500 for advanced solid tumorsFavorable FT500 Phase 1 Safety, Tolerability and Immunogenicity profile validates novel multi-dose treatment paradigm for off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived NK cell products.06:22BMY Bristol-Myers presents data from multiple studies evaluating lisocabtagene maraleucel at ASH (59.95 )These studies included an evaluation of liso-cel in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) (TRANSCEND CLL 004); a study in second-line patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients who were ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) (PILOT); and a separate analysis of patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma who received liso-cel in the outpatient setting across three studies."The results in relapsed or refractory CLL and SLL demonstrated a high rate of durable complete responses achieved in heavily pre-treated patients, including patients who have failed ibrutinib and venetoclax. We are encouraged by the potential of liso-cel to treat second-line relapsed or refractory large B-cell NHL patients who are not able to undergo a stem cell transplant. Finally, the analysis evaluating liso-cel administered in the outpatient setting demonstrates that not all patients require hospitalization and that the safety and efficacy profile across a variety of types of clinical sites is consistent."06:20LLY Eli Lilly presents interim clinical data from the LOXO-305 global Phase 1/2 BRUIN dose escalation trial (119.64 )At all doses studied, LOXO-305 delivered objective responses in patients who had received diverse prior therapies and had exhibited varied molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance.Of 16 CLL patients enrolled, there were 10 responders (8 partial responses, 2 partial response with ongoing lymphocytosis) among 13 patients eligible for response assessment, resulting in a 77% ORR. All patients with CLL have demonstrated tumor reduction, with evidence of deepening response over time. Responses were observed in patients with acquired resistance to prior BTK therapy (those with and without C481S mutations), in patients who were intolerant to prior BTK therapy, and in patients with acquired resistance to prior BCL2 therapy (including one with a known BCL G101V mutation). As expected, LOXO-305 treatment causes acute lymphocytosis, which resolves over time -- a well described pharmacodynamic response associated with effective BTK inhibition. Of the three CLL patients not yet eligible for response assessment (one with the BTK C481S mutation), all three have demonstrated lymphocytosis early in cycle 1. All CLL responding patients remain in response, and all CLL patients remain on study. Of eight MCL patients enrolled, there were three responses (1 complete response, 2 partial responses) among six patients eligible for response assessment, resulting in a 50% ORR. Two of the responders had progressed on prior BTK therapy (but without a documented C481x mutation). All MCL responding patients remain in response and on study. Three MCL patients discontinued therapy in cycle 1 due to progressive disease.Most treatment-emergent adverse events were Grade 1 in severity with the most commonly reported events, regardless of attribution, being fatigue (25% total: 21% Grade 1, 4% Grade 2) and diarrhea (18% total: 14% Grade 1, 4% Grade 2). Two adverse events > or =Grade 3 were attributed to LOXO-305 (Grade 3 leukocytosis and Grade 3 transient neutropenia). No dose limiting toxicities were reported and an MTD had not been reached.06:19AZN AstraZeneca reports full results from Phase III ELEVATE TN trial (47.68 )AstraZeneca presented results from the interim analysis of the Phase III ELEVATE TN trial, showing that CALQUENCE (acalabrutinib) combined with obinutuzumab or as monotherapy significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab, a standard chemo-immunotherapy treatment, in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia.In an exploratory analysis, CALQUENCE in combination or alone demonstrated consistent PFS improvements across most pre-specified subgroups of patients with high-risk disease characteristics, including the unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable gene (IGHV), del(11q) and complex karyotype. Overall, the safety and tolerability profile of CALQUENCE observed in the ELEVATE TN trial was consistent with its known profile.06:19BGNE BeiGene presents clinical data from three trials of its BTK inhibitor BRUKINSA at ASH (186.92 )In two oral presentations of BRUKINSA in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), the drug candidate demonstrated consistent safety and a high overall response rate (ORR); in the poster presentation of BRUKINSA combined with BeiGene's investigational anti-PD-1 antibody tislelizumab in patients with previously treated B-cell malignancies, the combination treatment showed preliminary efficacy and was generally well tolerated."The results presented today on BRUKINSA, a BTK inhibitor designed to maximize target occupancy and minimize off-target binding, demonstrated robust clinical activity and a safety profile consistent with what we've observed to date in our clinical trials, including safety data that supported the recent U.S. FDA accelerated approval in patients with previously treated mantle cell lymphoma," said Jane Huang, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, hematology at BeiGene. "CLL or SLL is the most common type of leukemia in adults, and despite the advancements of BTK inhibitor therapy for these cancers, there remains a need for highly selective BTK inhibitors capable of promoting long-term responses, and with a safety profile that is tolerable over time. The results presented here today further demonstrate the potential for BRUKINSA to help people living with these persistent, life-threatening cancers."06:18RCKT Rocket Pharmaceuticals presents "encouraging" preliminary results from its Phase 1 trial of commercial-grade RP-L102 'Process B' for Fanconi Anemia (22.37 )Results presented in the poster highlight preliminary Phase 1 data from two pediatric patients (age 5 and 6 years) who were treated with "Process B" RP-L102 prior to the development of severe bone marrow failure and are in ongoing follow-up. Drug product was successfully manufactured using "Process B" optimization, including transduction enhancers, commercial-grade vector, and modified cell processing. "Process B" drug product is manufactured to commercial grade standards, allowing for consistent drug product across patients and a vector copy number (VCN) two to three fold higher than that administered to optimally-treated "Process A" patients.Once transduced, drug product was infused fresh into patients without any prior conditioning regimen. To evaluate transduction efficiency, an analysis of the proportion of the MMC-resistant colony forming cells was conducted. Both patients exhibited early signs of engraftment based on peripheral blood, VCN and/or MMC-resistance. Preliminary phenotypic correction was also apparent in both patients, as evidenced by stabilization or increases in blood cell lineages. No safety or tolerability issues have been reported.06:18ABBV AbbVie reports new results from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE clinical trial showing the potential of this fixed-duration combination therapy (86.98 )AbbVie announced new data from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE (PCYC-1142) clinical trial, evaluating IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) in combination with VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO (venetoclax) in previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Results showed that patients who received up to 12 cycles of the combination regimen achieved high rates of undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD) in both peripheral blood (PB; 75% of patients) and in bone marrow (BM; 72% of patients). Safety data were consistent with the known safety profiles of IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO used as individual therapies.Results showed uMRD -- defined as less than 1 CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes (MRD<0.01%) by flow cytometry of PB or BM samples -- was achieved at any time after baseline in PB for 75% of patients (122 of 163 patients) and in BM for 72% (111 of 155 patients). The proportion of patients who had uMRD in PB increased over time from 57% after 6 cycles, 68% after 9 cycles, and 73% after 12 cycles of IMBRUVICA plus VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO. The high rates of uMRD in BM were consistent across high-risk subgroups, including in patients with del(17p), del(17p) or TP53 mutation, del(11q), complex karyotype, and unmutated IGHV status. In patients with uMRD in PB with matched BM samples, 93% of patients had uMRD in both PB and BM. With median follow-up of 14.7 months, 3 patients (2%) experienced disease progression.06:17OBSV ObsEva reports positive Phase 3 trial results from PRIMROSE 2 trial of linzagolix for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids (4.57 )The responder rate was 93.9% (p <0.001) for women receiving 200 mg with ABT and 56.7% for women receiving 100 mg without ABT (p <0.001), compared to 29.4% in the placebo group. Both doses achieved significant rates of amenorrhea (p <0.001), reduction in pain (p <0.001), and improvement in quality of life (p <0.001). Additionally, significant improvement (p <0.001) in hemoglobin levels, a reduction in number of days of bleeding and reduction in uterine volume were observed. Furthermore, a significant reduction in fibroid volume was also observed for the 200 mg dose with ABT (p <0.008).The overall safety profile was in line with expectations and confirmed that linzagolix was well-tolerated. The most frequently observed adverse events (occurring in > 5% of patients) were headache, hot flushes, and anemia. Mean percentage change from baseline in BMD was consistent with previous clinical data."We look forward to the results from our second pivotal study, PRIMROSE 1 conducted in the US, in Q2 2020. Assuming positive results, we expect that it would lead to a Marketing Authorization Application submission with the European Medicines Agency by year-end 2020 and a New Drug Application submission with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by Q1 2021."06:16THOR Synthorx to be acquired by Sanofi (SNY) for $68/share in cash (25.03 )Under the terms of the merger agreement, Sanofi will commence a cash tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Synthorx common stock for $68 per share in cash for a total enterprise value of approximately $2.35 billion.

While the DOJ and SEC conduct separate investigations, the same facts have been shared by Ericsson with both authorities. The resolution relates to historical FCPA breaches ending Q1 2017. While the Company had a compliance program and a supporting control framework, they were not adequately implemented. Specifically, certain employees in some markets, some of whom were executives in those markets, acted in bad faith and knowingly failed to implement sufficient controls. They were able to enter into transactions for illegitimate purposes and, together with people under their influence, used sophisticated schemes in order to hide their wrongdoing.Separately, Ericsson agreed to resolve civil charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) relating to allegations of violations of the bribery and accounting provisions of the FCPA. Ericsson agreed to the entry of a judgment enjoining it from future violations of the FCPA and it agreed to pay a financial sanction of $458,380,000, plus pre-judgment interest of $81,540,000.As part of the settlement, Ericsson has agreed to engage an independent compliance monitor for a period of three years while the Company continues to undertake significant reforms to strengthen its Ethics & Compliance program.The combined payment of $1.06 b.

This may just be the calm before the storm considering all the macro-related events set to take place as the week unfolds. S&P Futures saw a relative quiet beginning with only a nine point overnight range. The market is currently trading around the 3144 area, with a high of 3148.50 and a low of 3139.50. In Asia, both China and Japan finished the day marginally higher. The Shanghai struggled to gain much following lighter than expected export data that saw a 1.1% fall in November, compared to a forecast of +0.8%.The Nikkei traded around in a narrow range that culminated with a gain of 0.3%. Heavyweights such as Softbank and Sony both gained more than 1% by day's end. European markets slightly under water. The weaker than expected Export data out of China has likely kept the EU markets in check.

AL002 is a monoclonal antibody intended to enhance the activity of TREM2 and is being developed by Alector for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in collaboration with its partner AbbVie (ABBV). The data were presented today at the 12th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) meeting. The AL002 presentation at CTAD showcases the first data in humans showing that a TREM2 activating antibody engages its target and demonstrates downstream activity in the CNS. The data reported today are from the study's SAD phase in 56 healthy adults, who were enrolled into nine escalating dose cohorts. AL002 was found to be generally safe and well-tolerated. AL002 reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) soluble TREM2 in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating proof-of-target engagement in the brain. AL002 elevated a biomarker for microglia activity in the CSF, indicating proof-of-mechanism. The Phase 1b portion of the study in Alzheimer's disease patients is on-going.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD16:19WTRE Watford Holdings agrees to purchase Axeria IARD; terms not disclosed (26.47 +0.25)Axeria IARD is a property and casualty insurance company based in France.

China has pain pill addicts too, but no one's counting themAssociated Press InternationalDecember 31, 2019 Tuesday 5:21 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWS; Only on APLength: 3238 wordsByline: By ERIKA KINETZ, Associated PressDateline: SHANGHAI BodySHANGHAI (AP) -Wu Yi was supposed to die. At age 26, his cancer was spreading.His doctor gave him five years to live and a prescription for OxyContin.Six years later, he was still alive. And still taking OxyContin. Wu said his doctor told him that OxyContin is not addictive, but when Wu tried to stop, he couldn't."This drug is addictive," Wu said. "One hundred percent addictive."A thousand miles (1,600 km) away, in the ancient trading city of Xi'an, Yin Hao shoved eight pills of Tylox, a combination painkiller that contains the opioid oxycodone, in his mouth. Yin had started taking Tylox after getting injured in a fight six years earlier."Do you know how f------ much I don't want to take drugs?" he said. "My mouth says don't take it, but my body is more honest and figures out a way to get it."Both Wu and Yin fell into opioid abuse the same way many Americans did, through a doctor's prescription. But officially, in China, they don't exist.Addicts like Wu and Yin struggle in the shadows of a system that offers few treatment options and fails to count them in official statistics on drug abuse, the Associated Press found, making it difficult to assess abuse risks as China's consumption of opioid painkillers rises. In a society where shame about drug addiction is strong, many believe that strict controls on painkiller use will protect China from a U.S.-style addiction outbreak.______EDITOR'S NOTE: The Associated Press, supported by a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, is investigating the global spread of opioids and its consequences.______As the backlash against opioid painkillers drove down U.S. consumption, pharmaceutical companies began chasing profits in places like China, Australia and Europe using the same controversial sales tactics they did in North America. In 2017, more than half the doses of five major opioid painkillers went to countries other than the U.S. and Canada, the first time that has happened since at least 2000, data from the International Narcotics Control Board shows.Chinese officials have blamed out-of-control demand and poor oversight for the U.S. opioid epidemic, discounting the role of Chinese supply. Meanwhile, painkiller addicts in China remain largely invisible and, despite strict regulations, can turn to online black markets for opioids and other prescription drugs. The AP found previously unreported trafficking of OxyContin and Tylox on e-commerce and social media platforms run by China's largest technology companies.Only 11,132 cases of medical drug abuse were reported in China in 2016, according to the most recent publicly available national drug abuse surveillance report. But reporting is voluntary and drawn from a small sample of institutions including law enforcement agencies, drug rehabilitation centers and some hospitals.The China Food and Drug Administration said in the 2016 report that it was trying to do better but for the time being "the nature of medical drug abuse in the population cannot be confirmed."Hao Wei, president of the Chinese Association of Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment, said he believes abuse of prescription opioids is limited in China, but added that official data largely overlooks prescription drug abuse."What is recorded is the tip of the iceberg," he said.China's National Medical Products Administration and the National Narcotics Control Commission did not respond to requests for comment.A VISIT FROM THE GOD OF DEATHWu was diagnosed with lymphoma in October 2013.Cancer transformed Wu from a baby-faced boy to a sallow wraith immobilized on a gurney. Doctors cut chemotherapy short after he developed an infection, he said, and his existence narrowed to a single, searing reality: Pain.For six months, Wu lay in bed. Strange bulges, filled with pink fluid, appeared on his legs. It felt like his bones were swelling until they were ready to burst."At that time, I wanted to commit suicide because it was too painful," he said. "But I wasn't able to, because my leg joints and shoulder joints didn't work."Wu said a doctor at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou gave him his first prescription for OxyContin in 2014, telling him he could take as much as he wanted.As a late-stage cancer patient, Wu was exactly the kind of person OxyContin was meant to help. And the pills brought him relief. But even as the U.S. death toll from opioid overdoses approached 400,000, no one in China warned Wu about addiction risks, he said, not his doctor or the nurses or the drug company sales representative who visited him at his bedside.The sales rep told AP she worked for Mundipharma, a Chinese company that is owned by the Sackler family, which also owns Purdue Pharma, the American company whose sales of OxyContin allegedly helped drive the U.S. opioid crisis. She told AP she has left Mundipharma but confirmed she used to visit some patients in the hospital. She refused to discuss further details. Three other former Mundipharma employees also told AP they regularly visited patients in the hospital, sometimes disguising themselves as doctors.A doctor from Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center told AP that sales reps are not allowed to visit patients. He said he warns patients about OxyContin's abuse risks but acknowledged not all doctors do. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk with foreign media.In a statement to AP, Mundipharma denied that sales staff visit patients and said it has checks and balances in place to "ensure strict compliance with medical protocols, laws and regulations."Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center did not respond to requests for comment.THE PICKAXEYin Hao, who also goes by Yin Qiang, struggled to remember life before pain pills. He thought back to when was 21 years old, strong and wiry, working at a nightclub. He had knock-off Burberry sheets, a mortgage in his name, and a girl he planned to marry.Then one night in 2013, he and his friends got into a fight with some older, richer guys, and someone drove a pickaxe into his waist.The hospital sent him home with four boxes of Tylox, a combination of acetaminophen and oxycodone, the active ingredient in OxyContin. Tylox is manufactured by SpecGx, a subsidiary of Mallinckrodt, which has faced lawsuits in the U.S. accusing it of helping stoke the opioid abuse crisis.Mallickrodt has denied the allegations.Yin said his doctor didn't tell him the medicine could be addictive. Within six months, he was taking 30 pills a day.Yin needed more and more pills to function. He opened dozens of accounts with online pharmacies to buy Tylox. Many didn't require a prescription. Once he wrote a three-character Chinese profanity on a piece of paper and uploaded a photo of that instead of a prescription. The pills came anyway, he said. He figured pharmacies wanted the sale almost as much as he wanted the drugs. His excessive consumption didn't trigger any alarms.Yin lost 60 pounds. He wondered if his kidneys would fail and was convinced Tylox had changed the color of his eyes. "My nerves are a mess, my bones are misplaced and I have become lazy, irritable, extreme," he said. "Experts say that if you take this medicine because of pain, it's not addictive. This is rubbish."JUST CHEW ITIn early 2016, a doctor told Wu the cancer had come back. He signed an organ donation form, and posted it on social media with a message: "Although I don't know when the journey of life will end, when that moment comes, I will leave behind a bunch of flowers, roses that blossom from my body."The proximity of death clarified Wu's ambition. He had dropped out of school at fifteen and hustled to start a catering business, which collapsed when he got sick.Now, Wu dreamed of leaving his parents' home in Yangjiang, a coastal city in southern Guangdong province, and moving to Shenzhen, China's dazzling southern boom town, to make music."If people don't let me make music, I will die with everlasting regret, he said."Wu taught himself composition and piano from videos posted online at Bilibili, a video-sharing platform.By 2018, Wu's cancer was in remission and he could walk with a crutch. The pain was under control, but he kept taking OxyContin. "Once you take that drug, I've said it, it's just like going home," he said. "There's a sense of belonging and safety."But the longer Wu took the pills, the less effective they were, he said. Wu started taking OxyContin with a half bottle of strong Chinese liquor, which he had delivered secretly to his house.He also noticed the package insert for OxyContin says not to chew it, which releases the active ingredient, oxycodone, all at once rather than over time. Chewing the pills made them hit with more intensity. "As long as you try chewing it once, there's no way for you not to chew it the next time," he said.MORE TERRIBLE THAN GHOSTSYin had vowed dozens of times to quit Tylox. He tried ice baths, saunas, and Russian vodka. He took a fistful of an antipsychotic that made him feel like his heart had stopped. He went to hypnosis and consulted cheap doctors online.Yin said he'd gone to hospitals for help, but doctors around Panjin, the town in northeastern China where he lived with his grandparents, didn't seem to know what withdrawal was. Some told him to go to a psychiatric hospital; others prescribed more Tylox, he said.He moved to South Korea for a fresh start, but said he got deported after fighting with a policeman.Once he rented a hotel room in the northeastern city of Dalian, shackled his leg to the radiator and threw the key out the window, he said. He binged on horror movies and cigarettes to distract himself and spent a few sweaty, aching hours alone, writhing in a bed that felt like it was made of fire. Then he broke the lock on his shackles, ran to a pharmacy and bought more Tylox.On March 6, Yin woke up at 6 a.m. determined to go cold turkey. It hurt to chew. He soaked biscuits in water and gummed them; a little while later, they were diarrhea."If I fail and go back to taking the medicine, I will fall apart," he said on his sixth day of sobriety.Yin said he hoped his story would be a warning to others. If he could make a single vulnerable person understand the consequences of taking this drug, it would be one thing in his life he didn't regret."I used to be afraid of ghosts, but now I think this is more terrible than ghosts," he said.BLACK MARKETSWu's family had poured out all their meager fortune to pay his medical bills. He said health insurance had covered roughly 30 to 60 percent of the cost, depending on where he got treatment. To pay the rest, the family sold their house in August 2014. His parents, who planted orange trees before he got sick, picked up short-term jobs, like cleaning restaurants.As 2018 rolled into 2019, Wu was still spending 1,500 yuan ($215) a month on OxyContin. His parents told him he was poisoning himself and started locking up his pills.In April, he again swore to his family he would stop. Instead, he secretly spent his last 2,000 yuan on OxyContin.When he went to the hospital to pick up his pills, he signed consent form that instructed him not to give the medicine to anyone else, but did not warn about the risk addiction or abuse, a copy of the signed form shows.Wu trolled internet forums for cheaper, second-hand OxyContin. He joined an online community of opioid dealers and abusers, and grieving family members eager to get rid of left-over pain medicine.Wu left his contact information in a thread about OxyContin on Tianya, an internet forum. He said someone offered him OxyContin left over after a family member died, but he decided to stay focused on surviving on four pills a day, down from six.In the U.S., online sales fueled the spread of opioid abuse. Major tech platforms, including Facebook and Twitter, have struggled to purge themselves of illicit listings.China has some of the strictest regulation of opioids in the world, which many believe will prevent a U.S.-style addiction outbreak. But AP found illicit trafficking of opioids on the open internet in China as well.In a brief survey, AP identified thirteen active vendors selling OxyContin and Tylox on Tencent's popular WeChat and QQ platforms, Alibaba's second-hand marketplace Xianyu, Baidu's Tieba forum, as well as Sina Corp.'s Weibo microblogging site and Zhuan Zhuan, another second-hand marketplace. Vendors often used one platform to find customers and another to execute sales. In addition, Tianya had dozens of posts from people selling or seeking OxyContin over the past few years.The AP did not make any purchases and could not confirm the authenticity of the pills."Mundipharma China has no knowledge of the diversion of its products on e-commerce and social media platforms," the company said in a statement to AP.Mallinckrodt's specialty generics subsidiary SpecGx sells its pain pills to a Chinese importer. In a statement, the company said it "has no manufacturing, distribution, sales force or in-country presence in China."Alibaba's Xianyu, known as Idle Fish in English, said it removed listings that violated marketplace policies after AP pointed out illicit opioid sales. The company said it prohibits "illegal behavior by third-party sellers on the platform." Sina Corp., which runs Weibo, said that after finding violations, it ran a campaign in March to clean-up illicit content about medicines and medical equipment. Xianyu, Tencent, Baidu and Sina Corp. all said they actively monitor their platforms and encourage users to proactively report illicit activity.Tianya and 58.com, which runs Zhuan Zhuan, didn't respond to requests for comment.IT'S GOOD I DIDN'T DIEOn April 28, Wu ran out of money and stopped taking OxyContin. The fact that he was alive the year after he was supposed to be dead gave him hope. "I'm still young," Wu said. "I have a lot of things to do."Four days later, he told a doctor at Yangchun People's Hospital he couldn't stop taking OxyContin and hadn't slept in days. He left with a prescription for benzodiazepine sleeping pills and a warning not to take more than three at a time. He took 15.The next day, he went back for more, but the doctor didn't want to give him more than day's supply. Wu lay on the hospital floor and refused to budge."I am suffering so much," he called out. "Why do you treat me like this?'"Wu said he managed to get more sleeping pills that week by visiting different doctors. He'd take 20 or more at a time. The pills stunned him, he said, but didn't put him to sleep. At night, he'd just fall down, unconscious."It's good I didn't die," he said.Doctors at Yangchun People's Hospital eventually cut him off and told him to go to a mental hospital, he said.Yangchun People's Hospital did not respond to requests for comment.On May 29, Wu got his brain scanned at the Yangchun Minfu Psychiatric Hospital, medical records show. Doctors there first told Wu he was suffering from schizophrenia, then changed their diagnosis to depression, he said.Wu didn't believe he was mentally ill. He said he told doctors he was going through opioid withdrawal. He said he was given an anti-depressant and an anti-psychotic.A man who picked up the phone at Yangchun Minfu Psychiatric Hospital said the facility has no addiction treatment program and had never dealt with prescription pill abuse. He refused to give his name and hung up the phone.Wu's body began to swell. Terrified his cancer was back, he checked into the oncology ward of Yangchun People's Hospital on June 15. A blood test came back clean, he said. His cancer was still in remission.By the end of June, the worst of the withdrawal symptoms were gone.THE WORLD WITHOUT HIM IS AN ABYSSDespite the officially low numbers of pill addicts, the Chinese government was concerned enough about painkiller abuse that in September it pulled combination opioid painkillers, including Tylox, from most pharmacies.On September 18, Yin Hao posted an elegy to Tylox on WeChat. The world without Tylox, he wrote, "is an abyss."He said he was taking more than 100 Tylox pills a day, which added up to over 500 mg of oxycodone and 32,500 mg of acetaminophen. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control says a dose of just 33 mg of oxycodone a day doubles the risk of overdose. Taking more than 4,000 mg of acetaminophen daily can result in severe liver damage and death.Before the new regulations took effect, it was easy to get Tylox from pharmacies in certain cities and online without a prescription. Earlier this year, AP identified five pharmacies selling Tylox without a prescription. In addition, three of six online pharmacies that said they had Tylox in stock sold it without a prescription, AP found.A month after the new rules took effect, Yin had just two pills left. He thought about committing a crime or using harder drugs so the police would force him into a mandatory detox center.By November Yin's pill box was full again. He claimed he was able to buy Tylox illegally from some online pharmacies. He said he lied to doctors at hospitals to get more pills, though not everyone fell for it.Yin said he got Tylox sales agents to sell him bulk pills directly and bribed a courier not to examine his packages. He declined to share their names with AP, and it was impossible to verify his claim.Sometimes Yin worried police were following him. He didn't want to go to prison, he said. He wanted to go to rehab.If he could unspool his life and wind it up again, Yin said the second time round he would take pain instead of Tylox.WU'S DREAMAt 9:40 a.m. on September 23, Wu took a bus to Shenzhen and found a cheap third-floor room for rent."My dream is making music," Wu said in an interview earlier this month. "But in the two months since I came to Shenzhen, I have found the reality and dream are pretty different. Reality is crueler."Wu's face and hands seemed too big for his narrow hips. He was trying to get his body in better shape to prepare for hip replacement surgery, which he hopes to have next year. He flashed a smile and said he'd earn enough from singing to pay for the operation, but so far he's barely making rent.Around 1 a.m. early one Friday, Wu strapped a bottle of water onto the wheeled cart he uses to haul his amplifier around, grabbed his crutch and thumped down the stairs. He yanked his gear into the dark December chill and headed over to a strip of restaurants to see if he could sell any songs.At 1:15 a.m. it started to rain. Bad luck. There was hardly anyone around. A friendly restaurant manager let him sit under a bright blue awning until the rain stopped.Wu picked up his crutch and hauled his amplifier down a block and up a block and down a block again, peering into each small restaurant for stragglers who might pay him 30 yuan ($4) to sing.At 2:45 a.m., people at a table laden with empty beers took Wu's menu of songs, mostly Cantonese hits from the Eighties and Nineties, and after long deliberation, picked one. Wu sat in the cold near a hunk of glistening meat on display and waited for the people at the table to go to the bathroom and buy more cigarettes.Finally, Wu began to sing, a song called, "My Good Brothers.""Thank you," he said when he was done.No one clapped.--Associated Press researcher Chen Si contributed to this report.

US and China near deal that would suspend planned tariffsAssociated Press InternationalDecember 13, 2019 Friday 1:45 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 745 wordsByline: By PAUL WISEMAN, AP Economics WriterDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - The Trump administration and China are close to finalizing a modest trade agreement that would suspend tariffs that are set to kick in Sunday, de-escalating their 17-month trade war.A "deal is close,'' said Myron Brilliant, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's head of international affairs, who has been briefed by both sides.Brilliant said the administration has agreed to suspend Trump's plans to impose tariffs on $160 billion in Chinese imports Sunday and to reduce existing tariffs, though it wasn't clear by how much.In return, Beijing would buy more U.S. farm products, increase Americans companies' access to the Chinese market and tighten protection for intellectual property rights.The deal awaits final approval from President Donald Trump.Trump took to Twitter early Thursday to declare: "Getting VERY close to a BIG DEAL with China. They want it, and so do we!"The president's comments triggered a daylong rally on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 220 points, or 0.8%.Thursday evening, a senior administration official said a policy announcement regarding China would take place on Friday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning.Earlier Thursday, a spokesman for China's Ministry of Commerce, Gao Feng, had told reporters that "the economic and trade teams of both sides have maintained close communication." He offered no additional details.Beijing had threatened to retaliate if Trump proceeded with plans to raise tariffs on $160 billion of Chinese imports Sunday.The two sides are negotiating a so-called Phase 1 agreement as part of the effort to resolve their sprawling trade dispute. Still, the truce leaves unsettled the toughest and most complex issues that have divided the two sides.Three Democratic senators - Minority Leader Charles Schumer of New York, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Sherrod Brown of Ohio - sent a letter to the White House on Thursday, urging Trump to "stand firm'' in the negotiations with China. They called on the president to hold out for "commitments from the Chinese government to enact substantive, enforceable and permanent structural reform.''The administration accuses Beijing of cheating in its drive to achieve global supremacy in such advanced technologies as driver-less cars and artificial intelligence. The administration alleges - and independent analysts generally agree - that China steals technology, forces foreign companies to hand over trade secrets, unfairly subsidizes its own firms and throws up bureaucratic hurdles for foreign rivals.Beijing rejects the accusations and contends that Washington is simply trying to suppress a rising competitor in international trade.Since July 2018, the Trump administration has imposed import taxes on $360 billion in Chinese products. Beijing has retaliated by taxing $120 billion in U.S. exports, including soybeans and other farm products that are vital to many of Trump's supporters in rural America.On Sunday, the administration was set to start taxing an additional $160 billion in Chinese imports, a move that would extend the sanctions to just about everything China ships to the United States.Repeated rounds of negotiations had failed to achieve even a preliminary agreement. The prolonged uncertainty over Trump's trade policies has curtailed U.S. business investment and likely held back economic growth. Many corporations have slowed or suspended investment plans until they know when, how or even whether the trade standoff will end.A far-reaching agreement on China's technology policies will likely prove difficult. It would require Beijing to scale back its drive to become a global powerhouse in industrial high technology, something it sees as a path to prosperity and international influence.Efforts to acquire foreign technology are a theme that runs through Chinese law and government. Security researchers have asserted that Beijing operates a network of research institutes and business parks to turn stolen foreign technology into commercial products.The Trump administration has been seeking a way to enforce any significant trade agreement with China, reflecting its contention that Beijing has violated past promises. One way to do is to retain some tariffs as leverage."They're two such different economies that don't trust each other,'' said Jessica Wasserman, a trade lawyer at Greenspoon Marder LLP.__Associated Press writer Darlene Superville contributed to this report.Load-Date: December 14, 2019End of Document

Net loss attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders decreased 35%, to RMB126.7 million (US$17.7 million), from RMB193.9 million in the comparable period of 2018.Third Quarter 2019 Financial ResultsREVENUES: Net revenues decreased 25%, to RMB60.1 million (US$8.4 million), from RMB80.5 million in the comparable period of 2018.Enterprise revenues decreased 20%, to RMB54.5 million (US$7.6 million), from RMB67.8 million in the comparable period of 2018, primarily due to the Company's ongoing strategic restructuring to target its Search Engine Marketing (SEM) business toward higher return opportunities and to a slowdown in the Chinese economy.E-Government and other revenues decreased 56%, to RMB6.0 million (US$0.8 million), from RMB13.7 million in the comparable period of 2018, primarily due to reduced budgeted spending by the Chinese government as a result of government reorganization activities that began in 2018.COST OF REVENUES: Cost of revenues decreased 10%, to RMB21.3 million (US$3.0 million), compared with RMB23.6 million in the comparable period of 2018.GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS MARGIN: Gross profit decreased 32%, to RMB38.8 million (US$5.4 million), from RMB56.8 million in the comparable period of 2018. Gross margin decreased to 64.5% from 70.6%, reflecting the shift in revenue mix and the timelag between the Company's revenue restructuring. The Company believes its gross profit will begin to improve in 2020 as its sales mix continues to evolve with its IIoT solutions delivering a greater contribution.OPERATING EXPENSES: Total operating expenses declined 42%, to RMB148.4million (US$20.8 million), from RMB254.4 million in the comparable period of 2018. Sales and marketing expenses declined 27%, to RMB33.1 million (US$4.6 million), from RMB45.6 million in the comparable period of 2018. The decrease reflected a RMB6.6 million decrease in marketing and promotion expenses and a RMB4.2 million decrease in staff costs. Research and development expenses declined 53%, to RMB74.5 million (US$10.4 million), from RMB158.3 million in the comparable period of 2018. The decrease primarily reflected the Company moving past the peak of front-end investment into its industrial AI and IIoT platforms. General and administrative expenses declined 19%, to RMB40.9 million (US$5.7 million), from RMB50.5 million in the comparable period of 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a RMB8.3 million decrease in professional services fees.LOSS FROM OPERATIONS: Loss from operations was RMB109.6 million (US$15.3 million), compared with RMB197.5 million in the comparable period of 2018.NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GRIDSUM'S ORDINARY SHAREHOLDERS: Net loss attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders was RMB126.7 million (US$17.7 million), compared with RMB193.9 million in the comparable period of 2018.NON-GAAP NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GRIDSUM'S ORDINARY SHAREHOLDERS: Non-GAAP net loss attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders, which is defined as net loss attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders before share-based compensation expenses, was RMB115.9 million (US$16.2million), compared with RMB182.8 million in the comparable period of 2018.EBITDA: Loss before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization was RMB97.1 million (US$13.6 million), compared with RMB199.6 million in the comparable period of 2018.ADJUSTED EBITDA: Adjusted loss before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization, which excludes share-based compensation expenses, was RMB86.3 million (US$12.1 million), compared with RMB188.5 million in the comparable period of 2018.NET LOSS PER ADS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GRIDSUM'S ORDINARY SHAREHOLDERS: Net loss per ADS attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders was RMB3.68 (US$0.51), compared with RMB6.29 in the comparable period of 2018.NON-GAAP NET LOSS PER ADS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GRIDSUM'S ORDINARY SHAREHOLDERS: Non-GAAP net loss per ADS attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders was RMB3.36 (US$0.47), compared with RMB5.93 in the comparable period of 2018.Each ADS represents one Class B ordinary share. For purposes of determining net loss per ADS attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders, the weighted average number of ordinary shares for the third quarter of 2019 was 34,470,418. As of September 30, 2019, the total number of ordinary shares outstanding was 34,540,511.Balance SheetAs of September 30, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of RMB42.7 million (US$6.0 million), and restricted cash of RMB0.06 million (US$0.008 million).Third Quarter 2019 ReviewThe Company's performance in the third quarter of 2019 continued to reflect the Company'sefforts and challenges around its strategic restructuring to achieve a more optimal revenue and cost structure under operating conditions also characterized by cashflow and liquidity pressures. Momentum also continued to be impacted by the slowdown in the Chinese economy.Recent DevelopmentsOn October 9, 2019, the Company announced that the special committee (the "Special Committee") of the Company's board of directors (the "Board") retained Houlihan Lokey (China) Limited as its financial advisor in connection with its review and evaluation of the preliminary non-binding proposal received by the Board on July 15, 2019 (the "Proposal") from Guosheng Qi, Guofa Yu, their respective affiliated entities, and Beta Dynamic Limited, an affiliate of Hammer Capital Private Investments Limited.At this time, no decisions have been made by the Special Committee with respect to the Company's response to the Proposal or any other alternative transaction. The Special Committee has not set a definitive timetable for the completion of its evaluation of the Proposal or any other alternative transaction, and does not currently intend to announce developments unless and in the event a definitive agreement has been reached. There can be no assurance that any definitive offer will be made, that any agreement will be executed or that the transactions contemplated by the Proposal or any other alternative transaction will be approved or consummated.On May 5, 2018, the Company issued to FutureX Innovation SPC ("FutureX") a convertible note in the principal amount of US$40,000,000 due November 5, 2019 (the "Note").The Company has not yet repaid the Note.On December 9, 2019, FutureXserved a statutory demand on the Company, under which FutureX (i) claims that the Company owes, as of December 9, 2019, a total amount of US$41,913,498 under the Note (the "Debt"), (ii) demands that the Company pay the Debt or secure or compound for it to FutureX's satisfaction, and (iii) states that if payment of the Debt is not made within 21 days of the date when the statutory demand was served on the Company, the Company will be deemed to be insolvent and a winding up petition may be presented against the Company in accordance with applicable Cayman laws.The Company is engaged in discussions to resolve its obligations under the Note but there can be no assurance that any such resolution can be reached on a timely basis, or at all. In the event the Company is deemed insolvent there can be no assurance that the Company's ADRs will remain listed for trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market.Exchange RateThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. Dollars ("US$") at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise stated, all translations from RMB to US$ were made at the rate of RMB7.1477 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate in effect on September 30, 2019 in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board. The Company makes no representation that the RMB or US$ amounts referred could be converted into US$ or RMB, as the case may be, at any particular rate or at all.Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn evaluating the Company's business, the Company considers and uses the following non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental measures to review and assess the Company's operating performance: non-GAAP net loss attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders, non-GAAP net loss per share attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders, non-GAAP net loss per ADS attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP net loss attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders is net loss attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders before share-based compensation, non-GAAP net loss per share attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders is the per share equivalent and non-GAAP net loss per ADS attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders is the per ADS equivalent, EBITDA is net loss before interest income and expenses, income tax expenses and depreciation expenses, and adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA before share-based compensation.The Company presents these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by the Company's management to evaluate the Company's operating performance and formulate the Company's business plans. These non-GAAP financial measures enable the Company's management to assess the Company's operating results without considering the impact of non-cash charges, including depreciation expenses and share-based compensation, and without considering the impact of non-operating items such as interest income and expenses and income tax expenses. The Company also believes that the use of these non-GAAP measures facilitates investors' assessment of the Company's operating performance.These non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the Company's operations. Interest income and expenses, income tax expenses, depreciation expenses and share-based compensation have been and may continue to be incurred in the Company's business and are not reflected in the presentation of adjusted EBITDA. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, including Gridsum's peer companies, so their utility for comparison purposes may be limited.The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the Company's non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. Investors are encouraged to review the Company's financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their closest U.S. GAAP financial measures appears at the end of this release.About GridsumGridsum Holding Inc.

US regulators bar govt telecom funds for Huawei, ZTEAssociated Press InternationalNovember 23, 2019 Saturday 2:07 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 543 wordsByline: By TALI ARBEL, AP Technology WriterBodyU.S. communications regulators have cut off government funding for equipment from two Chinese companies, citing security threats.The Federal Communications Commission also proposed requiring companies that get government subsidies to rip out any equipment from Huawei and ZTE that they already have in place.It's the latest action by the U.S. government against Chinese tech and telecom companies.The FCC voted unanimously Friday to bar U.S. telecommunications providers from using government subsidies to buy equipment from Huawei or ZTE. The FCC's order mostly affects small, rural companies, as larger U.S. carriers do not use equipment from those Chinese companies.In a statement Saturday, Huawei urged the FCC to reconsider what it called a "profoundly mistaken" and "unlawful order."It said the decision was "based on selective information, innuendo, and mistaken assumptions" and that "these unwarranted actions will have profound negative effects on connectivity for Americans in rural and underserved areas across the United States."As for replacing existing equipment, the FCC is asking for comment on how to help rural telecoms financially. Bills in Congress have proposed setting $700 million to $1 billion aside.A trade group for small rural wireless carriers has said that it would cost up to $1 billion for its dozen companies to replace their Huawei and ZTE equipment. It says that Huawei has 40 customers in the U.S. (Huawei is also a member of the trade group, the Rural Wireless Association.)The group said Friday that it was "cautiously optimistic" that the FCC's approach would let its companies keep providing services to customers and give them funding to replace any banned equipment.The Huawei statement said the lack of funding would hurt rural and disadvantaged communities."Without access to those solutions, these carriers will lose their ability to provide reliable and high-speed telecommunications and internet services," it said. "Rural schools, hospitals, and libraries will feel the effects. And, due to reduced competition in the market for telecommunications equipment, particularly in cutting-edge 5G networks, all Americans will pay higher prices for these critical services."Huawei reiterated its desire to work with the FCC to lay to rest concerns over national security and ensure "best practices" are used in U.S. telecommunications systems.Huawei is the world's biggest supplier of telecom gear as well as a major cellphone manufacturer. The U.S. government has said that Huawei poses an espionage threat, but has presented no evidence of its equipment being used for spying by the Chinese government. The U.S. has been pressuring allies to ban Huawei from their networks and has restricted exports of U.S. technology to Huawei, though numerous loopholes have been exploited.ZTE did not respond to requests for comment Friday. ZTE has also denied that China uses its products for spying.A congressional report in 2012 labeled both Chinese companies as security risks.Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, said the FCC's move Friday was a good one, but took too long and did not go far enough. She said there needs to be a "coordinated national plan" for securing next-generation cellular networks, known as 5G.Load-Date: November 23, 2019End of Document

China's Moves to Stop Buying U.S. Tech Aren't Going Away - But They Have LimitsRealMoneyDecember 9, 2019 Monday 3:16 PM EDTCopyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 753 wordsByline: Eric JhonsaHighlight: Beijing is intent on reducing its dependence on American hardware, software and chips. But reducing it and eliminating are two very different things.BodyNot too surprisingly, China is responding to U.S. restrictions on Huawei and ZTE with efforts to ban or curb the use of various American tech suppliers.And while obtaining alternatives to U.S. tech will in many cases prove easier said than done, it's pretty clear at this point that Beijing's efforts will have meaningful long-term consequences.The latest evidence of this was provided on Monday morning, when The Financial Times reported that Chinese government agencies and public institutions  to stop using foreign PCs and software (much of it American) by 2022. Organizations are expected to remove 30% of the foreign PCs and software that they currently have in 2020, 50% in 2021 and the final 20% in 2022.Needless to say, this isn't good news for companies such as HP Inc.  , Dell Technologies  , Microsoft  and Oracle  , and not only because of the direct impact of Beijing's order. Indirectly, the order sends a clear message to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and privately-owned Chinese firms that Beijing would prefer that they not use American hardware and software.From the looks of things, a lot of these companies have already gotten this message loud and clear. Just ask Cisco Systems  . In August, Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins said his company, which has seen its Chinese sales fall sharply this year, is being "  " on some Chinese enterprise deals.One important qualifier here: Many U.S. IT giants don't get a large portion of their sales from China. Cisco, for example, now gets less than 3% of its revenue from the Middle Kingdom, and while Microsoft doesn't break out its Chinese sales, piracy is known to have long had a major impact on them. Last year,  that while 90% of Chinese firms are using Windows, only 1% are paying for it.Nonetheless, since this is the world's second-largest economy that we're talking about, many billions of dollars worth of hardware and software sales are still in the crosshairs.U.S. chip companies are also starting to feel some effects from China's attempts to reduce its reliance on American tech products. Since the Trump Administration banned Huawei's U.S. chip, component and software suppliers from doing business with it in May (the ban has since been partly lifted), Huawei, now the world's No. 2 smartphone supplier by volume, has  of non-U.S. chips within high-volume phones.Teardowns of a pair of recently-launched, high-end, Huawei phones --  and the  -- by research firm TechInsights reveal the extensive use of chips from Huawei's HiSilicon unit, including HiSilicon-developed modems, app processors, power management chips, RF chips and Wi-Fi/Bluetooth combo chips. Huawei also seems eager to use chips from European suppliers such as STMicroelectronics  and NXP Semiconductors  .However, the teardowns also show that U.S. chip suppliers still have a meaningful presence, even if it's less than what existed for prior Huawei phones. Audio amplifiers from Cirrus Logic  , interface chips from Texas Instruments  and RF chips and modules from Skyworks  , Qorvo  and Qualcomm  can still be spotted.The teardowns shine a light on how hard it is to fully end the use of American-designed chips within a product as complex and silicon-packed as a smartphone. Fully replacing U.S. RF chip suppliers could be especially tough, given the combination of design and manufacturing expertise needed to be a major player in this space.Outside of smartphones, there are also a lot of fields where China is likely to remain a big buyer of American-designed silicon. Just to give one example, the new Chinese PCs set to go inside of government offices will almost certainly rely on Intel  and AMD  CPUs, as will (in spite of some attempts to  ) a very large portion of Chinese server deployments in the coming years.And when it comes to replacing American tech products in general, there will probably be some situations where a Chinese firm chooses not to due to factors such as performance and software compatibility, even if it could do so in theory. For example, if Huawei or another Chinese smartphone OEM concludes that replacing RF chips from American suppliers would hurt a phone's battery life and 5G upload/download speeds, it might choose not to do so.With all that said, U.S. and Chinese companies are clearly in uncharted territory here, as a lot of business relationships that were taken for granted for many years are (if not unraveling) getting a lot more complicated. Even if some kind of trade deal is reached, there's likely to be more fallout in 2020.Load-Date: December 10, 2019End of Document

SHOULD AMERICA FEAR THE CHINESE H-20 STEALTH BOMBER?States News ServiceDecember 7, 2019 SaturdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1483 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for the National Interest (former the Nixon Center):Key point: The United States is beginning to lose its footing in East Asia.In October 2018, Chinese media announced that the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) would publicly unveil its new H-20 stealth bomber during a parade celebrating the air arm's seventieth anniversary in 2019.Prior news of the H-20's development had been teased using techniques pioneered by viral marketing campaigns for Hollywood movies. For example, the Xi'an Aviation Industrial Corporation released a promotional video in May 2018 pointedly imitating Northrop Grumman's own Superbowl ad for the B-21 stealth bomber, portraying a shrouded flying wing bomber in its final seconds. Later, the silhouette of a possible new bomber appeared at a PLAAF gala. This comes only two years after PLAAF Gen. Ma Xiaotian formally revealed the Hong-20's existence.If the H-20 does have the range and passable stealth characteristics attributed to it, it could alter the strategic calculus between the United States and China by exposing U.S. bases and fleets across the Pacific to surprise air attacks.Only three countries have both the imperative and the resources to develop huge strategic bombers that can strike targets across the globe: the United States, Russia and China. Strategic bombers make sense for China because Beijing perceives dominance of the western half of the Pacific Ocean as essential for its security due to its history of maritime invasion, and the challenge posed by the United States in particular. The two superpowers are separated by five to six thousand miles of oceanand the United States has spent the last century developing a network of island territories such as Guam, foreign military bases in East Asia and super-carriers with which it can project air and sea power across that span.Xi'an Aviation, the H-20's manufacturer, also builds China's H-6 strategic jet bombers, a knockoff the 1950s-era Soviet Tu-16 Badger which has recently been upgraded with modern avionics, aerial refueling capability and cruise missiles in the later H-6K and H-6J models. Beijing could easily have produced a successor in a similar vein, basically a giant four-engine airliner-sized cargo plane loaded with fuel and long-range missiles that's never intended to get close enough for adversaries to shoot back.Alternately, analyst Andreas Rupprecht reported that China considered developing a late-Cold War style supersonic bomber akin to the U.S. B-1 or Russian Tu-160 called the JH-XX. This would have lugged huge bombloads at high speed and low altitude, while exhibiting partial stealth characteristics for a marginal improvement in survivability. However, such an approach was already considered excessively vulnerable to modern fighters and air defense by the late twentieth century. A Chinese magazine cover sported a concept image of the JH-XX in 2013, but the project appears to have been set aside for now.Instead, in the PLAAF elected to pursue a more ambitious approach: a slower but far stealthier flying wing like the U.S. B-2 and forthcoming B-21 Raider. A particular advantage of large flying wings is they are less susceptible to detection by low-bandwidth radar, such as those on the Navy's E-2 Hawkeye radar planes, which are effective at detecting the approach of smaller stealth fighters.While China's development of stealth aircraft technology in the J-20 and J-31 stealth fighter was an obvious prerequisite for the H-20 project, so apparently was Xi'an's development of the hulking Y-20 'Chubby Girl' cargo plane, which established the company's capability to build large, long-range aircraft using modern computer-aided design and manufacturing techniquesprecision technology essential for mass producing the exterior surfaces of stealth aircraft.According to a study by Rick Joe at The Diplomat, Chinese publications began speculating about the H-20 in the early 2010s. Postulated characteristics include four non-afterburning WS-10A Taihang turbofans sunk into the top of the wing surface with S-shaped saw-toothed inlets for stealth. It's worth noting that the WS-10 has been plagued by major problems, but that hasn't stopped China from manufacturing fighters using WS-10s, with predictably troubled results.The new strategic bomber is expected to have a maximum un-refueled combat radius exceeding 5,000 miles and payload between the H-6's ten tons and the B-2's twenty-three tons. This is because the H-20 is reportedly designed to strike targets beyond the "second island ring" (which includes U.S. bases in Japan, Guam, the Philippines, etc.) from bases on mainland China. The third island chain extends to Hawaii and coastal Australia.In a U.S.-China conflict, the best method for neutralizing U.S. air power would be to destroy it on the ground (or carrier deck), especially in the opening hours of a war. While ballistic missiles and H-6 bombers can already contribute to this with long-range missiles, these are susceptible to detection and interception given adequate forewarning. A stealth bomber could approach much closer to carrier task forces and air bases before releasing its weapons, giving defenses too little time to react. An initial strike might in fact focus on air defense radars, "opening the breach" for a follow up wave of less stealthy attacks.The H-20 will also likely be capable of carrying nuclear weapons, finally giving China a full triad of nuclear-capable submarines, ballistic missiles and bombers. Though the H-6 was China's original nuclear bomber, these are no longer configured for nuclear strike, though that could change if air-launched nuclear-tipped cruise or ballistic missile are devised. Beijing is nervous that the United States' limited ballistic missile defense capabilities might eventually become adequate for countering China's small ICBM and SLBM arsenal. The addition of a stealth bomber would contribute to China's nuclear deterrence by adding a new, difficult-to-stop vector of nuclear attack that the U.S. defenses aren't designed to protect against.Some Chinese publications also argue that the H-20 will do double-duty as a networked reconnaissance and command and control platform similar to U.S. F-35 stealth fighters. This would make sense, as China has developed a diverse arsenal of long-range air-, ground- and sea-launched missiles, but doesn't necessarily have a robust reconnaissance network to form a kill-chain cueing these missiles to distant targets. Theoretically, an H-20 could rove ahead, spying the position of opposing sea-based assets using a low-probability-of-intercept AESA radar, and fuse that information to a firing platform hundreds or even thousands of miles away. The H-20 could also be used for electronic warfare or to deploy specialized directed energy.The crescendo of publicity surrounding the H-20 indicates the PLAAF believes the plane will soon be ready enough to show to the publicand international audiences. Once revealed, analysts will pour over the aircraft's geometry to estimate just how the stealthy it really is, looking for radar-reflective Achilles' heels such as exposed engine inlets and indiscrete tail stabilizers. However, external analysis cannot provide a full assessment, because the quality of the radar-absorbent materials applied to surfaces, and the finesse of the manufacturing (avoiding seams, protruding screws, etc.) has a major impact on radar cross-section.It is worth bearing in mind, however, that an H-20 seeking to slip through the gauntlet of long-range search radars scattered across the Pacific to launch CJ-10K cruise missiles with a range of over nine hundred miles would not require the same degree of stealth as an F-35 intended to penetrate more densely defended airspace and launch small diameter bombs with a range of 70 miles.Analysts forecast the H-20's first flight in the early 2020s, with production possibly beginning around 2025. If the H-20 is judged to be of credible design, the Pentagon in turn will have to factor the strategic implications of China's stealth capabilities, and will likely seek to field implement counter-stealth technologies which formerly have been mostly vaunted by Russia and China. The publicity which the often-secretive Chinese government is according the H-20 also indicates Beijing's hope the bomber will serve as a strategic deterrent to foreign adversarieseven before its first flight.Sebastien Roblin holds a master's degree in Conflict Resolution from Georgetown University and served as a university instructor for the Peace Corps in China.

Charges: Chinese surveillance goods illegally sold to USAssociated Press InternationalNovember 7, 2019 Thursday 9:20 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 453 wordsByline: By TOM HAYS, Associated PressDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) - A Long Island firm sold tens of millions of dollars in Chinese-made surveillance and other sensitive security equipment to customers, including the U.S. military to use on aircraft carriers, by falsely claiming the goods were manufactured in America, federal prosecutors said Thursday.The fraud that prosecutors allege by Aventura Technologies Inc. raised "a grave concern" over cyber security, U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue said.Though there was no allegation of breaches involving the Chinese government, emails and other evidence from the investigation showed "individuals in China were well aware of what was going on," Donoghue said.The equipment made in China and sold by Aventura "as purportedly U.S.-made has been installed on dozens of Army, Navy and Air Force bases, Department of Energy facilities and, among other places, on Navy aircraft carriers," prosecutors said in the criminal complaint. Of the $88 million Aventura made since 2010, $20 million came from federal government contracts promising it would provide only U.S.-made products, they said.Prosecutors accused the company of a cover-up involving systematically relabeling its merchandise to say it was made at its U.S. plant. It also circulated a photo that an Aventura executive, Jack Cabasso, showed the company's assembly line, but was actually an image of workers in a Chinese facility, the complaint said.Last year, Cabasso emailed an employee of a Chinese manufacturer stressing the need to take steps to make sure its products couldn't be traced, prosecutors said. He wrote that "the biggest problem" was that customers might notice the company's initials on circuit boards and asked them to conceal them, they said.The scheme began to unravel after the company sold 25 body cameras to the U.S. Air Force, security analysts discovered downloaded images including a logo of the Chinese Ministry of Public Security on the devices, the complaint said. A software analysis found indications that the camera's manufacturer in China "had been aware that the U.S. Air Force was the intended end user of the camera."Seven current and former Aventura employees, including Cabasso and other members of its top management, were charged with conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud. The government also froze bank accounts and seized a 70-foot yacht it said is owned by Cabasso and his wife.Phone messages seeking comment were left Thursday with Cabasso's attorney and at Aventura's headquarters in Commack, New York.A company website touts it as having "a reputation for being an innovative designer, developer and manufacturer of security hardware, software and peripheral products for government, military and enterprise since 1999."Load-Date: November 8, 2019End of Document

A TikTok beauty video with a hidden anti-China message has gone viralCNN WireNovember 28, 2019 Thursday 3:20 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1063 wordsDateline: HONG KONG/NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG/NEW YORK (CNN Business) --  The video starts with a teenager offering eyelash curling advice to her followers. But this is no ordinary beauty tip.Just seconds into Feroza Aziz's seemingly straightforward tutorial, the 17-year-old Afghan American woman tells the viewer to put down the lash curler and seamlessly transitions from eyelash curling to politics. "Use the phone that you're using right now to search up what's happening in China," she states matter of factly. She spends the rest of the 40-second clip --- which has racked up more than 1.5 million views on the wildly popular short video app TikTok --- criticizing the Chinese government and its detention centers, which hold mostly Muslim Uyghurs in the country's far western region of Xinjiang. Beijing has long insisted that the camps are voluntary "vocational training centers." However many Western nations, including the United States, have condemned them as mass detention centers designed to eradicate Uyghur culture and Islamic practices.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Tuesday there was an "overwhelming and growing body of evidence that the Chinese Communist Party is committing human rights violations and abuses against individuals in mass detention." He called for the immediate release of all those "arbitrarily detained" and for Beijing to end the "draconian policies that have terrorized its citizens in Xinjiang."China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang accused the United States of attempting to meddle in its affairs, and said there were no "ethnic, religious, human rights" issues in the region. "The measures that the Xinjiang government takes are about counter-terrorism and de-radicalization," Geng said at a briefing on Wednesday.In her video, Aziz rattles off a list of allegations --- "how they're getting concentration camps, throwing innocent Muslims in there, separating their families from each other" --- before launching into even more serious claims of abuse. Her video has even taken on a life outside of TikTok, attracting millions of views on other social platforms like Facebook and Twitter. 'Temporarily suspended'The episode has also evolved into a broader dispute between Aziz and TikTok, which she has accused of censoring her views.Earlier this week, Aziz told CNN Business that she was unable to access her account, and sent a reporter a screenshot of a TikTok login screen that said the account was "temporarily suspended" --- a sign she believed showed she was being discriminated against by the company, which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance.A TikTok spokesman on Wednesday denied that the company banned Aziz's video or her account, and pointed out that the video was still available on the app. CNN Business was able to find the video --- and her account --- on TikTok that day."TikTok does not moderate content due to political sensitivities," the company said in a statement.During US hours late Wednesday, though, TikTok acknowledged that Aziz had been effectively locked out of being able to access her account because of an earlier, unrelated ban. That ban prevented her from using an older account, and also affected a device Aziz used to access both her old and new accounts. TikTok said it is overriding the device ban.The company also apologized to Aziz for briefly removing the viral Xinjiang video from the service. The clip was offline for nearly an hour Wednesday morning in the United States because of what TikTok said was a "human moderation error." Aziz confirmed late Wednesday that she could again access her account, though still said she was suspicious of TikTok's explanation. "I believe TikTok took down the video because of its spread of awareness for Uyghurs in China, but realized that by doing this, then it would prove that they are trying to hide the truth," she told CNN Business.US censorship concernsTikTok has exploded in popularity and become one of the few Chinese-owned social media apps to gain traction in Western countries. But its connection to China has prompted some US lawmakers to voice concerns about whether TikTok censors content, and about whether the security of user data may be compromised.US Senators Chuck Schumer and Tom Cotton want the US intelligence community to assess the national security risks of TikTok and other Chinese-owned platforms, saying in a statement on October 24 that such apps could be used to spy on US citizens or become targets of foreign influence campaigns. TikTok has denied such allegations, saying last month that it has "never been asked by the Chinese government to remove any content and we would not do so if asked." Aziz's first ban from the service was completely unrelated to Xinjiang. The company said Wednesday that another account owned by Aziz had been banned because she "posted a video of Osama bin Laden, which is a violation of TikTok's ban on content that includes imagery related to terrorist organizations." When Aziz first spoke with CNN Business on Wednesday, she described that video as a joke that riffed on the discrimination she experienced as a young Muslim woman growing up in a white US community. That video, which CNN Business has seen and which Aziz confirmed as hers, includes a montage of men she says she likes now, one of whom is the infamous terrorist leader."I've been told to leave the country ... to go marry a terrorist, and people telling me that I was 'Bin Laden,'" Aziz said. She said she believed that account was banned because of other videos she posted that accused the news media of ignoring international crimes against Muslims.In its latest statement, TikTok said it recognized that that video "may have been intended as satire." But it added that its policies "on this front are currently strict."Asked about that response, Aziz told CNN Business that TikTok's response still did not satisfy her because they did not address her explanation in full. "That video should not have been the reason for my account to be suspended," she said. "TikTok is trying to cover up this whole mess."Aziz continues to use her social platforms to spread her message, and told CNN Business earlier this week that she was "shocked" her videos have gained so much attention."I will only speak louder about this issue. I will always speak louder."TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company. All rights reserved.Load-Date: November 28, 2019End of Document

FCC Commissioner Carr Issues Remarks at International Institute of Communications Telecommunications, Media ForumTargeted News ServiceDecember 10, 2019 Tuesday 11:47 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1968 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Federal Communications Commission issued the following remarks by Commissioner Brendan Carr at the International Institute of Communications Telecommunications and Media Forum:"I would like to thank the International Institute of Communications for inviting me to speak today. As I looked over the program--or, for our international attendees, that's "programme" with an extra "me" at the end--I was struck by the impressive list of speakers and panelists. I think that is a testament not only to the importance of the IIC's mission to provide a forum for balanced and open dialogue in global tech policy, but also to the moment in which we find ourselves."The growing5G revolution is a generational upgrade in communications that will fundamentally alter the way in which technology is integrated into our everyday lives. The march of technological improvement will continue to bring the citizens of the world closer together and grow our economies. It is therefore vital that the countries and institutions that we represent continue to work together to overcome our shared challenges and realize our shared goals."The panels this afternoon will address some very interesting and difficult issues, including data privacy and Artificial Intelligence. But to pull from a theme of some of my recent speeches, I want to be forward looking. Specifically, I want to look ahead to tomorrow afternoon's session on 5G infrastructure."As everyone here knows, 5G is a disruptive new service that promises 10 times more responsive networks, at 100 times current speeds, that can serve 1,000 times more devices. 5G isn't just an upgraded version of 4G. 5G's performance characteristics and how it is built blur the distinctions between wired and wireless industries. 5G will enable more choice as previously siloed industries compete, which we know will decrease prices and improve quality. And as more 5G networks come online, the already surging demand for data will explode."Our existing wireless networks cannot handle this coming volume of data. Nor can they perform at the level needed to power the technologies of the future. The fullest vision of IoT sees smart devices scattered throughout Smart Homes, in Smart Cities, and across Smart Ag. 4G networks can't serve that density of devices. The fullest vision of real-time networked experiences--from gaming, to virtual reality, to remote surgery, to autonomous vehicles--requires networks with nearly zero latency. All these life-changing technologies won't work or won't work well without 5G."Although the benefits of 5G are compelling, the network upgrade won't happen evenly or everywhere unless we get the right regulatory structures in place. After all, many of the largest cities in the U.S.--indeed, the world--might see 5G almost regardless of the regulations we adopt. But that's not success. We want to see next-generation broadband and the economic opportunity it enables available in every community. And smart infrastructure policies are key to doing that--they can flip the business case for thousands of communities."That's why we've been so focused at the FCC on updating our broadband infrastructure rules. We've done so by modernizing our rules and cutting red tape."All of these FCC efforts are already delivering results."Internet speeds are now up 56 percent compared to just two years ago. The digital divide--the percentage of Americans that lack access to high-speed Internet services--narrowed by about 20 percent. Providers built out more miles of high-speed fiber lines last year than ever before. And investment in broadband networks is back on the rise."The 5G results are especially exciting. America now has the world's leading 5G platform. The very first commercial 5G service launched here in the U.S. more than one year ago. By the end of 2018, the private sector extended 5G to 14 communities. Halfway through this year, that figure expanded to more than 30, and one provider has now committed to building 5G to 99 percent of the U.S. population."Many of these 5G builds are powered by small cell antennas that provide the fiber-like capacity and millisecond latency that are key for many 5G applications. Because of FCC reforms I mentioned earlier, investment in small cells has boomed. The private sector deployed 13,000 small cells in 2017, and then 60,000 in 2018, and an expected 200,000 total by year's end.And the benefits of our infrastructure reforms are not just being realized in big cities, but in small communities across the nation. I recently met with broadband builders in Houston's Second Ward, a part of the city that hasn't always shared in the prosperity or investments that its neighboring communities have seen. They were at work trenching fiber and powering up small cells to boost wireless capacity."Outside of America's biggest cities, we're seeing progress too. Take Sioux Falls, South Dakota. That's where next-gen small cells have been installed that are now live and ready for 5G service."These figures and examples quantify the momentum America now has for 5G investment. But of course, these next-gen networks must also be secure."As networks transition from carrying voice calls and emails to these life changing applications, the security of those networks becomes only more important. There's already so much in modern society that now runs on interconnected networks, from banking, to transportation, and even our power grids. This will become only more so as carriers continue to build out 5G networks. If these networks are threatened, everything we have come to rely on is threatened."In the U.S., we have acknowledged the threat that Chinese telecom firms pose to our networks for some time. In 2012, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence issued a report recommending that companies avoid using Huawei and ZTE equipment. In 2018, Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act, which prohibits U.S. government agencies and contractors from using Chinese equipment. In May of this year, President Trump issued an Executive Order to secure our ICT infrastructure and supply chains. Separately, the U.S. Department of Commerce added Huawei to the Entity List, which imposes restrictions on its access to U.S. markets, based on a determination that the company engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security interests. And just last month, U.S. Attorney General William P. Barr filed a letter at the FCC stating that "we should not signal that Huawei and ZTE are anything other than a threat to our collective security.""The FCC opened a proceeding on the threats posed by Huawei, ZTE, and other equipment providers last year. The record that developed made clear the security threats posed by these firms. Both companies have close ties to China's Communist government and military apparatus. It's been reported, for instance, that Huawei employees work as agents for the People's Liberation Army. Both companies are subject to Chinese law that obligates them to cooperate with any request from the country's intelligence services and to keep those requests secret. Indeed, China's National Intelligence Law requires that all "organizations cooperate with the State intelligence work," and it provides them no right to refuse. It also gives the Chinese government the power to take over a company's communications equipment. Both companies have apparently engaged in conduct like intellectual property theft, bribery, and corruption. And an independent cyber security firm recently found that over half of the Huawei firmware images they analyzed had at least one potential backdoor and that each Huawei device they tested had an average of 102 known vulnerabilities."There is no sign that they will cease these patterns and practices. With this and other evidence, it's not hard to see the threat that companies like Huawei and ZTE pose to our networks and to our national security. And because 5G networks are interconnected, even a small amount of compromised equipment could be devastating to a country's national security. 5G means that we must secure our networks from the "core" to the "edge.""At the FCC, we are in a position to do something about this threat. And we are. Just three weeks ago, my colleagues and I voted to prohibit carriers from using federal dollars to purchase any equipment or services from companies that pose a national security threat, including Huawei and ZTE."We are not stopping there. In 2018, I called on the FCC to expand our proceeding and put even more options on the table, including the removal of potentially insecure equipment that carriers have already installed in their networks. After all, if equipment poses a threat, it's not enough to stop subsidizing it: it must come out of the network. I am glad that my colleagues joined me in voting in favor of doing just that last week. So the FCC will continue to eradicate the threat posed by insecure equipment in 5G networks."Importantly, this discussion is not just about network security in some narrow, technical sense. It is also about what I have described as "5G values"--values that China very clearly does not share. Indeed, President Xi Jinping told security officials in January that China does not walk the "Western road" of constitutionalism, separation of powers, or judicial independence. And that's an understatement. Chinese tech companies have a track record longer than a CVS receipt of illegal and malign conduct, which includes violating sanctions, stealing intellectual property, reported lying about extensive partnerships with military and intelligence entities, and enabling extensive and oppressive state surveillance activities."So part of this conversation--and similar ones taking place across the globe--is about our shared 5G values. We need to work together to ensure that the companies supplying the equipment and services integral to 5G networks are ones we can trust, and are ones that share our commitment to transparency, rule of law, freedom, and individual rights."I am pleased to report that we are now seeing many countries recognize this position. In March, for instance, the European Commission released a set of recommendations to improve 5G security, which include assessing the risk that equipment vendors could be influenced by third party countries. More recently, in May, the Czech Republic hosted representatives from more than 30 countries to build a common approach to 5G security. That effort produced the Prague Principles, which are a set of recommendations on how to build a secure and trustworthy 5G network. Those principles also recognize the risks posed by a third country wielding influence over an equipment supplier. Australia issued 5G security guidance to protect their networks from unauthorized access or interference by "vendors who are likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government that conflict with Australian law." Japan has imposed requirements to "take appropriate cyber security measures including measures to respond to supply chain risks." Taiwan has extended its existing measures regarding trusted equipment vendors to cover all 5G government networks and critical infrastructure. And most recently, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Polish President Andrzej Duda signed a Memorandum of Understanding on 5G security."So we have seen a great deal of progress on securing 5G networks over the course of the past year. I am confident that this progress will continue and that these next-gen networks will deliver economic opportunity to the citizens we all serve."Once again, I'd like to thank the IIC for the opportunity to speak with you today, and I look forward to taking your questions."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6957979 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 16, 2019End of Document

Senate Judiciary Committee Issues Testimony From MicrosoftTargeted News ServiceNovember 6, 2019 Wednesday 7:52 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 5396 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Judiciary Committee issued the following testimony by Tom Burt, corporate vice president of customer security and trust at Microsoft, at a hearing entitled "How Corporations and Big Tech Leave Our Data Exposed to Criminals, China, and Other Bad Actors":"Thank you for the opportunity to testify today on the important topic of protecting information from criminals, terrorist organizations, and nation-state actors."My name is Tom Burt and I am the Corporate Vice President of Customer Security and Trust (CST) at Microsoft, a cross-disciplinary team made up of engineers, lawyers, policy advocates, business professionals, data analysts, and cyber-crime investigators who are collectively responsible for ensuring customer trust in Microsoft's products and online services. We focus on ensuring compliance and enhancing security and transparency to protect our customers and promote global trust in Microsoft. Specifically, we work with a variety of governmental and nongovernmental stakeholders to:* Fight cyber-crime and nation-state compromises;* Advocate for and contribute to cyberpeace and the stability and security of democratic institutions globally;* Advance safety on our online services; and* Ensure Microsoft's products and online services comply with our internal security engineering policies."Though my team has a broad mission, in my testimony I will focus specifically on the work that we do to combat cyber-crime and nation-state compromises and our approach to encouraging global cyberpeace."There are two characteristics of the Internet that make it essential that private enterprise, governments, and civil society work collaboratively if we hope to ever find effective and durable approaches to combatting cybercrime and reducing nation-state attacks. First, the Internet is almost entirely the product of private sector innovation and ownership. The physical and virtual assets that form the backbone of the on-line community were created by, and are maintained, evolved and secured by, the private sector. Thus, the private sector has unique data access and systemic controls not available to government. Second, the Internet is largely borderless - and is especially so when cybercrime and nation-state attacks are considered. This means that traditionally sovereign approaches to the investigation and prosecution of crimes, and other disruptions, will not work. Indeed, sophisticated cybercriminals and nation-state actors use deep understanding of jurisdictional differences and legal authority restrictions to"enable their activities. Neither government nor the private sector can address these challenges alone."Microsoft is committed to this partnership. We advocate with governments and through policy initiatives around the world for all stakeholders to adopt rules of conduct in cyberspace to protect governments, enterprises, and consumers. We collaborate with law enforcement, the intelligence community and other government agencies so that our efforts can yield maximum protection for the global online ecosystem and our customers throughout the world.Nation-State Threats"Microsoft's work to protect our customers and the security of the online ecosystem builds upon the company's experience in both assessing and tracking cybersecurity threats and in fighting cybercriminal activity. The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) has focused on tracking nation-state actors for more than a decade, and Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) has used creative techniques and Microsoft technology to fight cyber-crime and improve cybersecurity since 2008. Our robust experience in tracking nation-state threats enhances Microsoft's ability to fight cybercriminal activity and increase the cybersecurity of the global online community. Combined, these actions help Microsoft customers stay ahead of new and evolving threats and challenges."In the past year, Microsoft notified nearly 10,000 customers1 that they have been targeted or compromised by nation-state attacks. About 84% of these attacks targeted our enterprise customers, and about 16% targeted consumer personal email accounts. This data demonstrates the significant extent to which nation-states continue to rely on cyberattacks as a tool to gain intelligence, influence geopolitics or achieve other objectives."Most of the nation-state activity in recent months originated from actors in three countries: Iran, North Korea, and Russia. Specifically, we have seen extensive activity from: the actors we call Holmium, Phosphorus, 2 and Mercury operating from Iran; Thallium operating from North Korea; and two actors operating from Russia we call Yttrium and Strontium.3 We have also seen activity by actors operating from China, but not at the same volume as the actors in these three nations. We continuously track these global threats, building this intelligence into our security products to protect customers and using it in support of our efforts to disrupt threat actor activities through direct legal action or in collaboration with law enforcement. Each nation has its own targets of primary interest. For Russia's Strontium actor, for example, we see them targeting information technology firms and think tanks, democratic processes and most recently antidoping and national sporting organizations. Iran's Mercury actor has been pursuing targets in the oil and gas sector. North Korea's Thallium actor has been targeting universities and diplomatic entities, especially individuals and organizations active in nuclear non-proliferation policy. Given the breadth and increasing frequency of these nation-state attacks, Microsoft has had to bring automation and machine learning to help address these problems at scale."Combatting cybercrime and nation-state compromises require a joint effort. To that end, we monitor evolving cybercrime threats and work closely with law enforcement on a number of initiatives to help devise and execute strategies that disrupt cybercrime threats targeting enterprises, consumers, and governments. Microsoft's work with law enforcement agencies on malware disruptions demonstrates the value of private-public partnerships.Microsoft Combats Botnets and Business Email Compromise"Microsoft plays offense against online threats. Working through robust partnerships, we work to take down criminal infrastructure and pursue financially motivated cybercriminals and nation-state actors. This work helps us to protect our customers and to improve the safety of the global internet community so that all users - enterprises, consumers, and governments - can trust the technology and online services on which we rely for commerce and communication."Microsoft has been driving a sustained fight against botnets for over a decade using novel legal and technical countermeasures to protect our customers and internet users across the globe. "Bots" are software that infiltrate computers and other devices without detection. Typically, the infiltrated systems belong to a government agency, business, or individual. The bot software gives the person who infected the device, known as the "bot-herder," the ability to control the infiltrated systems remotely. These botnets can range from a few hundred to tens of millions of compromised systems. They are used by cybercriminals to conduct distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks, launch massive spam campaigns, proliferate malicious software, and steal data. Whether using common law property or tort causes of action in civil cases to seize malicious domains, or applying Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organization (RICO) and Lanham Act provisions to physically seize command and control servers used by cybercriminals, Microsoft's efforts in this sustained campaign against cyber-crime enabling botnets can be seen in the 17 operations we've engaged in over the past several years against prominent botnets like Rustock,4 Dorkbot5 and more recently Gamarue.6 Each operation is an exercise in collaboration, bringing together the unique abilities and assets of our private industry, academic, and public sector partners all striving to find new ways to protect people from cyber-crime across the globe."Microsoft then works to clean the computers that were infected with botnet software. Our success in this effort is due to close collaboration with security industry partners, internet security providers (ISPs), and government computer emergency readiness teams (CERTs) that are tasked with protecting infrastructure and work with partners to defend against cyberthreats around the world to help affected computer owners regain control of their malware-infected computers. Microsoft shares the information acquired through our investigative efforts and disruptive actions primarily through our threat sharing program. By sharing our botnet takedown data with customers, ISPs, and CERTs, Microsoft has been able to provide the information necessary to inform affected computer owners as well as offer free tools to help them clean their systems. This effort has already helped drastically reduce the global infection of the 17 botnets Microsoft has tackled so far.7 In fact, since 2012 Microsoft's efforts has rescued computers identified on 423 million distinct internet protocols (IPs) covering 15 malware families."Building on the success of this effort, Microsoft is continuing to explore new ways to better engage with our partners. For example, we are working on incorporating new data into our threat sharing program in addition to the infected IPs collected during our botnet disruptions that we currently share. This new data will seek to include known or suspected malicious servers, domains, and internet of things (IOT) devices being leveraged by cybercriminals. Collecting and sharing this data will enable Microsoft and our partners to identify and block malicious traffic emanating from criminal infrastructure located in parts of the world beyond our collective reach, thereby allowing us to counter the changing tactics criminals deploy as they attempt to protect their infrastructure."We have also developed a new threat sharing platform called the Command and Control Observer, a business intelligence-based dashboard delivering reliable, secure, and near real-time actionable intelligence on threats. The Command and Control Observer dashboard was designed to strengthen public-private collaboration in the investigation and disruption of cybercriminal infrastructure. It is being used by over 20 different entities including the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC), a financial industry consortium, and government agencies, ISPs, and CERTs in 13 countries today. It provides law enforcement, CERTs, and government agencies responsible for the enforcement of cyber laws and the protection of critical infrastructure with better telemetry related to criminal cyber infrastructure located within their jurisdiction regarding specific threats, as well as a view of compromised computers and victims impacted by such criminal infrastructure."In addition to its work combatting botnets, Microsoft is also fighting against Business Email Compromise (BEC) crimes. This crime impacts both individuals and enterprises around the world. The FBI reported that in the past three years there have been at least 160,000 victims, who have lost in total more than $26 billion to these crimes.8 Microsoft is working to combat BEC by: 1) disrupting the technical infrastructure utilized by cybercriminals to facilitate BEC attacks - in the last year we have removed over 300,000 malicious phishing URLs, which helped prevent unsuspecting customers from inadvertently accessing phishing pages and falling victim; 2) deterring future BEC attacks by identifying the responsible individuals and referring cases and evidence to the FBI and international law enforcement agencies--most recently Microsoft provided evidence and referred cases in support of Operation ReWired, a coordinated international enforcement action against cybercriminals engaged in BEC; and, 3) communicating timely and relevant information regarding emerging BEC threats to customers and industry partners.Private Sector Experience: Sharing Insights and Developing Tools"The private sector - as the owner and steward of the Internet - has the first responsibility to protect our customers. To that end, we work in a number of ways to increase the private sector's ability to prepare for, defend against, and become resilient to cyber-attacks. Among other things, we have worked with others to create tools for small and medium enterprises to manage cyber risk, formed coalitions of technology leaders to enhance the stability of cyberspace, and collaborated on surveys of private sector resilience."In collaboration with Marsh, we recently surveyed the cyber risk management maturity of the private sector.9 Overall, we found that the firms with the best cyber risk management strategies are increasing their focus on cyber resilience over prevention. Some of the key recommendations emerging from the survey are:* Create a strong organizational cybersecurity culture, with clear, shared standards for governance, accountability, resources, and actions.* Quantify cyber risk to drive better informed capital allocation decisions, enable performance measurement, and frame cyber risk in the same economic terms as other enterprise risks.* Evaluate the cyber risk implications of new technology as a continual and forward-looking process throughout the lifecycle of the technology.* Manage supply chain risk as a collective issue, recognizing the need for trust and shared security standards across the entire network, including the organization's cyber impact on its partners.* Pursue and support public-private partnerships around critical cyber risk issues that can deliver stronger protections and baseline best practice standards for all."Consistent with these findings, Microsoft works with other private sector entities, governmental organizations, and international bodies to raise the standard of cybersecurity."The Cybersecurity Framework produced by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has proven to be a useful baseline for firms to evaluate their cybersecurity maturity and the effectiveness of available processes to manage cybersecurity risk. The Framework has been widely adopted and reportedly is increasingly used by Boards of Directors and enterprise management. We were an industry contributor to the development of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and use it as one means of assessing our own cybersecurity maturity. Microsoft enjoys a vibrant relationship with NIST in our partnership to advance Cybersecurity Excellence. We are a National Cybersecurity Excellence Partner (NCEP) and regularly engage with leaders and members of NIST's National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence to advance thought leadership and the provision of hardware and software to support the rapid adoption of secure technologies. Just this past month, during National Cybersecurity Awareness month, Microsoft sponsored a multi-day exchange with NIST at our headquarters to discuss emerging trends in artificial intelligence security, IoT standards, quantum computing, election system protection, and privacy. In addition, my team joined NIST in Maryland for NCEP roundtables for DC Cyber Week. Our engagement with NIST is a successful representation of effective public-private collaboration."In addition, Microsoft, in collaboration with other private sector companies, launched the Cyber Readiness Institute (CRI), a non-profit initiative that convenes senior leaders of global companies--including Mastercard, Microsoft, ExxonMobil, Maersk, General Motors and others--to develop tools and resources to improve the cyber readiness of small and medium-sized enterprises.10 The CRI uses the NIST cybersecurity framework as a baseline for its work in developing targeted programs such as the Cybersecurity Readiness Program. Though it rarely recommends non-governmental tools to consumers, NIST recently featured the Cybersecurity Readiness Program on its website as a tool for small and medium enterprises to increase the safety and security of enterprises against cybersecurity threats.11"Encouraging good cyber risk management practices for firms domestically and internationally enhances the ability of firms to prevent, protect, and recover from attacks. Most importantly, public awareness directly impacts the resilience of the private sector against cyber-crime and nation-state compromises. But industry leaders cannot do this alone, it requires collective effort by civil society, governments, and international bodies.Collaboration with the Federal Government"In combatting cybercrime and nation-state compromises, we know that strong partnerships with the federal government are essential. We value our collaboration with the Department of Homeland Security and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in particular, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and other agencies, including the intelligence community, that are involved in combatting nation-state activity. We welcome the new mission of the National Security Agency's Cybersecurity Directorate and we look forward to deeper collaboration with the Directorate to help protect against nation-state attacks and advance the public private partnership required to achieve meaningful solutions."The federal government, however, can help advance our shared goals by increasing transparency around nation-state activity it observes. Although it may appear counter-intuitive, that transparency will help eliminate more nation-state activity. Often, nation-state activity is a "stepping-stone" for further action by other nation-states or cybercriminals, recycling advanced tools to pursue their objectives cheaply and effectively. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies should more frequently share attribution, but also indicators of compromise or other threat intelligence from cases or matters that did not go to prosecution, so that they can be used by others to defend against attacks and improve resiliency."Though the success of our efforts to disrupt nation-state compromises and cybercrime is due in significant part to our relationship with law enforcement agencies around the world, we recognize the special challenges law enforcement faces. A traditional approach of investigating in order to identify and prosecute is increasingly challenging in the virtual world, which enables cybercriminals to act anonymously, hide in jurisdictions with no qualms about their activities, and operate through resources located around the globe, thereby significantly frustrating efforts to identify and prosecute these individuals. Many cybercriminals are located within jurisdictions with no extradition treaties in place, so even when attribution is possible, arrest is not. This requires us to work together to balance the objectives of the public and private sector. We need to work together to effectuate systematic change, to take down criminal infrastructure globally, and improve the recovery and resilience of victims at scale."To improve its effectiveness in combatting these crimes, the United States needs to work with allies in new ways while using existing authorities to make a meaningful impact. The recently announced agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom - the first international agreement concluded under the parameters of the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data (CLOUD) Act - is a significant step forward. But the United States, the United Kingdom, and governments around the world must continue to engage with each other to modernize digital evidence and privacy laws, resolve conflicts, and set forth concrete international frameworks that properly protect their citizens from cybercrime and insidious attacks in this digital age. We are encouraged by the start of negotiations between the United States and the European Commission toward a CLOUD Act agreement, and hope the Department of Justice increases their engagement with other governments to negotiate and conclude agreements envisioned by the CLOUD Act.International Norms and Multi-Stakeholder Collaboration"Increasing numbers of sophisticated attacks in cyberspace today are being driven by nation- state investment in the development and deployment of offensive cyberweapon capabilities."Nation-state cyberattacks have over the last decade increased dramatically in frequency, proliferation, and impact. Observers have also highlighted the risks posed by the laws of authoritarian governments like China's Cybersecurity Law, which requires that companies provide the Chinese government with carte blanche access to their networks. Other nations are starting to follow that lead. The U.S. must focus on the threats that such policies pose to the security of technologies, whatever their origin. We must invent 21st Century solutions to this uniquely 21st Century threat and this will require new forms of collaboration."As Microsoft has worked to advocate for multi-stakeholder approaches to addressing these issues, we recognized that the private sector needed itself to commit to core principles to advance global cybersecurity. To that end, we joined with 34 other global technology companies in founding the Cybersecurity Tech Accord in 2018. This Accord asks members to endorse four foundational principles:* Protecting all of our users and customers everywhere;* Opposing cyberattacks against innocent civilians and enterprises;* Empowering users, customers and developers to be more secure; and* Partnering with one another to enhance cybersecurity and resilience."Since its launch, the Cybersecurity Tech Accord has grown to include more than 120 global technology companies from 25 countries. We meet regularly to pursue new initiatives to protect cyberspace including awareness-raising activities, consultations with governments, promoting international norms, and committing to have every signatory adopt a vulnerability disclosure policy. The Cybersecurity Tech Accord has by its collaboration and actions become the global voice of the technology industry on cybersecurity policy."Most recently, the Hewlett Foundation, Mastercard and Microsoft, along with others, founded the CyberPeace Institute as an independent NGO to be based in Geneva, Switzerland. The CyberPeace Institute seeks to enhance the stability of cyberspace by decreasing the frequency, harm, and scale of cyberattacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure and by increasing the resilience of vulnerable populations."It seeks to accomplish this by:* raising public awareness of the occurrence and impacts of sophisticated cyberattacks, including those led or sponsored by states, on civilians and civilian infrastructure;* promoting transparency of, and accountability for, cyberattacks that are perpetrated by sophisticated actors and result in significant, direct harm to civilians or civilian infrastructure;* reinforcing existing norms and practices related to increasing the stability of cyberspace, including by supporting institutions and mechanisms that seek to restrain the use, spread, or harm of cyberattacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure;* highlighting any perceived normative or legal gaps that may exist by examining how rules regarding state behavior are being applied in an operational context;* building and enhancing expert networks to assist vulnerable populations in recovering from cyberattacks that are perpetrated by sophisticated actors and have significant, direct harm; and* providing capabilities to increase the resilience of vulnerable populations against cyberattacks."The leadership of the Institute is assisted by both an executive board and an advisory board, comprised of leading experts from across industry, academia, civil society, and government. The Institute is to be based in Geneva, Switzerland, to capitalize on its history of neutrality and as the home of international institutions and non-profits related to peace and security, including the International Committee for Red Cross (ICRC), the UN Institutions, International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), Land Mine Ban Treaty Organization, and others."On the global stage, the U.S. government can and should play a leading role in advancing meaningful international norms to limit escalating nation-state attacks in cyberspace. Although there are perhaps a handful of well-known and advanced cyber powers responsible for much of this activity, independent assessments suggest that more than 60 nations12 are now actively developing such offensive capabilities in an apparent new "cyber arms-race," all in the absence of clear rules or expectations for responsible behavior. In fact, "cyber" is now the first global threat listed in the most recent Worldwide Threat Assessment, from the U.S. Intelligence Community.13"This weaponization of cyberspace also has important downstream consequences as cyberweapons developed by governments can be stolen, sold, reused or repurposed to devastating effect by malicious actors and cybercriminals with a wide range of objectives. Such consequences were on full display when nation-state developed exploit software was leaked and repurposed in the WannaCry and notPetya attacks of 2017 - which caused massive economic harm, spread autonomously to computer systems across dozens of countries and hundreds of enterprises in a matter of hours, and in the case of WannaCry disabled the United Kingdom's National Health System, putting lives at risk in the process."As with other domains of conflict, long-term solutions for protecting cyberspace will require clear and binding international commitments to articulate what is and is not tolerable behavior for states online. The age of ambiguity, where many actors exploit perceived gaps or grey areas in international law, is no longer tenable, desirable, or acceptable for anyone."Establishing these rules and making them truly effective must inherently require collaboration of governments and the private sector with the participation of civil society. Multi-stakeholder solutions are essential to what is necessarily a multi-stakeholder problem. We must indeed invent 21st Century solutions to this uniquely 21st Century threat and this will require new forms of collaboration. That is why Microsoft was proud to join in supporting the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace last year, along with what are now more than 65 governments and over 350 companies and 135 civil society organizations. The Paris Call is a voluntary commitment to 9 foundational cybersecurity principles including protecting the public core of the internet, critical infrastructure, elections and intellectual property from cyberattacks. The Paris Call has widespread support from these 550 organizations and countries --including every government of the European Union, almost all NATO countries and every one of the "Five Eyes" governments -- all with the exception of the United States. For the sake of the security of American citizens, and those around the world endangered by escalating and sophisticated attacks online, Microsoft encourages the United States to join with so many other countries and organizations in supporting this multi-stakeholder agreement - the most widely endorsed multi-stakeholder commitment in history."While the Paris Call is a significant step toward the required solutions the world needs, much more needs to be done and there are other processes in motion. Two ongoing dialogues under the auspices of the United Nations - the Group of Governmental Experts and an Open-Ended Working Group - have the potential to advance new and more binding commitments for responsible state behavior in cyberspace. The success of these initiatives will hinge in no small part on the willingness of the United States to push for consensus outcomes that recognize the importance of human rights, international law, multi-stakeholder input and rules for responsible state behavior online."Governments, including our own, must continue to use diplomatic processes that include the private sector and civil society to advance cyber norms and drive for meaningful rules governing government conduct in cyberspace.CONCLUSION"Microsoft believes strongly in the importance of protecting our customers in the United States and around the world from nation-states and cybercriminals. Nation-states are still exploring the boundaries of offensive cyber tactics and capabilities, and development of clear laws and policies have been slow. The safety and security of our customers and all participants in the global on-line community are at increasing risk, threatening the evolution and utility of our modern age's most transformative invention. To this end, Microsoft is working to raise industry standards for achieving better cyber risk management, encouraging increased transparency, improving collaborative public-private relationships, and advancing a multi-stakeholder approach to establishing meaningful international norms."While public/private collaboration has yielded significant success in combatting cyber-crime and disrupting nation-state compromises, there is much more to be done. While we commend the government for its work disrupting criminal infrastructure, we hope that Congress will provide new incentives for law enforcement to prioritize the disruption and dismantling of criminal networks. We are supportive of the agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom implementing the CLOUD Act and encourage the Department of Justice to"increase their engagement with other governments to negotiate and conclude CLOUD Act agreements. We also encourage the United States to support the Paris Call and to support the adoption of clear and binding international commitments to rules of conduct in cyberspace. Governments, including the United States, must continue to use diplomatic processes to advance cyber norms and drive for multi-stakeholder solutions."* * *Footnotes:1 New Cybersecurity Threats require new ways to protect democracy. https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/07/17/new-cyberthreats-require-new-ways-to-protect-democracy/2 Recent Cyberattacks Require Us All To Be Vigilant. https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/10/04/recent-cyberattacks-require-us-all-to-be-vigilant/3 New Cyberattacks Targeting Sporting and Anti-Doping Organizations. https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/10/28/cyberattacks-sporting-anti-doping/4 Rustock is a botnet that was responsible for significant amounts of spam in Hotmail consumer accounts. https://www.wired.com/2011/03/microsoft-versus-rustock-botnet/5 Dorkbot is a botnet that is used to steal online payments and cause distributed denial of service attacks. https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA15-337A6 Gamarue is a botnet that was available for sale on the black market to enable a wide variety of cyber-crime. https://www.geekwire.com/2018/microsoft-releases-new-details-gamarue-malware-botnet-sprawling-infrastructure/7 We have seen a 49.56% decrease in distinct IPs since our highest peak in 2014.

China cuts some tariffs to boost trade and take heat out of pork pricesCNN WireDecember 23, 2019 Monday 8:01 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 444 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  China will reduce import tariffs on hundreds of goods next week as it tries to boost trade, shore up its slowing economy and soften the impact of a devastating swine fever epidemic.The Chinese government announced Monday that it would lower import duties on frozen pork, semiconductor parts and more than 800 other items ranging from consumer goods to high-tech products. The rollbacks begin January 1. China's economy has taken hits from all sides this year. Domestic demand has slowed, debt levels are mounting and the prolonged trade war with the United States continues to take its toll.The skyrocketing price of pork --- a staple of the Chinese diet --- may also explain why China is easing frozen pork tariffs from 12% to 8%. African swine fever has ravaged the country's pig farms, causing the cost of the meat to more than double last month compared to a year earlier.Earlier this month, the spike in pork prices caused China's consumer inflation to rise by the quickest pace in nearly eight years.The Chinese government on Monday said that the pork tariff reductions were needed to "better meet people's daily needs."China is looking at measures beyond tariff cuts as it tries to avert a sharp economic slowdown. Monday's announcement came one day after Beijing announced 28 new measures to step up support for the country's struggling private sector, including bigger tax cuts and easier access to bank loans. The private sector is crucial to China's growth, but its companies face more funding difficulties than their state-owned peers.China's trade relationships with other countries are also a consideration. The country is still expected soon to sign a "phase one" trade deal with the United States, which is expected to include Chinese purchases of American farm products.One analyst considered Monday's announcement an "encouraging olive branch" as that deal moves closer toward reality. Stephen Innes, chief Asia market strategy as AxiTrader, said Beijing might be showing Washington that it wants to keep opening up its market and economy. "It suggests that harmonious discussions continue" as the two sides wrap up "phase one" and head into "phase two" of trade negotiations, Innes added. China's move also suggests that the country is trying to encourage trade with other countries as it hashes out its dispute with the United States, said Alex Capri, senior fellow and lecturer at the National University of Singapore.Capri said Beijing likely wants to increase ties in the semiconductor sector with countries like South Korea and Japan.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Reports: US launches review of China-owned video app TikTokAssociated Press Financial WireNovember 1, 2019 Friday 9:43 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 510 wordsByline: By The Associated PressBodyMultiple published reports say that the U.S. government has launched a national-security review of the China-owned video app TikTok, popular with millions of U.S. teens and young adults.The reports Friday from Reuters,The New York Times and others said that the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews acquisitions by foreign firms, has opened an inquiry into TikTok owner ByteDance's 2017 acquisition of a predecessor app, Musical.ly.Several senators have recently noted concerns about censorship and data collection on TikTok.The Treasury Department, which houses CFIUS, said it does not comment on specific cases because the agency by law cannot disclose to the public information filed to it.TikTok said it cannot comment on ongoing regulatory processes. But it said it "has made clear that we have no higher priority than earning the trust of users and regulators in the U.S. Part of that effort includes working with Congress and we are committed to doing so."After acquiring Musical.ly, Beijing-based ByteDance merged it into TikTok. Musical.ly, popular in the U.S. and Europe, had operated out of offices in Shanghai and California.Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) last month sent a letter to Treasury requesting a CFIUS review of the national-security implications of the Musical.ly deal, saying there is "ample and growing evidence" that TikTok is censoring content that is not in line with the Chinese government. In the letter, he said there had been questions about why the app had so few videos of the recent protests in Hong Kong.Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) later in October asked for the U.S. intelligence community to assess national-security risks of TikTok and other Chinese-owned content platforms in the U.S. They said that while TikTok says it stores U.S. user data in the U.S., the company must still adhere to Chinese law on supplying information to the government. Such accusations have also been leveled against other Chinese companies, including Huawei.The senators also said that TikTok is a potential target of foreign influence campaigns similar to Russia's attempts to undermine the 2016 U.S. election on Facebook.TikTok has said its data is not subject to Chinese law and that it does not remove content based on "sensitivities related to China."On the app, people share short videos, often set to music. They lip-sync and dance to songs, do silly pranks and share other bits of their lives. It's searchable by user names, songs and hashtags, like "thisishalloween" or "tiktokcats."The government has stepped in several times over the past few years to block or break up Chinese deals. A Chinese company that owns the gay dating app Grindr reportedly agreed to sell it earlier this year after a CFIUS review. Broadcom, based in Singapore, was stopped from going after U.S. chip maker Qualcomm because of U.S. national-security concerns over losing dominance in the race to for leadership in "5G" wireless, particularly to China. Qualcomm is a major telecom supplier.Load-Date: November 2, 2019End of Document

FCC Commissioner Carr Issues Remarks at Washington Foreign Press CenterTargeted News ServiceNovember 26, 2019 Tuesday 7:55 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1247 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Federal Communications Commission issued the following speech by Commissioner Brendan Carr at the Foreign Press Center on ensuring the security of 5G networks:"Thank you to the U.S. Department of State for the invitation to participate in this press briefing. I look forward to discussing 5G and the steps we're taking in America to ensure secure, trusted, and vibrant communications networks around the globe. I am happy to take questions from the esteemed members of the foreign press that are here today. And I would like to begin by offering some brief opening remarks."Advancing the buildout of 5G networks has been a leading focus for me at the Federal Communications Commission. After all, 5G networks will be the platforms upon which a new wave of jobs and economic opportunity will be created. Indeed, all of the life-changing technologies we hear about--from autonomous cars to smart cities, from remote surgery to virtual reality--won't work or won't work well without 5G."As networks transition from carrying voice calls and emails to these life changing applications, the security of those networks becomes only more important. There's already so much in modern society that now runs on interconnected networks, from banking, to transportation, and even our power grids. This will become only more so as carriers continue to build out 5G networks. If these networks are threatened, everything we have come to rely on is threatened."In the U.S., we have acknowledged the threat that Chinese telecom firms pose to our networks for some time. In 2012, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence issued a report recommending that companies avoid using Huawei and ZTE equipment. In 2018, Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act, which prohibits U.S. government agencies and contractors from using Chinese equipment. In May of this year, President Trump issued an Executive Order to secure our ICT infrastructure and supply chains. Separately, the U.S. Department of Commerce added Huawei to the Entity List, which imposes restrictions on its access to U.S. markets, based on a determination that the company engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security interests. And just this month, U.S. Attorney General William P. Barr filed a letter at the FCC stating that "we should not signal that Huawei and ZTE are anything other than a threat to our collective security.""The FCC opened a proceeding on the threats posed by Huawei, ZTE, and other equipment providers last year. The record that developed made clear the security threats posed by these firms. Both companies have close ties to China's Communist government and military apparatus. It's been reported, for instance, that Huawei employees work as agents for the People's Liberation Army. Both companies are subject to Chinese law that obligates them to cooperate with any request from the country's intelligence services and to keep those requests secret. Indeed, China's National Intelligence Law requires that all "organizations...cooperate with the State intelligence work," and it provides them no right to refuse. It also gives the Chinese government the power to take over a company's communications equipment. Both companies have apparently engaged in conduct like intellectual property theft, bribery, and corruption. And an independent cybersecurity firm recently found that over half of the Huawei firmware images they analyzed had at least one potential backdoor and that each Huawei device they tested had an average of 102 known vulnerabilities."There is no sign that they will cease these patterns and practices. With this and other evidence, it's not hard to see the threat that companies like Huawei and ZTE pose to our networks and to our national security. And because 5G networks are interconnected, even a small amount of compromised equipment could be devastating to a country's national security. 5G means that we must secure our networks from the "core" to the "edge.""At the FCC, we are in a position to do something about this threat. And we are. Just last week, my colleagues and I voted to prohibit carriers from using federal dollars to purchase any equipment or services from companies that pose a national security threat, including Huawei and ZTE."We are not stopping there. In 2018, I called on the FCC to expand our proceeding and put even more options on the table, including the removal of potentially insecure equipment that carriers have already installed in their networks. After all, if equipment poses a threat, it's not enough to stop subsidizing it: it must come out of the network. I am glad that my colleagues joined me in voting in favor of doing just that last week. So the FCC will continue to eradicate the threat posed by insecure equipment in 5G networks. Importantly, this discussion is not just about network security in some narrow, technical sense. It is also about what I have described as "5G values"--values that China very clearly does not share. Indeed, President Xi Jinping told security officials in January that China does not walk the "Western road" of constitutionalism, separation of powers, or judicial independence. And that's an understatement. Chinese tech companies have a track record longer than a CVS receipt of illegal and malign conduct, which includes violating sanctions, stealing intellectual property, reported lying about extensive partnerships with military and intelligence entities, and enabling extensive and oppressive state surveillance activities."So part of this conversation--and similar ones taking place across the globe--is about our shared 5G values. We need to work together to ensure that the companies supplying the equipment and services integral to 5G networks are ones we can trust, and are ones that share our commitment to transparency, rule of law, freedom, and individual rights."I am pleased to report that we are now seeing many countries recognize this position. In March, for instance, the European Commission released a set of recommendations to improve 5G security, which include assessing the risk that equipment vendors could be influenced by third party countries. More recently, in May, the Czech Republic hosted representatives from more than 30 countries to build a common approach to 5G security. That effort produced the Prague Principles, which are a set of recommendations on how to build a secure and trustworthy 5G network. Those principles also recognize the risks posed by a third country wielding influence over an equipment supplier. Australia issued 5G security guidance to protect their networks from unauthorized access or interference by "vendors who are likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government that conflict with Australian law." Japan has imposed requirements to "take appropriate cyber security measures including measures to respond to supply chain risks." Taiwan has extended its existing measures regarding trusted equipment vendors to cover all 5G government networks and critical infrastructure. And most recently, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Polish President Andrzej Duda signed a Memorandum of Understanding on 5G security."So we have seen a great deal of progress on securing 5G networks over the course of the past year. I am confident that this progress will continue. And I look forward to answering any questions you may have."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6941047 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 27, 2019End of Document

Global Head-UP Display Market Report 2019: Market is Competitive and Fragmented, with the Presence of a Large Number of Global and Regional Players - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireDecember 20, 2019 Friday 12:49 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 1537 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Head-UP Display Market - Growth, Trends, and Forecast (2019 - 2024)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The head-up display (HUD) market is expected to register a CAGR of over 23% over the forecast period 2019 - 2024.Growing awareness about passenger and vehicle safety, technological advancements of a head-up display, and increasing demand for luxury and high-end cars are driving the market's growth positively.• Today vehicle owners are increasingly considering advanced automotive safety functions and technologies while making purchase decisions. Monitoring various in-vehicle displays can be a cause of distraction for the driver, triggering potential dangerous situations on the road. Enabled by active and passive systems, a HUD reduces driver distraction and increases driver safety.• Additionally, over the last five years, continuous technological enhancements have resulted in the development of portable and interactive HUDs which is driving the market's growth.• In the near future, AR head-up displays will help to make driving even more comfortable and safe. In August 2019, Jaguar Land Rover announced that it is developing next-generation HUD technology which could beam real-time safety information in front of the driver, and allow passengers to stream 3D movies directly from their seats as part of the shared, autonomous future.• Furthermore, government regulations in the developed regions of North America and Europe are increasingly favoring automotive innovations and technologies that support vehicle and road safety. In October 2018, the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) announced their latest federal guidance for automated vehicles entitled, Preparing for the future of transportation: Automated Vehicles 3.0. (AV 3.0). AV 3.0, reinforced the USDOT commitment for supporting safe integration of automation into the broad transportation system.• The growing automotive production and trends such as connected vehicles, autonomous cars are also expected to fuel the adoption and demand for HUD over the forecast period.• HUD's are widely used in commercial and military aircraft since it plays a significant role in supporting pilots and reducing collision risk with the terrain. Continuously growing military spending, coupled with the rising adoption of HUDs in civil aircraft are expected to favor the market's growth.• Moreover, a rise in air passenger traffic is anticipated to result in the expansion of global aircraft fleet size, and consequently, boost the demand for HUDs from the civil aviation sector in the coming years. For instance, According to figures released by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a total of 4.3 billion passengers were carried by air transport on scheduled services in 2018. This indicates a 6.1% increase over 2017. The number of departures rose to approximately 38 million globally.Scope of the ReportThe Head-Up Display (HUD) is a Human-Machine-Interface that relays real-time information related to the vehicle, traffic, and associated environment for an assisted driving experience. A typical HUD consists of a projector unit, a combiner, and a video generator. HUD is being adopted widely in the automotive and military and civil aviation industries. In the Aviation industry, the HUD helps the pilot in the critical phases of a flight - takeoff and landing.Key Market TrendsGrowing Adoption of HUD in Automotive Industry Driving the Market's Growth• Digitalization is a major trend in the automotive industry. The industry has witnessed numerous technological advancements in the digital field from the last couple of decades. The technological enhancement in the form of HUD is one such example.• A vehicle's HUD keeps drivers focused on the road, safely delivering speed, warning signals, and other vital vehicle and navigation information on the windshield directly in the driver's line of sight.• The growing need for safety and user comfort is one of the most important factors driving the adoption of HUD in the automotive industry. Moreover, an increasing number of road accidents fuels the need for HUD. For instance, According to the World Health Organization, over 1.35 million people die each year as a result of road traffic crashes globally. Injuries from road traffic accidents are the leading cause of death among people aged between 5 and 29 years.• The growing automotive industry is expected to contribute to the market's growth positively. For instance, According to the State Of the U.S. Automotive Industry report, 2018, and the American Automotive Policy Council report in August 2018, auto sales in the United States have increased by over 67% since 2009 (from 10.4 million to 17.4 million).• Luxury brands such as Audi, BMW, Lexus, Land Rover, and Mercedes-Benz, among others are offering a HUD system as a standard or optional add on feature across their premium vehicles.• However, OEMs have been thinking and making them standard even in economy cars. In the year 2018, a Japanese manufacturer, Toyota, launched Camry with the largest windshield HUD, when compared to many other cars available in the market. The company has also made windshield HUD as a standard for its Prius model.• Additionally, the implementation of AR has made HUD an important part of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). The OEM's are expected to include more ADAS applications in the vehicles in the next decade.• BMW also includes entertainment functions into the HUD. It displays radio stations or song list as one scroll through them using a button on the steering wheel. Hence the launch of new car models equipped with HUD is anticipated to boost the market's growth.Asia-Pacific is Expected to Witness Highest Growth Rate• Asia-Pacific is expected to witness the highest growth rate owing to the growing demand from emerging economies such as China and India.• The Central Government of China expects that China's automobile output will reach 30 million units by 2020 and 35 million units by 2025. With the growth in automobile production, the need for HUD is expected to increase, thereby impacting the market's growth positively.• Additionally, the standardization of autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) is accelerating in China. Recently, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the Chinese government issued the key working points of Intelligent Connected Vehicle Standardization for 2018 to promote and facilitate the development of the intelligent connected vehicles industry.• China has to deal with numerous challenges, such as increasing air traffic, unfavorable weather conditions, and high rates of pollution. The authorities are rolling out several measures, including the compulsory use of HUDs. For instance, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) has made it mandatory for all Chinese airlines for adopting HUD.• India and China are significant contributors to the aviation industry developments in the region owing to increasing per capita GDP and domestic air connectivity. For instance, According to ICAO, Asia-Pacific recorded 42% of domestic traffic share and has grown by 10.4% in 2018. The Chinese aviation market is expected to witness significant growth over the next few years, as its three largest airlines, such as Air China, China Southern, and China Eastern, have ambitious fleet plans that will put their sizes at the top of airlines globally.• Automotive manufacturers are expanding in the Indian market with advanced features. For instance, Korean company Kia Motors entered India with the launch of an SUV, Seltos. The vehicle boasts several segment-leading features such as air purifier, connected car features through UVO app, HUD, 8-unit Bose sound system, 360 camera, and ventilated seat.Competitive LandscapeThe head-up display market is competitive and fragmented, with the presence of a large number of global and regional players. The vendors are increasingly focusing on product differentiation and innovation.• June 2019 - Continental AG has developed the first ultra-compact, high-performance HUD in a project initiated by its own development and production service provider, Continental Engineering Services. The HUD is particularly suitable for integration into cockpits with limited installation space, such as in the sports cars.• January 2019 - Panasonice Automotive announced the launch of its latest fully integrated technology platform to transform the consumer experience and provide new flexibility and freedom for automakers. The company launched its latest SPYDR 2.0 at CES 2019, which is the single brain cockpit domain controller solution featuring a Driver Monitoring System (DMS) with Head-Up Display (HUD) IntegrationCompanies Mentioned• Denso Corporation• Nippon Seiki Co.

DETAINED EARLY RAIN CHURCH PASTOR LOSES DEFENSE ATTORNEY IN CHINA'S SICHUANStates News ServiceNovember 6, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 759 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Authorities in China's Sichuan have prevented the lawyer of Early Rain Covenant Church pastor Wang Yi, who is currently facing subversion charges, from representing him, RFA has learned.Wang, who founded the church, was detained by police in Sichuan's provincial capital Chengdu on Dec. 14, 2018 on suspicion of "incitement to subvert state power," alongside dozens of church members in a raid that prompted an international outcry.But while the majority of those detained in the wake of the crackdown have since been released, Wang remains behind bars, while his lawyer Zhang Peihong has been prevented from representing him."This morning, the prosecutor that I've been dealing with this whole time called me and told me that they didn't approve me as Wang Yi's lawyer," Zhang told RFA on Wednesday. "The reason was some things I had written [online]."He said Wang had told him at their last meeting that he was "still considering" whether or not to keep Zhang as his lawyer.Zhang has previously posted on Facebook, which is banned in China, that he wouldn't be writing updates about Wang "in order to secure the right to defend him."An Early Rain church member told RFA that there had been some kind of standoff between Zhang and the authorities."Now he has been formally notified that he isn't allowed to represent Wang Yi," the church member said. "He had originally been hired by Wang Yi's parents."But he said the decision was highly unlikely to have come from Wang himself."This is definitely about the authorities telling Wang Yi in the detention center that he's not allowed to have Zhang Peihong represent him," he said.Wang's wife Jiang Rong is currently out on "bail" after being detained alongside her husband during the initial raid on the church.Both she and Wang's parents are currently under close surveillance by state security police.The church member said the lawyer's dismissal could be an indication that the authorities are preparing to take Wang Yi's case to trial.Deprived of food, water, sunlightMeanwhile, Early Rain church member Gou Zhongcan was released on Oct. 22 after being held for several months in a "legal study center" on charges of "picking quarrels and stirring up trouble."A Christian believer surnamed Wang said Gou had been held for the duration in a basement and deprived of access to sunlight.Some church members who were detained in raids on Dec. 9 and 10 and later released said the police had beaten them, and one detainee described being tied to a chair and deprived of water and food for 24 hours, rights groups reported at the time.According to the New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW), the authorities also ransacked and sealed Early Rain Covenant Church's properties, including offices, a kindergarten, a seminary, and a Bible college, and searched the homes of many of its members.Police also forced church members to sign a pledge not to attend the church again, while the church's accounts on China's social media platform WeChat were removed, it said.Around half of the church's original membership remain under close surveillance by police.'Influential public intellectual'Wang Yi had earlier published an essay critical of the government's tight control over religion, and calling on China's Christians to resist and peacefully disobey new rules issued by the ruling Chinese Communist Party severely restricting the activities of religious organizations.Wang, 46, founded the Early Rain Covenant church in 2008 after several years of political activism that saw him named as "one of the most influential public intellectuals" by the Southern Weekend newspaper in 2004.A graduate the Sichuan University Law School, Wang went on to teach at Chengdu University. He also founded an online forum to study progress in China towards constitutional government.The ruling Chinese Communist Party, which embraces atheism, exercises tight controls over any form of religious practice among its citizens.China is home to an estimated 68 million Protestants, of whom 23 million worship in state-affiliated churches, and some nine million Catholics, 5.7 million of whom are in state-sponsored organizations.The administration of President Xi Jinping regards Christianity as a dangerous foreign import, with officials warning last year against the "infiltration of Western hostile forces" in the form of religion.Reported by Qiao Long for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Wong Lok-to for the Cantonese Service.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 97.80.Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for November declined to 70 from 71 in October. Investors will receive Housing Starts and Building Permits for October on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +28.9% YTDS&P 500 +24.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.2% YTDRussell 2000 +18.1% YTD16:21T AT&T: Sony (SNE) subsidiary Sony Pictures Entertainment acquires AT&T's minority stake in Game Show Network (39.63 +0.13)Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) and AT&T announced that SPE has acquired AT&T's minority stake in Game Show Network. SPE now owns 100% of the multimedia entertainment company. Following the transaction, the Game Show Network channel will continue to be carried on DIRECTV.The sale is consistent with AT&T's strategy to monetize non-strategic assets as it de-levers its balance sheet and begins to retire shares. Prior to the transaction, SPE owned a 58% stake in Game Show Network, and AT&T owned the remaining 42%. In connection with the transaction, AT&T received approx. $500 mln, including proceeds for its equity stake valued at $380 mln (before transaction-related adjustments) and dividends of approx. $130 mln. Game Show Network will continue to be managed by Sony Pictures Television (SPT) with Mark Feldman continuing as President and CEO of the multimedia outlet.16:15EFC Ellington Financial commences public offering of 4.2 mln shares of common stock (18.81 +0.01)The company expects to use proceeds to acquire its targeted assets.

Lowered total FY19 non-GAAP net income guidance to RMB4.0 bln (prior RMB4.5 bln), citing a strategic effort to reduce risk-taking loan balance and focus on higher quality borrowers via open-platform. Co noted that it implemented a conservative strategy of reducing credit volumes in its risk undertaking business and paused its credit trial program to manage macro-driven risk and stabilize delinquency rates; co believes that "the recent exit of many smaller players may create further credit liquidity pressure for the Chinese consumption credit sector," prompting co's conservative approach for its risk-taking book in the final quarter of the year and its guidance revision. At seven-month lows. ABMD (184.06 -17.55%): Presentations by research teams at the American Heart Association's annual meeting this weekend called into question the safety of co's Impella device, suggesting that the device is associated with a higher risk of adverse events and higher costs relative to lower-tech offerings that came before. Drops to multi-week lows. ACB (2.32 -15.1%): Continued weakness on heavy volume following last week's first quarter results. The stock has now declined by circa 36% over the last week. It trades at two-year lows. The broader cannabis sector also lags notably today.15:12HD Home Depot: Earnings Preview; HD recently said the US consumer is exceptionally healthy (238.29 +0.98)Home Depot (HD) is set to report Q3 (Oct) earnings results tomorrow before the open (last quarter it released at 6:00 ET) with a conference call to follow at 9am ET.The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for Q3 EPS is $2.53. The revenue consensus estimate is $27.52 bln. Note: HD typically guides for revenue, EPS and comps in the press release for the full year. Same store comps are always a key metric for Home Depot. In Q2 (Jul), comps came in at +3.0% (+3.1% US comps), up a bit from Q1 (Apr) comps of +2.5% (+3.0% US comps). HD said it overcame a tough May and continued lumber price deflation (lower lumber prices hurts comps) to deliver accelerating comp performance throughout JulQ: Comps were +0.6% in May, +4.1% in June, and +4.7% in July. Last quarter, Home Depot, lowered its full year comp guidance to approx. +4%, mostly to reflect the impact of lumber price deflation as well as some conservatism to account for tariffs. Home Depot was pretty bullish at a recent Goldman Investor Conference, saying that the US consumer right now is exceptionally healthy thanks to record low unemployment and making up almost the whole of GDP growth at this point. Also, homeowners have seen some home price appreciation in recent years. We'll see if management maintains this view as we near the end of the year. Because Home Depot is such a large retailer, its results should provide some early clues on how robustly the consumer is spending. Last week, Wal-Mart (WMT) kicked off the retail earnings parade with a good result. We'll see if HD can match that. However, tariffs, hurricane sales and lumber price deflation could impact comps this quarter. In particular, HD's results will set expectations for Lowe's (LOW) which reports on Wednesday before the open. Other key reporting dates: HD, KSS & TJX (Nov 19, before open), TGT & LOW (Nov 20, before open), M (Nov 21, before open), GPS (Nov 21, after the close), PVH (Nov 25, after the close), BBY & BURL (Nov 26, before open), KR (late Nov/early Dec), DG (Dec 5, before open), COST (Dec 12, after the close).15:07BONDX Treasury Market SummaryTreasuries Maintain Bullish BiasU.S. Treasuries began the new week with gains across the curve. The cash session started with modest losses that followed a subdued overnight affair, which saw more, albeit slight, easing from the People's Bank of China. However, Treasuries reclaimed their starting losses immediately after the cash open, as the market responded to a tweet from a CNBC anchor in Beijing, who reported that Chinese officials have a pessimistic view of the ongoing negotiations with the U.S. due to President Trump's reluctance to roll back import tariffs. The report prompted a spike into the green, which was followed by a rally past Friday's intraday highs. Treasuries marked their best levels of the day around 10:30 ET, spending the remainder of the session near those highs. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.2% to 97.78. Yield Check: 2-yr: -2 bps to 1.59% 3-yr: -2 bps to 1.59% 5-yr: -3 bps to 1.63% 10-yr: -3 bps to 1.81% 30-yr: -2 bps to 2.29%News: President Trump met with Fed Chairman, Jay Powell, and Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, today. The Department of Commerce extended a temporary license that allows U.S. companies to continue selling components to Huawei. The People's Bank of China lowered its reverse repurchase rate by five basis points to 2.50%. British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, said that every Conservative candidate for a parliamentary seat pledged to vote in favor of the Brexit deal if Conservatives win majority in the upcoming election. Singapore's October trade surplus totaled SGD3.78 bln (last surplus of SGD3.83 bln). Non-Oil exports fell 2.9% m/m (expected 1.4%; last -3.3%), contracting 12.3% yr/yr (expected -10.4%; last -8.1%).

There's a nervous-sounding headline about the state of trade negotiations between the U.S. and China, the market dips on that headline, and then it bounces back.In turn, the gains are not material. They are modest, but nonetheless, they have kept the major indices on a record-setting course.Currently, the S&P 500 is up just 0.1%, which is just about its high for the session. The move there has seen a subsidence of the outperformance of defensive-oriented areas, like utilities (+0.4%) and consumer stales (+0.6%), and the ascendance of the growth-oriented sectors, like communication services (+0.5%) and information technology (+0.4%).There hasn't been a news catalyst for this performance shift; rather, it is indicative of a market that is playing with a bullish bias and riding a trading trend until it no longer proves to be a friend.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.2%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 are up 0.1%; and the Russell 2000 is down 0.3%.14:00OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:PTON Jan20 35 calls (volume: 11300, open int: 760, implied vol: ~62%, prev day implied vol: 51%).

The Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%, and the Russell 2000 is down 0.3%.Some hesitation may be attributed to a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, Eunice Yoon, saying a government source told her that the trade mood in Beijing has turned pessimistic due to President Trump not backing any tariff rollbacks. The tweet has contended with Chinese state media indicating that Phase One talks were constructive over the weekend.From an equity-index level, the strong resistance to any sort of pullback remains indicative of an expectation for some sort of an agreement. Investors remain inclined toward stocks, but money is flowing into the more defensive-oriented sectors like the S&P 500 consumer staples (+0.8%), utilities (+0.8%), and real estate (+0.8%) sectors.The energy sector (-1.4%) is today's outright laggard amid a decline in oil prices ($56.78/bbl, -$0.94, -1.6%). The industrials sector (-0.5%) is under broad-based selling pressure, too.Separately, Apple (AAPL 266.47, +0.70, +0.3%) continues to grind out new all-time highs.In corporate news, Netflix (NFLX 304.18, +9.15, +3.1%) shares are seeing increased demand on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman have taken a large stake in the company. HP Inc. (HPQ 19.92, -0.26, -1.3%) rejected the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 38.94, unch), although it remains open to a deal.U.S. Treasuries are benefiting from a conservative mindset today. The uptick in demand has the benchmark 10-yr yield down two basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.3% to 97.75.Today's lone economic report was the NAHB Housing Market Index for November, which declined to 70 from 71 in October.12:33SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (92) outpacing new lows (56) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: AAPL, AGEN, AIZ, ALLE, AMAT, AMD, AMED, AMH, ANSS, APD, ARNC, ARVN, ATEC, ATRS, AUDC, AY, BIO, BIP, BRX, BURL, CATM, CDE, CDW, CG, CNMD, CNNE, CODI, CPRT, CZR, DAR, DEI, DGII, DRNA, DXCM, EIDX, EPAM, EPRT, EW, FISV, FIVN, FTNT, GLPI, GOOGL, GPN, GWRE, HIBB, INMD, INST, KEYS, KIM, KMX, KOD, KRG, KRYS, LDOS, LPT, LULU, LW, LXP, LZB, MDT, MMC, MSCI, MSFT, NUVA, OC, ORLY, PCTY, PLMR, PLUG, PLXS, PODD, PPL, PSN, QGEN, RH, SEM, SGEN, SHOO, SKX, SRC, STX, TDG, TGI, TNK, TYL, UI, WD, WSM, XPEL, ZBH, ZYMEStocks that traded to 52 week lows: AM, AMC, AR, BSM, BTU, CDEV, CHK, CNK, CPS, CTMX, CVEO, CYCN, DLPH, ECOL, ELVT, ENBL, ENLC, EQM, ETRN, EXTN, EZPW, FET, FOSL, FPRX, GLOG, GLOP, GSM, HCC, I, IIVI, KLXE, KWR, MRKR, NBLX, NEWM, NVEE, PBT, PNNT, PSNL, QUAD, RARE, RBBN, RES, RVLV, SDRL, SIGA, SINA, SXC, SYRS, TH, TTI, TUP, UAN, UPWK, WES, WLLThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: CNXN, FWONA, KRTX, LACQ, NVMI, NWPX, PLOWThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: CLXT, CMCT, NSCO, RDI, SRRK, TRCETFs that traded to 52 week highs: DIA, EIS, EWC, EWK, EWN, EWQ, IHI, IOO, IWF, IYH, IYK, NIB, OEF, PBD, SPY, VTI, XLK, XLP, XLVETFs that traded to 52 week lows: AMJ, VXX12:07SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Dicerna Pharmaceuticals (DRNA) rises on collaboration agreement -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersDRNA (22.26 +15.34%): Co and Novo Nordisk (NVO) announced an agreement to develop therapies for liver-related cardio-metabolic diseases using co's proprietary GalXC RNAi platform technology, with plans to explore more than 30 liver cell targets.

This partnership will allow Gett to expand its reach across the United States, seamlessly serving its business clients on the Lyft network, all through Gett's SaaS platform for business travelers.Juno is shutting down in New York today as a result of both Gett's increased focus on the corporate transportation sector and the enactment of misguided regulations in New York City earlier this year. All Juno riders will be invited to join Lyft.11:16TALKX Market Briefing: Market checks up on tweet checkThus far, there hasn't been any follow-through on Friday's record-setting advance for the major indices, which are sporting modest losses.There is a bit of a hesitation/defensive trade mindset at work today after China-based CNBC anchor Eunice Yoon tweeted earlier this morning that a government source has told her that the mood in Beijing about a trade deal is pessimistic because President Trump hasn't endorsed any tariff rollbacks.This tweet conflicted with some of Friday's optimism, which was based on NEC Director Kudlow's indication that the two sides were getting close to an agreement and were down to the "short strokes."The fact that today's losses are far more modest that Friday's gains underscores an otherwise sticky belief that a deal of some kind will be reached; however, history on these matters dictates allowing some room for disappointment. Buyers, therefore, aren't rushing back into today's action, but knowing this market has refused to buckle on any negative-sounding news, is keeping the selling efforts in check as well.Currently, the defensive-oriented consumer staples (+1.0%), utilities (+0.8%), and real estate (+0.7%) sectors are winning standouts, while the energy (-1.4%), industrials (-0.5%), and financial (-0.3%) sectors bring up the rear.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is flat; the S&P 500 is down 0.1%; the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is down 0.5%.10:58XLP Sector Briefing: Bond Proxies (61.89 +0.56)The early portion of today's session has seen losses in most sectors, but there are some pockets of relative strength, as rate-sensitive consumer staples (+0.9%), utilities (+0.9%), and real estate (+0.7%) trade with solid gains.The three sectors account for just 14.0% of the entire S&P 500, so they have a limited impact on the overall performance of the market, but today's outperformance is largely due to one common factor: falling interest rates.Treasury yields backed down from three-month highs during the past week and they have already dipped beneath last week's lows today. Today's pressure on yields comes after a CNBC reporter in Beijing tweeted that the Chinese government has a pessimistic view of trade negotiations with the U.S., according to government sources.The continued pressure on Treasury yields means that high-yielding sectors like utilities, real estate, and consumer staples are becoming more attractive to investors.Notable movers:Consumer staples: Coty (COTY 12.18, +0.27, +2.3%), Kimberly-Clark (KMB 133.91, +2.28, +1.7%), Colgate-Palmolive (CL 67.50, +1.13, +1.7%), Walmart (WMT 120.52, +1.65, +1.4%), and Procter & Gamble (PG 122.00, +1.46, +1.2%)Utilities: Eversource Energy (ES 82.58, +1.31, +1.6%), NextEra Energy (NEE 234.20, +2.78, +1.2%), American Electric Power (AEP 90.79, +1.23, +1.4%), CMS Energy (CMS 61.63, +0.73, +1.2%), and Evergy (EVRG 65.53, +0.78, +1.2%)Real estate: Realty Income (O 78.68, +1.22, +1.6%), Equinix (EQIX 558.00, +7.59, +1.4%), Crown Castle International (CCI 136.38, +1.70, +1.3%), Welltower (WELL 85.13, +1.14, +1.4%), Healthpeak Properties (PEAK 34.97, +0.52, +1.5%)10:54ECONX President Trump tweets confirmation of 'cordial' meeting with Fed Chair Powell (311.75 -0.04)Tweet10:37ECONX Fed Chair Powell met with with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and President Trump this morning; he reiterated his monetary policy outlook, which will depend entirely on incoming information that bears on the outlook for the economyAt the President's invitation, Chair Powell met with the President and the Treasury Secretary Monday morning at the White House to discuss the economy, growth, employment and inflation.Chair Powell's comments were consistent with his remarks at his congressional hearings last week. He did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy, except to stress that the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming information that bears on the outlook for the economy.Finally, Chair Powell said that he and his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee will set monetary policy, as required by law, to support maximum employment and stable prices and will make those decisions based solely on careful, objective and non-political analysis.10:31OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:LOW Weekly Nov22 120 calls are seeing interest with 1300 contracts trading vs. open int of 110, pushing implied vol up around 18 points to ~79%.

In ORION-9, twice-yearly dosing (following initial and three-month doses) with inclisiran sodium 300 mg met all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, was well-tolerated and demonstrated an excellent safety profile. Full study results were presented during a late-breaking science session at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions in Philadelphia.For the primary endpoints of ORION-9, inclisiran delivered placebo-adjusted LDL-C reductions of 50% (71 mg/dL, p<0.0001) at day 510 in HeFH patients and demonstrated time-averaged placebo-adjusted LDL-C reductions of 45% (63 mg/dL, p<0.0001) from days 90 through 540. The overall adverse event profiles of the placebo- and inclisiran-treated groups in ORION-9 were similar. At least one serious treatment emergent adverse event was experienced by 13.8% of patients in the placebo-treated group and 7.5% of patients in the inclisiran-treated group. The incidences of deaths (0.4% vs. 0.4%) and malignancies (1.3% vs. 0.8%) were similar between the placebo and inclisiran groups, respectively. Low incidences of clinically significant elevations in liver function tests (ALT 0.4% vs. 1.2%, AST 0.4% vs. 0.8%) and serum creatinine increases (0.4% vs. 0.4%) were observed in the placebo and inclisiran groups, respectively, and none were considered related to study drug. Clinically relevant adverse events at the injection site, predominantly mild and always transient, were reported in 0.4% of placebo-treated patients vs. 13.7% of inclisiran-treated patients.09:02SSTK Shutterstock appoints Jarrod Yahes as CFO, effective December 9 (42.19 )Since October 2016, Mr. Yahes has served as the Chief Financial Officer at Zeta Global, a marketing technology company.09:01CYTK Cytokinetics and Amgen (AMGN) present results from COSMIC-HF (8.18 )Amgen, Cytokinetics, and Servier announced that new results from COSMIC-HF (Chronic Oral Study of Myosin Activation to Increase Contractility in Heart Failure), a Phase 2 trial evaluating omecamtiv mecarbil in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), will be presented today at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2019. In patients with HFrEF treated with omecamtiv mecarbil, in addition to previously reported improvements in cardiac contractility measures (including systolic function, or pumping action of the heart), measures of diastolic function were not different from placebo and, for some measures, trended towards improvement. In COSMIC-HF, 448 patients with stable, symptomatic heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <40% were randomly assigned to omecamtiv mecarbil or placebo in a double-blind fashion for 20 weeks. This post-hoc analysis assessed the effect of chronic therapy with omecamtiv mecarbil by treatment group on echocardiographic measures of diastolic function, including early (E-wave) and late (A-wave) peak mitral inflow velocities, early peak myocardial relaxation velocity (e'), isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT), tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV), and diastolic filling time. In patients with HFrEF who received omecamtiv mecarbil, systolic ejection time increased as previously reported and expected, while diastolic filling time was not reduced, nor were diastolic parameters worsened. Specifically, in patients receiving omecamtiv mecarbil E-wave velocity, E/A-ratio, and E/e' or e' were not significantly changed compared to placebo. There was a small increase (<5 ms) in the duration of the IVRT, and in the PK group, TRV, an indicator of pulmonary pressure, improved significantly during treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil therapy.09:01OSTK Overstock.com declares regular annual cash dividend for 2019 of $0.16 per share on the company's Voting Series A-1 Preferred Stock and of $0.16 per share on its Voting Series B Preferred Stock (8.33 )08:51LH Laboratory Corp commences senior notes offering (171.55 )LabCorp intends to use proceeds for general corporate purposes that may include (1) the purchase, redemption, or repayment at maturity of its outstanding 2.625% Senior Notes due Feb. 1, 2020, (2) the purchase of up to $300 mln aggregate purchase price of its 4.625% Senior Notes, due November 15, 2020 in a concurrent tender offer, and (3) the repayment of some or all of the amounts outstanding under its term loan credit facilities.08:50LOV Spark Networks appoints Eric Eichmann as CEO (5.59 )Eric will replace Jeronimo Folgueira who is stepping down from the role as chief executive officer.

DAPA-HF is the first outcomes trial with an SGLT2 inhibitor investigating the treatment of HF in patients with reduced ejection fraction, with and without type 2 diabetes. The new analyses showed the consistency of these results across patient subgroups with and without T2D, an early onset of effects, and improvement in patient-reported outcomes of HF-related health status. Data were consistent in patients with and without type 2 diabetes, showed early effects in the first month and improvement in patient-reported outcomes.06:22NVS Novartis AG announces new subgroup analyses from global Phase III PARAGON-HF study of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (90.04 )The data suggest that, in specific subgroups, treatment with Entresto may result in greater reductions in heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular death, as compared to valsartan. This greater benefit was seen in women with HFpEF and in HFpEF patients recently hospitalized for heart failure. In addition, in a pooled analysis of PARAGON-HF (HFpEF) and PARADIGM-HF (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)), greater treatment benefit was observed in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below approximately 60%. HFpEF is a type of heart failure that has no currently approved treatment and disproportionately affects women. These new analyses were presented at the American Heart Association's (AHA) Scientific Sessions 2019 with simultaneous publication of the gender analysis in Circulation and hospitalization analysis in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.06:21LLY Eli Lilly presents new interim analysis of three-year data from the EMPagliflozin compaRative effectIveness and SafEty real-world study (113.19 )A new interim analysis of three-year data from the EMPagliflozin compaRative effectIveness and SafEty (EMPRISE) real-world study on effectiveness shows that Jardiance (empagliflozin) was associated with a decreased risk of hospitalization for heart failure and a similar risk of non-fatal atherosclerotic cardiovascular events compared with DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists. The interim analysis included 190,000 adults in the U.S. with type 2 diabetes with and without cardiovascular disease.In this new interim analysis, Jardiance was associated with a reduction in risk of hospitalization for heart failure of 41% compared with DPP-4 inhibitors and of 17% compared with GLP-1 receptor agonists. Risk for non-fatal atherosclerotic cardiovascular events-defined as non-fatal heart attack or stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or coronary revascularization-was similar for those treated with Jardiance (14.6 events per 1,000 patient-years) compared with DPP-4 inhibitors (17.6 events per 1,000 patient-years). The risk was also similar for those treated with Jardiance (14.2 events per 1,000 patient-years) compared with GLP-1 receptor agonists (14.8 events per 1,000 patient-years).In a second interim analysis of EMPRISE, which included more than 45,000 patients, Jardiance was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause hospitalizations, emergency department visits and physician's office visits compared with DPP-4 inhibitors. Results from the EMPRISE real-world study in routine clinical care complement data from the landmark EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, in which Jardiance showed a 35% relative risk reduction in hospitalization for heart failure compared with placebo in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. The EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial also showed a 38% relative risk reduction in cardiovascular death in those taking Jardiance versus placebo in the same population.06:20EIDX Eidos Therapeutics and BridgeBio Pharma (BBIO) report Phase 2 Open Label Extension suggesting long-term tolerability of AG10 (46.55 )BridgeBio Pharma (BBIO) and Eidos Therapeutics (EIDX) presented positive data from the companies' ongoing Open Label Extension (OLE) of the Phase 2 clinical trial studying AG10 in patients with symptomatic transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM).

Leiter, MD, FRCPC, FACP, FACE, FAHA Director of the Lipid Clinic at St. Michael's Hospital and Professor of Medicine and Nutritional Sciences, University of Toronto. The presentation highlighted that bempedoic acid reduced hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) by 0.19% versus placebo in patients with diabetes (n=1,134) at 12 weeks. The analysis also showed that patients on bempedoic acid had fewer instances of new-onset diabetes as well as hyperglycemia than those on placebo.In addition, a poster, titled "Efficacy of Bempedoic Acid: A Pooled Analysis of 4 Pivotal Phase 3 Clinical Trials" was presented by Maciej Banach, MD, PhD, FAHA, FESC. The poster highlighted that in the pooled Phase 3 studies, bempedoic acid significantly lowered LDL-C in patients with hypercholesterolemia when added-on to maximally tolerated statin therapy, which may mean no statin at all. In patients on background statin therapy, bempedoic acid lowered LDL-Cholesterol by 18% compared to placebo. In patients not on statin background therapy and considered statin intolerant, bempedoic acid lowered LDL-Cholesterol by 25% compared to placebo.06:18GOLD Barrick confirms deal to to sell 50% interest in Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines in Western Australia to Saracen Mineral Holdings Limited for a total consideration of $750 mln in cash (16.57 )06:17TMUS T-Mobile US schedules conference call for investors and media today at 9 a.m. ET to provide business update (78.07 )06:17KNSA Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals reports Phase 2 Clinical Data for Rilonacept; Pivotal Phase 3 trial of rilonacept in recurrent pericarditis enrolling; data expected in 2H 2020 (6.54 )Co reported final data from an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of rilonacept, a weekly, subcutaneously-injected, recombinant fusion protein that blocks IL-1a and IL-1 signaling.

In ORION-10, twice-yearly dosing with inclisiran sodium 300 mg met all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, was well-tolerated and again demonstrated an excellent safety profile. For the primary endpoints of ORION-10, inclisiran delivered placebo-adjusted LDL-C reductions of 58% (p<0.0001) at day 510 and demonstrated time-averaged placebo-adjusted LDL-C reductions of 56% (p<0.0001) from days 90 through 540. The overall adverse event profiles of the placebo- and inclisiran-treated groups in ORION-10 were similar. A similar proportion of patients in the placebo and inclisiran groups experienced at least one serious treatment emergent adverse event (26.3% vs. 22.4%). The incidences of deaths (1.4% vs. 1.5%) and malignancies (3.3% vs. 3.3%) were also comparable between the placebo and inclisiran groups, respectively. Clinically significant elevations in liver function tests (ALT 0.3% vs. 0.3%, AST 0.6% vs. 0.5%) and serum creatinine increases (3.9% vs. 3.9%) were similar between the placebo and inclisiran groups, respectively.

In reaching this determination, the Board also considered the highly conditional and uncertain nature of the proposal, including the potential impact of outsized debt levels on the combined company's stock. We have great confidence in our strategy and our ability to execute to continue driving sustainable long-term value at HP. In addition, the Board and management team continue to take actions to enhance shareholder value including the deployment of our strong balance sheet for increased repurchases of our significantly undervalued stock and for value-creating M&A. We recognize the potential benefits of consolidation, and we are open to exploring whether there is value to be created for HP shareholders through a potential combination with Xerox. However, as we have previously shared in connection with our prior requests for diligence, we have fundamental questions that need to be addressed in our diligence of Xerox. We note the decline of Xerox's revenue from $10.2 billion to $9.2 billion (on a trailing 12-month basis) since June 2018, which raises significant questions for us regarding the trajectory of your business and future prospects. In addition, we believe it is critical to engage in a rigorous analysis of the achievable synergies from a potential combination. With substantive engagement from Xerox management and access to diligence information on Xerox, we believe that we can quickly evaluate the merits of a potential transaction."06:03DRNA Dicerna Pharmaceuticals and Novo Nordisk (NVO) announce agreement to discover and develop novel therapies for the treatment of liver-related cardio-metabolic diseases using Dicerna's proprietary GalXC RNAi platform technology.

China had a lot to do with the strength after state media reports suggested Phase One talks have been constructive over the weekend. Also, the PBOC announced a key interest rate cut. This has supported markets and put US futures into all-time high territory. The S&P is just off the high of 3127.75, trading around 3124. This is well off the overnight low of 3113.75.In Asia, China took the spotlight with the news out of the region. The PBOC's rate cut of its seven-day repurchase rate, took it down to 2.50% from 2.55%. The move was unexpected. This helped the Shanghai gain 0.6% on Monday and essentially get all of Friday's losses back. Hong Kong managed to bounce over 1% after suffering heavy losses last week. Japan quietly rose 0.5%. European markets saw a small pop early but have settled back in since. Although most of the trading has been lackluster, mining stocks are among the weakest groups with Gold, Silver and Platinum down in the range of 0.7-1.3%. Copper has not followed metals lower, likely due to the rate cut in China.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: +4.010 yr Note: 1.84%USD/JPY: 109.05 +0.30EUR/USD: 1.1064 +0.0015Europe: FTSE +0.1% DAX -0.1% CAC -0.2%Asia: Hang Seng +1.4% Shanghai +0.6% Nikkei +0.5%Gold (1458.50 -10.00) Silver (16.75 -0.20) Crude (57.77 +0.05)17:05WRAPX This week's biggest % gainers/losersThe following are this week's top percentage gainers and losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).This week's top % gainers Healthcare: CLVS (6.38 +77.96%), AMRN (24.02 +43.23%), COLL (18.12 +40.97%), SGRY (11.77 +35.6%), QGEN (40.56 +32.59%), DXCM (208.37 +32.47%), EPZM (15.36 +29.62%)Industrials: BE (6.53 +95.51%), TGI (28.49 +29.79%), MAXR (11.5 +28.49%)Information Technology: LASR (20.62 +46.24%), SYNA (60.37 +34.04%), COMM (14.95 +32.18%), DXC (37.23 +31.23%), CARB (22.95 +28.86%)Financials: TRUP (32.35 +36.21%), LTS (3.48 +32.82%)This week's top % losers Healthcare: ANAB (11.1 -71.29%)Industrials: AFI (3.73 -41.26%), NSP (72.9 -32.29%)Consumer Discretionary: PRTY (1.89 -66.61%), MOD (7.54 -34.94%), EXPE (95.67 -30.57%)Information Technology: RBBN (2.75 -38.82%), PLT (26.22 -35.39%)Energy: EXTN (7.56 -41.89%), GLOG (9.64 -31.58%)17:01MGI Moneygram provides restructuring update (2.68 +0.06)On November 11, 2019, the co committed to an operational plan to reduce overall operating expenses - expects to complete the workforce reduction by the end of the first quarter of 2020.

The S&P 500 (+0.8%) closed above the 3100 level, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.8%) closed above 28,000 -- both for the first time.The Nasdaq Composite (+0.7%) also closed at a record high, while the Russell 2000 (+0.5%) continued to trail its large-cap peers.The S&P 500 health care sector did the heavy lifting on Friday, climbing 2.2%, even as the Trump administration announced an initiative to increase price transparency from hospitals and insurers. Investors were evidently unconcerned about the proposal leading to an adverse effect on earnings.No other S&P 500 sector increased 1.0%, but the continued outperformance of Apple (AAPL 265.76, +3.12, +1.2%), Microsoft (MSFT 149.97, +1.91, +1.3%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1334.87, +23.41, +1.8%) should not be understated.

Semiconductor stocks benefited from the trade news and the solid results and guidance from Applied Materials (AMAT 62.06, +5.10, +9.0%). Conservative guidance from NVIDIA (NVDA 204.19, -5.60, -2.7%) did limit gains, though.Interestingly, the trade-sensitive materials sector (-0.1%) was the lone holdout on Friday.Separately, T-Mobile US (TMUS 78.07, +1.23, +1.6%) CEO John Legere is no longer considering the CEO role at WeWork, according to CNBC.

Excluding autos, retail sales jumped 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.4%) after declining an unrevised 0.1% decline in September.The key takeaway from the report, other than it shows continued growth in discretionary spending, is that it will be a positive input for Q4 GDP. Core retail sales, which exclude autos, gasoline, building materials, and food services and drinking places sales, and which factor into the goods component of the PCE calculation, were up 0.3%.Import prices for October were down 0.5%. Excluding fuel, they were down 0.2%. Export prices were down 0.1%. Excluding agricultural products, they were down 0.3%.The key takeaway from the report is that it points to an indolent inflation backdrop.Industrial production slumped 0.8% in October (Briefing.com consensus -0.4%) on the heels of an upwardly revised 0.3% decline (from -0.4%) in September. The capacity utilization rate fell to 76.7% (Briefing.com consensus 77.1%) from 77.5% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that, while the GM strike had a big impact on industrial production, things were still weak excluding that impact. To wit, the Federal Reserve reports industrial production declined 0.5% excluding motor vehicles and parts.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%) after a downwardly revised 0.1% decline (from 0.0%) in August.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 97.80.Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for November declined to 70 from 71 in October.

SPE now owns 100% of the multimedia entertainment company. Following the transaction, the Game Show Network channel will continue to be carried on DIRECTV.The sale is consistent with AT&T's strategy to monetize non-strategic assets as it de-levers its balance sheet and begins to retire shares. Prior to the transaction, SPE owned a 58% stake in Game Show Network, and AT&T owned the remaining 42%. In connection with the transaction, AT&T received approx. $500 mln, including proceeds for its equity stake valued at $380 mln (before transaction-related adjustments) and dividends of approx. $130 mln.

Co noted that it implemented a conservative strategy of reducing credit volumes in its risk undertaking business and paused its credit trial program to manage macro-driven risk and stabilize delinquency rates; co believes that "the recent exit of many smaller players may create further credit liquidity pressure for the Chinese consumption credit sector," prompting co's conservative approach for its risk-taking book in the final quarter of the year and its guidance revision.

ABMD (184.06 -17.55%): Presentations by research teams at the American Heart Association's annual meeting this weekend called into question the safety of co's Impella device, suggesting that the device is associated with a higher risk of adverse events and higher costs relative to lower-tech offerings that came before.

The revenue consensus estimate is $27.52 bln. Note: HD typically guides for revenue, EPS and comps in the press release for the full year. Same store comps are always a key metric for Home Depot. In Q2 (Jul), comps came in at +3.0% (+3.1% US comps), up a bit from Q1 (Apr) comps of +2.5% (+3.0% US comps). HD said it overcame a tough May and continued lumber price deflation (lower lumber prices hurts comps) to deliver accelerating comp performance throughout JulQ: Comps were +0.6% in May, +4.1% in June, and +4.7% in July. Last quarter, Home Depot, lowered its full year comp guidance to approx. +4%, mostly to reflect the impact of lumber price deflation as well as some conservatism to account for tariffs. Home Depot was pretty bullish at a recent Goldman Investor Conference, saying that the US consumer right now is exceptionally healthy thanks to record low unemployment and making up almost the whole of GDP growth at this point. Also, homeowners have seen some home price appreciation in recent years. We'll see if management maintains this view as we near the end of the year. Because Home Depot is such a large retailer, its results should provide some early clues on how robustly the consumer is spending. Last week, Wal-Mart (WMT) kicked off the retail earnings parade with a good result. We'll see if HD can match that. However, tariffs, hurricane sales and lumber price deflation could impact comps this quarter. In particular, HD's results will set expectations for Lowe's (LOW) which reports on Wednesday before the open. Other key reporting dates: HD, KSS & TJX (Nov 19, before open), TGT & LOW (Nov 20, before open), M (Nov 21, before open), GPS (Nov 21, after the close), PVH (Nov 25, after the close), BBY & BURL (Nov 26, before open), KR (late Nov/early Dec), DG (Dec 5, before open), COST (Dec 12, after the close).15:07BONDX Treasury Market SummaryTreasuries Maintain Bullish BiasU.S. Treasuries began the new week with gains across the curve. The cash session started with modest losses that followed a subdued overnight affair, which saw more, albeit slight, easing from the People's Bank of China. However, Treasuries reclaimed their starting losses immediately after the cash open, as the market responded to a tweet from a CNBC anchor in Beijing, who reported that Chinese officials have a pessimistic view of the ongoing negotiations with the U.S. due to President Trump's reluctance to roll back import tariffs. The report prompted a spike into the green, which was followed by a rally past Friday's intraday highs. Treasuries marked their best levels of the day around 10:30 ET, spending the remainder of the session near those highs. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.2% to 97.78. Yield Check: 2-yr: -2 bps to 1.59% 3-yr: -2 bps to 1.59% 5-yr: -3 bps to 1.63% 10-yr: -3 bps to 1.81% 30-yr: -2 bps to 2.29%News: President Trump met with Fed Chairman, Jay Powell, and Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, today.

There's a nervous-sounding headline about the state of trade negotiations between the U.S. and China, the market dips on that headline, and then it bounces back.In turn, the gains are not material. They are modest, but nonetheless, they have kept the major indices on a record-setting course.Currently, the S&P 500 is up just 0.1%, which is just about its high for the session. The move there has seen a subsidence of the outperformance of defensive-oriented areas, like utilities (+0.4%) and consumer stales (+0.6%), and the ascendance of the growth-oriented sectors, like communication services (+0.5%) and information technology (+0.4%).There hasn't been a news catalyst for this performance shift; rather, it is indicative of a market that is playing with a bullish bias and riding a trading trend until it no longer proves to be a friend.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.2%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 are up 0.1%; and the Russell 2000 is down 0.3%.14:00OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:PTON Jan20 35 calls (volume: 11300, open int: 760, implied vol: ~62%, prev day implied vol: 51%).

The Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%, and the Russell 2000 is down 0.3%.Some hesitation may be attributed to a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, Eunice Yoon, saying a government source told her that the trade mood in Beijing has turned pessimistic due to President Trump not backing any tariff rollbacks. The tweet has contended with Chinese state media indicating that Phase One talks were constructive over the weekend.From an equity-index level, the strong resistance to any sort of pullback remains indicative of an expectation for some sort of an agreement. Investors remain inclined toward stocks, but money is flowing into the more defensive-oriented sectors like the S&P 500 consumer staples (+0.8%), utilities (+0.8%), and real estate (+0.8%) sectors.The energy sector (-1.4%) is today's outright laggard amid a decline in oil prices ($56.78/bbl, -$0.94, -1.6%). The industrials sector (-0.5%) is under broad-based selling pressure, too.Separately, Apple (AAPL 266.47, +0.70, +0.3%) continues to grind out new all-time highs.In corporate news, Netflix (NFLX 304.18, +9.15, +3.1%) shares are seeing increased demand on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman have taken a large stake in the company. HP Inc. (HPQ 19.92, -0.26, -1.3%) rejected the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 38.94, unch), although it remains open to a deal.U.S. Treasuries are benefiting from a conservative mindset today. The uptick in demand has the benchmark 10-yr yield down two basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.3% to 97.75.Today's lone economic report was the NAHB Housing Market Index for November, which declined to 70 from 71 in October.12:33SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (92) outpacing new lows (56) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: AAPL, AGEN, AIZ, ALLE, AMAT, AMD, AMED, AMH, ANSS, APD, ARNC, ARVN, ATEC, ATRS, AUDC, AY, BIO, BIP, BRX, BURL, CATM, CDE, CDW, CG, CNMD, CNNE, CODI, CPRT, CZR, DAR, DEI, DGII, DRNA, DXCM, EIDX, EPAM, EPRT, EW, FISV, FIVN, FTNT, GLPI, GOOGL, GPN, GWRE, HIBB, INMD, INST, KEYS, KIM, KMX, KOD, KRG, KRYS, LDOS, LPT, LULU, LW, LXP, LZB, MDT, MMC, MSCI, MSFT, NUVA, OC, ORLY, PCTY, PLMR, PLUG, PLXS, PODD, PPL, PSN, QGEN, RH, SEM, SGEN, SHOO, SKX, SRC, STX, TDG, TGI, TNK, TYL, UI, WD, WSM, XPEL, ZBH, ZYMEStocks that traded to 52 week lows: AM, AMC, AR, BSM, BTU, CDEV, CHK, CNK, CPS, CTMX, CVEO, CYCN, DLPH, ECOL, ELVT, ENBL, ENLC, EQM, ETRN, EXTN, EZPW, FET, FOSL, FPRX, GLOG, GLOP, GSM, HCC, I, IIVI, KLXE, KWR, MRKR, NBLX, NEWM, NVEE, PBT, PNNT, PSNL, QUAD, RARE, RBBN, RES, RVLV, SDRL, SIGA, SINA, SXC, SYRS, TH, TTI, TUP, UAN, UPWK, WES, WLLThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: CNXN, FWONA, KRTX, LACQ, NVMI, NWPX, PLOWThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: CLXT, CMCT, NSCO, RDI, SRRK, TRCETFs that traded to 52 week highs: DIA, EIS, EWC, EWK, EWN, EWQ, IHI, IOO, IWF, IYH, IYK, NIB, OEF, PBD, SPY, VTI, XLK, XLP, XLVETFs that traded to 52 week lows: AMJ, VXX12:07SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Dicerna Pharmaceuticals (DRNA) rises on collaboration agreement -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersDRNA (22.26 +15.34%): Co and Novo Nordisk (NVO) announced an agreement to develop therapies for liver-related cardio-metabolic diseases using co's proprietary GalXC RNAi platform technology, with plans to explore more than 30 liver cell targets.

Through the Lyft partnership, Gett's corporate customers traveling in the United States will be able to request rides through the Gett app and be matched with a driver on the Lyft network. This partnership will allow Gett to expand its reach across the United States, seamlessly serving its business clients on the Lyft network, all through Gett's SaaS platform for business travelers.Juno is shutting down in New York today as a result of both Gett's increased focus on the corporate transportation sector and the enactment of misguided regulations in New York City earlier this year. All Juno riders will be invited to join Lyft.11:16TALKX Market Briefing: Market checks up on tweet checkThus far, there hasn't been any follow-through on Friday's record-setting advance for the major indices, which are sporting modest losses.There is a bit of a hesitation/defensive trade mindset at work today after China-based CNBC anchor Eunice Yoon tweeted earlier this morning that a government source has told her that the mood in Beijing about a trade deal is pessimistic because President Trump hasn't endorsed any tariff rollbacks.This tweet conflicted with some of Friday's optimism, which was based on NEC Director Kudlow's indication that the two sides were getting close to an agreement and were down to the "short strokes."The fact that today's losses are far more modest that Friday's gains underscores an otherwise sticky belief that a deal of some kind will be reached; however, history on these matters dictates allowing some room for disappointment. Buyers, therefore, aren't rushing back into today's action, but knowing this market has refused to buckle on any negative-sounding news, is keeping the selling efforts in check as well.Currently, the defensive-oriented consumer staples (+1.0%), utilities (+0.8%), and real estate (+0.7%) sectors are winning standouts, while the energy (-1.4%), industrials (-0.5%), and financial (-0.3%) sectors bring up the rear.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is flat; the S&P 500 is down 0.1%; the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is down 0.5%.10:58XLP Sector Briefing: Bond Proxies (61.89 +0.56)The early portion of today's session has seen losses in most sectors, but there are some pockets of relative strength, as rate-sensitive consumer staples (+0.9%), utilities (+0.9%), and real estate (+0.7%) trade with solid gains.The three sectors account for just 14.0% of the entire S&P 500, so they have a limited impact on the overall performance of the market, but today's outperformance is largely due to one common factor: falling interest rates.Treasury yields backed down from three-month highs during the past week and they have already dipped beneath last week's lows today. Today's pressure on yields comes after a CNBC reporter in Beijing tweeted that the Chinese government has a pessimistic view of trade negotiations with the U.S., according to government sources.The continued pressure on Treasury yields means that high-yielding sectors like utilities, real estate, and consumer staples are becoming more attractive to investors.Notable movers:Consumer staples: Coty (COTY 12.18, +0.27, +2.3%), Kimberly-Clark (KMB 133.91, +2.28, +1.7%), Colgate-Palmolive (CL 67.50, +1.13, +1.7%), Walmart (WMT 120.52, +1.65, +1.4%), and Procter & Gamble (PG 122.00, +1.46, +1.2%)Utilities: Eversource Energy (ES 82.58, +1.31, +1.6%), NextEra Energy (NEE 234.20, +2.78, +1.2%), American Electric Power (AEP 90.79, +1.23, +1.4%), CMS Energy (CMS 61.63, +0.73, +1.2%), and Evergy (EVRG 65.53, +0.78, +1.2%)Real estate: Realty Income (O 78.68, +1.22, +1.6%), Equinix (EQIX 558.00, +7.59, +1.4%), Crown Castle International (CCI 136.38, +1.70, +1.3%), Welltower (WELL 85.13, +1.14, +1.4%), Healthpeak Properties (PEAK 34.97, +0.52, +1.5%)10:54ECONX President Trump tweets confirmation of 'cordial' meeting with Fed Chair Powell (311.75 -0.04)Tweet10:37ECONX Fed Chair Powell met with with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and President Trump this morning; he reiterated his monetary policy outlook, which will depend entirely on incoming information that bears on the outlook for the economyAt the President's invitation, Chair Powell met with the President and the Treasury Secretary Monday morning at the White House to discuss the economy, growth, employment and inflation.Chair Powell's comments were consistent with his remarks at his congressional hearings last week. He did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy, except to stress that the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming information that bears on the outlook for the economy.Finally, Chair Powell said that he and his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee will set monetary policy, as required by law, to support maximum employment and stable prices and will make those decisions based solely on careful, objective and non-political analysis.10:31OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:LOW Weekly Nov22 120 calls are seeing interest with 1300 contracts trading vs. open int of 110, pushing implied vol up around 18 points to ~79%.

In ORION-9, twice-yearly dosing (following initial and three-month doses) with inclisiran sodium 300 mg met all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, was well-tolerated and demonstrated an excellent safety profile. Full study results were presented during a late-breaking science session at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions in Philadelphia.For the primary endpoints of ORION-9, inclisiran delivered placebo-adjusted LDL-C reductions of 50% (71 mg/dL, p<0.0001) at day 510 in HeFH patients and demonstrated time-averaged placebo-adjusted LDL-C reductions of 45% (63 mg/dL, p<0.0001) from days 90 through 540. The overall adverse event profiles of the placebo- and inclisiran-treated groups in ORION-9 were similar. At least one serious treatment emergent adverse event was experienced by 13.8% of patients in the placebo-treated group and 7.5% of patients in the inclisiran-treated group. The incidences of deaths (0.4% vs. 0.4%) and malignancies (1.3% vs. 0.8%) were similar between the placebo and inclisiran groups, respectively. Low incidences of clinically significant elevations in liver function tests (ALT 0.4% vs. 1.2%, AST 0.4% vs. 0.8%) and serum creatinine increases (0.4% vs. 0.4%) were observed in the placebo and inclisiran groups, respectively, and none were considered related to study drug. Clinically relevant adverse events at the injection site, predominantly mild and always transient, were reported in 0.4% of placebo-treated patients vs. 13.7% of inclisiran-treated patients.09:02SSTK Shutterstock appoints Jarrod Yahes as CFO, effective December 9 (42.19 )Since October 2016, Mr. Yahes has served as the Chief Financial Officer at Zeta Global, a marketing technology company.09:01CYTK Cytokinetics and Amgen (AMGN) present results from COSMIC-HF (8.18 )Amgen, Cytokinetics, and Servier announced that new results from COSMIC-HF (Chronic Oral Study of Myosin Activation to Increase Contractility in Heart Failure), a Phase 2 trial evaluating omecamtiv mecarbil in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), will be presented today at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2019. In patients with HFrEF treated with omecamtiv mecarbil, in addition to previously reported improvements in cardiac contractility measures (including systolic function, or pumping action of the heart), measures of diastolic function were not different from placebo and, for some measures, trended towards improvement. In COSMIC-HF, 448 patients with stable, symptomatic heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <40% were randomly assigned to omecamtiv mecarbil or placebo in a double-blind fashion for 20 weeks. This post-hoc analysis assessed the effect of chronic therapy with omecamtiv mecarbil by treatment group on echocardiographic measures of diastolic function, including early (E-wave) and late (A-wave) peak mitral inflow velocities, early peak myocardial relaxation velocity (e'), isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT), tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV), and diastolic filling time. In patients with HFrEF who received omecamtiv mecarbil, systolic ejection time increased as previously reported and expected, while diastolic filling time was not reduced, nor were diastolic parameters worsened. Specifically, in patients receiving omecamtiv mecarbil E-wave velocity, E/A-ratio, and E/e' or e' were not significantly changed compared to placebo. There was a small increase (<5 ms) in the duration of the IVRT, and in the PK group, TRV, an indicator of pulmonary pressure, improved significantly during treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil therapy.09:01OSTK Overstock.com declares regular annual cash dividend for 2019 of $0.16 per share on the company's Voting Series A-1 Preferred Stock and of $0.16 per share on its Voting Series B Preferred Stock (8.33 )08:51LH Laboratory Corp commences senior notes offering (171.55 )LabCorp intends to use proceeds for general corporate purposes that may include (1) the purchase, redemption, or repayment at maturity of its outstanding 2.625% Senior Notes due Feb. 1, 2020, (2) the purchase of up to $300 mln aggregate purchase price of its 4.625% Senior Notes, due November 15, 2020 in a concurrent tender offer, and (3) the repayment of some or all of the amounts outstanding under its term loan credit facilities.08:50LOV Spark Networks appoints Eric Eichmann as CEO (5.59 )Eric will replace Jeronimo Folgueira who is stepping down from the role as chief executive officer.

The interim analysis included 190,000 adults in the U.S. with type 2 diabetes with and without cardiovascular disease.In this new interim analysis, Jardiance was associated with a reduction in risk of hospitalization for heart failure of 41% compared with DPP-4 inhibitors and of 17% compared with GLP-1 receptor agonists. Risk for non-fatal atherosclerotic cardiovascular events-defined as non-fatal heart attack or stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or coronary revascularization-was similar for those treated with Jardiance (14.6 events per 1,000 patient-years) compared with DPP-4 inhibitors (17.6 events per 1,000 patient-years). The risk was also similar for those treated with Jardiance (14.2 events per 1,000 patient-years) compared with GLP-1 receptor agonists (14.8 events per 1,000 patient-years).In a second interim analysis of EMPRISE, which included more than 45,000 patients, Jardiance was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause hospitalizations, emergency department visits and physician's office visits compared with DPP-4 inhibitors. Results from the EMPRISE real-world study in routine clinical care complement data from the landmark EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, in which Jardiance showed a 35% relative risk reduction in hospitalization for heart failure compared with placebo in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. The EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial also showed a 38% relative risk reduction in cardiovascular death in those taking Jardiance versus placebo in the same population.06:20EIDX Eidos Therapeutics and BridgeBio Pharma (BBIO) report Phase 2 Open Label Extension suggesting long-term tolerability of AG10 (46.55 )BridgeBio Pharma (BBIO) and Eidos Therapeutics (EIDX) presented positive data from the companies' ongoing Open Label Extension (OLE) of the Phase 2 clinical trial studying AG10 in patients with symptomatic transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM).

Leiter, MD, FRCPC, FACP, FACE, FAHA Director of the Lipid Clinic at St. Michael's Hospital and Professor of Medicine and Nutritional Sciences, University of Toronto. The presentation highlighted that bempedoic acid reduced hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) by 0.19% versus placebo in patients with diabetes (n=1,134) at 12 weeks. The analysis also showed that patients on bempedoic acid had fewer instances of new-onset diabetes as well as hyperglycemia than those on placebo.In addition, a poster, titled "Efficacy of Bempedoic Acid: A Pooled Analysis of 4 Pivotal Phase 3 Clinical Trials" was presented by Maciej Banach, MD, PhD, FAHA, FESC. The poster highlighted that in the pooled Phase 3 studies, bempedoic acid significantly lowered LDL-C in patients with hypercholesterolemia when added-on to maximally tolerated statin therapy, which may mean no statin at all. In patients on background statin therapy, bempedoic acid lowered LDL-Cholesterol by 18% compared to placebo. In patients not on statin background therapy and considered statin intolerant, bempedoic acid lowered LDL-Cholesterol by 25% compared to placebo.06:18GOLD Barrick confirms deal to to sell 50% interest in Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines in Western Australia to Saracen Mineral Holdings Limited for a total consideration of $750 mln in cash (16.57 )06:17TMUS T-Mobile US schedules conference call for investors and media today at 9 a.m. ET to provide business update (78.07 )06:17KNSA Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals reports Phase 2 Clinical Data for Rilonacept; Pivotal Phase 3 trial of rilonacept in recurrent pericarditis enrolling; data expected in 2H 2020 (6.54 )Co reported final data from an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of rilonacept, a weekly, subcutaneously-injected, recombinant fusion protein that blocks IL-1a and IL-1 signaling.

In ORION-10, twice-yearly dosing with inclisiran sodium 300 mg met all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, was well-tolerated and again demonstrated an excellent safety profile. For the primary endpoints of ORION-10, inclisiran delivered placebo-adjusted LDL-C reductions of 58% (p<0.0001) at day 510 and demonstrated time-averaged placebo-adjusted LDL-C reductions of 56% (p<0.0001) from days 90 through 540. The overall adverse event profiles of the placebo- and inclisiran-treated groups in ORION-10 were similar. A similar proportion of patients in the placebo and inclisiran groups experienced at least one serious treatment emergent adverse event (26.3% vs. 22.4%). The incidences of deaths (1.4% vs. 1.5%) and malignancies (3.3% vs. 3.3%) were also comparable between the placebo and inclisiran groups, respectively. Clinically significant elevations in liver function tests (ALT 0.3% vs. 0.3%, AST 0.6% vs. 0.5%) and serum creatinine increases (3.9% vs. 3.9%) were similar between the placebo and inclisiran groups, respectively. Clinically relevant adverse events at the injection site, predominantly mild and always transient, were reported in 0.9% of placebo-treated patients vs. 2.6% of inclisiran-treated patients.06:14RCEL Avita Medical names David McIntyre CFO (8.15 )Interim CFO Tim Rooney will continue in his role as AVITA Medical's Chief Administrative Officer with responsibility for global operations and supply chain management, program management, human resources, and information technology.

In reaching this determination, the Board also considered the highly conditional and uncertain nature of the proposal, including the potential impact of outsized debt levels on the combined company's stock. We have great confidence in our strategy and our ability to execute to continue driving sustainable long-term value at HP. In addition, the Board and management team continue to take actions to enhance shareholder value including the deployment of our strong balance sheet for increased repurchases of our significantly undervalued stock and for value-creating M&A. We recognize the potential benefits of consolidation, and we are open to exploring whether there is value to be created for HP shareholders through a potential combination with Xerox. However, as we have previously shared in connection with our prior requests for diligence, we have fundamental questions that need to be addressed in our diligence of Xerox. We note the decline of Xerox's revenue from $10.2 billion to $9.2 billion (on a trailing 12-month basis) since June 2018, which raises significant questions for us regarding the trajectory of your business and future prospects. In addition, we believe it is critical to engage in a rigorous analysis of the achievable synergies from a potential combination. With substantive engagement from Xerox management and access to diligence information on Xerox, we believe that we can quickly evaluate the merits of a potential transaction."06:03DRNA Dicerna Pharmaceuticals and Novo Nordisk (NVO) announce agreement to discover and develop novel therapies for the treatment of liver-related cardio-metabolic diseases using Dicerna's proprietary GalXC RNAi platform technology.

We also plan to further analyze these results to better understand the potential of KarXT in patients with schizophrenia experiencing negative and cognitive symptoms, and to explore other CNS disorders that could benefit from this approach, such as psychosis in Alzheimer's disease as well as the management of pain."06:00LN LINE Corp confirms agreement to form capital alliance with Z Holdings (48.13 )Line Statement06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets get a small boost from China's surprise rate cutThe global equity markets are mostly higher to begin the week. China had a lot to do with the strength after state media reports suggested Phase One talks have been constructive over the weekend. Also, the PBOC announced a key interest rate cut. This has supported markets and put US futures into all-time high territory. The S&P is just off the high of 3127.75, trading around 3124. This is well off the overnight low of 3113.75.In Asia, China took the spotlight with the news out of the region. The PBOC's rate cut of its seven-day repurchase rate, took it down to 2.50% from 2.55%. The move was unexpected. This helped the Shanghai gain 0.6% on Monday and essentially get all of Friday's losses back. Hong Kong managed to bounce over 1% after suffering heavy losses last week. Japan quietly rose 0.5%. European markets saw a small pop early but have settled back in since. Although most of the trading has been lackluster, mining stocks are among the weakest groups with Gold, Silver and Platinum down in the range of 0.7-1.3%. Copper has not followed metals lower, likely due to the rate cut in China.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: +4.010 yr Note: 1.84%USD/JPY: 109.05 +0.30EUR/USD: 1.1064 +0.0015Europe: FTSE +0.1% DAX -0.1% CAC -0.2%Asia: Hang Seng +1.4% Shanghai +0.6% Nikkei +0.5%Gold (1458.50 -10.00) Silver (16.75 -0.20) Crude (57.77 +0.05)17:05WRAPX This week's biggest % gainers/losersThe following are this week's top percentage gainers and losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).This week's top % gainers Healthcare: CLVS (6.38 +77.96%), AMRN (24.02 +43.23%), COLL (18.12 +40.97%), SGRY (11.77 +35.6%), QGEN (40.56 +32.59%), DXCM (208.37 +32.47%), EPZM (15.36 +29.62%)Industrials: BE (6.53 +95.51%), TGI (28.49 +29.79%), MAXR (11.5 +28.49%)Information Technology: LASR (20.62 +46.24%), SYNA (60.37 +34.04%), COMM (14.95 +32.18%), DXC (37.23 +31.23%), CARB (22.95 +28.86%)Financials: TRUP (32.35 +36.21%), LTS (3.48 +32.82%)This week's top % losers Healthcare: ANAB (11.1 -71.29%)Industrials: AFI (3.73 -41.26%), NSP (72.9 -32.29%)Consumer Discretionary: PRTY (1.89 -66.61%), MOD (7.54 -34.94%), EXPE (95.67 -30.57%)Information Technology: RBBN (2.75 -38.82%), PLT (26.22 -35.39%)Energy: EXTN (7.56 -41.89%), GLOG (9.64 -31.58%)17:01MGI Moneygram provides restructuring update (2.68 +0.06)On November 11, 2019, the co committed to an operational plan to reduce overall operating expenses - expects to complete the workforce reduction by the end of the first quarter of 2020.

The S&P 500 (+0.8%) closed above the 3100 level, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.8%) closed above 28,000 -- both for the first time.The Nasdaq Composite (+0.7%) also closed at a record high, while the Russell 2000 (+0.5%) continued to trail its large-cap peers.The S&P 500 health care sector did the heavy lifting on Friday, climbing 2.2%, even as the Trump administration announced an initiative to increase price transparency from hospitals and insurers. Investors were evidently unconcerned about the proposal leading to an adverse effect on earnings.No other S&P 500 sector increased 1.0%, but the continued outperformance of Apple (AAPL 265.76, +3.12, +1.2%), Microsoft (MSFT 149.97, +1.91, +1.3%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1334.87, +23.41, +1.8%) should not be understated. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.86, +0.44, +1.0%) and Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+0.9%) also showed relative strength.Retail stocks extended yesterday's advance after October retail sales increased 0.3% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). Semiconductor stocks benefited from the trade news and the solid results and guidance from Applied Materials (AMAT 62.06, +5.10, +9.0%). Conservative guidance from NVIDIA (NVDA 204.19, -5.60, -2.7%) did limit gains, though.Interestingly, the trade-sensitive materials sector (-0.1%) was the lone holdout on Friday.Separately, T-Mobile US (TMUS 78.07, +1.23, +1.6%) CEO John Legere is no longer considering the CEO role at WeWork, according to CNBC. Shares of RH (RH 188.47, +13.25, +7.6%) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY 38.95, +1.19, +3.2%) outperformed after Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B 219.74, +0.38, +0.2%) disclosed new positions in the companies.U.S. Treasuries didn't sell off despite the risk-on mentality in the stock market, but they did edge lower. The 2-yr yield increased three basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 97.99. WTI crude rose 0.9%, or $0.99, to $57.75/bbl.Reviewing Friday's batch of economic data:October retail sales increased 0.3% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) following an unrevised 0.3% decline in September. Excluding autos, retail sales jumped 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.4%) after declining an unrevised 0.1% decline in September.The key takeaway from the report, other than it shows continued growth in discretionary spending, is that it will be a positive input for Q4 GDP. Core retail sales, which exclude autos, gasoline, building materials, and food services and drinking places sales, and which factor into the goods component of the PCE calculation, were up 0.3%.Import prices for October were down 0.5%. Excluding fuel, they were down 0.2%. Export prices were down 0.1%. Excluding agricultural products, they were down 0.3%.The key takeaway from the report is that it points to an indolent inflation backdrop.Industrial production slumped 0.8% in October (Briefing.com consensus -0.4%) on the heels of an upwardly revised 0.3% decline (from -0.4%) in September. The capacity utilization rate fell to 76.7% (Briefing.com consensus 77.1%) from 77.5% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that, while the GM strike had a big impact on industrial production, things were still weak excluding that impact. To wit, the Federal Reserve reports industrial production declined 0.5% excluding motor vehicles and parts.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%) after a downwardly revised 0.1% decline (from 0.0%) in August. Total business sales were down 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.1% increase (from 0.2%) in August.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+3.7%) and sales growth (+0.5%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.Looking ahead, investors will receive Net Long-Term TIC Flows for September on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +28.7% YTDS&P 500 +24.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTDRussell 2000 +18.4% YTD16:02PJC Piper Jaffray authorizes $150 mln common stock repurchase program (76.25 +0.61)Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: November 19, 2019End of Document

Ross: US Will Increase China Tariffs On December 15 "If Nothing Happens Between Now And Then."The FrontrunnerDecember 3, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 532 wordsBodyAsked on Fox Business' Varney & Co. (12/2, 64K) if the US will roll back tariffs on China on Dec. 15, Commerce Secretary Ross said, "It all depends on their behavior between now and then. ... I do think the President is 100 percent right. They want to make a deal. The question is, do they want to make a deal we can live with?" Asked when a phase one deal might be signed, Ross said, "You have a logical deadline December 15th. If nothing happens between now and then, President has made quite clear he will put the tariffs in. The increased tariffs."China Declines To Retaliate Economically In Dispute Over Hong Kong Bill.The New York Times (12/2, Qin, 18.61M) reports China said Monday that it will "suspend visits to Hong Kong by American warships and impose sanctions on several United States-based nongovernmental groups, in a mostly symbolic retaliation for tough human rights legislation President Trump signed last week." A spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry "denounced the new human rights legislation as illegal interference into its domestic affairs," and "also accused several organizations, including the National Endowment for Democracy, Human Rights Watch and Freedom House, of instigating violence during the antigovernment protests that have convulsed Hong Kong since June."Likewise, under the headline "China Spares Trade in First Retaliation to US's Hong Kong Law," Bloomberg (12/2, 4.73M) also reports that China "avoided measures related to trade in its first actions retaliating against the US over a law supporting Hong Kong's protesters, instead vowing to sanction some rights organizations and halt warship visits to the city." The AP (12/2, Moritsugu) says that "while the nature of the sanctions remained unclear, the move followed Chinese warnings that the US would bear the costs if the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act was approved."State Official Defends US Law On Hong Kong.The Washington Times (12/2, Gertz, 492K) reports a "senior State Department official said Monday a new US law will help preserve Hong Kong's, even as Beijing announced a series of sanctions in response." David Stillwell, the Department's "most senior Asian policymaker," said in a speech that the Administration's new policy "seeks to promote pluralistic governance in the face of growing authoritarianism and hegemony in Asia and elsewhere" and "defended the passage last week of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act."WPost: Teen's Suspension Shows TikTok Serves As "Long Arm Of The Chinese Government."The Washington Post (12/2, 14.2M) editorializes that the social media platform TikTok, which it calls "the long arm of the Chinese government," last week suspended "a 17-year-old student in New Jersey named Feroza Aziz...after posting what started as a makeup tutorial and then took a turn toward activism: Viewers who tuned in to learn how they could get long eyelashes were instead urged to research China's repression and cultural genocide of its Uighur Muslim minority." The Post says TikTok has "repeatedly protested that it is independent from the regime" and said Aziz's suspension "had nothing to do with her stand against the atrocities in Xinjiang."Load-Date: December 3, 2019End of Document

As the two struggle, another protester in black approaches, at whom the officer points his gun.It seems as ifTencent wants to take this partnership a step further though, as an anonymousTencent official told the Wall Street Journal that console players are being targetted in the USA and Europe."What we want is to expand from China, and one target is console game players in the USA and Europe", stated aTencent official, who requested to not be recognized. Echoing the same,Nintendo Chief Executive Shuntaro Furukawa told analysts they should not expect a lot from the Switch in China. One ofTencent's highest-profile attempts at the reverse is "Honor of Kings", a mobile game that is a monster hit with Chinese gamers but that has failed to catch on outside of China. The organization is also in a partnership withNintendo, too.As of now, it's unclear as to what's the extent ofTencent's plans for the game. The brand is apparently seeking outside developers to create games targeted at young women, such as romance games, which are extremely popular in China.Load-Date: November 13, 2019End of Document

Through Dec 23, revenue increased by approximately 5% vs the same period and workdays in the prior year.Co also confirms it expects full year sales to be above the midpoint of its outlook range of +1-3%.16:23WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryIt was another record-setting day on Thursday, with the Nasdaq Composite rallying 0.8% to cross the 9000 level for the first time. The S&P 500 (+0.5%) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) also closed at new highs, thanks to some mega-cap leadership and a strong finish into the close. The Russell 2000 finished flat.Amazon's (AMZN 1868.77, +79.56) 4.5% gain stood out after the company said it had another record-breaking holiday season. A separate report from MasterCard SpendingPulse indicated that total retail sales, excluding autos, increased 3.4% yr/yr from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24 while online sales rose 18.8%.It was no surprise, then, to see the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (+1.4%) as today's sector leader. The communication services (+0.8%) and information technology (+0.7%) sectors followed suit amid solid gains in Apple (AAPL 289.91, +5.64, +2.0%), Alphabet (GOOG 1360.40, +16.84, +1.3%), and Facebook (FB 207.79, +2.67, +1.3%).Conversely, the health care (-0.1%), energy (unch), and consumer staples (+0.1%) sectors underperformed with little changes.Trading volume was relatively light on this day after Christmas, but that didn't detract from the positive sentiment in the market. The holiday sales results, after all, showcased the strength of the U.S. consumer, while reports that the U.S. and China are close to signing a Phase One trade deal kept investors at ease.A tight labor market, as indicated in the latest weekly jobless claims report, may also bode well for continued strength in the consumer. Specifically, initial claims for the week ending Dec. 21 decreased by 13,000 to 222,000, as expected.U.S. Treasuries held steady throughout the session. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.91%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 97.56.

Continuing claims for the week ending December 14 decreased by 6,000 to 1.719 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims have picked up some from the cyclical bottom, but remain at a level that is still indicative of a tight labor market.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications declined 5.3% following a 5.0% decline in the prior week.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +36.0% YTDS&P 500 +29.2% YTDRussell 2000 +24.4% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +22.7% YTD16:20CWT California Water subsidiaries propose recycled water projects in House Bill 5302 (50.86 +0.17)California Water subsidiaries California Water Service and Hawaii Water Service have each proposed a recycled water project that is included in Rep. Jerry McNerney's (CA-09) new federal bill, the "Western Water Recycling and Drought Relief Act." Bill H.R. 5302, designed to strengthen the water infrastructure of California and Hawaii by adding a total of almost 20,000 acre-feet of new water supplies, includes 12 projects from utilities that are part of the Western Recycled Water Coalition; if the bill is enacted, it will offset the costs for the utilities to design, plan, and construct the facilities.Cal Water's King City District will be home to the City of King Recycled Water Project, which will provide Title 22-quality tertiary, non-potable, recycled water for agricultural and landscape irrigation, using treated wastewater from the city's wastewater treatment plant.

"We are very pleased with the new product label as it achieves our primary goal of removing unclear language pertaining to repeat administration, which we believe was potentially confusing to patients, physicians and payers alike...In addition, we are gratified by the inclusion of safety data from our repeat administration trial and the removal of the inappropriate comparator statement. We believe the updated label supports our goal of seeing ZILRETTA become the leading intra-articular therapy for managing OA knee pain."15:27SCANX Large cap notable movers of interest -- Shopify (SHOP) notches new all-time highs -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable large cap movers of interest ($10 bln - $200 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Large Cap GainersTME (12.07 +3.43%): Recovers higher after shedding as much as circa 5% over the course of the last five sessions.

With Christmas falling in the middle of the week, today's session was not expected to generate much excitement, and that is exactly what happened. Treasuries started the cash session near Tuesday's closing levels, climbing toward this week's highs during the initial minutes of the session. Mid-morning action saw a slip to lows, but Treasuries rallied to fresh highs as the trading day went on. The late push to highs was undisturbed by the completion of a soft $32 bln 7-yr note sale. The auction drew a high-yield of 1.853%, which tailed the when-issued yield by 0.9 bps. The bid-to-cover ratio (2.47x) was above average (2.43x) while indirect takedown (59.4%) was a bit below average (60.8%). The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.1% to 97.52. Yield Check: 2-yr: UNCH at 1.63% 3-yr: UNCH at 1.64% 5-yr: UNCH at 1.73% 10-yr: -1 bp to 1.91% 30-yr: UNCH at 2.34%News: Property names outperformed in China amid speculation that the Chinese government will scrap registration limits in smaller cities. Japan's Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, said he has high hopes for annual spring wage talks between unions and businesses. China, Iran, and Russia will hold joint naval drills in the Gulf of Oman between Friday and Monday. Japan's November Housing Starts fell 12.7% yr/yr (expected -8.1%; last -7.4%) while November Construction Orders decreased 1.2% yr/yr (last 6.4%). Singapore's November Industrial Production fell 9.4% m/m (expected 1.1%; last 3.0%), contracting 9.3% yr/yr (expected 0.8%; last 3.6%). $32 bln 7-year Treasury note auction results (prior 12-auction average): High yield: 1.853% (2.087%).Bid-to-cover: 2.47 (2.43).Indirect bid: 59.4% (60.8%).Direct bid: 23.4% (17.9%).Today's Data: Initial claims for the week ending December 21 decreased by 13,000 to 222,000, as expected. Continuing claims for the week ending December 14 decreased by 6,000 to 1.719 million. The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims have picked up some from the cyclical bottom but remain at a level that is still indicative of a tight labor market. The weekly MBA Mortgage Index fell 5.3% to follow last week's 5.0% decrease. The Purchase Index fell 4.8% while the Refinance Index fell 5.1%.

Alternatives to stand-alone prospects were deemed not compelling, and co has terminated all discussions regarding alternatives. Reports later indicated that certain suitors may still be interested in co. Resumed with an Underperform at BofA/Merrill. Drops to its lowest levels since early November. WW (37.36 -8.55%): Continued weakness sinks the stock to one-month lows; this action has been attributed to a cautious blog mention suggesting that a contract extension with Oprah Winfrey will not be sufficient to support the stock's recovery long-term. In other sector items, Tivity Health's (TVTY) Nutrisystem brand today announced the launch of the new Nutrisystem personal weight loss plans, and Tivity Health's South Beach Diet brand launched The New Keto-Friendly South Beach Diet program.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.2%, while the Russell 2000 is down 0.1%.It's been a modest advance on this day after Christmas, with investors waking up to positive holiday sales figures. For the period Nov. 1 through Dec. 24, retail sales, excluding autos, increased 3.4% yr/yr while online sales rose 18.8%, according to MasterCard Spending Pulse.Amazon (AMZN 1846.30, +57.44, +3.2%) reportedly said it had another record-breaking holiday season, and the positive reaction to the news is contributing to the outperformance of the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (+0.9%). UPS (UPS 118.96, +0.63, +0.5%), however, is expecting to process a record 1.9 million returns by Jan. 2.Mega-cap stocks like Apple (AAPL 288.21, +3.94, +1.4%), Facebook (FB 206.94, +1.81, +0.9%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 138.78, +1.20, +0.9%) provide further support for the broader market, while the S&P 500 health care (-0.2%), industrials (-0.2%), and materials (unch) sectors struggle to keep pace.Positive sentiment is carrying stocks higher in a lighter-volume day, but some profit taking appeared to knock the broader market from session highs after the Nasdaq hit the 9000 level. In this context, "knock" translates to about four points in the S&P 500.U.S. Treasuries are holding steady, with the benchmark 10-yr yield unchanged at 1.91%. WTI crude ($61.67/bbl, +0.56, +0.9%) and gold futures ($1514.00/ozt, +9.40, +0.6%) are both up, while the U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 97.54.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the weekly reports for jobless claims and mortgage applications.Initial claims for the week ending December 21 decreased by 13,000 to 222,000, as expected.

The intent-to-treat analysis of the cohort, which enrolled 115 patients, showed that 17 patients had a response and 62 patients had stable disease, for a 68.7% disease control rate. The confirmed ORR was 14.8%, and median duration of response was 7.4 months. The futility analysis has been concluded for Cohorts 2 and 3, which met their minimum threshold of responses to continue; read outs for those cohorts are expected in 2020.

It has been a slow, but steady, grind higher since the opening bell with most sectors registering modest gains. The energy (+0.7%), information technology (+0.5%), and consumer discretionary (+0.6%) sectors are leading the way.The real key, though, is that most of the market's most heavily-weighted stocks are trading higher. That would include the likes of Apple (AAPL 287.48, +3.21, +1.1%), Microsoft (MSFT 158.15, +0.77, +0.5%), Amazon.com (AMZN 1824.06, +34.85, +2.0%), Alphabet (GOOG 1349.56, +6.00, +0.5%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 138.58, +1.00, +0.7%), and Facebook (FB 207.08, +1.96, +1.0%) to name a few.Amazon is a stock in the news, as it reported having a record-breaking holiday season. On a related note, MasterCard Spending Pulse said retail sales, excluding autos, were up 3.4% year-over-year for November 1 through December 24.Overall, today's news has been limited, which isn't unusual for the day after Christmas when many market participants and non-participants alike remain on holiday.The stock market, therefore, is still riding on positive sentiment that has been sustained in the absence of any negative news shocks, a seeming promise from the Fed that it won't be raising rates anytime soon, and an easing of trade tension between the U.S and China.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.5%; the S&P 500 is up 0.3%; the Dow Jones industrial Average is up 0.2%; and the Russell 2000 is flat.10:46AWK American Water Works subsidiary Illinois American Water acquires Granite City wastewater collection system for $18 mln (122.29 +0.67)Illinois American Water, a subsidiary of American Water, has entered into an agreement with Granite City to acquire the City's wastewater collection assets. The agreement for the sale of the wastewater collection system, which serves 12,500 customer connections, is for $18 mln. The company expects to close the transaction in late 2020.10:43XLY Sector Briefing: Consumer Discretionary (125.04 +0.50)The consumer discretionary sector (+0.5%) is today's second-best performing group, trailing only the energy sector (+0.7%). The sector is now up 0.5% for the week versus a 0.4% week-to-date gain in the S&P 500.Today's outperformance is being driven by relative strength in a handful of retailers after Mastercard SpendingPulse reported that holiday retail sales grew 3.4% yr/yr while online sales surged 18.8% yr/yr. These growth rates are likely a bit more optimistic than what will be shown by final results, considering that UPS (UPS 118.77, +0.44, +0.4%) expects to process a record 1.9 mln returns on January 2. This would translate to yr/yr growth of 26.0%.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 45.79, +0.07, +0.2%) touched an eight-month high before narrowing its gain to 0.2%, which underscores the fact that only some retail stocks trade with big gains.Notable movers:Amazon (AMZN 1821.26, +32.05, +1.8%): leading sector component, returning to its 200-day moving average (1824.51) after record-breaking holiday sales. Ralph Lauren (RL 118.11, +0.46, +0.4%): set a fresh six-month high today. Under Armour (UA 19.45, +0.05, +0.2%): trading at its best level since the start of August. Marriot (MAR 152.28, +0.78, +0.5%): trading at a fresh record. CarMax (KMX 88.03, -0.83, -0.9%): weakest sector component, falling to its lowest level since early October after reporting mixed results last week.10:29OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:CRWD Weekly Dec27 50 calls are seeing interest with 2720 contracts trading vs. open int of 120, pushing implied vol up around 20 points to ~67%.

Markets in Australia and Hong Kong remained closed for holiday.

The total consideration represents $93.50 per share. The common stock consideration would be subject to downside protection, such that if the average market value of WCC stock prior to closing is between $46.23 per share and $57.79 per share, then the cash consideration paid at closing would be increased by up to $2.77 per share to ensure that the total consideration remains at $93.50 per Anixter share. The perpetual preferred stock is expected to have a fixed market rate of approximately 9.25% (representing a spread of 325 bps over the prevailing unsecured notes to be issued to enact the transaction), subject to reset and a five-year non-call feature, and will be listed on the NYSE.WCC says combination would generate greater than $200 mln of annual run-rate cost synergies.16:34WCC Wesco confirms FY sales to be above the midpoint of its outlook range of +1-3% (57.80 -0.79)Co announces strong preliminary sales for the quarter-to-date period for Q4.

The S&P 500 (+0.5%) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) also closed at new highs, thanks to some mega-cap leadership and a strong finish into the close. The Russell 2000 finished flat.Amazon's (AMZN 1868.77, +79.56) 4.5% gain stood out after the company said it had another record-breaking holiday season. A separate report from MasterCard SpendingPulse indicated that total retail sales, excluding autos, increased 3.4% yr/yr from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24 while online sales rose 18.8%.It was no surprise, then, to see the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (+1.4%) as today's sector leader. The communication services (+0.8%) and information technology (+0.7%) sectors followed suit amid solid gains in Apple (AAPL 289.91, +5.64, +2.0%), Alphabet (GOOG 1360.40, +16.84, +1.3%), and Facebook (FB 207.79, +2.67, +1.3%).Conversely, the health care (-0.1%), energy (unch), and consumer staples (+0.1%) sectors underperformed with little changes.Trading volume was relatively light on this day after Christmas, but that didn't detract from the positive sentiment in the market. The holiday sales results, after all, showcased the strength of the U.S. consumer, while reports that the U.S. and China are close to signing a Phase One trade deal kept investors at ease.A tight labor market, as indicated in the latest weekly jobless claims report, may also bode well for continued strength in the consumer. Specifically, initial claims for the week ending Dec. 21 decreased by 13,000 to 222,000, as expected.U.S. Treasuries held steady throughout the session. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.91%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 97.56.

With Christmas falling in the middle of the week, today's session was not expected to generate much excitement, and that is exactly what happened. Treasuries started the cash session near Tuesday's closing levels, climbing toward this week's highs during the initial minutes of the session. Mid-morning action saw a slip to lows, but Treasuries rallied to fresh highs as the trading day went on. The late push to highs was undisturbed by the completion of a soft $32 bln 7-yr note sale. The auction drew a high-yield of 1.853%, which tailed the when-issued yield by 0.9 bps. The bid-to-cover ratio (2.47x) was above average (2.43x) while indirect takedown (59.4%) was a bit below average (60.8%). The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.1% to 97.52.

Continuing claims for the week ending December 14 decreased by 6,000 to 1.719 million. The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims have picked up some from the cyclical bottom but remain at a level that is still indicative of a tight labor market.

Reports later indicated that certain suitors may still be interested in co. Resumed with an Underperform at BofA/Merrill. Drops to its lowest levels since early November.

It has been a slow, but steady, grind higher since the opening bell with most sectors registering modest gains. The energy (+0.7%), information technology (+0.5%), and consumer discretionary (+0.6%) sectors are leading the way.The real key, though, is that most of the market's most heavily-weighted stocks are trading higher. That would include the likes of Apple (AAPL 287.48, +3.21, +1.1%), Microsoft (MSFT 158.15, +0.77, +0.5%), Amazon.com (AMZN 1824.06, +34.85, +2.0%), Alphabet (GOOG 1349.56, +6.00, +0.5%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 138.58, +1.00, +0.7%), and Facebook (FB 207.08, +1.96, +1.0%) to name a few.Amazon is a stock in the news, as it reported having a record-breaking holiday season. On a related note, MasterCard Spending Pulse said retail sales, excluding autos, were up 3.4% year-over-year for November 1 through December 24.Overall, today's news has been limited, which isn't unusual for the day after Christmas when many market participants and non-participants alike remain on holiday.The stock market, therefore, is still riding on positive sentiment that has been sustained in the absence of any negative news shocks, a seeming promise from the Fed that it won't be raising rates anytime soon, and an easing of trade tension between the U.S and China.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.5%; the S&P 500 is up 0.3%; the Dow Jones industrial Average is up 0.2%; and the Russell 2000 is flat.10:46AWK American Water Works subsidiary Illinois American Water acquires Granite City wastewater collection system for $18 mln (122.29 +0.67)Illinois American Water, a subsidiary of American Water, has entered into an agreement with Granite City to acquire the City's wastewater collection assets. The agreement for the sale of the wastewater collection system, which serves 12,500 customer connections, is for $18 mln. The company expects to close the transaction in late 2020.10:43XLY Sector Briefing: Consumer Discretionary (125.04 +0.50)The consumer discretionary sector (+0.5%) is today's second-best performing group, trailing only the energy sector (+0.7%). The sector is now up 0.5% for the week versus a 0.4% week-to-date gain in the S&P 500.Today's outperformance is being driven by relative strength in a handful of retailers after Mastercard SpendingPulse reported that holiday retail sales grew 3.4% yr/yr while online sales surged 18.8% yr/yr. These growth rates are likely a bit more optimistic than what will be shown by final results, considering that UPS (UPS 118.77, +0.44, +0.4%) expects to process a record 1.9 mln returns on January 2. This would translate to yr/yr growth of 26.0%.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 45.79, +0.07, +0.2%) touched an eight-month high before narrowing its gain to 0.2%, which underscores the fact that only some retail stocks trade with big gains.Notable movers:Amazon (AMZN 1821.26, +32.05, +1.8%): leading sector component, returning to its 200-day moving average (1824.51) after record-breaking holiday sales. Ralph Lauren (RL 118.11, +0.46, +0.4%): set a fresh six-month high today. Under Armour (UA 19.45, +0.05, +0.2%): trading at its best level since the start of August. Marriot (MAR 152.28, +0.78, +0.5%): trading at a fresh record. CarMax (KMX 88.03, -0.83, -0.9%): weakest sector component, falling to its lowest level since early October after reporting mixed results last week.10:29OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:CRWD Weekly Dec27 50 calls are seeing interest with 2720 contracts trading vs. open int of 120, pushing implied vol up around 20 points to ~67%.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal.

The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.32.

Mylan gains in the face of a Bloomberg report that drugmakers have been in talks with the U.S. Department of Justice in an attempt to resolve a criminal antitrust probe of alleged price fixing.Conversely, Comcast (CMCSA 43.47, -1.33, -2.97%) sits at the bottom of the index despite a dearth of corporate news.14:00 ETDow +134.74 at 28010.27, Nasdaq +101.52 at 8621.4, S&P +18.64 at 3128.93[BRIEFING.COM] The Nasdaq Composite still sits atop the standings with two hours to go on Monday, +1.19%.Gold futures settled $6.60 lower (-0.5%) to $1,457.00/oz as the market digested positive trade developments out over the weekend.The U.S. Dollar Index sits under 0.1% higher to 98.34.13:30 ETDow +141.79 at 28017.32, Nasdaq +102.94 at 8622.82, S&P +19.79 at 3130.08[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages all sit near afternoon highs in recent trade with the Dow Jones Industrial Average holding the softest advance, up 0.51%.Some of the best performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average today include technology names like Intel (INTC 58.66, +1.05, +1.82%), Cisco Systems (CSCO 45.42, +0.57, +1.27%), and Apple (AAPL 265.01, +3.23, +1.23%). Tech, often a beneficiary of favorable trade sentiment with China, is perhaps benefiting from news out over the weekend that China may step up efforts to protect intellectual property rights and enforce stricter penalties against IP theft, a precursor to trade talk progression toward a Phase One deal.Conversely, McDonald's (MCD 191.80, -1.34, -0.69%) and Exxon Mobil (XOM 68.92, -0.45, -0.65%) continue to jostle for the bottom rung on the standings today.

The Russell 2000 (+1.9%) outperforms, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) trails the pack.The Chinese government released a document stating intentions to better deter IP theft by increasing the penalties on violations, according to Bloomberg. The news is taking precedent over a Reuters report that suggested a Phase Two deal is unlikely to be completed before the presidential election next year.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.1%), which tends to outperform when trade sentiment is positive, is the lone sector up more than 1.0% today. Leading the group higher are the semiconductor stocks, especially NVIDIA (NVDA 219.64, +8.75, +4.2%) after it was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.1%.Following suit are the health care (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.8%), and industrials (+0.6%) sectors. The utilities (-0.2%), energy (-0.1%), and consumer staples (unch) sectors are the lone holdouts.As for M&A activity, some of today's announcements have already been on the market's radar like Charles Schwab (SCHW 48.76, +0.56, +1.2%) agreeing to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.19, +3.06, +6.3%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreeing to acquire Tiffany & Co.

Both the U.S. and China continued to say over the weekend that a deal is near.The news is conflicting with a less-covered story from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal, whatever that may look like, may not be completed before the 2020 presidential election.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) edged above the S&P 500 (+0.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%), and Russell 2000 (+0.3%).The market heard from both President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, President Xi, on Friday. Mr. Xi called for mutual respect and equality in talks, but reiterated Beijing is willing to fight back if necessary. Mr. Trump said talks are moving along nicely and closing in on a deal, but the president suggested a deal should not be equal and should favor the U.S. instead.The takeaway was that the market still doesn't know for certain if a Phase One trade agreement will be signed this year, but talks are ongoing and appear to not be escalating. Separately, an upwardly revised reading in the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November was supportive for equities today.Leading the market in gains were the S&P 500 financials (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.7%), and industrials (+0.5%) sectors. The real estate (-0.5%) and energy (-0.4%) sectors were today's laggards.Nordstrom (JWN 37.95, +3.63, +10.6%) and Gap (GPS 16.94, +0.72, +4.4%) were among the biggest earnings-driven gainers in the consumer discretionary space, while an earnings-driven decline in Intuit (INTU 259.81, -11.34, -4.2%) put some pressure on the information technology sector (-0.1%).Elsewhere, the futuristic design of Tesla's (TSLA 333.04, -21.79, -6.1%) Cybertruck pickup was met with some confusion and mixed reviews. Ultimately, it appeared to be a sell-the-news case after the stock climbed about 40% in the past month.U.S. Treasuries ended the week on a flat note. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield was unchanged at 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.26. WTI crude declined 1.2%, or $0.70, to $57.88/bbl.Friday's economic data was limited to the revised reading for the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November:The final November reading for the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index checked in at 96.8 (Briefing.com consensus 94.9), which exceeded the preliminary estimate of 95.7 and the final October reading of 95.5. The November reading is in close proximity to the average level (97.0) since the start of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is the acknowledgment that consumers aren't anticipating sizable increases in inflation, unemployment, and interest rates, which suggests consumer spending activity should remain supportive for the U.S. economy.Investors will not receive any economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +28.4% YTDS&P 500 +24.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.5% YTDRussell 2000 +17.8% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1717/1152. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1778/1303.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: November 25, 2019End of Document

All Rights ReservedLength: 4559 wordsBody-- S&P 500, Nasdaq, Dow close at new highs-- Reported progress toward a Phase One trade agreement; China aims to increase penalties on IP theft -- Strength in the technology stocks-- Notable M&A activity across several sectorsStock market rallies to new records amid trade, M&A news - Nov 25 - 16:20 ET[BRIEFING.COM] U.S. stocks rallied on Monday to lift the S&P 500 (+0.8%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.3%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%) to new closing records, as investors reacted positively to Chinese efforts to better protect intellectual property rights. Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The  Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high. Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal. It should be noted that a separate report from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal before the 2020 election is unlikely to be reached did not have a noticeable effect on the market. The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.4%), which typically outperforms when the prevailing view on trade is positive, led all sectors in gains amid strength in the semiconductor stocks. NVIDIA (NVDA 221.21, +10.32, +4.9%) was a notable gainer after the stock was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.4%.The health care (+1.1%) and consumer discretionary (+0.9%) sectors also rose more than the S&P 500, while the utilities sector (-0.4%) was today's lone sector to finish in negative territory. Two of today's M&A deals were ones that were already on the market's radar: Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.31, +1.11, +2.3%) agreed to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.78, +3.65, +7.6%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction, and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreed to acquire Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.25, +7.74, +6.2%) for $16.2 billion in cash.New deals included Novartis (NVS 91.30, +0.82, +0.9%) agreeing to acquire The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.80, +15.25, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash and eBay (EBAY 35.85, +0.73, +2.1%) agreeing to sell StubHub to Viagogo for $4.05 billion in cash. Strikingly, U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note despite the risk sentiment displayed in the stock market.

Mr. Xi called for mutual respect and equality in talks, but reiterated Beijing is willing to fight back if necessary. Mr. Trump said talks are moving along nicely and closing in on a deal, but the president suggested a deal should not be equal and should favor the U.S. instead.The takeaway was that the market still doesn't know for certain if a Phase One trade agreement will be signed this year, but talks are ongoing and appear to not be escalating. Separately, an upwardly revised reading in the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November was supportive for equities today. Leading the market in gains were the S&P 500 financials (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.7%), and industrials (+0.5%) sectors. The real estate (-0.5%) and energy (-0.4%) sectors were today's laggards.Nordstrom (JWN 37.95, +3.63, +10.6%) and Gap (GPS 16.94, +0.72, +4.4%) were among the biggest earnings-driven gainers in the consumer discretionary space, while an earnings-driven decline in Intuit (INTU 259.81, -11.34, -4.2%) put some pressure on the information technology sector (-0.1%). Elsewhere, the futuristic design of Tesla's (TSLA 333.04, -21.79, -6.1%) Cybertruck pickup was met with some confusion and mixed reviews. Ultimately, it appeared to be a sell-the-news case after the stock climbed about 40% in the past month. U.S. Treasuries ended the week on a flat note. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield was unchanged at 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.26. WTI crude declined 1.2%, or $0.70, to $57.88/bbl.Friday's economic data was limited to the revised reading for the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November:• The final November reading for the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index checked in at 96.8 (Briefing.com consensus 94.9), which exceeded the preliminary estimate of 95.7 and the final October reading of 95.5. The November reading is in close proximity to the average level (97.0) since the start of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is the acknowledgment that consumers aren't anticipating sizable increases in inflation, unemployment, and interest rates, which suggests consumer spending activity should remain supportive for the U.S. economy.Investors will not receive any economic data on Monday.• Nasdaq Composite +28.4% YTD• S&P 500 +24.1% YTD• Dow Jones Industrial Average +19.5% YTD• Russell 2000 +17.8% YTDNASDAQ - 1778 - 1303 - 1.9 blnNYSE - 1717 - 1152 - 717.7 mlnDJ30 - +109.33 - 27875.53NASDAQ - +13.67 - 8519.88SP500 - +6.75 - 3110.29Load-Date: November 25, 2019End of Document

Well, another piece of Breaking News overnight that we've just learned, Carlos Ghosn is now on the run, the former Nissan chairman fleeing house arrest in Tokyo. He flew to Lebanon on a private jet. One of Ghosn's attorneys is slamming his behavior as inexcusable. We've got details on that story.Plus the U.S. and China, looking to ring in 2020 with a trade truce. White House Trade Advisor, Peter Navarro telling "Fox" that the Phase 1 agreement could be signed as early as this week."MORNINGS with MARIA" begins right now.CASONE: And taking a look at live pictures out of New Zealand, the new year already starting around the world. This is a live look at Auckland, New Zealand, one of the very, very first New Year's Eve celebrations that we're going to get throughout the hour on "MORNINGS with MARIA."We've got a big show this morning, joining the conversation, Michael Lee, Strategy Founder Michael Lee Is with us; Optimal Capital, Director of Capital and Market Analyst, Frances Newton Stacy is here; and RealClearPolitics Co-Founder and President, Tom Bevan. Happy New Year guys.TOM BEVAN, CO-FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, REALCLEARPOLITICS: Happy New Year.MICHAEL LEE, FOUNDER, STRATEGY: Happy New Year.FRANCES NEWTON STACY, DIRECTOR OF STRATEGY AND MARKET ANALYST, OPTIMAL CAPITAL: Happy New Year.CASONE: Mike, a lot to celebrate with these markets. I can't say it enough. We've had a phenomenal year.LEE: Yes. It's been really spectacular. And typically when a market moves this much in one year, people get a little bit hesitant but just some thoughts to stay positive in 2020. So in the summer of 2018, the market actually had you know, roughly 10 percent below here and we had a violent selloff going off into the end of 2018 so I think that spells well for 2020; this could really keep going.CASONE: Yes.LEE: And so it's been a really good decade for stocks so I think this tends to continue. There's a lot of wind in our sails.CASONE: Yes.Frances, a lot to watch obviously for you as well this year, it's been a block-buster year.NEWTON STACY: It's been a block-buster year and the thing is, is that I think was really important is the catalyst that have kept the market going, that they keep going, the China trade deal, we keep getting news on that front, and also the Fed keeps injecting money into the system which is very good for equities so.CASONE: Not sure if this is going to be the big year for politics or next year Tom. I think it's going to be 2020 though.BEVAN: Oh yes.CASONE: I'll just throw that out (ph).BEVAN: For sure.CASONE: If we get (ph)...BEVAN: We got -- we've got a little bit of politics happening this year, certainly the markets is good news...CASONE: Yes.BEVAN: ... for Donald Trump heading into reelection and also the Democrats still trying to figure out how to -- how to work against Trump, and run against an economy that remains resilient and strong.CASONE: There's a lot to celebrate if you're -- the Trump administration right now as far as these markets go and with these markets, it is our top story, the last trading day of the 2010s, we're rounding out the decade, the month, the -- everything, the year and investors are hoping that this Santa Claus Rally is going to extending the2020 with another round of records; we shall see.These are the decade numbers and I can't show you these enough, a hundred and seventy-two percent gain over the last 10 years for the Dow; the S&P up a hundred and eighty-eight percent; NASDAQ up 294 percent, so we're really ending the decade with a bang. And as you look at these numbers Mike, I think the bigger piece of this really has got to be the NASDAQ because you've got companies like Amazon, like Apple, Netflix, that have really powered through that Index.LEE: Yes. Well, what's wild is those -- you know -- those of us that are old enough to remember, the NASDAQ hit 5,000 in the year 2000 right and we didn't get back there until some sort of -- until 2013, 2014 so this bull market and the Techs you know, really own -- they started a few years ago and typically bull markets last for you know, 16-day and 19 years (ph) so there could be a lot more to come; obviously technologies a wave of the future, may be some different leaders will emerge that we don't really know about yet but again still positive on stocks going forward.CASONE: Yes.Frances we've got to look ahead now to 2020 and that's the big question is will there be a recession in 2020 after -- and it wouldn't be a shock to see something like that happen after a 10-year bull market but no one's talking about recession yet?NEWTON STACY: So it is. It's the largest bull market in history and that does sort of put additional risk into things. I mean the S&P has more than doubled now; the Dow is more than doubled; and the NASDAQ as we've been saying has more than tripled this year so we do have to watch for the catalyst that keeps that sustainable.We have a little bit of waning in earnings going on and we have to see if the China trade deal puts a little bit more certainty onto the table and capex spending goes back up and manufacturing recovers, that will say it's sustainable, if not then we look at a little bit of a deceleration but those are the things that I'm watching.CASONE: Well we want to get to this Breaking News that we just learned overnight about Carlos Ghosn, and this is a pretty dramatic development for the story. He's the former Nissan chairman. He's now fled Tokyo. He reportedly got on a private plane, flew to Lebanon. Ghosn was on house arrest after being charged with financial wrongdoing by Japanese officials more than a year ago.Now his attorney has said that he was surprised by the news and he's now slamming his behavior Tom, as inexcusable so the Tokyo authorities have his three passports so however he maneuvered himself out of Japan we don't know but this is pretty fascinating, what he's...BEVAN: It is a...CASONE: ... pulled off here.BEVAN: ... fascinating story and this is a story that Maria has been covering for a long time and spoken with the family and they obviously feel that he's been treated unfairly, that the Japanese system hasn't been fair to him so we'll see whether he seeks asylum there or how this is going to work out but...CASONE: Yes.BEVAN: ... you know, eventually he's going to have to -- he's going to have to face his charges.CASONE: So he has dual citizenship though?BEVAN: Right.CASONE: I mean he does have a citizenship in Lebanon. He actually has a home...BEVAN: Right.CASONE: ... and right now you've got cameras and reporters that are staked out at that home, they're waiting to see him. Where his wife is, we don't know, I'm assuming that she's with him -- it's -- it's a lot of question marks.But you know, the whole merger Mike, between Renault and Nissan from the beginning seemed to have kind of cultural pains and then when he got ousted a year ago, it was because they were worried that the French were going to try and take over Nissan so this is the dynamics of the story we should bring out here.LEE: Yes. The details that Maria has gotten into in her past interviews...CASONE: Yes.LEE: ... have been shocking. It's just not what you'd expect from a first-world country's justice system like Japan, basically known for their rule of law almost such so as the United States so this has just been an absolutely wild story from start to finish.CASONE: Yes. Well, obviously, we're a lot -- we're watching any developments on the Carlos Ghosn story.We also of course are watching U.S.-China trade. We've got these you know, comments now from Liu He, that he's going to be here in Washington and the reports are that they're going to sign this deal.Trade and Manufacturing Policy Director, Peter Navarro, actually spoke out yesterday about it on "Fox News."(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETER NAVARRO, TRADE AND MANUFACTURING POLICY DIRECTOR & TRADE ADVISOR, WHITE HOUSE: All we've been waiting for on the China deal is to translate the English version of the 86-page deal into the Chinese version. As soon as that is done, I -- there's reports that may be Liu He, the Chinese negotiator will come over and sign but it's -- that's -- that's a done deal; put that one in the bag.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Yes. Well, done deal, Frances? And that would certainly be good news from an economic perspective. It gives certainty to U.S. businesses.NEWTON STACY: Absolutely, so we've had deceleration in global growth going on for quite a while but the thing is, is that so much of it has been attributed to the trade deal essentially so then investors are thinking of the trade deal is finally handled and the first deal and we don't know all the details just yet about how skinny this deal possibly is. That puts more certainty in the marketplace and that certainly if there's liquidity available which the Fed has made liquidity available, then certainty is going to have investors getting into play. Whether they follow the deal you know, that's -- that remains to be seen.CASONE: That's -- that's a good point, that they -- there's got to be strict issues in place -- rules in place, and we know that they're going to the actual details of it right now, the technical side, that's what Steven Mnuchin said but the question is will the Chinese uphold their side of the bargain.BEVAN: Correct. And will they -- will they actually honor it and will they change their behavior which is what the Trump administration has been trying to get them to do.Back to 2020 though on the talk about the markets and the China deal.CASONE: Sure.BEVAN: What's -- what's important for Donald Trump politically, from the economy standpoint is that wages have gone up right, the market numbers are great but for the folks who are in the states that are going to decide this, the working-class voters and you know, the Rust Belt, the fact their wages have gone up, and the trade deal for farmers in a lot of these states will continue to provide political benefits for Trump.CASONE: Yes.Mike, you're shaking your head, yes?LEE: You know, just a touch on wages, if you look at median wages for people with less than a high school education right so kind of the bottom 5 or 10 percent of wage earners, those are up 20 percent since Trump got elected. The previous decade they were flat so that is a huge boon for a lot of these swing-state voters across the Rust Belt that were -- may be voted for Obama and switched to Trump so that's -- I don't see that stopping either.CASONE: I want to get all of your take really quick before we go on Hong Kong because it is New Year's Eve now in Hong Kong. We know that more protests are coming, and it has been -- it's been a really turbulent -- frankly horrible year for the folks there and these students that are -- there really fighting for their freedom.You've got Carrie Lam giving her New Year's address which is already given and she says that these demonstrations have brought sadness, anxiety, disappointment. She's vowing to take on these types of issues in 2020.Mike, I think the question is, does she stay and what happens to Hong Kong which up until this year had been the financial shining star for China?LEE: You know, I wonder if the Chinese government will let her leave. And the second part of that is, who would want to take that job right now.CASONE: That's a very good point.Frances, you're...NEWTON STACY: That's a great point.CASONE: ... agreeing.NEWTON STACY: You know, what I find so interesting, is that again the financial side of it is always about confidence but I find so interesting that now the police are sort of condoning these protests as long as they're peaceful, that is the tenet of democracy.CASONE: Maybe there's hope there for Hong Kong...NEWTON STACY: Yes.CASONE: ... after all. It was a democracy up until this year.NEWTON STACY: Yes.CASONE: But we are just getting started this morning folks. We've got a lot more coming up. We've got oil on the rise, hitting a three-month high despite tensions in the Middle East. We've got your 2020 outlook on oil coming up.Plus CARDS FOR CASH, how you can get more out of those Christmas gift cards, you don't plan on using because you know, you're not going to use them right.Plus showdown on New Year's Eve, Professional Fighting League, CEO Peter Murray, is here along with Randy "The Natural" Couture to talk the six million-dollar fight that is happening tonight, right here in New York City.Well coming up, Hanukkah hate-crime, chilling new details about the stabbing suspect and new charges leveled against him overnight.They can't stop vaping, well staffers at Juul's headquarters said to be puffing away in their offices, we're going to take a look.And it is New Year's Eve and we are celebrating a year of stellar markets. We're going to celebrate all morning long. We are well ahead of the folks in Times Square today.We'll be right back.CASONE: Well some Breaking News overnight. The U.S. Embassy in Iraq under attack. Lauren Simonetti has got the details. Lauren?LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR & FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTOR, "MORNINGS WITH MARIA": Hey Cheryl, pretty dramatic images.Iraqi militia supporters have apparently gotten inside the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad after breaking down the front gate and storming in. The U.S. Ambassador and embassy staff are reportedly evacuated.All this following deadly U.S. airstrikes earlier this week that killed 25 Iran-backed militants. Now those U.S. airstrikes were in retaliation for Friday's killing of an American contractor in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base.Well Uber and Postmates, filing a lawsuit in California to block the State's controversial freelancer law which is set to take effect tomorrow. The new law would force companies like Uber and Lyft to classify drivers as employees and increase their own labor costs by between 20 and 30 percent. It would also grant freelance employees protections including minimum wage, overtime, workers compensation, and unemployment insurance. The companies would also have to pay half of their payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare.Well Bitcoin has seen its share of volatility this year but it has been a rock-solid investment over the past decade. Bitcoin.com says the digital currency gained 8.9 million percent since the start of 2010. Bank of America says one -- a one-dollar investment in Bitcoin back in 2010 would now be worth $90,000, did we see that coming?CASONE: Well I mean, when Bitcoin launched, and it was 20 Grand, remember we all...SIMONETTI: I do.CASONE: ... talked about it on "Fox Business" saying, "Come on, really."SIMONETTI: But they've done this without sales people, without pitches, without advertising.CASONE: Yes.SIMONETTI: I mean if you bought it then.CASONE: I'd be (ph) -- I also too think, Mike, that there's other digital currencies. I mean, well look at Libra and Facebook, not that that's been a stellar performer but I think there could be more digital currencies come out. I don't think it's going to be called a coin though.LEE: You know, Bitcoin does have that first-mover advantage. It's been around the longest. There will be some competitors to it, there's competitors to it now. I think recently the price has come back and that has a lot more to do with certainty from the China trade deal and...CASONE: Yes.LEE: ... so you can see it's almost like a gold proxy for I don't know the millennial investor but it's -- it's -- as interest rates sell off and gold sells off a little bit and we get a little bit more certainty, the flight to safety that Bitcoin has kind of become in certain situations...CASONE: Yes.LEE: ... is -- it's getting that, a little bit of a correlation trade there.CASONE: Well it would be nice to see millennials stop investing in Bitcoin and get to the markets.Millennials have not participated in this -- in this rally. It's -- it's - - I'm so disappointed. Just putting that out there to the kids.NEWTON STACY: They're...CASONE: Sorry guys (ph).NEWTON STACY: ... so anti-establishment.Casone X you know, you know.All right, well we've got a lot more coming up folks.Passing the torch, Carrie Underwood is stepping down from her longtime role as the CMA host. We're going to explain why she made this big decision.Plus, the top movie on Netflix this year is a mystery.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you notice anything out of the ordinary?(CHORUS): The (inaudible).UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But we didn't do this.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Someone's trying to frame us.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We do things together, so can we please just figure this out.(SCREAMING)(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: We're going to take a look at Netflix's 10-year rally and how its content has evolved.CASONE: And welcome back.Well disturbing details about the man charged with federal hate-crimes in connection with the Monsey, New York, Hanukkah stabbing that happened over the weekend. Grafton Thomas is accused of entering a rabbi's home and stabbing five people with a machete during their Hanukkah celebration. He is said to have searched online for terms like "Why did Hitler hate the Jews," and the locations of Jewish temples. Thomas is facing five counts of attempted murder and one count of first-degree burglary at the state level in addition to federal charges.Joining me now, Attorney and former D.C. Homicide Detective and Fox News Contributor, Ted Williams. Ted, good morning.TED WILLIAMS, ATTORNEY AND FORMER D.C. HOMICIDE DETECTIVE AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning to you.CASONE: Could somebody like him have been stopped?WILLIAMS: I think that there were warning signs and I don't think that anybody actually paid attention to those warning signs. For instance he as you know, has been charged, meaning Thomas, with hate crimes, federal hate- crimes and what they were able to do is to look at his internet fingerprints and blueprints and they were able to show that he had information there on about hating Jews, very anti-Semitic writings; he had information on his cell phone. I think that there were signs but nobody caught them.CASONE: So you know, there's a lot of talk now about the proliferation of hate crimes, we really see the pickup not just against the Jewish community but also against it seems religion in general and I'm thinking specifically about this shooting at a -- at a church just outside of Fort Worth, Texas, that was also live streamed. Things like this are horrific. Do you think that there is a pattern and why do you think we're seeing more anti- religious sentiment in the country right now?WILLIAMS: Yes. The country is going through a metamorphosis here that is unexplainable to be very candid with you. When you look at the hate crime in New York here against the Jewish people. I can tell you that that -- it was a very targeted situation.The situation in Texas, I don't know how much we can say that it was targeted but I can say that -- thank God for that security guard that took that person out because he could've done a great deal more of damage.BEVAN: Ted, this is Tom Bevan. Back to...WILLIAMS: Hi Tom?BEVAN: ... Cheryl's original question, well the governor of New York has said he wants to try Grafton Thomas under the hate -- I'm sorry, domestic terrorism laws. Is there any evidence that hate-crime laws or if we charge them under another set of laws, that there's any deterrence effect there, would that stop someone like this from committing the crime in the first place?WILLIAMS: Tom, I wish I could tell you it would but unfortunately, I do not believe that it will. We've had hate crimes on the book for some time now and we've had these acts. As you know, within the last several weeks here, we've had 13 acts of terrorism or what I define as domestic terrorism, against the Jewish people. We had last week in Jersey City, where a Jewish supermarket was attacked and four people murdered. There's something that's going on, our social scientists are the ones who are going to have to give us that response Tom.CASONE: Well you know, I want to pick up on what Tom just asked you as well about what we're seeing here in New York. So you've got this new Bail Reform law that's going to go into effect tomorrow here in New York State. They are already setting suspect free in courts. We just saw this in Brooklyn with another hate crime, a woman was yelling at -- this young Jewish woman who was with her mother -- excuse me her child, and the "New York Post" is saying that now, individuals -- this is including individuals arrested, there's a string of anti-Semitic attacks in New York City.I mean your reaction of what New York plans to do which is frankly put them before a judge and then let them walk out the door.WILLIAMS: Well you -- you've just summed it up. The sad commentary is that these individuals can commit crimes that are misdemeanors and non- dangerous felony counts and that they can be let go back into the community without making bail. And as you said and you just represented it about -- on Saturday a woman was released and the judge said, "Hey, I'm going to release you because the New York Crime or Reform Act -- Bail Act, is coming into play; it's not in the play now but it will be in play at the beginning of the year, so I'm just going to go along and release you."It's like you can commit crime and get away with it, and that's a sad commentary of what is taking place.CASONE: It really is Ted. It is a sad commentary and we hope that things change in 2020, that's one wish for the new year anyway.Ted Williams thank you for getting up so early.WILLIAMS: My pleasure. And Happy New Year to all of you all.CASONE: Happy New Year.And France's really quick, that attack happening in Texas. You and I are both Texans, it was pretty upsetting...NEWTON STACY: Yes.CASONE: ... (inaudible).NEWTON STACY: No. It's very upsetting. And this country is going into a very interesting place in time and populism has a historical record of fracas and it has to do with the wealth gap. And I think that we also have to associate that with the crime.CASONE: The wealth gap and also the concealed carry issue which there's a lot of talk about now...NEWTON STACY: Yes.CASONE: ... down in the great...NEWTON STACY: That's true.CASONE: ... state of Texas.All right, we've got a lot more coming up folks.Can't stop vaping, get this, staffers at Juul's headquarters are said to be puffing away in their office. We're going to take a look.Plus, talk about over the top. Red Lobster's new Bloody Mary is not your average holiday cocktail. It's got a biscuit. It's got a clock. And there's some alcohol in it.CASONE: And welcome back. I'm Cheryl Casone, in for Maria Bartiromo. It is Tuesday. It is December 35th -- first -- New Year's Eve. I haven't -- I haven't had one drop of alcohol, I promise.It is 6:30 a.m. Eastern time. We are ending the year folks with a bang. Futures are pointing to gains on the last trading day of the decade. Right now the Dow is up 18; S&P is up 2 1/4; NASDAQ is up 4 3/4. Now the record run took a bit of a pause yesterday but look, you can just ignore these red arrows, well with the Dow closing down 183 because 2019 was a record year for the market; stocks gearing up for their best performance in six years.And then you've got sharp gains across the decade, which is also I mean something to really celebrate. Look at that, the NASDAQ up 294 percent in change for the decade, unbelievable, the bull run that we've had.Now let's take a look at Europe, lower across the board there. The DAX actually was closed for holiday in Germany but the FTSE and the CAC 40 ending out the year, slight losses but actually a positive month for Europe.And then Asia, closing the books on 2019, the NIKKEI and the KOSPI were closed. Chinese manufacturing activity actually expanded in December as you can see the Shanghai Composite, slight gain for the end of the year and they've actually had the best year there since 2014.Well, there is a sign now that the strikes in France may be coming to an end.Lauren Simonetti, maybe that's good year's -- new news for New Year's Eve.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it could be. These protests in France have crippled transportation services across the country. Now officials say that train and rail service is improving as crews slowly return to work. Workers have been off the job for almost a month now over French President Emmanuel Macron's pension reform plans. He's expected to talk about the situation tonight during his New Year's address for the nation.It is official, Hasbro has closed on its purchase of Canada's Entertainment One. It's a $3.8 billion all-cash deal. It units Entertainment One's Peppa Pig and PJ Masks' franchises with Hasbro's Transformers and My Little Pony. A lot of little kids buy those toys.Let's take a look at shares of Hasbro. A nice year. Up just about 30 percent.A major problem at Juul headquarters. Unbelievable. Workers using the product on the job and they just won't stop. The company unable to get its own employees to stop vaping in the office. That's forcing bosses to outline a series of punishments, including job termination. That according to a new report. The U.S. Surgeon General has warned vaping is dangerous to users and those nearby users. Vaping-related illnesses have killed 54 in the U.S. in the last year.So it's safer than smoking, Cheryl, but there's lots of chemicals and what happens when you inhale them?CASONE: Well, we've seen all these vaping deaths that we've been reporting on all year.SIMONETTI: Yes.CASONE: Lauren, thank you.And, you know what, Francis, I kind of couldn't believe this story when I first read it because of all companies, Juul, you're going to keep vaping in the office, really?FRANCES NEWTON STACY, DIRECTOR OF STRATEGY, OPTIMAL CAPITAL: Yes. I mean you really have to sort of take a pause when you have to discipline your employees for using your product. I mean that has to be the worst advertisement possible.But, yes, I think it -- I think vaping -- I -- probably the ultimate consequences are not even yet known. But it clearly is showing signs of being very dangerous and I hope that young kids take heed to that.CASONE: I -- I do too. I just -- it's so disturbing.Anyway, well, let's move on to the streaming wars hitting a fever pitch. Netflix announcing that its own content ruled the platform for 2019. "Murder Mystery," which starred Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler, took the top spot for the most popular 2000 release, coming in second place, the third season of "Stranger Things."Let's bring in to break this all down, tech analyst Pete Pachal.Pete, Happy New Year, by the way.PETE PACHAL, TECH ANALYST: Happy New Year to you. Thanks for having me.CASONE: What -- all right, so Netflix, an amazing run for the stock over the last decade, but they're spending a lot on content.PACHAL: They are spending a lot on content. And I honestly -- I -- it had a great decade. No question. I think the next decade is not going to be so good for them. I think their subscriber growth is going to ultimately slowdown in the coming years simply because consumers aren't spending more money on their entertainment. And with all these players coming in, particularly Disney Plus, which had a stiller rollout in the latter half of this year, it's -- it's -- there's going to be so much pressure on them to keep their subscribers going but it's not -- the only edge Netflix has now at this point I see is their international growth. They're ahead of the game there worldwide.CASONE: Which, Mike, we saw that with the earnings. They did come out with strong international subscribers, which seems to be kind of the saving grace right now.MICHAEL LEE, MICHAEL LEE STRATEGY: Yes, so I was talking with Pete about this. So Netflix has the first mover advantage, right? We've come a long way from getting your DVD's in the mail, right? So the world has changed in terms of how we get our entertainment delivered to us and Netflix has been on the forefront.But how much longer can that continue with all these other players coming in?PACHAL: I mean it can. I mean it -- they have the edge on international. So, here's the thing. Like traditional companies like Disney and NBC, I mean, they're used to these complicated rights issues to get their stuff distributed overseas. But Netflix, you think about it, with their originals, and Apple TV has this as well, like they -- the rights issues are non-existent. They just sort of start streaming wherever they want. So -- and on top of that, Netflix has actually really good content strategies in a lot of regions. So they're actually making content specifically for regions. So it's not just they're having this service available. So they have a big edge over the three plus years they've been aggressively marketing themselves overseas. But even that is going to start chipping away.I mean Disney Plus has a very strong rollout plan over the next two years to go international. They're in five countries already. They're probably going to be in just as many as Netflix in a few years. And Disney Plus, I mean, they have such a strong brand. I mean that's why their rollout was so successful. You get your family friendly entertainment, you get franchises like Star Wars, like the Marvel Universe. What you see is what you get with Disney. And most people see the $7 a month as a bargain.CASONE: Tom, do you guys have kids? Kids, right?STACY: No. No kids.CASONE: OK, do you have kids?TOM BEVAN, CO-FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, REALCLEARPOLITICS: Five.CASONE: Disney plus, yea or nay?BEVAN: Immediately.CASONE: OK.STACY: Immediately.BEVAN: Already watched "The Mandalorian." Yes.CASONE: There you go. All right. That's -- that's a good point.BEVAN: It has been a big hit.PACHAL: And that's -- that's some legit pop culture buzz they have even on top of that. Like the -- the extremely online, which is a key demographic for any streaming service, has been buzzing like crazy over Baby Yoda for like the past few weeks. It's -- it's a sensation.BEVAN: Pete --STACY: Do you think people will buy all of the streaming services or do you think that they'll be very selective based on content?PACHAL: I think they're going to be selective. I think they're going to subscribe to more simply because cheaper seems to be the way to go now. So you see this with Apple TV Plus, it's only $5. Disney Plus was about $7. I think we're also seeing that consumers want choice with regard to, can I subscribe and get ad free and save a little money and actually see something with ads. Hulu's been very good at -- about that and it looks like NBC's Peacock is going to go for the same sort of model. So I think you're going to see not an overall increase in spend, but you're going to see people subscribing at three, four, five when they probably were subscribing before to two, three or four.CASONE: Cutting that cable cord big-time, right, guys? We've talked about that so much.But I do want to go look at the stock. And we're looking at all these different stocks that have performed so well for the decade. Netflix is one of them. A 4,000 percent jump since the end of 2009, guys. That -- that gain at one point made Netflix a larger company than Disney. I had to throw that out, Pete, because you were just talking about Disney Plus. And I don't know that -- is it -- I think it might be too soon to kind of put the doubts on Netflix. And I say that because I think it's -- it's habit now. My parents, my stepfather's 80, he's addicted to Netflix. I mean I think that that -- that core consumer that knows and understands Netflix might stay with the platform.PACHAL: Well, like I was saying, brand counts for a lot. And I think Netflix's brand -- I mean it's almost like must see TV in a way in that you're just sort of used to paying that $12 a month or whatever it is and you have Netflix.The thing is, I mean, they've had a good decade, they've had a good run. I mean all credit to them. It's just that they've kind of figured out the model and they're stubbornly clinging to it.Another thing that's going to be a big deal over the next year or too is there's going to be a lot of pressure on subscriber only services, like Netflix, to introduce ads. You even see players like Roku, which has a very impressive ad platform, so that's -- so that minor streaming players can get on Roku devices and don't have to hire an extensive ad sales team and there's a big revenue sharing model. There's a lot of money to be made in ads in streaming services. So those that cling to just a subscriber model are really going to feel the pressure.CASONE: Francis, you're nodding your head. I think you're agreeing with a lot of what he's saying.STACY: Well, no, I -- well, I just wonder how much the pricing mechanism of Netflix, you know, they're going to try to hold out with their price, obviously, and how much that's going to hurt them or if people are just willing to pay it because it is like sort of the early-comer, you know, and people are used to it and it's just so engrained in their daily lives?PACHAL: Well, they've also developed these franchises like "Stranger Things." There's a lot of sort of original content on Netflix that they are -- that people will just subscribe to because they want it. But, I mean, again, they pioneered this model for over the top for streaming, but everyone is doing it now.CASONE: Right.PACHAL: You have Apple. You have Amazon. You -- you have Quibi, the short form video service that's coming out next year. There's going to be so much more on offer to compete for those every single dollar.CASONE: I want to add in HBO Max, Comcast, just to kind of -- you know, this is a very crowded field for 2020. So, you know, "Friends" officially, you know, broke off with Netflix. We know that. That was a big story obviously we covered right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA. That's actually at midnight tonight. And then HBO Max, obviously, is the story there. So, for 2020, predictions?PACHAL: Well, HBO Max, I think, it sort of goes against a lot of the trends I was just talking about in that it's more expensive, right? It's like $15 a month. And it stuffs everything Warner Media has under sort of the HBO umbrella. And I don't think that's good branding. HBO stands for premium. It stands for these pop culture defining shows like "Game of Thrones," like "Curb Your Enthusiasm." And by putting everything under the sun under that brand, I really -- I think the sheen is kind of going to wear off. And it's sort of this quantity over quality approach that makes sense from a business perspective in some ways but I think in the long term it hurts them.But my pick for 2020 as the service to watch is Quibi. Quibi is just fascinating to me. The pitch, you know, short form video for phones. I mean it's been around forever, right, since we've had phones.CASONE: Right.PACHAL: And it seems like it's destined to fail. But they're really putting Hollywood quality production values at scale, which we haven't really seen in like under 10-minute format before.CASONE: I thought I was cool just watching YouTube videos on my phone. I am so not cool.Pete, you are cool. Thank you very much.PACHAL: My pleasure.CASONE: Pete Pachal.Happy New Year.PACHAL: Happy New Year too.CASONE: All right, we've got a lot more coming up, folks.Passing the torch. Carrie Underwood stepping down from her long-time role as CMA host. We're going to explain what went into that decision.Plus, countdown to 2020. We are ringing in the new year and taking a look at a decade of markets. The celebration in Times Square said to be the safest place to be all year. And there's your live picture of Times Square.CASONE: With this year and the decade coming to a close, here is a look back on the year in business in 2019.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR: As the ball comes down for 2019, tensions flair right to the end as Washington, Wall Street and main street become more intertwined than ever before.REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): I solemnly and sadly open the debate on the impeachment of the president of the United States.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Another record run on Wall Street.STEPHEN MOORE: Blockbuster job's number.BARTIROMO: It was a year of political fights, stock market hits and celebrity misses.The year started with a government shutdown and a delayed presidential State of the Union. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was a thorn in President Trump's side throughout the year and capped the year off by impeaching him, calling a phone call with the leader of Ukraine an abuse of power, making President Trump one of only three presidents in U.S. history to be impeached.REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY): The House Committee on the Judiciary is introducing two articles of impeachment.DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It doesn't really feel like we're being impeached.BARTIROMO: But amid the fights with Congress, trade was Trump's priority in 2019 as he pushed for better deals with China, Mexico and Canada. The trade war with China got ugly this year.TRUMP: It's a phenomenal deal.BARTIROMO: But by the time it was all said and done, he had a phase one deal that was cheer by the business and financial community.LARRY KUDLOW: If they do not abide by the rules and the commitments, then there will be a snapback on tariffs among other things.BARTIROMO: And the day after he was impeached, the Democratic-led House finally passed a new version of NAFTA known as USMCA.A less successful fight for the president, his push for border wall funding.Meanwhile, China had a different battle on its hands besides the one with the president. Millions of protestors in the business mecca of Hong Kong taking to the streets to push back on China's authoritarian rule.2019 was a troubling year for aircraft maker Boeing. Its new 737 Max suffering two fatal crashes. By year end, the company had halted production of the mammoth jet, sending ripples through the industry and the economy.Meanwhile, President Trump was busy on the international front, stepping into North Korea during a meeting with Kim Jong-un, calling on NATO partners to pay up for their national security and supporting Brexit for the U.K. That fight saw Boris Johnson winning a stunning election victory, all but assuring Brexit will happen in 2020.Back in Washington, Department of Justice inspector general delivering a damning report of the FBI's behavior and actions while investigating the Trump campaign in the election year. Attorney General Bill Barr said a criminal investigation by U.S. Attorney John Durham would be even more comprehensive.On the West Coast, celebrities and other elites exposed in a college admission's bribery scheme. Some already doing prison time for it, others still fighting the charges.And there was cheering this year on Wall Street and on main street. Unemployment near record lows, while wages are up. The consumer fueling economic growth and a stock market that churned out record after record, putting the major averages in unchartered territories, even as the president's impeachment loomed.Now the focus turns to 2020, with an impeachment trial expected in the Senate in January, more trade deals seen with the EU, the U.K., and India and another presidential election coming this November.(END VIDEOTAPE)CASONE: Of course that was Maria Bartiromo.Happy New Year to you, Maria, if you're watching.All right, Mike Lee, what was your favorite moment of 2019?LEE: Beyond the fantastic performance of the S&P 500, I have to say it's the U.K. elections and the conservative, overwhelming victory there. Brexit, if you remember, got the most amount of votes of any other popular election in the history of the United Kingdom. So to finally see that follow through after all the forces tried to stop it shows us that democracy is alive and well in the world.CASONE: That's a good one.STACY: That's a great point.CASONE: All right, I have a feeling today is your favorite day, no?STACY: Today's my favorite day.CASONE: And it is because it's your birthday.STACY: Yes.CASONE: Happy birthday!STACY: It's my birthday. I'm happy to turn 25 again every year.CASONE: You look great.STACY: Thank you.But, no, just being here for New Year's is just amazing. There's no place I'd rather be on my birthday, actually.CASONE: Oh, thanks for celebrating it with us and our viewers. We appreciate you here.CASONE: Thank you.CASONE: All right, Tom, 2019, favorite moment?BEVAN: Well, favorite moment, if -- personally favorite moment. See, I follow politics, day in and day out, and it's been a -- it's been an exciting year, it's been a very news worthy year. But my favorite moment of 2019 is actually a sports moment.CASONE: OK.BEVAN: It's Tiger Woods winning the Masters. It's a great run.CASONE: Yes.STACY: Yes.CASONE: That's a good one.BEVAN: And -- and it was so exciting and -- for everybody really. It was a story that moved beyond sports.CASONE: He -- you know, he really -- everybody loves a comeback story.BEVAN: Everybody loves a --CASONE: And that's, I think, why we so celebrate it because he was so down for so many years.BEVAN: Yes.CASONE: So, my favorite moment of the year was the ending of "Game of Thrones" because I'm so sick of doing that story. I never watched the show. And I had to read all these stories of "Game of Thrones." I'm just never going watch it, ever. (INAUDIBLE).STACY: I'm with -- I'm with you. I've never seen it.BEVAN: That's a (INAUDIBLE).STACY: It's crazy, but I've never seen it.CASONE: I know. No, I mean, trust me, like, if I had to do one more "Game of Thrones" story this year I was going to lose it. So -- and, watch, they're going to add one before the end of the show, because that's what they'll do.All right, coming up, a reason to cry over spilled milk. Organic Valley faces a steep fine. We're going to tell you about that.Plus, who does not love a good nap?(VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: We are going to tell you which day is the sleepiest of the year. We've got more stories making buzz this morningCASONE: Look at the decade in stocks. Unbelievable.Well, Carrie Underwood making a buzz this morning, hanging up her microphone at the Country Music Awards. The singer announced on Instagram that she's stepping away from her hosting duties after a dozen years. The "American Idol" winner says that she's incredibly grateful to everyone at the CMA's but says it is time to pass the torch. Underwood shared hosting duties with fellow country music star Brad Paisley for 11 of the 12 years. This year he stepped aside for country music icons Dolly Parton, Reba McIntyre.I don't know, Francis, I mean I -- I do love Carrie Underwood but I'm curious to see where the show goes, because with all the women on the stage this year, it was pretty spectacular.STACY: Pretty spectacular. I'm a huge country music fan. And I love it and, I don't know, I've always watched her in that role and I've always enjoyed her and the outfit changes. She pulls off all of it. And so it's going to be interesting to see how it changes going forward.But I think country music is on the rise in general, so people just get used to the new way things are.CASONE: Yes, no, I'm a big fan of hers as well.STACY: Yes.CASONE: So we'll see what happens with the CMA's.Also, a big fan of New Year's. I'm a big fan of lobster. Red Lobster spicing things up for the new year. The chain's new bloody Mary is not a simple cocktail. It's got chipotle barbeque seasoning. It's got a chilled Maine lobster claw and giant shrimp and one of the Red Lobster's famous cheddar bay biscuits. The specialty drink is being subbed a drink-a-tizer for its snackable (ph) add-on. The savory brew arrives in time to celebrate National Bloody Mary Day, which, guess what, Mike Lee, is tomorrow.STACY: Shocker.LEE: Yes, I'm just going to say, a hard pass on this drink.CASONE: No? No (INAUDIBLE)?LEE: Hard pass. Bottomless mimosa type guy for me.CASONE: Actually (INAUDIBLE).STACY: No, but you've got your carbs to absorb your alcohol. It's like an efficiency thing.CASONE: Yes.LEE: I'll just have a burger with my brunch. I'm going to give this guy a miss (ph).CASONE: When I was in Wisconsin earlier this year, I -- they were serving - - I didn't have one -- bloody Mary's and they had like a burger on top and some sausage.LEE: Oh.STACY: Oh, man.CASONE: I know, right? Is it -- sounds gross. OK.Last buzzy (ph) story.Pillows most likely are working overtime on Wednesday, as in tomorrow. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine says that New Year's Day is the sleepiest day of the year. Fifty-seven percent of people asked say they feel to most tired on January 1st compare to every other day of the year. It could be because, obviously, we're staying out late the night before or the entire holiday season is finally catching up with us. Either way, odds are, keeping your eyes open New Year's Day going to be rougher than staying awake on the first day back to work. The Academy recommends at least seven hours of shut-eye every single night. You may not, Tom, get that tonight, but that's what they're recommending for you today.BEVAN: WE were talking about -- certainly I would have guessed maybe Thanksgiving, because everyone, you know, that's a -- that's a classic take a nap day. But, clearly, you know, people will be staying up late and having bloody Mary's and all of that and -- which will lead to a lot of sleeping tomorrow.CASONE: Yes, well, (INAUDIBLE).STACY: Any time the markets are closed.CASONE: Yes.STACY: I'm like, yes, I can sleep in --CASONE: It's true.STACY: On the West Coast, right? The stock market opens at 6:30.CASONE: That is a very good point.LEE: No sleep with three little kids for me. So, we'll see.CASONE: That's right. You do you have the brood and they're small.BEVAN: No naps?LEE: No naps.CASONE: Yes.Well, I will say this, that, you know, for New Year's Day, I mean, obviously, on this -- on this morning show schedule, a lot of us aren't going to be awake in New Year's, but are you guys going to make the effort to stay alive tonight and ring in the New Year?STACY: I have to, it's my birthday. I mean --CASONE: It is your birthday. Happy birthday, OK?BEVAN: One of the benefits of being on Central Time is at 11:00 we see the ball drop and then we're off to bed.CASONE: All right. Mike Lee will already be in bed. Sorry (ph).LEE: Yes. No chance I'll be awake.CASONE: All right, well, let's stay with is New Year's Eve them because still ahead we've got the countdown to 2020. We are ringing in the New Year. We're going to take a look at a decade of markets and we are celebrating that.Also, you've got the celebration in Times Square, said to be the safest place to be all year. Live pictures of Times Square right now.Another hour of MORNINGS WITH MARIA coming up.CASONE: Good morning. I'm Cheryl Casone, in for Maria Bartiromo.It is Tuesday, December 31st. It is New Year's Eve.And your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time.We are closing the year on a high note. Futures searching for gains on this last trading day of the decade but still it has been an incredible year and a record run for the markets.Now, we did take a little bit of a pause yesterday with the Dow closing down by 183. But, again, it has been a bull market run for 10 years. And it was a strong year for the markets, by the way. Stocks are gearing up now for their best performance in six years. That's 2019 versus six years ago. As you can see, the Nasdaq for the decade gained 294 percent. The tech heavy index, an incredible story there.

Tax, financing and low-priced exemptions: China's gigantic economic aid to HuaweiCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 26, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 380 wordsBodyThe Chinese government helped drive Huawei's global growth by the fact that the Chinese technology flag would have obtained up to $75 billion in tax, financing and low-priced exemptions, according to information released by this Wednesday The Wall Streey Journal.The billions of dollars in financial aid from the Chinese government would have helped propel Huawei Technologies' rise to the top of global telecommunications.According to a Review by the Journal of grants, credit facilities, tax exemptions and other forms of financial aid, Huawei had access to up to $75 billion in state support as it grew from being a little-known provider of phone switches to the world's largest telecommunications equipment company, with generous funding deadlines and price reductions compared to rivals of up to 30%.While financial support for businesses or industries is common in many countries, China's support to Huawei, including tax exemptions that began 25 years ago, is among a number of factors that raise questions about Huawei's relationship with Chinese state."While Huawei has business interests, those interests are strongly supported by the state," Michael Wessel, a member of a U.S. Congressional panel reviewing U.S.-China relations, said to a report softened his trade war.The United States has expressed concern that Huawei's technology teams may pose a security risk, should Beijing request network data from the company, although Huawei says it would never deliver that data to the government.Most of this aid, about $46 billion, comes from loans, lines of credit, and other aid from state lenders. It also saved up to 25 billion in taxes between 2008 and 2018 due to state incentives to promote the technology sector. In addition, it enjoyed 1.6 billion in grants and 2 billion in land rebates.Huawei says it received "small and non-material" grants to support the investigation, which was not unusual; and that much of the support, such as tax exemptions for the technology sector, were also available to others.For its investigation, the journal made use of available public records, including company statements and property registration documents.Entry Tax, financing and low-priced resources: China's gigantic economic aid to Huawei was first published in The Third.Load-Date: January 27, 2020End of Document

Toure against Ozil's public rebuke of China's crackdownAssociated Press InternationalDecember 18, 2019 Wednesday 1:32 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 418 wordsByline: By ROB HARRIS, AP Global Soccer WriterDateline: DOHA, Qatar BodyDOHA, Qatar (AP) - Arsenal forward Mesut Ozil should not have spoken out to denounce human rights in China, former Barcelona and Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure said on Tuesday, fresh from a brief stint playing in the country.Toure said that discussing the mass detention on Uighurs and others is "complicated" because he and Ozil are both Muslim, but took a different approach to the Arsenal midfielder over whether athletes should use their platforms to discuss political issues."Footballers have to stay with football and politicians to politics because you cannot be involved with this kind of things because it's going to attract a lot of problems and a lot of things," Toure said in an interview with The Associated Press. "As a Muslim it is complicated and it is his choice. He's been doing his comments but I think he was wrong to say that."Ozil's criticism last week of Beijing's crackdown on Muslims in Xinjiang led to Arsenal's match being pulled from Chinese television. The Chinese government accused Ozil of being "blinded and misled" before protesting about mass detentions and the closure of mosques in the northwest region.One politician who did weigh in to support Ozil was U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo."China's Communist Party propaganda outlets can censor (Ozil) and Arsenal's games all season long, but the truth will prevail," Pompeo wrote on his U.S. government Twitter account on Tuesday. "The CCP can't hide its gross#HumanRightsviolations perpetrated against Uighurs and other religious faiths from the world."Toure, a former Ivory Coast international, has just completed five months playing at Chinese second-tier club Qingdao Huanghai. Toure's comments on Ozil echo the stance of Arsenal, which said it "adheres to the principle of not being involved in politics.""I always love football," Toure said during a trip to Qatar with FIFA for the Club World Cup, "and that's why sometimes I don't want to be political."Secret documents reported by the AP last month showed the Chinese government used mass surveillance and an integrated computing system to target pious Muslims and Uighurs who travelled abroad for detention in internment camps. China has been accused of detaining more than 1 million Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang and subjecting them to torture, beatings and food deprivation. The documents showed they were forced to learn Mandarin and Communist ideology.___ More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and            https://twitter.com/AP_SportsLoad-Date: December 18, 2019End of Document

Continue reading China makes it a criminal offense to publish deepfakes or fake news without disclosureImage: TheGoncas2 / YouTubeChina has released a new government policy designed to prevent the spread of fake news and misleading videos created using artificial intelligence, otherwise known as deepfakes. The new rule, reported earlier today byReuters, bans the publishing of false information or deepfakes online without proper disclosure that the post in question was created with AI or VR technology. Failure to disclose this is now a criminal offense, the Chinese government says.The rules go into effect on January 1st, 2020, and will be enforced by the Cyberspace Administration of China.  With the adoption of new technologies, such as deepfake, in online video and audio industries, there have been risks in using such content to disrupt social order and violate people's interests, creating political risks and bringing a negative impact to national security and social stability,  the CAC said in a notice to online video hosting websites on Friday, according to theSouth China Morning Post.China's stance is a broad one, and it appears the Chinese government is reserving the right to prosecute both users and image and video hosting services for failing to abide by the rules. But it does mirror similar legislation introduced in the US that is designed to combat deepfakes.China's policy is broad, but it mirrors similar legislation in the USLast month, California became the first US state to criminalize the use of deepfakes in political campaign promotion and advertising. The law, called AB 730 and signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, makes it a crime to publish audio, imagery, or video that gives a false, damaging impression of a politician's words or actions. California's law does not use the word deepfake, but it's clear the AI-manufactured fakes are the primary culprit, along with videos misleadingly edited to frame someone in a negative light.California's approach does exclude news media, as well as parody and satire, with the sole aim for now being to prevent the potential damage that deepfake attack ads could cause when used in the run-up to an election. The law applies to candidates within 60 days of an election and it's designed to expire by 2023 unless explicitly reenacted.Congress is also in the process of analyzing the potential harm of deepfakes and how best to combat their influence in the upcoming 2020 presidential election. The House Intelligence Committee held a hearing on the subject after convening a panel of experts from universities and think tanks to come up with a deepfake strategy with regard to election integrity and security. There are also numerous pieces of legislation moving through Congress at the moment that would require special watermarks over or disclosures around fake or misleading media, as well as criminalization of the creation and distribution of such video.On the US platform side, Facebook and Twitter are in the process of creating better tools for detecting deepfakes and helping reduce the spread of those videos and imagery across the respective platforms. Twitter this month said it was drafting deepfake policy after a number of high-profile incidents, including a misleadingly edited video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi going viral, that have highlighted how vulnerable the company's platform is to misinformation of this variety.Facebook, which also faced criticism for failing to stop the spread of the Pelosi video, has begun developing technology to detect deepfakes, but it notably has refused to remove such videos in line with its policy on speech. Similarly, Facebook has come under fire for allowing politicians to knowingly lie in advertisements, opening up the future possibility of deepfake political ads in the absence of federal legislation. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said his company does not want to regulate speech on the platform. Twitter took the opposite stance and announced an outright ban on all political advertising last month.Tags:See Campaign:https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/29/20988363/china-deepfakes-ban-internet-rules-fake-news-disclosure-virtual-realityContact Information:Nick StattTags:,           Artificial Intelligence Newswire,           Wire,           United States,           EnglishLoad-Date: December 13, 2019End of Document

These restrictions may be lifted by the court if it appears to infringe on his legitimate business ventures, The Post added. The Millennial heir is commonly referred to as "China's most eligible bachelor" and often flaunts his wealth by throwing            lavish star-studded parties, and buying expensive tech gadgets ⁠-            including eight iPhones ⁠- for his dog, Coco. According to The Daily Mail, Wang's court order may be in accordance with the country's strict social credit system, the country's massive ranking system, which monitors the behavior if its 1.4 billion citizens. People can be rewarded or punished based on their social scores, and can be banned from activities like            taking trains, flying, or staying in luxury hotels.Offenses that could impact            social credit ratings include failing to pay a fine, jaywalking, loitering, or even            not picking up after your dog. The country is working to            combine its 170+ million security cameras with artificial intelligence and facial recognition technology to create a vast surveillance state in order to keep tabs on citizen's activities. The system will be fully operational by 2020, but it has already been trialed in several cities across China. According to The Daily Mail, Wang has yet to be completely discredited by the system, but could face detention should he go against the order.The social credit system has already punished millions of people with low rankings, barring them from buying plane tickets or taking trains last year, according to Associated Press. • Read more:• China has started ranking citizens with a creepy 'social credit' system - here's what you can do wrong, and the embarrassing, demeaning ways they can punish you• Chinese dog owners are being assigned a social credit score to keep them in check - and it seems to be working• These are the things that can get you punished under China's creepy 'social credit' system - from fake news to jaywalkingNOW WATCH: Watch Google reveal the new Nest Mini, which is an updated Home MiniSee Also:• China is barring gamers under 18 from playing video games after 10 p.m., a move meant to curb a growing addiction• Employees of TikTok in the US were reportedly pressured to censor 'culturally problematic' content that might offend the Chinese government• Apple and TikTok skipped a Senate hearing on Big Tech and China, and empty seats show lawmakers aren't pleasedLoad-Date: November 12, 2019End of Document

Huawei is suing the FCC, which is trying to block it from providing equipment to rural AmericaBusiness Insider USDecember 5, 2019 Thursday 07:19 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 479 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Isobel Asher Hamilton)Highlight: The FCC last month cut Huawei off from a $8.5 billion pot of government subsidies designed to help rural communities buy telecoms equipment.BodyREUTERS/Aly Song• Last month the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) cut Huawei off from a $8.5 billion pot of government subsidies designed to help rural communities buy telecoms equipment.• The FCC said it was blocking US companies from using subsidy money to buy Huawei kit, claiming the company represents a national security threat.• Huawei announced a legal challenge against the FCC on Thursday, calling the decision "unlawful."• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.Huawei is once again locking horns with the US government.The Chinese tech giant announced at a press conference on Thursday that it has filed a lawsuit against the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for blocking rural US communities from using subsidies to buy Huawei telecoms equipment.That's after FCC chairman Ajit Pai announced in October he would block US companies from dipping into the $8.5 billion Universal Service Fund (USF) to purchase from companies that pose a "national security threat." The order was            voted through on November 22.The US government has repeatedly accused Huawei of posing a national security threat by acting as a conduit for the Chinese government to spy. Huawei denies the allegations, and its CEO Ren Zhengfei has said he would rather shut down the company than allow it become a vehicle for espionage.In a statement sent to Business Insider, Huawei called the order unlawful."Banning a company like Huawei, just because we started in China - this does not solve cyber security challenges," said Huawei's chief legal officer Song Liuping. "The FCC should not shut down joint efforts to connect rural communities in the US," he added.Huawei's chief counsel for the legal challenge, Glen Nager, said that the FCC had exceeded its remit in designating Huawei a national security threat, saying the Commission has "no national security expertise or authority."The FCC was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Business Insider. However on its website, the agency states that cybersecurity and homeland security does fall into its remit.It's not the first time this year Huawei has taken the US government to court. It sued the US for banning government officials from using Huawei equipment in March, and Bloomberg reported in June that the company had            filed a suit against the Department of Commerce for seizing equipment.NOW WATCH: 8 weird robots NASA wants to send to spaceSee Also:• This map shows how the US really has 11 separate 'nations' with entirely different cultures• Huawei's big rival to the iPhone 11 reportedly doesn't contain any American parts thanks to the US-China trade war• Huawei's CEO said his arrested daughter should be proud to be a bargaining chip in the US-China trade warSEE ALSO: Huawei's CEO said his arrested daughter should be proud to be a bargaining chip in the US-China trade warLoad-Date: December 5, 2019End of Document

With Christmas falling in the middle of the week, today's session was not expected to generate much excitement, and that is exactly what happened. Treasuries started the cash session near Tuesday's closing levels, climbing toward this week's highs during the initial minutes of the session. Mid-morning action saw a slip to lows, but Treasuries rallied to fresh highs as the trading day went on. The late push to highs was undisturbed by the completion of a soft $32 bln 7-yr note sale. The auction drew a high-yield of 1.853%, which tailed the when-issued yield by 0.9 bps. The bid-to-cover ratio (2.47x) was above average (2.43x) while indirect takedown (59.4%) was a bit below average (60.8%). The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.1% to 97.52. Yield Check: 2-yr: UNCH at 1.63% 3-yr: UNCH at 1.64% 5-yr: UNCH at 1.73% 10-yr: -1 bp to 1.91% 30-yr: UNCH at 2.34%News: Property names outperformed in China amid speculation that the Chinese government will scrap registration limits in smaller cities. Japan's Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, said he has high hopes for annual spring wage talks between unions and businesses. China, Iran, and Russia will hold joint naval drills in the Gulf of Oman between Friday and Monday. Japan's November Housing Starts fell 12.7% yr/yr (expected -8.1%; last -7.4%) while November Construction Orders decreased 1.2% yr/yr (last 6.4%). Singapore's November Industrial Production fell 9.4% m/m (expected 1.1%; last 3.0%), contracting 9.3% yr/yr (expected 0.8%; last 3.6%). $32 bln 7-year Treasury note auction results (prior 12-auction average): High yield: 1.853% (2.087%).Bid-to-cover: 2.47 (2.43).Indirect bid: 59.4% (60.8%).Direct bid: 23.4% (17.9%).Today's Data: Initial claims for the week ending December 21 decreased by 13,000 to 222,000, as expected. Continuing claims for the week ending December 14 decreased by 6,000 to 1.719 million. The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims have picked up some from the cyclical bottom but remain at a level that is still indicative of a tight labor market. The weekly MBA Mortgage Index fell 5.3% to follow last week's 5.0% decrease. The Purchase Index fell 4.8% while the Refinance Index fell 5.1%.

Alternatives to stand-alone prospects were deemed not compelling, and co has terminated all discussions regarding alternatives. Reports later indicated that certain suitors may still be interested in co. Resumed with an Underperform at BofA/Merrill. Drops to its lowest levels since early November. WW (37.36 -8.55%): Continued weakness sinks the stock to one-month lows; this action has been attributed to a cautious blog mention suggesting that a contract extension with Oprah Winfrey will not be sufficient to support the stock's recovery long-term. In other sector items, Tivity Health's (TVTY) Nutrisystem brand today announced the launch of the new Nutrisystem personal weight loss plans, and Tivity Health's South Beach Diet brand launched The New Keto-Friendly South Beach Diet program.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.2%, while the Russell 2000 is down 0.1%.It's been a modest advance on this day after Christmas, with investors waking up to positive holiday sales figures. For the period Nov. 1 through Dec. 24, retail sales, excluding autos, increased 3.4% yr/yr while online sales rose 18.8%, according to MasterCard Spending Pulse.Amazon (AMZN 1846.30, +57.44, +3.2%) reportedly said it had another record-breaking holiday season, and the positive reaction to the news is contributing to the outperformance of the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (+0.9%).

In this context, "knock" translates to about four points in the S&P 500.U.S. Treasuries are holding steady, with the benchmark 10-yr yield unchanged at 1.91%. WTI crude ($61.67/bbl, +0.56, +0.9%) and gold futures ($1514.00/ozt, +9.40, +0.6%) are both up, while the U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 97.54.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the weekly reports for jobless claims and mortgage applications.Initial claims for the week ending December 21 decreased by 13,000 to 222,000, as expected.

The intent-to-treat analysis of the cohort, which enrolled 115 patients, showed that 17 patients had a response and 62 patients had stable disease, for a 68.7% disease control rate. The confirmed ORR was 14.8%, and median duration of response was 7.4 months. The futility analysis has been concluded for Cohorts 2 and 3, which met their minimum threshold of responses to continue; read outs for those cohorts are expected in 2020.

It has been a slow, but steady, grind higher since the opening bell with most sectors registering modest gains. The energy (+0.7%), information technology (+0.5%), and consumer discretionary (+0.6%) sectors are leading the way.The real key, though, is that most of the market's most heavily-weighted stocks are trading higher. That would include the likes of Apple (AAPL 287.48, +3.21, +1.1%), Microsoft (MSFT 158.15, +0.77, +0.5%), Amazon.com (AMZN 1824.06, +34.85, +2.0%), Alphabet (GOOG 1349.56, +6.00, +0.5%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 138.58, +1.00, +0.7%), and Facebook (FB 207.08, +1.96, +1.0%) to name a few.Amazon is a stock in the news, as it reported having a record-breaking holiday season. On a related note, MasterCard Spending Pulse said retail sales, excluding autos, were up 3.4% year-over-year for November 1 through December 24.Overall, today's news has been limited, which isn't unusual for the day after Christmas when many market participants and non-participants alike remain on holiday.The stock market, therefore, is still riding on positive sentiment that has been sustained in the absence of any negative news shocks, a seeming promise from the Fed that it won't be raising rates anytime soon, and an easing of trade tension between the U.S and China.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.5%; the S&P 500 is up 0.3%; the Dow Jones industrial Average is up 0.2%; and the Russell 2000 is flat.10:46AWK American Water Works subsidiary Illinois American Water acquires Granite City wastewater collection system for $18 mln (122.29 +0.67)Illinois American Water, a subsidiary of American Water, has entered into an agreement with Granite City to acquire the City's wastewater collection assets. The agreement for the sale of the wastewater collection system, which serves 12,500 customer connections, is for $18 mln. The company expects to close the transaction in late 2020.10:43XLY Sector Briefing: Consumer Discretionary (125.04 +0.50)The consumer discretionary sector (+0.5%) is today's second-best performing group, trailing only the energy sector (+0.7%). The sector is now up 0.5% for the week versus a 0.4% week-to-date gain in the S&P 500.Today's outperformance is being driven by relative strength in a handful of retailers after Mastercard SpendingPulse reported that holiday retail sales grew 3.4% yr/yr while online sales surged 18.8% yr/yr. These growth rates are likely a bit more optimistic than what will be shown by final results, considering that UPS (UPS 118.77, +0.44, +0.4%) expects to process a record 1.9 mln returns on January 2. This would translate to yr/yr growth of 26.0%.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 45.79, +0.07, +0.2%) touched an eight-month high before narrowing its gain to 0.2%, which underscores the fact that only some retail stocks trade with big gains.Notable movers:Amazon (AMZN 1821.26, +32.05, +1.8%): leading sector component, returning to its 200-day moving average (1824.51) after record-breaking holiday sales. Ralph Lauren (RL 118.11, +0.46, +0.4%): set a fresh six-month high today. Under Armour (UA 19.45, +0.05, +0.2%): trading at its best level since the start of August. Marriot (MAR 152.28, +0.78, +0.5%): trading at a fresh record. CarMax (KMX 88.03, -0.83, -0.9%): weakest sector component, falling to its lowest level since early October after reporting mixed results last week.10:29OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:CRWD Weekly Dec27 50 calls are seeing interest with 2720 contracts trading vs. open int of 120, pushing implied vol up around 20 points to ~67%.

In 2018, The Chinese government raided and shut down churches ahead of Christmas and detained pastors and members caught celebrating. From reports of labor camps in the country to growing surveillance through technology, China is increasingly cracking down on freedom. This is all laid out in a new book, titled Deceiving the Sky: Inside Communist China's Drive for Global Supremacy. The author, Bill Gertz, joins us on Acton Line to discuss. He's a national security columnist for the Washington Times and senior editor of the Washington Free Beacon.Check out additional resources for this episode:Buy: Deceiving the Sky: Inside Communist China's drive for global supremacyChina Closes Megachurches Before ChristmasChinese City Bans Christmas Displays Amid Religious CrackdownChristian family details crackdown on church in ChinaWatch: Bill Gertz on China and US National SecurityLoad-Date: December 24, 2019End of Document

Wenger says Ozil must 'accept consequences' of China criticismStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeDecember 19, 2019 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: SPORTS; Pg. 1Length: 501 wordsByline: Sidney GuerreroBodyChina's Foreign Ministry says Arsenal's Mesut Ozil was "completely deceived by fake news and false statements" when the midfielder criticised the country's policy toward its Muslim Uighur minority.The Chinese foreign ministry said today that Arsenal football player Mesut Ozil's "judgment was influenced by untruthful remarks" after the former German World Cup victor said that Muslims were persecuted in China's Xinjiang province & criticised Muslim countries for failing to speak up."But it seems he has been deceived by fake news, and that his judgment was influenced by untruthful remarks", he said.The Chinese Football Association added that his social media posts were "unacceptable"."We have serious concerns about the human rights situation in Xinjiang and have raised these regularly with the Chinese government and at the United Nations", a government spokesperson said, referring to the western region of China home to the Uighurs.The Gunners playmaker has found himself at the centre of diplomatic controversy following comments he made online in December, which prompted a number of responses, from both within China and outside the country.The saga involving Mesut Ozil and the country of China continues to roll on, with the Arsenal man now having been removed from the Chinese versions of popular football video game franchises FIFA and Pro Evolution Soccer.NCLAT strips Tata Sons off private company statusThe NCLAT, however, stayed the operation of the order with respect to reinstatement for four weeks to allow Tatas to appeal. He has an elder brother - Shapoor Mistry and one of his sisters is married to Noel Tata, Ratan Tata's half-brother.In a statement to Euronews, Arsenal reiterated their stance, saying they are "always apolitical as an organisation"."The German player Ozil posted an extreme statement about China on social media", it said in a statement.China is the Premier League's most lucrative overseas broadcast market.Amid ongoing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey voiced support for the demonstrators October 7 on Twitter prompting Beijing's state-controlled media outlets to launch salvos against Morey, the Rockets and the National Basketball Association . There are fears China is engaging in gross violations of human rights including the murder of these people. This move is also insidious on China's part."It appears many are being sent to factories no freer than the camps, in some cases located on the campgrounds or adjacent to them", wrote the board, accompanied with a photo of a protest outside the Chinese Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. Muslim schools are being banned ...Over 1 million Uighur Muslims and other ethnic minorities have reportedly been detained in high-security camps in Xinjiang."First of all Mesut Ozil has freedom of speech like everyone else and he uses his notoriety to express his opinions, what is not necessarily shared by everybody but he has the right to do that", the Frenchman added.Load-Date: December 19, 2019End of Document

The findings were presented today at the 61st American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting & Exposition, held in Orlando from December 7--10, 2019.14:48NVS Novartis AG Kymriah demonstrates consistent efficacy and safety outcomes in US patients when used in real-world setting (92.60 +0.53)Efficacy in DLBCL confirmed results seen in the pivotal trial despite treatment of a broader population, including older and more heavily pretreated patients.Fewer known CAR-T cell therapy adverse events for patients with DLBCL, specifically rates of high-grade cytokine release syndrome (4%) and neurologic events (5%), were observed compared with the pivotal clinical trials.In children and young adults with ALL, efficacy outcomes were similar and safety outcomes appear to be more favorable compared to the pivotal trial.14:48GMDA Gamida Cell announces updated results from Phase 1 clinical study of GDA-201 (4.75 -0.35)The co announced updated results from a Phase 1 clinical study of GDA-201, an investigational, natural killer (NK) cell-based cancer immunotherapy for the treatment of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM), at the 61st Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH), which is being held December 7--10 in Orlando, FL. Data from 22 patients in the ongoing study showed GDA-201 in combination with monoclonal antibodies was generally well tolerated and demonstrated early evidence of clinical activity in heavily pre-treated patients, including five complete responses observed among nine patients with NHL. Gamida Cell plans to initiate a Phase 1/2 multi-dose, multi-center study of GDA-201 in patients with NHL in 2020.14:46GILD Gilead Sciences announces primary results from ZUMA-2 -- 93% of patients treated with Investigational KTE-X19 achieved response, including 67% with a complete response (67.30 +0.22)The co announced primary results from ZUMA-2, a global, multicenter, single-arm, open-label Phase 2 study of KTE-X19, an investigational CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, in adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). After a single infusion of KTE-X19, the best objective response via independent radiologic central review (n=60 evaluable for efficacy analysis) was 93 percent, with 67 percent of patients having achieved a complete response. These findings were presented today at the 61st American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting & Exposition, in Orlando from December 7--10, 2019.With a median follow-up of 12.3 months (range: 7.0 to 32.3 months) at the time of data cutoff, 57 percent of patients remained in an ongoing response. Of the first 28 patients treated (minimum follow-up of 24 months), 43 percent were alive and remained in continued remission without additional therapy. The 12-month estimates of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 61 percent and 83 percent, respectively. Median duration of response, PFS and OS were not yet reached. Among the 68 patients evaluable for safety, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events were observed in 91 percent and 63 percent of patients, respectively. Grade 3 or higher CRS and neurologic events were seen in 15 percent and 31 percent of patients, respectively. No Grade 5 CRS or neurologic events occurred.14:42TALKX Market Briefing: Buyers a reluctant bunchThere has been a steady deterioration in the major indices since about 10:15 a.m. ET. The downward trend hasn't been sparked by any specific news catalyst; rather, it is largely a case of absent buyers today, which is making it easier to pressure prices lower.Their reluctance to push things further is understandable given how far things have been pushed already and given that the world is on the cusp of learning if the U.S. is going to implement a tariff on a $160 billion tranche of imported Chinese goods on December 15.Should that tariff be implemented, it is thought that the stock market would not react well. Accordingly, given how far the market has come, the near-term risk-reward dynamic is seen as being skewed to the risk side of things at the moment. Strikingly, the CBOE Volatility Index is up 11.7% to 15.21.Apple (AAPL 267.28, -3.43, -1.3%), which was up 20.9% since the end of September, is an influential laggard today.The consumer staples (+0.2%), consumer discretionary (+0.2% 0, and rel estate (+0.1%) sectors are the only sectors trading higher. The major indices are all down between 0.2-0.3%.14:33COMDX Energy Settlement PricesFeb Crude Oil futures fell $0.06 (-0.1%) to $59.04/barrel Jan Natural Gas $0.12 lower (-5.31%) at $2.21/MMBtu Jan RBOB Gasoline settled $0.01 higher (0.46%) at $1.6549/gallon Jan Heating oil futures settled $0.01 lower (-0.39%) at $1.9445/gallon14:27SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- PG&E (PCG) gains following wildfire settlement agreement -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersBNTX (28.99 +18.96%): The October IPO extends to new all-time highs on higher than average volume amid an active session for the biotech sector, which today digests a bevy of clinical updates and several premium acquisitions, including those of ArQule (ARQL) and Synthorx (THOR), which are active in the oncology space.PCG (11.25 +16.61%): Reached a settlement to resolve individual claims connected to losses from the 2015 Butte Fire, the 2017 Northern California Wildfires, and the 2018 Camp Fire valued at approx. $13.5 bln, resolving all claims arising from those fires; the settlement is to be implemented pursuant to co's Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization. Co, "with all major wildfire claims now on a path to be resolved and the total amount of wildfire liabilities determined," will now amend and finalize that plan. At two-month highs.AM (5.15 +14.8%): Announced that it will repurchase $100 mln of shares from Antero Resources (AR). Additionally, co and AR have agreed to a growth incentive fee program. Due to additional optimization of the midstream infrastructure buildout, co is now targeting a 2020 capital program of approx. $300-325 mln, a 22% reduction vs the previous target. Co targets net debt to adj. EBITDA in the mid-to-high 3-times range in 2020.Mid Cap LosersKOS (5.24 -13.25%): The stock, trading with above 3x average volume, sank to eleven-month lows early in the session, though it has since moderated those losses. In sector news, shares of Tullow Oil (TUWLF) plummeted overseas after that company, among other updates, including the announcement of the departures of its CEO and its Exploration Director, reset its forward-looking guidance, now forecasting 2020 Group production to average between 70,000-80,000 bpd, and noted that production performance has been significantly below expectations at the TEN and Jubilee fields in Ghana. Co is also active in Ghana and is a partner in production at the TEN and Jubilee fields. BPMC (71.18 -9.3%): Announced initial data from the Phase 2 PIONEER trial of avapritinib in patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis; initial data from the dose-finding Part 1 of the trial showed "rapid and robust reductions in serum tryptase" in patients treated with 25, 50, or 100 mg of avapritinib once daily. All doses of avapritinib tested were well-tolerated; there was one Grade 3 cognitive effect reported in the 100 mg cohort, and the event was resolved following dose modification. Co announced top-line results from the EXPLORER trial; among other results, top-line efficacy data as of a data cutoff of August 30 showed a centrally confirmed ORR of 77% in 48 patients evaluable for response. Top-line safety results were generally consistent with previously reported data. After the data cutoff, one patient with SM and an associated hematologic neoplasm of myelodysplastic syndrome had a Grade 5 intracranial bleed. PGNY (27.81 -8.79%): Continued volatility.14:23MDB MongoDB will report third quarter results this afternoon (131.32 +0.15)MongoDB (MDB) will report fiscal 2020 third quarter (October) results this afternoon, and management will host a call at 17:00.MongoDB is the leading non-relational (or NoSQL) database platform that is heralded by developers. The next-generation database company's freemium "land and expand" business model has led to explosive growth.The company has beaten estimates and guided revenue above consensus in each of its first eight quarterly reports as a public company since its IPO in October 2017.Management guided for a third quarter adjusted net loss of $0.29-0.27/share with revenue up 52% to $98-100.Revenue growth is expected to slow to 24% in the fourth quarter given increasingly difficult comparisons after revenue grew 85% in the fourth quarter last year. MongoDB has guided for a fiscal 2020 adjusted net loss of $1.11-1.06/share with revenue up ~48% to $390-395 mln.Last quarter, revenue grew 67% while total customers grew ~6% sequentially and 103% yr/yr to over 15,000. MongoDB Atlas, the company's managed cloud database-as-a-service offering, grew customers 7% sequentially and 149% yr/yr to over 13,200. Atlas revenue was up over 240% yr/yr and represented 37% of total revenue for the quarter, which does weigh on gross margins.The stock fell in response to earnings despite strong results as the 20x forward revenue multiple seemed to have already priced in the company's strong position.The $7.3 bln valuation now represents ~17x forward revenue estimates. The stock has consolidated for the last six months and is currently attempting to hold the 50-DMA.14:09SUMRX Earnings Out This Afternoon/Tomorrow MorningThis Afternoon: CDMO CASY CHWY ROAD MDB PHR SFIX TOL MTNTomorrow Morning: AZO CMD CONN DBI HDS14:00SCANX Large cap notable movers of interest -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable large cap movers of interest ($10 bln - $200 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Large Cap GainersZM (66.33 +5.72%): Shares display relative strength as they bounce back from last week's 16% slide. FCX (12.22 +4.98%): Price target increased at UBS from $12 to $14.50; Buy rating maintained. CVNA (89.44 +3.49%): Shares see modest recovery from last week's 9% pullback; part of outperformance may be attributable to positive weekend mention by Motley Fool contributor.Large Cap LosersIFF (133.35 -6.12%): Lagging after Bloomberg reported that the company is mulling a potential bid for a $25 bln DuPont (DD) unit. DDOG (34.62 -3.61%): Disclosed in a regulatory filing that 20% of shares subject to lock-up agreements will become eligible for sale in the public market at the open of trading on December 10 after their price condition was satisfied. OXY (37.51 -1.87%): Shares see extension of prolonged weakness, falling to fresh multi-year lows; hearing JP Morgan out this morning reiterating Underweight rating.13:42CHWY Chewy Earnings Preview- Can CHWY break its string of EPS misses? (24.27 -0.67)Chewy (CHWY) is set to report Q3 earnings tonight after the close with a conference call set for 5pmET.Current Capital IQ consensus stands at a loss of ($0.13) per share on revenues of $1.20 bln.GuidanceQ3 revenues in the range of $1.19-1.21 bln.2020 revenues in the range of $4,75-4.80 bln. 2020 EBITDA Margin improvement in the range of 420-450 bps.The StoryShares of CHWY fell to post-IPO lows following the release of Q2 results. CHWY outpaced revenue expectations as revenue growth was 43% (49% in autoship). The issue was the shortfall on the bottom line as it missed EPS consensus for the second straight quarter. Higher than expected SG&A costs in Q2 were one of the reasons why the stock sold off post Q2 results. Some of the increase was driven by non-recurring items like fulfillment center build outs and public company costs. Operating Expenses increased 55% yr/yr compared to the 43% top line growth. CHWY was able to improve gross margins by 300 bps, EBITDA margins increased 410 bps yr/yr. However this only led to a small increase to the low end of its EBITDA outlook.The good news is investor expectations around earnings has been dampened which leaves upside surprise potential for this evening. Two pedestrian quarters with bottom line misses and a cautious note from Cleveland Research saying sales were tracking 'softer' than expected has reigned in the outlook. The company's float stands at 44 mln shares and 32% of this is short interest which leaves it susceptible to a squeeze. Trader's need to be aware that the lock up expiration looms on December 11. Parent company PetSmart owns approx 67% of the shares with hedge funds owning approx 20%. Shares of CHWY opened at $36 on June 14 but have been on a downward trend since opening up for trade. Shares hit a post-IPO low of $21.68 on November 11. Since then it has been able to recover approx 10% to rally into its 50-sma ($24.36) ahead of tonight's print. CHWY will need to surprise to the upside, particularly on its cost management side, in order to shake out some of the shorts. But that lock up expiration lingers, similat to what we saw at Crowdsrike (CRWD) which will make it tough to squeeze.Q2 RecapReported Q2 (Jul) loss of $0.21 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.11 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.10). Revenues rose 43.1% year/year to $1.15 bln vs the $1.13 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Gross margin of 23.6 percent expanded 300 basis points year-over-year and in line with expectations. Net loss of $82.9 million, including a non-cash share-based compensation charge of $43.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA(1) loss of $29.2 million improved 45 percent year-over-year.Adjusted EBITDA margin of (2.5) percent expanded 410 basis points year-over-year and in line with expectations.13:39COMDX Metals Settlement PricesFeb gold settled today's session down $0.20 (0.01%) at $1464.9/oz Mar silver settled today's session $0.04 higher (0.24%) at $16.65/oz Mar copper settled $0.03 higher (1.01%) at $2.7575/lb13:15OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:CLF Dec 9 calls are seeing interest with the underlying stock up 5% following positive mention in Barrons (volume: 36.7K, open int: 1570, implied vol: ~55%, prev day implied vol: 44%).

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is unchanged.December 15 is fast approaching, and the market is hoping that the U.S. and China can reach a deal to possibly delay the tariffs scheduled to hit that day. Scattered throughout this week will be policy decisions from the Fed and ECB, as well as reports on consumer inflation and retail sales for November.In the meantime, it's been tough for the market to gain any traction amid the losses in Apple (AAPL 265.26, -5.44, -2.0%) and the S&P 500 health care sector (-0.5%). Conversely, the S&P 500 communication services (+0.3%) and consumer discretionary (+0.3%) sectors have provided some support.M&A activity seen some huge premiums, especially in the biotech space. ArQule (ARQL 19.70, +10.04, +103.4%) will be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for about $2.7 billion. Synthorx (THOR 67.66, +42.63, +170.3%) will be acquired by French company Sanofi (SNY 45.35, -0.68, -1.5%) for about $2.4 billion. Both are cash deals.Elsewhere, Texas Capital (TCBI 62.92, +5.03, +8.9%) and Independent Bank Group (IBTX 61.01, +1.75, +3.0%) have agreed to a $5.5 billion all-stock merger of equals.Separately, shares of Macy's (M 15.58, +0.43, +2.8%) have defied a downgrade to Sell at Goldman Sachs. Qorvo (QRVO 109.40, +2.78, +2.6%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.86, +2.53, +2.5%) were "double" upgraded to Buy from Underperform at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Overall losses are very modest, but there has been a noticeable increase in hedging interest and an uptick in defensive positioning. The CBOE Volatility Index is up 9.4% to 14.90, while the benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.82%.Investors did not receive any notable economic data.12:55SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ARQL (51.13 mln +103.83%), ACB (25.3 mln +4.94%), DHR (15.9 mln -0.26%), DPLO (14.31 mln -32.01%), CGC (13.75 mln +13.62%)Materials: FCX (18.84 mln +4.39%)Industrials: GE (13.66 mln -0.81%)Consumer Discretionary: M (23.44 mln +2.77%), NIO (22.42 mln -3.54%), F (11.26 mln -0.03%)Information Technology: AAPL (16.52 mln -1.96%), AMD (16.34 mln -1.01%)Financials: BAC (14.35 mln -0.5%), ITUB (12.41 mln +2.09%)Energy: CHK (37.97 mln +3.16%), KOS (14.66 mln -13.41%), SWN (12.99 mln -0.49%), AR (12.22 mln +25.11%)Utilities: PCG (28.32 mln +17.2%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: THOR (29.66x +170.22%), ARQL (21.4x +103.83%), FATE (8.02x +41.99%), DPLO (7.89x -32.01%), ABEO (6.19x +0.85%), TGTX (3.91x +25.37%), RCKT (3.43x -1.27%), PDLI (2.93x +22.03%), DHR (2.72x -0.26%), SGMO (2.54x -8.32%), BLUE (2.29x -5.29%)Industrials: DY (2.16x -5.63%)Consumer Discretionary: BIG (2.57x +5.51%)Information Technology: LPL (2.34x +10.75%)Financials: IBTX (7.6x +3.8%), TCBI (4.63x +9.29%), AB (2.93x -2.02%), USIG (2.43x +0.14%)Energy: KOS (2.41x -13.41%), KLXE (2.33x +13.56%)12:55SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (70) outpacing new lows (13) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: A, ACEL, ACN, ADUS, ALLE, ANSS, ARQL, ARVN, AVP, BBIO, BBY, BHC, BOLD, BRMK, BXMT, CARE, CASY, CBRE, CDAY, CIM, CMC, CODI, COF, CZZ, DAR, DCPH, DEA, DEI, DKS, DOCU, DTIL, EIDX, EPZM, FMC, FTSV, GBT, GCO, GL, GMRE, GOOGL, INFO, INSG, INSP, INSW, KDMN, KRYS, LAMR, LPG, LULU, MCO, MPW, NKE, OSK, QRVO, RCKT, RS, RYI, SPXC, SSW, STWD, SWKS, TBBK, THC, THOR, TNK, VCTR, VICI, VRTX, WWD, XBITStocks that traded to 52 week lows: AGX, BNFT, CERS, GCI, MNRL, NVEE, OSTK, OXY, PBT, S, SIGA, SYRS, TRXCThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: POWLETFs that traded to 52 week highs: EWK, EWN, FAN, IBB, IYK, JO, OEF, PALL, PBD, QAI, SEA, XBIETFs that traded to 52 week lows: UNG12:54SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: THOR (67.64 +170.22%), ARQL (19.7 +103.83%), FATE (19.41 +41.99%), TGTX (8.93 +25.37%), PDLI (3.6 +22.03%), DERM (9.01 +14.34%), DVAX (6.49 +13.86%), CGC (21.19 +13.62%), NKTR (23.07 +12.81%), ITCI (11.23 +10.1%)Consumer Discretionary: HOME (6.23 +9.88%)Information Technology: LPL (6.9 +10.75%)Energy: AR (2.74 +25.11%), AM (5.3 +18.14%), KLXE (6.28 +13.56%), ALTM (2.25 +10.05%), SDRL (1.29 +9.32%)Utilities: PCG (11.31 +17.2%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: DPLO (3.95 -32.01%), TVTY (19.9 -12.1%), TBIO (9.1 -8.91%), ATNX (16.26 -8.39%), SGMO (10.69 -8.32%), BPMC (72.09 -8.14%), GBT (74.15 -6.55%), CRSP (68.33 -5.58%), ATRS (4.62 -5.52%), BLUE (75.22 -5.29%), ACAD (48.71 -5.23%)Materials: IFF (134.39 -5.39%)Industrials: DY (48.07 -5.63%)Consumer Discretionary: GTX (10.25 -11.71%), MCFT (15.18 -5.36%)Information Technology: SMAR (42.07 -5.8%)Financials: JT (1.46 -5.81%)Energy: KOS (5.23 -13.41%), CCJ (9.21 -5.78%)Consumer Staples: DF (0.06 -7.89%)12:54SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Synthorx (THOR) soars upon premium acquisition agreement -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersTHOR (67.55 +169.88%): To be acquired by Sanofi (SNY) for a premium $68/share in cash, representing an aggregate equity value of approx. $2.5 bln, as Sanofi seeks to enhance its position in oncology and in immuno-oncology through the addition of co's THOR-707, said to have potential to become the best-in-class IL-2 therapeutic for the treatment of solid tumors, and co's other earlier-stage cytokine programs to its pipeline. At all-time highs. ARQL (19.7 +103.83%): To be acquired by Merck (MRK) for a premium $20/share in cash, representing an approximate total equity value of approx. $2.7 bln; Merck sees co's assets strengthening Merck's pipeline, most notably co's ARQ 531, which Merck names as "a compelling candidate for the treatment of B-cell malignancies." Co also today announced final Phase 1 clinical results for ARQ 531 in patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies; ARQ 531 reportedly demonstrated substantial anti-tumor activity and a manageable safety profile, and the data set "confirms the potential utility of ARQ 531 for the treatment of [...] heavily pretreated CLL patients," according to co's management. At multi-year highs. FTSV (26.48 +83.38%): Presented updated magrolimab clinical data in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. In higher-risk MDS, the ORR was 92%, including a complete response rate of 50%, while in untreated AML, the ORR was 64%, among other data. Co, with FDA guidance, has developed a protocol that will allow it "two distinct opportunities to achieve an accelerated approval" while remaining on-track to file an initial BLA in Q4 of 2021. Also announced preclinical proof-of-concept data for its novel all antibody conditioning regimen, comprised of FSI-174 and magrolimab, for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Reaches new all-time highs.Small Cap LosersDTIL (10.21 -48.07%): After spiking to record highs early in the session, the stock now gives up the majority of a substantial run higher that it had netted since mid-November. The volatility follows co's announcement of updated interim clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1 trial of PBCAR0191, its lead investigational allogeneic CAR T cell therapy candidate. Of nine patients treated with PBCAR0191, seven had objective evidence of tumor shrinkage at any timepoint. In the R/R non-Hodgkin lymphoma cohort, four of six patients achieved an objective response at day 28+, including three partial responses (two patients treated at Dose Level 1 and one at DL2) and one complete response (treated at DL2); the remaining two NHL patients achieved early responses at day 14 -- both patients had evidence of disease progression at day 28. In the B-ALL cohort treated at DL2, one of three patients achieved a complete response at day 28+; the remaining two patients did not respond at day 28. The trial is ongoing; treatment of patients at a third dose level recently commenced.DPLO (3.95 -32.1%): Agreed to be acquired by UnitedHealth's (UNH) OptumRx for $4.00/share through a cash tender offer, following a careful review of strategic options by co's Board of Directors. The stock had established new record lows below $3 in mid-November following co's issuance of Q3 results, at which time co's pursuit of a comprehensive strategic alternatives process remained ongoing; by Friday's close, the stock had improved by circa +139% from those lows. TVTY (19.7 -13%): Pulls back to multi-week lows on above average volume after disclosing that the employment relationship between co and its COO, Dawn M. Zier, has been mutually terminated and that co has entered into a Separation and Release Agreement with Ms. Zier that provides that she will receive those payments and benefits that she is entitled to under her employment agreement in respect of a termination without cause.

Nomura initiated coverage of the stock with a Buy rating on November 8 while Raymond James initiated coverage with an Outperform rating on October 8. The company has a long history of expanding margins. AZO's gross margin hit a record of 53.72% in Q3 before ticking down to 53.65% in Q4. Another uptick in gross margin would be welcomed by investors. The stock hit a record high on November 29, extending this year's gain to 41.7%. Today, the stock trades within 1.0% of its November high.AutoZone trades at 17.6x forward earnings expectations, which represents a premium to Advance Auto Parts (AAP 151.76, -2.86, -1.9%) but a discount to O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY 443.57, -2.00, -0.5%).11:30BONDX New SupplyTreasury Auction Preview$38 bln 3-year Treasury note auction (results at 13:00 ET) Prior auction results: High yield: 1.630% Bid-to-cover: 2.60 Indirect bid: 53.3% Direct bid: 16.9% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.059% Bid-to-cover: 2.50 Indirect bid: 47.1% Direct bid: 16.5%11:29M Macy's shakes off analyst downgrade (15.43 +0.28)Shares of department store retailer Macy's (M 15.43, +0.28, +1.8%) are outperforming today in an otherwise flat market. That outperformance is remarkable because it flies in the face of Goldman Sachs downgrading the stock to Sell from Neutral and slashing its price target to $12 from $17.Strikingly, Macy's has already exceeded its average daily volume less than two hours into the trading session. That heavy volume and the positive turn in the stock on a seemingly negative development are likely byproducts of the following factors:Investor belief that the Goldman Sachs analyst isn't breaking any new ground with the basis for the downgrade (secular headwinds weighing on comps and profitability). Shares of M were down 49% for the year before today's downgrade.Short-covering activity, which is often triggered when a beaten-up stock makes a counter-intuitive move.Momentum trading as speculators see an opportunity to force a short squeeze.Macy's is the picture of a tax-loss selling candidate, but the flip side of that understanding is that many tax-loss selling candidates are seen as good, bargain-hunting opportunities after the tax-loss selling is complete. The stock's resilience to selling interest today is apt to be helping its candidacy as a short-term, speculative rebound play.11:09TALKX Market Briefing: A mixed state of affairsThe stock market is mixed, and little changed, in today's early action. Buyers have reined in their efforts after Friday's post-employment report rally and ahead of a batch of key macro developments that will unfold this week, the most notable of which is the possible implementation of tariffs on Sunday of ~$160 billion worth of imported goods from China, most of which are consumer-oriented goods.Tucked in between will be the FOMC meeting, the ECB meeting, the UK election, and CPI and Retail Sales reports for November.Today, then, has the markings thus far of a wait-and-see day, yet the underlying bullish bias can still be described as bullish given the overall lack of selling interest with the market sitting close to an all-time high.The consumer discretionary sector (+0.3%), led by Amazon.com (AMZN 1758.58, +6.98, +0.4%), is today's bet-performing sector followed by the communication services sector (+0.2%), which is led by Alphabet (GOOG 1350.61, +9.99, +0.8%) and Facebook (FB 202.50, +1.45, +0.7%).Six sectors are up and five sectors are down in a reflection of the mixed state of things, which is also reflected in the recognition that the biggest sector winner is up just 0.3% while the biggest sector loser (industrials) is down just 0.2%.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.05%; the S&P 500 is flat; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000 are both down 0.1%.11:03APRE Aprea Therapeutics presents results from US and French Phase Ib/II clinical trials of APR-246 and azacitidine at ASH (29.62 +3.57)The trials evaluate the safety and efficacy of APR-246 in combination with azacitidine (AZA) for the treatment of TP53 mutated MDS and AML.U.S. Phase Ib/II clinical trial in patients with TP53 Mutant Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML):As of the data cutoff, the overall response rate (ORR) in 33 evaluable MDS patients was 88%, with a 61% complete remission (CR) rate, by International Working Group (IWG) criteria. With a median duration of follow-up of 10.8 months, the median duration of response was 8.4 months and the median duration of CR was 7.3 months. Seventeen (52%) evaluable MDS patients discontinued therapy to pursue stem cell transplant. Median overall survival (OS) for all enrolled patients (n=55) was 10.8 months. Median OS in responding patients versus non-responders was 13.7 vs. 3.9 months. Adverse events, regardless of causality, were mostly grade 1/2. Grade 3+ adverse events occurring in > or =20% of patients were limited to cytopenias and infection, consistent with underlying hematopoietic malignancies, and no exacerbation of the expected AZA-related safety profile has been observed.French Phase Ib/II clinical trial in MDS and AML:As of the data cutoff, the ORR in 24 evaluable MDS patients was 74%, with a 66% CR rate, based on IWG criteria. With a median duration of follow-up of 6.4 months, the median OS for all enrolled patients (n=53) had not been reached. In addition, all responding patients were alive at data cutoff. Relative to baseline, mutant TP53 variant allele frequency was significantly decreased in responding patients and undetectable in all patients who achieved a CR.10:44FTSV Forty Seven announces presentation of foundational preclinical data supporting development of FSI-174 in combination with magrolimab as novel all antibody conditioning regimen for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (24.81 +10.37)Forty Seven today announced preclinical proof-of-concept data for its novel all antibody conditioning regimen, comprised of FSI-174, its anti-cKIT antibody, and magrolimab, its anti-CD47 antibody. Preclinical studies in a non-human primate (NHP) model showed that the combination of FSI-174 and magrolimab significantly depleted hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from the bone marrow, with no dose limiting toxicities. The data will be presented in a poster session at the 61st American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.In the preclinical data presented at ASH, FSI-174 demonstrated binding affinity to both human and NHP cKIT receptors, and induced phagocytosis as well as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, FSI-174 was well-tolerated when administered to NHPs as a single agent, with no dose-limiting toxicities. The no-observed-adverse-effect level was established at 50 mg/kg, the highest dose tested. When administered together, FSI-174 and magrolimab demonstrated a synergistic benefit, promoting the highest level of phagocytosis of cKIT expressing target cells and inducing significant HSC depletion nine days after infusion compared to placebo.Forty Seven expects to complete investigational new drug-enabling studies by the end of 2019, and subject to approval of the IND by the FDA, plans to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating FSI-174 in healthy volunteers in the first quarter of 2020.10:39MRK Merck and Seven and Eight BioPharmaceuticals sign clinical research collaboration agreement (88.59 -0.26)Seven and Eight BioPharmaceuticals has signed a clinical research collaboration agreement with Merck, through a subsidiary, to explore the combination of Seven and Eight's BDB001, an immune modulator targeting toll-like receptors (TLR) 7 and 8, and Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), in treating patients with advanced solid tumors. Under the terms of the agreement, Seven and Eight will sponsor and be responsible for the conduct of the clinical study.10:36ATRA Atara Biotherapeutics reports updated long-term clinical results from multicenter Expanded Access Protocol study of tab-cel for patients with EBV+ PTLD (14.72 +0.73)Atara Biotherapeutics presented long-term clinical results from a multicenter Expanded Access Protocol (EAP) study of tab-cel (tabelecleucel) for patients with Epstein-Barr virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (EBV+ PTLD) at the ASH Annual Meeting & Exposition. Results from this analysis demonstrate a high overall response rate, short time to response, and favorable estimated long-term overall survival rates for tab-cel in patients with EBV+ PTLD following hematopoietic cell transplant or solid organ transplant who have failed rituximab-based therapy. Tab-cel was generally well-tolerated in all patients with EBV+ PTLD and other EBV-associated diseases.Safety analyses were presented for all patients treated with tab-cel (n=61; n=26 EBV+ PTLD and n=35 patients with other EBV-associated diseases). Consistent with prior studies, tab-cel was generally well-tolerated in all patients, and no tab-cel related adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred. Three graft versus host disease adverse events were reported, all in patients with prior allogeneic HCT. No other adverse events of special interest including cytokine release syndrome were reported.Median time to response of one month was seen in both EBV+ PTLD patient cohorts. In responders, two-year estimated overall survival rate was 86% for HCT (n=7) and 100% for SOT (n=10) with no patient deaths attributable to PTLD progression. Similar outcomes were observed in the EAP-201 subgroup of EBV+ PTLD patients (n=22) with adequate ECOG performance status, no CNS disease and no PLTD-related ventilatory support who would have likely met the eligibility criteria for Atara's ongoing tab-cel Phase 3 studies. Overall response rate was 55% and 82%, with a two-year estimated overall survival of 79% and 81%, in the HCT (n=11) and SOT (n=11) cohorts, respectively.10:32ACHN Achillion Pharma reports "positive" data from Phase 2 dose-finding study of danicopan at ASH (6.19 +0.02)Achillion Pharma today reported top-line data from a dose-finding Phase 2 trial assessing the safety and effectiveness of its oral small molecule factor D inhibitor danicopan (ACH-4471) in combination with intravenous eculizumab in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) patients who have an inadequate response to C5 monotherapy.The primary endpoint of the trial was an increase in hemoglobin from baseline. A mean increase of 2.4 g/dL at 24 weeks of treatment was achieved in this proof-of-concept trial. Danicopan, in combination with eculizumab, resulted in a significant reduction in blood transfusions with 10 patients receiving 34 transfusions (58 units) in the 6 months prior to screening to 1 patient receiving 1 transfusion (2 units) during the 24-week trial.In addition to improvements in hemoglobin and transfusions, there were also meaningful improvements in markers of hemolysis including bilirubin, reticulocytes, and PNH red blood clone size (%).In this clinical trial, danicopan was generally well tolerated. All treatment emergent adverse events were considered mild to moderate in severity except for Grade 3 severe adverse events that occurred in two patients. Both patients had resolution of their events, remained on danicopan, and completed the study.The company plans to initiate a global Phase 3 trial in early 2020.10:28NKTR Nektar Therapeutics announces presentation of new preclinical data for NKTR-255 at ASH (22.25 +1.80)NKTR-255 is an interleukin-15 (IL-15) receptor agonist that is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical study in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Details of the preclinical data presentations at ASH are as follows and are available on the scientific section of Nektar's website."The preclinical data being recognized at ASH demonstrate NKTR-255's promise in hematological malignancies through its potential to restore both NK cell and memory CD8 T cell compartments in patients," said Loui Madakamutil, Ph.D., SVP and Head of Discovery and Research at Nektar Therapeutics. "In studies presented by the laboratory of Dr. Nikhil Munshi at Dana-Farber, NKTR-255 enhanced the number and function of NK and CD8+ effector memory T cell populations in peripheral blood and bone marrow from patients with multiple myeloma and, also increased expression of activating receptors found on those NK cells. Separately, researchers from the laboratory of Dr. Cameron Turtle at Fred Hutchinson demonstrated NKTR-255 prevented tumor growth and increased survival of CAR T cells when added to a CD19-targeted CAR T cell regimen in models of B cell lymphoma. This preclinical data reinforces the basis of our ongoing clinical trial evaluating the potential of NKTR-255 in patients with multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."10:23XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (59.57 -0.18)The energy sector (-0.3%) displays relative weakness in the early going of today's session. Today's early underperformance comes after the sector gained 1.5% last week, finishing ahead of the remaining ten groups. Factors contributing to the underperformance:Pressure on the price of oil. WTI crude is down $0.27, or 0.5%, at $58.93/bbl. Granted, the energy component has climbed off its overnight low of $58.23 in recent trade, but it remains in negative territory, weighing on the energy sector. China reported a smaller than expected trade surplus for November, which supports the argument that the Chinese economy continues slowing down. This will continue posing a headwind to global growth. Pullback after last week's show of relative strength.Notable movers:Marathon Petroleum (MPC 58.95, -1.26, -2.1%): weakest sector component after being downgraded to Neutral from Overweight at JP Morgan. Chevron (CVX 117.27, -0.74, -0.6%): downgraded to Neutral from Buy at Citigroup. HollyFrontier (HFC 50.40, -0.54, -1.1%): trading at a three-month low. Occidental Petroleum (OXY 37.71, -0.51, -1.3%): on the verge of falling to a fresh 2019 low. Chevron (CVX 117.31, -0.70, -0.6%): looking to remain above its 50-day moving average (117.39). Baker Hughes (BKR 22.64, +0.43, +1.9%): showing relative strength in a weak sector.10:19CNST Constellation Pharmaceuticals provides updated preliminary data from MANIFEST clinical trial with CPI-0610 (56.82 +13.12)MANIFEST is an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of the company's bromodomain and extra-terminal domain protein inhibitor CPI-0610 in patients with myelofibrosis (MF). Arm 3 is evaluating CPI-0610 in combination with ruxolitinib in JAK-inhibitor-nave MF patients. Arms 1 and 2 are studying CPI-0610 as a monotherapy or in combination with ruxolitinib in ruxolitinib-resistant or -intolerant MF patients. Results include:Preliminary data showed continuing signs of activity across a broad range of parameters, suggesting possible disease-modifying effects of CPI-0610.In the first-line treatment arm, 12 out of 15 (80%) evaluable JAK-inhibitor-nave patients treated with a CPI-0610 / ruxolitinib combination achieved at least a 35% spleen volume response (SVR35) at 12 weeks. The median percent change in spleen volume reduction was -49.7%. Ten out of 14 (71%) evaluable patients achieved at least a 50% improvement in Total Symptom Score (TSS50) at 12 weeks. The median percent change in TSS at 12 weeks was -60.3%.Clinical activity, including SVR35 responses, TSS50 responses, and conversion from transfusion dependence to transfusion independence, was seen at 24 weeks in patients in the second-line treatment arm who added CPI-0610 to ruxolitinib, suggesting that treatment with CPI-0610 may have durable effects.CPI-0610 in combination with ruxolitinib in JAK-inhibitor-nave patients was generally well tolerated. No adverse events led to study discontinuation. Three patients (10%) had greater than or equal to Grade 3 anemia. One patient (3.3%) had Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, which was reversible. CPI-0610 as monotherapy or in combination with ruxolitinib in ruxolitinib-refractory or -intolerant patients (Arms 1 and 2) was generally well tolerated. The most common hematologic adverse event was thrombocytopenia.Constellation continues to enroll patients in MANIFEST. As a result of encouraging preliminary data, Constellation expanded Arm 3 of MANIFEST for JAK-inhibitor-nave patients from 43 to up to 101 patients. The company also expanded Cohort 2A, for TD ruxolitinib-resistant or -intolerant patients adding CPI-0610 to ruxolitinib, from 16 to up to 60 patients. Constellation has started planning for a randomized, active-controlled, pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial studying the combination of CPI-0610 and ruxolitinib versus ruxolitinib and placebo in JAK-inhibitor-nave patients with MF. The company expects this clinical trial to start in 2020.An investor event to discuss the MANIFEST update at ASH is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. EST today.10:18AGIO Agios Pharma presents updated data for mitapivat from extension phase of DRIVE PK Phase 2 study in patients with pyruvate kinase deficiency (44.64 +3.70)Agios Pharma today reported new data from the extension phase of the DRIVE PK Phase 2 study of mitapivat (AG-348) in adults with pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency at the 2019 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.In the extension phase, patients treated with mitapivat doses >25 mg twice daily in the core period undergo a dose taper and continue on a dose that maintained their Hb level at no lower than 1.0 g/dL below their pre-taper level. As of the March 27, 2019 data cutoff, 18 of the 36 patients remain in the extension phase with a median treatment duration of 35.6 months (range 28.7-41.9). For the 18 patients in the extension phase, improvements in hemoglobin and other markers of hemolysis including reticulocytes, indirect bilirubin, and haptoglobin achieved during the core period were sustained during the extension period up to 42 months, as of the data cutoff. Adverse events for patients who continued in the study (n=18) were comparable in the core and extension periods. In the extension, the most common AEs were headache (39%), insomnia (28%), fatigue (28%), and nasopharyngitis (28%). No new safety signals were identified in the extension period.The cumulative safety profile, says the company, continues to support long-term twice daily dosing of mitapivat.Mitapivat is an investigational, first-in-class, oral, small molecule allosteric activator of wild-type and a variety of mutated pyruvate kinase-R (PKR) enzymes that directly targets the underlying metabolic defect in PK deficiency, a rare, potentially debilitating, hemolytic anemia. In addition, data was shared from the Agios-sponsored Natural History Study of PK deficiency that detailed the comorbidities and complications associated with the disease and the impact of transfusion history.10:13OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:CLF Dec 9 calls are seeing interest following positive mention in Barrons with 3720 contracts trading vs. open int of 1570, pushing implied vol up around 6 points to ~50%.

The study was designed in two parts: Part A to establish an initial priming dose with flat dosing regimens and Part B to escalate dosing on subsequent administrations to the priming dose. Prophylactic treatment for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was mandated prior to each dose of XmAb13676. XmAb13676 was generally well tolerated, and a priming dose of 45 mcg/kg was chosen for continued dose escalation in Part B for patients with NHL. Safety was evaluated in all 53 patients. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were pyrexia (55%), CRS (53%), and anemia (41%). CRS was more frequent and generally higher grade on the first dose. Three patients (6%) experienced Grade 3 or 4 CRS on the first dose, all prior to the implementation of step-up dosing. AEs consistent with the symptoms of CRS, but not reported as such, were observed in an additional 23% of patients and were mild to moderate in severity.10:09SGEN Seattle Genetics and Takeda Pharma (TAK) announce additional analyses of results from ECHELON-1 and ECHELON-2 frontline phase 3 trials of ADCETRIS (116.36 -1.14)These analyses were presented at the 61st Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology. ADCETRIS (brentuximab vedotin) is an antibody-drug conjugate directed to CD30, a defining marker of classical Hodgkin lymphoma and expressed on the surface of several types of peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL). The ECHELON-1 analysis highlighted a four-year update of the phase 3 clinical trial in a poster presentation.ECHELON-1 is evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with AVD compared to ABVD in patients with Stage III or IV frontline classical Hodgkin lymphoma.As previously reported, the ECHELON-1 trial achieved its primary endpoint with the combination of ADCETRIS plus AVD resulting in a statistically significant improvement in modified progression-free survival compared to the control arm of ABVD as assessed by independent review facility. A four-year post-hoc exploratory analysis was conducted to examine PFS outcomes per investigator assessment in the intent-to-treat population of 1,334 patients, including results by PET2 status, age, stage and prognostic risk scores. Results include: The four-year PFS rate for patients in the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm was 81.7% compared to 75.1% in the ABVD arm, a difference of 6.6%. This represents a 31% reduction in the risk of progression or death. Median follow-up time was 48.4 months. A PFS benefit at four-years for ADCETRIS plus AVD was observed for all patients independent of PET2 status, including in patients who are less than 60 years old.Consistent improvement in PFS was observed among patients treated with ADCETRIS plus AVD compared with ABVD across the majority of pre-specified subgroups.As previously reported for the primary analysis, on the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm, peripheral neuropathy events were observed in 67% of patients compared to 43% in the ABVD arm. The four-year update shows that among patients with peripheral neuropathy, 83% in the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm and 84% in the ABVD arm reported complete resolution or improvement at last follow-up. The ECHELON-2 phase 3 clinical trial data were presented in an oral session at ASH and focused on the outcomes of the subset of patients who underwent consolidative stem cell transplant. ECHELON-2 is evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with CHP compared to CHOP in frontline CD30-expressing PTCL.As previously reported, the ECHELON-2 trial met its primary endpoint with the combination of ADCETRIS plus CHP resulting in a statistically significant improvement in PFS versus the control arm of CHOP per blinded independent central review. A post-hoc exploratory analysis evaluated the impact of consolidative stem cell transplant in the ECHELON-2 study for the patients who achieved CR treated with ADCETRIS plus CHP. In the ADCETRIS plus CHP arm, this included 38 patients in CR who received a stem cell transplant and 76 patients in CR who did not. Key findings of this analysis include:The PFS estimate favored the use of stem cell transplant (HR, 0.38; [95% CI: 0.18, 0.82]). After a median follow-up time of 35.9 months, the three-year PFS rate for the 38 patients who received a stem cell transplant was 76.1%. After a median follow-up time of 41.6 months, the three-year PFS rate for the 76 patients who did not receive a stem cell transplant was 53.3%. As previously reported, the safety profile of ADCETRIS plus CHP in the ECHELON-2 trial was comparable to CHOP and consistent with the established safety profile of ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy.10:08SWTX SpringWorks Therapeutics' collaborator GlaxoSmithKline presented data evaluating SpringWorks' nirogacestat alone and in combination with GlaxoSmithKline's belantamab mafodotin (27.00 +2.48)The data demonstrated that treatment of BCMA-expressing cancer cell lines with nirogacestat led to significantly increased levels of cell surface expression of BCMA and corresponding decreases in shedding of BCMA, as measured by levels of soluble BCMA. Further, the combination of nirogacestat and belantamab mafodotin resulted in synergistic increases in cancer cell killing as compared to belantamab mafodotin alone, with an up to ~3,000-fold improvement in cytotoxicity.09:40WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Stock market opens little changedThe major indices begin the day little changed.

It is the Company's intention to resume the Advantage Loan program as soon as management is confident its stated policies and procedures are being followed. However, it is presently difficult to estimate how long this suspension might last.The Advantage Loan program is a material component of the Bank's total loan originations. While it is difficult to quantify the financial impact of the program's temporary suspension, management anticipates a reduced level of near-term loan originations, slower overall loan portfolio growth, and less loan sales. However, management does not anticipate any credit related issues from previous loans made under the program due to the substantial amount of equity required for each borrower and the resulting strong collateral package for each loan. In order to mitigate the operational and financial impact of the Advantage Loan program's temporary suspension, the Company will continue to work on initiatives to diversify its overall loan production. Such initiatives include expanding the Bank's commercial lending efforts, including multifamily, tenant-in-common, construction, and commercial and industrial loans. In addition, management will continue to review new residential loan products that meet the needs of its customers in its served markets.08:13SCANX Gapping downGapping downIn reaction to disappointing earnings/guidance:THO -4.1%M&A news:DPLO -31.7% (to be acquired by UnitedHealth's (UNH) OptumRx for $4.00/share in cash)Other news:KALV -17.7% (announced results of the Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the use of KVD001) MNRL -4.4% (commences 11 mln common stock offering; 6 mln by the co and 5 mln by the selling stockholders) SYNH -3% (approves expansion and extension of the Company's existing stock repurchase program) AUPH -2.8% (commences registered underwritten public offering of $150 mln of its common shares) ERIC -0.7% (reaches resolution on US FCPA Investigations; combined payment of $1.06 bln) LITE -0.5% (to offer $850 mln aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2026)Analyst comments:M -2.1% (downgraded to Sell at Goldman)MMM -1.3% (downgraded to Neutral at Citigroup)ORLY -1.3% (downgraded to Neutral from Buy at Goldman)08:12APEI American Public Education Board authorizes program to repurchase up to an additional $25 mln of shares of the company's common stock (25.12 )08:10SCANX Gapping upGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:N/A.M&A news:THOR +168.5% (to be acquired by Sanofi (SNY) for $68/share in cash) XBIT +136.1% (to divest Human antibody Bermekimab targeting IL-1a to Janssen) ARQL +100.6% (to be acquired by Merck (MRK) for $20 per share in cash for an approximate total equity value of $2.7 billion) RRTS +10.9% (announces the sale of its Flatbed business unit for $30 mln in cash)Other news:FATE +25.1% (reports clinical data from Landmark Phase 1 studies; no dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients; also presents new in vivo preclinical data for FT596 -- company plans to initiate enrollment of first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in rarly 2020) OBSV +22.1% (reports positive Phase 3 trial results from PRIMROSE 2 trial of linzagolix) TGTX +22.1% (presents triple therapy data from Phase I/II study of ublituximab in combination with umbralisib and venetoclax) PCG +21% (reaches agreement to resolve wildfires from 2017 and 2018) CRTX +14% (reports new data revealing link between bacterial pathogen and genetic risk for Alzheimer's Disease) AGIO +12.4% (announces that clinical proof-of-concept has been established based on preliminary analysis of Phase 2 trial of mitapivat in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia) DTIL +9.4% (announces updated interim clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1 trial of its lead investigational off-the-shelf chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy candidate, PBCAR0191) RCKT +7.3% (presents "encouraging" preliminary results from its Phase 1 trial of commercial-grade RP-L102 "Process B" for Fanconi Anemia) ALEC +6.8% (presents Phase 1 data on AL002) SGMO +5.5% (Sangamo Therapeutics and Pfizer (PFE) report updated Phase 1/2 results showing sustained increased Factor VIII activity through 44 weeks) KPTI +5.3% (reports new and updated XPOVIO data demonstrating 56% overall response) BLUE +5% (Bluebirdbio and Bristol-Myers (BMY) report "positive" top-line results from Ph 2 KarMMa study of ide-cel; met its primary endpoint and key secondary endpoint) APTO +3.9% (reports early clinical observations with CG-806 and APTO-253) CGC +3.3% (names David Klein CEO effective January 14) AM +2.9% (to repurchase $100 mln of shares from Antero Resources) CSIQ +2.8% (authorizes $150 mln share repurchase program) BMY +2.3% (presents data from multiple studies evaluating lisocabtagene maraleucel at ASH) MNK +2.1% (presents data on a novel predictive model to identify infants at risk for infantile spasms) SESN +1.7% (initiated the submission of its BLA for Vicinium for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer under Rolling Review to the FDA)MBIO +1.3% (highlights presentation of updated Phase 1/2 clinical data for MB-107 lentiviral gene therapy for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency)Analyst comments:QRVO +3.4% (upgraded to Buy from Underperform at BofA/Merrill)SWKS +2.2% (upgraded to Buy from Underpeform at BofA/Merrill)NUE +1.4% (upgraded to Buy at Longbow)STLD +1.1% (upgraded to Buy at Longbow)08:10BONDX Overnight Treasury Market SummaryRebound in ProgressU.S. Treasuries will attempt to snap their three-day skid after Treasury futures inched higher during a quiet overnight session.

We believe this proprietary combination has the potential to enhance the results of BTK inhibitor therapy alone and offer patients early and deep responses with a tolerable safety profile."08:02GALT Galectin Therapeutics announces publication of results from its NASH-CX Phase 2 clinical trial in NASH cirrhosis in the peer-reviewed journal Gastroenterology (2.99 )The paper outlines that in a phase 2b study of 162 patients with NASH, cirrhosis, and portal hypertension, one year of biweekly infusion of belapectin was safe but not associated with significant reduction in HVPG or fibrosis, compared with placebo. However, in a subgroup analysis of patients without esophageal varices, 2 mg/kg belapectin (GR-MD-02) did reduce HVPG and development of varices. This subgroup analysis suggests that there may be benefits from belapectin in patients with NASH cirrhosis without esophageal varices. Further, if this observation can be reproduced in subsequent studies, belapectin may have a role in the management of patients with NASH cirrhosis and portal hypertension but no varices.08:01REPL Replimune names Jean M.

This was comparable to historical data with multiple doses of busulfan conditioning.CD117-ADC was well tolerated in non-human primates with no evidence of the often severe side effects seen with busulfan conditioning, including veno-occlusive disease, weight loss, diarrhea, mucositis, vomiting, pulmonary fibrosis or seizures.07:42TPX Tempur Sealy Int'l determines that it will record a charge of $30 mln (before tax) in Q4 in connection with the bankruptcy of one of its customers (85.89 )On December 6, 2019, Tempur Sealy determined that it will record a charge of $30 mln (before tax) in the fourth quarter of 2019, in connection with the bankruptcy of one of its customers, Mattress PAL Holding, LLC, and the resulting significant liquidity issues of Mattress PAL's affiliates (collectively, "Mattress1One"). On April 7, 2019, Mattress PAL filed a voluntary petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code ("Chapter 11 Proceedings"). On December 5, the Bankruptcy Court orally granted Mattress PAL's request to convert the Chapter 11 Proceedings to a Chapter 7 liquidation case. The company plans to treat this charge, which does not involve any cash payments, as an adjustment in calculating adjusted EBITDA under the company's senior secured credit agreement. Mattress1One represented less than 1% of the company's global net sales in 2019, and the company does not expect this charge, or the loss of Mattress1One as a customer, to have a material impact on the company's 2019 guidance, 2020 outlook, or current or future liquidity.07:37IEP Icahn Enterprises commences private placement of Senior Notes due 2027 (61.61 )The proceeds from the offering will be used for general limited partnership purposes.07:35MBIO Mustang Bio highlights presentation of updated Phase 1/2 clinical data for MB-107 lentiviral gene therapy for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (3.85 )Lentiviral Gene Therapy with Low Dose Busulfan for Infants with X-SCID Results in the Development of a Functional Normal Immune System: Interim Results of an Ongoing Phase I/II Clinical Study Lentiviral gene therapy using low dose busulfan conditioning has been well tolerated, with no serious adverse events other than hematologic related to busulfanAll 11 patients had robust hematopoietic recovery within 3-4 weeks post cell infusion without blood product support Nine patients, with a follow up of greater than 3 months, achieved normal-for-age T-cell and natural killer (NK)-cell numbers within 3-4 months post gene therapy Five patients are off intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy thus far, of whom 3 responded to vaccines Median vector copy number (VCN) at 12 months post-gene therapy in seven patients, who have been followed for more than 12 months, was 2.25 VCN/cell (range: 1.24-3.03) in T cells, 0.34 VCN/cell (range: 0.23-1.25) in B cells, 1.55 VCN/cell (range 1.27-3.39) in NK cells, and 0.08 VCN/cell (range: 0.03-0.76) in myeloid cells in peripheral blood, and 0.10 (range: 0.05-0.66) in CD34+ bone marrow cells, respectivelyEnhanced Transduction Lentivector Gene Therapy for Treatment of Older Patients with X-Linked Severe Combined ImmunodeficiencyEarly outcome data for five older children and young adults with XSCID who received the lentivector (also known as lentiviral) gene therapy as salvage therapy after having previously received haplo-identical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as infants without chemotherapy-based conditioning were previously reported and published in Science Translational Medicine. By 2016, three additional patients were treated, and the cohort of eight patients (referred to as Cohort A) has now been followed for 3 to 7 years. Among Cohort A, gradual clinical benefit in the clearance of chronic norovirus and associated improved abdominal complaints, malabsorption, growth and IgG production were observed, and four patients were able to cease immunoglobulin replacement therapy.While the results were positive, the relatively inefficient transduction of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) required large quantities of vector. This resulted in relatively low VCN in myeloid cells in some patients, with delayed immune cell recovery and persistent clinical disease, especially in the last patient treated (patient 8). To address this, NIH developed a refined enhanced transduction (ET) procedure consisting of a single overnight transduction after 48 hours pre-stimulation in cytokines (Stem cell factor, Thrombopoietin, Flt3-ligand; 100ng/mL) and incorporated transduction enhancers LentiBoost 1:100 and dimethyl prostaglandin 2 (dmPGE2; 1uM).The presentation at the 2019 ASH Annual Meeting included data from six patients (referred to as Cohort B) treated by NIH, including re-treatment of patient 8. The patients, who were aged 12 to 36, had significant problems with donor T cell infiltration of liver, bone marrow and kidneys, and were nearly absent of B and NK cells. The enhanced transduction procedure achieved much greater transduction efficiencies than were observed in Cohort A, with greater than 10-fold less vector, and resulted in faster immune reconstitution and more significant clinical benefit by 3 months.07:33AR Antero Resources highlights agreements expected to reduce its gathering, processing and transportation costs by approximately $350 mln over the next four years, commences asset sale program targeting $750 mln to $1 bln in proceeds to be completed in 2020 (2.19 )The agreements include a growth incentive fee program with Antero Midstream Corporation (AM) that aligns with the Company's current 8% to 10% compound annual production growth plan through 2021 and additional agreements with other third party midstream providers.

All response-evaluable patients experienced tumor reduction (complete response + partial response + stable disease) following treatment with ADCETRIS in combination with OPDIVO. Median duration of response was not yet reached and the maximum duration of response was 22 months and ongoing (95% CI: 7.06, -). The most common treatment-related adverse events of any grade occurring in at least 20 percent of patients were fatigue, diarrhea, pyrexia, infusion related reaction, peripheral motor neuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy and increase in lipase. One treatment-related serious adverse event was pyrexia. Fifty-seven percent of patients (12/21) had at least one treatment-related adverse event greater than or equal to Grade 3, most commonly increase in lipase (24 percent, 5/21), peripheral motor neuropathy and peripheral sensory neuropathy (each 14 percent, 3/21), and fatigue and hyponatremia (each 10 percent, 2/21). Two-Year Follow-up Results from the Phase 1-2 Study of Brentuximab Vedotin in Combination with Nivolumab in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (Abstract #238, oral presentation at 2:45 p.m. ET on Saturday, December 7, 2019) Of the 91 treated patients, 85 percent (77/91) had an objective response, including 67 percent (61/91) with a complete response, 16 patients with a partial response and six patients had stable disease. Of the 91 treated patients, 67 patients received an ASCT per trial protocol with no additional salvage therapy. For all treated patients, the two-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 79 percent (95% CI: 68%, 87%). For the 67 patients who received an ASCT per trial protocol, the two-year PFS was 92 percent (95% CI: 80%, 97%). Median follow-up for all treated patients was 24.2 months (range 1.8-41.7) and the median PFS was not reached. Estimated overall survival at two years was 94 percent (95% CI: 85%, 97%) and median overall survival was not yet reached. Peripheral immune signatures were consistent with an activated T-cell response. Prior to ASCT, the most common adverse events of any grade occurring in more than 20 percent of patients were nausea, infusion related reaction, fatigue, diarrhea, pruritus, headache, vomiting and pyrexia. Other adverse events included peripheral neuropathy in 16 patients (18 percent) and neutropenia in six patients (7 percent). Two patients (2 percent) discontinued treatment due to adverse events, Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy and increased gamma-glutamyltransferase. Serious adverse events occurred in 14 patients (15 percent), including pneumonia, pneumonitis and pyrexia (two patients each); and Grade 3 Guillain-Barre syndrome (one patient).06:52GILD Gilead Sciences reports Long-term data from ZUMA-1 demonstrating about half of refractory large b-cell lymphoma patients were alive three years after Yescarta treatment (67.08 )Co announced new data from the ZUMA-1 trial of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) in adult patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma. These results included updated overall survival data from the pivotal phase 2 study after three years following a single infusion of Yescarta, as well as an analysis from a separate safety management cohort of patients receiving early steroid intervention for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events. Updated results from a separate ZUMA-1 safety management study (Cohort 4) were also presented at the meeting (Abstract #243). In this analysis, patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma treated with Yescarta received earlier steroid intervention, beginning when patients experienced Grade 1 neurologic events or experienced Grade 1 CRS with no improvement after three days of supportive care. Patients could receive optional bridging chemotherapy prior to Yescarta infusion. In the analysis, 41 patients had received Yescarta, with a median follow-up of 8.7 months; 73% of patients received corticosteroids and 76% received tocilizumab. Earlier steroid use appeared to decrease the percentage of patients with Grade > or =3 CRS (2%) and neurologic events (17%), each of which were numerically lower than rates in the registrational cohorts of ZUMA-1 (13% CRS, 31% neurologic events). There were no Grade 4 or 5 CRS or neurologic events and no Grade 5 AEs related to Yescarta in Cohort 4. Objective response rate per investigator assessment was 73% in Cohort 4, with 51% of patients achieving a complete response. The median duration of response was 8.9 months. Fifty-four percent of patients in this cohort remained in an ongoing response with at least six months of follow-up after Yescarta infusion. Median OS in Cohort 4 has not been reached.06:51CRTX Cortexyme reports new data revealing link between bacterial pathogen and genetic risk for Alzheimer's Disease (28.31 )Co announced the presentation of new data supporting the on-target activity of COR388, its lead investigational medicine, and linking the "gingipain hypothesis" for Alzheimer's disease (AD) to the significance of the APOE gene as a major risk factor for the disease.Gingipains from P. gingivalis cleave ApoE proteins and have a preference for cleaving ApoE4; and COR388, a gingipain inhibitor, prevents this. In in vitro experiments, cells infected with P. gingivalis exhibited gingipain-dependent ApoE cleavage activity that generated ApoE fragments similar to what was seen in the brains and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, uninfected cells had no significant ApoE protein-cleaving activity. Furthermore, P. gingivalis gingipains cleaved ApoE4 more readily than ApoE3. Finally, in the infected cells, COR388 alone was sufficient to block ApoE fragmentation. In a Phase 1b trial, COR388 reduced ApoE fragments in CSF. Cortexyme's Phase 1 clinical development program for COR388 included cohorts of healthy volunteers and subjects with Alzheimer's disease. In addition to assessing safety and initial clinical activity, investigators also assessed the level of ApoE fragmentation in the CSF of nine subjects with Alzheimer's disease. Six subjects received 50mg of COR388 twice daily while three subjects received placebo. After 28 days, a statistically significant decrease in ApoE fragments (both ApoE4 and ApoE3) was observed in subjects treated with COR388 versus those treated with placebo.06:51EGRX Eagle Pharma commences dosing in pilot study for novel estrogen receptor antagonist product candidate (56.43 )The company has commenced dosing in a pilot clinical study to assess the unique characteristics of its fulvestrant product candidate, which has the potential to enhance estrogen receptor ("ER") inhibition and improve outcomes for patients with ER-positive breast cancer. The results of the pilot study will inform the design of the company's pivotal trial, which Eagle expects to commence in 2020.06:51BLUE Bluebirdbio presents new data from ongoing Phase 1/2 HGB-206 study of investigational LentiGlobin gene therapy for sickle cell disease (79.42 )HGB-206 is an ongoing, Phase 1/2 open-label study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LentiGlobin gene therapy for SCD that includes three treatment cohorts: Groups A, B, and C. All results are as of the data cutoff date of August 26, 2019.Groups A and B:As of the data cutoff date, seven out of nine total patients in Groups A and B (five out of seven in Group A and two out of two in Group B) did not require regular RBC transfusions post-treatment. Overall, patients in Groups A and B experienced a reduction, but not complete elimination of VOC and ACS events at two years post-treatment, suggesting that the levels of gene therapy-derived hemoglobin may have been sufficient to reduce but not eliminate continued sickle-related disease manifestations. Group C As of the data cutoff date, 17 patients were treated with LentiGlobin for SCD in Group C, with the longest follow-up at 21 months; none required regular RBC transfusions post-treatment. In patients with six or more months of follow-up (n=12), median levels of gene therapy-derived anti-sickling hemoglobin, HbAT87Q, were at least 40% of total hemoglobin. Total hemoglobin and HbAT87Q levels ranged from 9.3 -- 15.2 g/dL and 2.7 -- 9.0 g/dL, respectively, at last visit. Treatment with LentiGlobin for SCD reduced key markers of hemolysis, including reticulocyte counts, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and total bilirubin concentration, which suggests that treatment is improving biological markers of the disease. Among the nine patients with at least six months of follow-up who had four or more VOC or ACS events in the two years prior to treatment, there was a 99% reduction in annualized rate of VOC and ACS. There were no reports of ACS or serious VOC at up to 21 months post-treatment in these patients. As previously reported, there was one non-serious Grade 2 VOC was observed in a patient approximately 3.5 months post-LentiGlobin for SCD treatment.HGB-206 Exploratory Assays bluebird bio presented results from exploratory assays in samples from a subset of patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD from Groups A, B and C, to assess the relationship between drug product characteristics and RBC physiology. To demonstrate the pancellular expression of the gene therapy derived anti-sickling Hb, HbAT87Q, bluebird bio developed an assay that enables detection of HbAT87Q and HbS protein in individual RBCs. In 12 patients who had at least six months of follow-up, the proportion of RBCs positive for HbAT87Q at the last study visit was more than 70% in all cases; with more than 90% of RBCs positive for HbAT87Q in four patients.On average, HbAT87Q present in RBCs of patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD was within the range of non-sickling adult Hb, HbA, present in the RBCs from people with sickle cell trait. The RBCs also resembled sickle cell trait RBCs with regard to propensity to sickle under low oxygen conditions. Sickling of RBCs from patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD was significantly less than that seen in untreated patients with SCD.06:49MNK Mallinckrodt plc presents data on a novel predictive model to identify infants at risk for infantile spasms (3.41 )Co announced findings on the use of a novel predictive model designed to more quickly identify infants with infantile spasms (IS), a rare seizure disorder that typically occurs between three and seven months of age. Key FindingsDeductive models developed to identify the combinations of variables that predict IS prior to diagnosis and during the treatment pathway: 557 patients had =2 symptoms pertaining to IS -- seizures, developmental delay, lack of eye contact and lack of muscle tone -- and a moderate or high severity ED visit. In this group, 55 percent of patients (n=304) had an IS diagnosis within a median 0.8 months of the triggering event. The most notable deductive combinations focused on pre-diagnosis of IS. MethodsThe study utilized data from the Symphony Health Integrated Dataverse database to identify triggers for early identification of IS patients from medical and pharmacy claims from 10.8 million patients under 2 years of age between May 2017 and April 2018. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) procedure codes were evaluated to identify the codes most likely to predict a subsequent diagnosis of IS. Researchers also used input from IS medical experts to determine the clinical, electrographic, radiologic, procedural and medication variables that may predict IS development.06:48SGMO Sangamo Therapeutics announces preliminary results from first three patients treated in Phase 1/2 THALES study evaluating investigational ST-400 ex vivo gene-edited cell therapy in transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (11.66 )The three patients treated with ST-400 experienced prompt hematopoietic reconstitution, demonstrating neutrophil engraftment in 14-22 days and platelet engraftment in 22-35 days (Table 1). No emerging clonal hematopoiesis has to date been observed by on-target indel pattern monitoring in the three treated patients. Reported adverse events (AEs) are consistent with the known toxicities of mobilization, apheresis, and myeloablative busulfan conditioning. One serious adverse event (SAE) related to ST-400 was reported. As previously disclosed, Patient 1 experienced hypersensitivity during ST-400 infusion considered by the investigator to be likely related to the product cryoprotectant excipient, DMSO, and which resolved by the end of the infusion.06:47LITE Lumentum to offer $850 mln aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2026 (72.08 )Lumentum intends to use approximately $196 million of the net proceeds of the offering to repay in full all amounts outstanding under its term loan credit facility, and a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to purchase up to approximately $200 million of its common stock concurrently with the pricing of this offering in privately negotiated transactions effected through the initial purchaser of the notes or its affiliates as its agent.

In addition, there was a 61 percent probability that patients who achieved a CR would maintain it after five years.06:38AGIO Agios Pharma announces that clinical proof-of-concept has been established based on preliminary analysis of Phase 2 trial of mitapivat in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (40.94 )The Phase 2 study has enrolled 12 of the intended 17 patients (nine with -thalassemia and three with a-thalassemia). As of the November 14, 2019 data cutoff date, eight patients, all with -thalassemia, were evaluable for the primary endpoint of a hemoglobin increase of =1.0 g/dL from baseline in at least one assessment during Weeks 4-12. All eight patients were treated with 50 mg of mitapivat twice daily for the first six weeks and escalated to 100 mg twice daily, and all patients remain on treatment (range 12.4-34.3 weeks). Seven of eight efficacy evaluable patients achieved a hemoglobin increase of =1.0 g/dL, and for responders the mean hemoglobin increase from baseline was 1.76 g/dL (range, 0.9--3.3 g/dL) during Weeks 4-12. The majority of adverse events were Grade 1 or 2 and consistent with previously published Phase 2 data for mitapivat in patients with pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency. Updated results from the Phase 2 thalassemia study will be presented at a medical meeting in the first half of 2020.06:38PRNB Principia Biopharma reports positive data of PRN1008 for Immune Thrombocytopenia in ongoing Phase 1/2 Trial (37.39 )Co announced consistent positive data from an ongoing Phase 1/2 trial of its investigational treatment, PRN1008, in 31 highly treatment-resistant and refractory patients (median of six prior therapies) with immune thrombocytopenia.Of the 31 patients, 39 percent (80 percent confidence interval (CI) 28, 50), irrespective of dose and duration of treatment, achieved the trial's primary endpoint of =2 consecutive platelet counts of =50,000/L, separated by at least five days, and increased by =20,000/L from baseline, without requiring rescue medication. In addition, 45 percent (80 percent CI 34, 57) of enrolled patients achieved any two platelet counts =50,000/L. Most patients who achieved the primary endpoint had a platelet count >30,000/L by the first week of treatment. Preliminary data on 13 patients treated at higher doses (300mg and 400mg twice daily) and who had completed at least 12 weeks of therapy, demonstrated a response rate of 54 percent (80 percent CI 37, 70) and 62 percent (80 percent CI 44, 77) for both endpoints respectively. To date PRN1008 has been well-tolerated at all doses studied, whether given as a monotherapy or with allowed concomitant ITP therapy (thrombopoietin and steroids), with no reported treatment related bleeding or thrombotic events. Related treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 35 percent of patients and were all grade 1 or 2.06:37ZIOP ZIOPHARM presents pre-clinical data of Rapid Personalized Manufacture (5.16 )Data were presented today in the poster presentation "Rapid Personalized Manufacture (RPM) of Sleeping Beauty System-generated NY-ESO-1-specific TCR-T Cells Co-Expressing Membrane-bound IL-15 Yields Antitumor Responses" and demonstrated:T cells can be genetically modified with the Sleeping Beauty system to express TCR and mbIL15T cells expressing TCR and mbIL15 exhibited superior anti-tumor effects compared with TCR-modified T cells without mbIL15T cells expressing TCR and mbIL15 are infused the day after gene transfer per RPMLow-dose of T cells genetically modified per RPM to express TCR and mbIL15 exhibit anti-tumor effectsT cells expressing TCR and mbIL15 persist in mouse model06:36TGTX TG Therapeutics presents triple therapy data from Phase I/II study of ublituximab in combination with umbralisib and venetoclax in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (7.12 )Title: A Phase 1/2 Study of Umbralisib, Ublituximab and Venetoclax in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)Overall response rate (ORR) of 87% (20/23) after U2 induction period at cycle 3, prior to introduction of venetoclax, in relapsed/refractory CLL patients, including patients refractory to ibrutinibU2 induction appeared to reduce venetoclax TLS risk, with no patients remaining as TLS high-risk following 3 cycles of U213 patients treated for >7 cycles and 9 patients for > 12 cycles: 100% ORR (13/13) after cycle 7 for the triple combination 100% ORR (9/9) including 44% Complete Response (CR) after cycle 12 for the combination100% (9/9) of patients had undetectable minimal residual disease (MRD) (<0.01%) in peripheral blood after 12 cycles of therapy; and78% (7/9) of patients who completed 12 cycles of therapy had undetectable MRD in bone marrow and have stopped therapy No patients (n = 27) have progressed to date with a median follow-up of 6.4 monthsTriple combination was generally well tolerated with no events of TLS observed06:36TAK Takeda Pharma presents Phase 3 TOURMALINE-AL1 results (20.26 )Co announced that results of the TOURMALINE-AL1 trial. Key findings, to be presented by Dr. Angela Dispenzieri, include: The first of two primary endpoints was not met in TOURMALINE-AL1. Hematologic responses were seen in 53% versus 51% of patients receiving NINLARO plus dexamethasone versus physician's choice (odds ratio 1.10 [95% CI 0.60-2.01], p=0.762).Complete response (CR) rate was 26% in the NINLARO plus dexamethasone arm versus 18% in the physician's choice arm. The second primary endpoint, two-year vital organ deterioration or death, was not mature at the time of analysis.Safety data includes: Drug-related adverse events (AE) were experienced by 82% of patients receiving NINLARO plus dexamethasone compared to 81% of patients receiving physician's choice. Serious adverse events (SAE) were experienced by 47% of patients in the NINLARO plus dexamethasone arm compared to 33% in the physician's choice arm.06:34BPMC Blueprint Medicines announces initial data from Phase 2 PIONEER clinical trial of avapritinib in patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis (78.48 )Initial data from the dose-finding Part 1 of the PIONEER trial showed rapid and robust reductions in serum tryptase, a well-established measure of mast cell burden, in patients treated with 25 mg, 50 mg or 100 mg of avapritinib once daily (QD). All dose levels of avapritinib tested were well-tolerated, and no patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse event (AE).Blueprint Medicines plans to report additional data from Part 1 of the PIONEER trial that will inform the selection of a recommended Part 2 dose (RP2D), including the change in patient-reported disease symptoms as measured by the Indolent SM Symptom Assessment Form (ISM-SAF), in the first quarter of 2020. The registration-enabling Part 2 of the PIONEER trial is anticipated to initiate patient screening in the first half of 2020.06:34REGN Regeneron Pharma announces initial clinical data for REGN5458 in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma (372.26 )Results were presented today at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting from the first two dose groups (3 mg and 6 mg weekly doses). Patients had a median of seven lines of prior systemic therapy, and all had failed CD38 antibody treatment. Responses were observed in 4 of 7 (57%) patients, including 3 of 4 (75%) in the 6 mg dose group. In the 6 mg dose group, 2 patients (50%) were also minimal residual disease (MRD) negative, meaning that no cancer cells were detectable in their bone marrow.As of data cutoff, there have been no neurotoxicity, dose-limiting toxicities or treatment discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs). The most common treatment-emergent AEs were lymphopenia (n=5), anemia (n=4) and thrombocytopenia and cytokine release syndrome (n=3 each). Grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent AEs were seen in 5 patients and included lymphopenia (n=3), hypertension (n=2) and anemia, atrial fibrillation, fatigue, febrile neutropenia, pain in extremity, septic shock and thrombocytopenia (n=1 each).06:33STZ Constellation Brands names Garth Hankinson Executive Vice President and CFO (183.65 )Co announces that Garth Hankinson has been promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective January 13, 2020.

The results from the pharmacokinetic and occupancy studies for the first seven patients have been in-line with expectations. The Company anticipates that a dose that achieves maximum target occupancy will be achieved in the next one or two dose cohorts. CPI-818 has been shown to bind covalently to ITK at low nanomolar concentrations without reacting with other kinases. In vitro studies demonstrated selective cytotoxicity to Sezary cells (malignant cells from patients with CTCL), while sparing normal T-cells, in three subjects not enrolled in the study. Preclinical murine models of lymphoproliferative and autoimmune disease showed CPI-818 inhibited the development of lymph node and spleen enlargement by preventing proliferation of abnormal T-cells. Treatment with CPI-818 led to regression of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly in animals with established disease.06:32CGC Canopy Growth names David Klein CEO effective January 14 (18.65 )In his current role as executive vice president and chief financial officer at Constellation Brands, David oversees all aspects of the company's finance operations, all mergers and acquisitions, as well as the company's information technology function.The appointment of David Klein follows a thorough recruitment process overseen by a special Hiring Committee of the Board using global recruitment company Heidrick & Struggles, which saw a wide variety of exceptional candidates vetted and interviewed.

Fourteen patients were evaluable at one month.AUTO3 was well-tolerated, with no patients experiencing > or = Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with primary infusion and 1 of 14 experiencing Grade 3 neurotoxicity that resolved swiftly with steroids. There were no pembrolizumab immune-related toxicities and the majority of grade 3 or higher adverse events were hematological. Low levels of serum cytokines are consistent with the observed low levels of CRS and neurotoxicity. Across all tested doses 5 patients achieved a complete response, with 4 of 5 complete responses ongoing, the longest at 18 months. All CRs were achieved without need for steroid or tocilizumab-based management of the patients or ICU level care.AUTO3 -- (Poster) - Phase 1/2 AMELIA clinical trial of AUTO3 in patients with relapsed/refractory pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pALL) (Abstract # 2620)AUTO3 was well-tolerated overall, with no patients experiencing = Grade 3 CRS and no patients experiencing > or = Grade 2 neurotoxicity, in doses > or =3x106 /kg CAR-T cells. No AUTO3-related deaths were reported.Among the 10 CAR T-nave patients, at a median follow-up time of 9.7 months (range 1.8- 18), 9 of 10 patients (90%) achieved a complete response, and 8 of 10 (80%) achieved complete molecular remission by PCR. Estimated overall survival at 12 months was 100%. There are 2 ongoing patients in complete molecular remission at 12 and 15 months post-AUTO3 infusion, respectively. The most common cause of relapse was due to loss of CAR T-cell persistence. The median persistence of CAR-T cells in blood was 170 days.06:29STOK Stoke Therapeutics presents new preclinical data on STK-001 for the treatment of Dravet syndrome (28.98 )Data from studies in non-human primates (NHP) showed STK-001 distributed throughout the brain and achieved target engagement and increased Nav1.1 protein expression throughout the cortex after a single intrathecal injection. Safety findings showed STK-001 to be well-tolerated at the two intrathecal dose levels studied. These data were presented in a poster session at the American Epilepsy Society (AES) Annual Meeting in Baltimore.Stoke plans to submit an investigational new drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in early 2020 and, subject to acceptance of the IND, plans to initiate a Phase 1/2 single-ascending dose study in children and adolescents with Dravet syndrome in the first half of 2020.06:28FATE Fate Therapeutics presents new in vivo preclinical data for FT596 -- company plans to initiate enrollment of first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in rarly 2020 (13.67 )FT596 is the first cellular immunotherapy engineered with three active anti-tumor components to be cleared for clinical investigation by the FDA. In addition to a proprietary CAR targeting CD19, FT596 expresses a novel high-affinity, non-cleavable CD16 (hnCD16) Fc receptor that has been modified to augment antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, enabling coincident targeting of CD19 and additional tumor-associated antigens such as CD20. FT596 also expresses an interleukin-15 receptor fusion (IL-15RF), a potent cytokine complex that promotes survival, proliferation and trans-activation of NK cells and CD8 T cells without the need for systemic cytokine support. Together, these features of FT596 are intended to maximize potency and minimize toxicity in treated patients. The Company plans to initiate enrollment of a first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in early 2020.New preclinical data presented at ASH showed that FT596 administered as a monotherapy exhibited durable tumor clearance and extended survival in vivo similar to primary CAR T cells in a humanized mouse model of CD19+ lymphoma. Additionally, when combined with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab, FT596 showed enhanced killing of CD20+ lymphoma cells in vivo as compared to rituximab alone. These data confirm previously presented in vitro findings that demonstrate the unique multi-antigen targeting functionality of FT596, and the product candidate's potential to effectively overcome CD19 antigen escape.The Company also announced that, in preparation for Phase 1 initiation, it had recently completed GMP production of FT596. In a single small-scale manufacturing campaign, the Company produced over 300 cryopreserved, infusion-ready doses of FT596 at a cost of approximately $2,500 per dose. The Company's iPSC product platform unites stem cell biology and precision genetic engineering to create renewable master engineered iPSC lines that can be repeatedly used to mass produce cancer-fighting immune cells, replacing the high production costs, weeks of manufacturing time, and complex manufacturing processes required for current-generation CAR T-cell immunotherapies with a lower-cost, easier-to-manufacture, well-characterized, off-the-shelf product that has the potential to reach many more patients.06:27SGMO Sangamo Therapeutics and Pfizer (PFE) report updated Phase 1/2 results showing sustained increased Factor VIII activity through 44 weeks (11.66 )Sangamo Therapeutics (SGMO) and Pfizer (PFE) announced updated follow-up results from the Phase 1/2 Alta study evaluating investigational SB-525 gene therapy in patients with severe hemophilia A. The data showed that SB-525 was generally well tolerated and demonstrated sustained increased Factor VIII (FVIII) levels following treatment with SB-525 through to 44 weeks, the extent of follow-up for the longest treated patient in the 3e13 vg/kg dose cohort.06:27KURA Kura Oncology provides clinical and regulatory updates for lead drug candidate, tipifarnib, in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (15.61 )In June 2019, Kura reported that the primary efficacy endpoint was achieved in each of the expansion cohorts in its Phase 2 trial of tipifarnib in relapsed or refractory PTCL: 1) patients with AITL, an aggressive form of T-cell lymphoma often characterized by high levels of CXCL12 expression, and 2) patients with PTCL who lack a single nucleotide variation in the 3'-untranslated region of the CXCL12 gene. Given the high level of activity observed among AITL patients, Kura continued to enroll patients to acquire more experience regarding safety and tolerability in this population. Based upon the 2016 revision of the World Health Organization classification of lymphoid neoplasms1, AITL and AITL-like histologies represent approximately one-third of all PTCL cases.As of the November 11, 2019 data cutoff date, a total of 26 patients with relapsed or refractory AITL were enrolled in all stages of the trial. Among the 20 patients evaluable for efficacy, five achieved a complete response (CR) and five achieved a partial response (PR), for an objective response rate (ORR) of 50% on an evaluable basis and 38% on an intent-to-treat basis. In addition, three patients experienced disease stabilization. Patients had a median of three prior regimens (range 1-7).Next-generation sequencing of 19 available patient biopsies showed that 10 (53%) carried C336R/Q386E variants in the killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) 3DL2, an immune checkpoint receptor. Four of the 10 patients with KIR3DL2 variants achieved a CR and three achieved a PR, for a CR rate of 40% and an ORR of 70%. This compares to a CR rate of 11% and an ORR of 22% among the nine AITL patients with KIR3DL2 wild type.Regulatory Update: Following FDA feedback from an end-of-Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting, Kura plans to initiate a Phase 2 registration-directed trial of tipifarnib in patients with relapsed or refractory AITL and related lymphomas in 2020. The multi-center, single-arm trial will target enrollment of 128 patients with AITL and AITL-like histologies who are relapsed or refractory to at least one prior systemic cytotoxic therapy.06:26PTLA Portola Pharma presents new interim results from ongoing Phase 2a study of cerdulatinib in patients with specific subtypes of T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (29.21 )As of the November 12, 2019 cut-off date, 64 PTCL patients and 40 CTCL patients treated with cerdulatinib as a single agent were evaluable for response. The overall response rate (ORR) was 34% in the PTCL cohort and 43% in the CTCL cohort. Among the subset of patients in the PTCL cohort with AITL, the ORR was 52% and the complete response rate (CR) was 37%.Among the 64 patients in the PTCL cohort, 14 patients (22%) achieved a CR and eight patients (12%) achieved a partial response (PR). In the subgroup of 27 patients with AITL, 10 patients (37%) achieved a CR, and four patients (15%) achieved a PR. The median duration of response is eight months for all PTCL patients and is greater than nine months in AITL patients. Follow-up is ongoing. Among the 40 patients in the CTCL cohort, three patients (8%) achieved a CR and 14 patients (35%) achieved a PR. Importantly, rapid improvements in pruritus, or severe itching -- a common and often serious condition associated with CTCL -- have been observed, as measured by the Likert scale.Cerdulatinib demonstrated good tolerability in both PTCL and CTCL. The most common Grade 3 or greater adverse events across the PTCL and CTCL cohorts with a frequency > 5% were lipase increase (25%), amylase increase (19%), neutropenia (12%), anemia (10%), diarrhea (8%), sepsis/bacteremia (6%), and febrile neutropenia (4%). The lipase and amylase changes were generally asymptomatic and not associated with pancreatitis.06:25XENE Xenon Pharmaceuticals provides updates on partnered neurology pipeline programs (13.95 )Xenon Pharmaceuticals announced that it will provide updates on its partnered epilepsy programs at the American Epilepsy Society Annual Meeting.Overview of clinical stage XEN901 and Related Patient Survey to be Presented in the "Genetic Epilepsies -- Updates in the Science and Diagnosis" on December 8th.Pre-clinical work suggests selective sodium channel inhibitors that reduce action potential firing in excitatory neurons, while sparing inhibitory interneurons, may provide promising drug profile.06:25IMV IMV presents updated results from SPiReL at ASH (2.83 )The poster, which included additional data collected between the abstract submission and the presentation, continued to demonstrate a favorable therapeutic profile and treatment-associated clinical benefit in r/r DLBCL patients who received the DPX-Survivac combination regimen.06:24QURE uniQure presents updated clinical data on three patients treated in ongoing Phase IIb study of etranacogene dezaparvovec; additionally presents up to 4 years of follow-up data on the 10 patients in the Phase I/II trial of AMT-060 (66.05 )At Least One Year of Stable, Therapeutic Levels of FIX Activity in Patients Treated with Etranacogene Dezaparvovec: Featured in a poster presentation at ASH, the 52 weeks of follow-up data show that all three patients have stabilized and sustained FIX activity at therapeutic levels after the one-time administration of etranacogene dezaparvovec. Mean FIX activity for the three patients at 52 weeks after administration was 41% of normal, with the first patient achieving FIX activity of 50% of normal, the second patient achieving FIX activity of 31% of normal and the third patient achieving FIX activity of 41% of normal. The second and third patients had previously screen-failed and were excluded from another gene therapy study due to pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to a different AAV vector. Reported FIX activity was measured using an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay performed at a central laboratory.At one year after dosing, no patient in the study has reported any bleeding events. All patients have remained free of prophylaxis after receiving etranacogene dezaparvovec. One patient, who had earlier in the study undergone hip surgery due to a pre-existing condition, experienced back pain and treated himself with a single infusion of factor replacement, which was later determined by the patient and the investigator to be unrelated to a bleed. No other FIX infusions were reported by any patient.Stable FIX Expression and Durable Reductions in Bleeding and FIX Consumption for up to 4 Years Following AMT-060 Gene Therapy:In the ongoing Phase I/II study of AMT-060, all 10 patients continue to show long-term clinical benefit, including sustained increases in FIX activity, reduced usage of FIX replacement therapy, and decreased bleeding frequency. At up to 4 years of follow-up, AMT-060 continues to be well-tolerated, with no new serious adverse events and no development of inhibitors since the last reported data.All five patients in the second dose cohort of 2x1013 gc/kg (the dose being studied in the ongoing Phase III HOPE-B study of etranacogene dezaparvovec) continue to be free of routine FIX replacement therapy at 3.5 years after treatment. Based on the six months of data collected during the fourth year of follow-up, the mean annualized bleeding rate was zero compared to an average of 4 bleeds during the year prior to treatment, representing a 100% reduction. During this same period, the usage of FIX replacement therapy also declined 100% compared to the year prior to treatment. Mean FIX activity over 3.5 years was 7.5%.06:22FATE Fate Therapeutics reports clinical data from Landmark Phase 1 studies; no dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients (13.67 )Fate Therapeutics announced initial clinical data for its FT516 and FT500 off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived natural killer (NK) cell product candidates.No morphologic evidence of leukemia and complete neutrophil recovery observed in first patient treated with FT516 Monotherapy for AML following first dosing cycleNo dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients treated with FT500 for advanced solid tumorsFavorable FT500 Phase 1 Safety, Tolerability and Immunogenicity profile validates novel multi-dose treatment paradigm for off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived NK cell products.06:22BMY Bristol-Myers presents data from multiple studies evaluating lisocabtagene maraleucel at ASH (59.95 )These studies included an evaluation of liso-cel in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) (TRANSCEND CLL 004); a study in second-line patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients who were ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) (PILOT); and a separate analysis of patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma who received liso-cel in the outpatient setting across three studies."The results in relapsed or refractory CLL and SLL demonstrated a high rate of durable complete responses achieved in heavily pre-treated patients, including patients who have failed ibrutinib and venetoclax. We are encouraged by the potential of liso-cel to treat second-line relapsed or refractory large B-cell NHL patients who are not able to undergo a stem cell transplant. Finally, the analysis evaluating liso-cel administered in the outpatient setting demonstrates that not all patients require hospitalization and that the safety and efficacy profile across a variety of types of clinical sites is consistent."06:20LLY Eli Lilly presents interim clinical data from the LOXO-305 global Phase 1/2 BRUIN dose escalation trial (119.64 )At all doses studied, LOXO-305 delivered objective responses in patients who had received diverse prior therapies and had exhibited varied molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance.Of 16 CLL patients enrolled, there were 10 responders (8 partial responses, 2 partial response with ongoing lymphocytosis) among 13 patients eligible for response assessment, resulting in a 77% ORR. All patients with CLL have demonstrated tumor reduction, with evidence of deepening response over time. Responses were observed in patients with acquired resistance to prior BTK therapy (those with and without C481S mutations), in patients who were intolerant to prior BTK therapy, and in patients with acquired resistance to prior BCL2 therapy (including one with a known BCL G101V mutation). As expected, LOXO-305 treatment causes acute lymphocytosis, which resolves over time -- a well described pharmacodynamic response associated with effective BTK inhibition. Of the three CLL patients not yet eligible for response assessment (one with the BTK C481S mutation), all three have demonstrated lymphocytosis early in cycle 1. All CLL responding patients remain in response, and all CLL patients remain on study. Of eight MCL patients enrolled, there were three responses (1 complete response, 2 partial responses) among six patients eligible for response assessment, resulting in a 50% ORR. Two of the responders had progressed on prior BTK therapy (but without a documented C481x mutation). All MCL responding patients remain in response and on study. Three MCL patients discontinued therapy in cycle 1 due to progressive disease.Most treatment-emergent adverse events were Grade 1 in severity with the most commonly reported events, regardless of attribution, being fatigue (25% total: 21% Grade 1, 4% Grade 2) and diarrhea (18% total: 14% Grade 1, 4% Grade 2). Two adverse events > or =Grade 3 were attributed to LOXO-305 (Grade 3 leukocytosis and Grade 3 transient neutropenia). No dose limiting toxicities were reported and an MTD had not been reached.06:19AZN AstraZeneca reports full results from Phase III ELEVATE TN trial (47.68 )AstraZeneca presented results from the interim analysis of the Phase III ELEVATE TN trial, showing that CALQUENCE (acalabrutinib) combined with obinutuzumab or as monotherapy significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab, a standard chemo-immunotherapy treatment, in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia.In an exploratory analysis, CALQUENCE in combination or alone demonstrated consistent PFS improvements across most pre-specified subgroups of patients with high-risk disease characteristics, including the unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable gene (IGHV), del(11q) and complex karyotype. Overall, the safety and tolerability profile of CALQUENCE observed in the ELEVATE TN trial was consistent with its known profile.06:19BGNE BeiGene presents clinical data from three trials of its BTK inhibitor BRUKINSA at ASH (186.92 )In two oral presentations of BRUKINSA in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), the drug candidate demonstrated consistent safety and a high overall response rate (ORR); in the poster presentation of BRUKINSA combined with BeiGene's investigational anti-PD-1 antibody tislelizumab in patients with previously treated B-cell malignancies, the combination treatment showed preliminary efficacy and was generally well tolerated."The results presented today on BRUKINSA, a BTK inhibitor designed to maximize target occupancy and minimize off-target binding, demonstrated robust clinical activity and a safety profile consistent with what we've observed to date in our clinical trials, including safety data that supported the recent U.S. FDA accelerated approval in patients with previously treated mantle cell lymphoma," said Jane Huang, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, hematology at BeiGene. "CLL or SLL is the most common type of leukemia in adults, and despite the advancements of BTK inhibitor therapy for these cancers, there remains a need for highly selective BTK inhibitors capable of promoting long-term responses, and with a safety profile that is tolerable over time. The results presented here today further demonstrate the potential for BRUKINSA to help people living with these persistent, life-threatening cancers."06:18RCKT Rocket Pharmaceuticals presents "encouraging" preliminary results from its Phase 1 trial of commercial-grade RP-L102 'Process B' for Fanconi Anemia (22.37 )Results presented in the poster highlight preliminary Phase 1 data from two pediatric patients (age 5 and 6 years) who were treated with "Process B" RP-L102 prior to the development of severe bone marrow failure and are in ongoing follow-up. Drug product was successfully manufactured using "Process B" optimization, including transduction enhancers, commercial-grade vector, and modified cell processing. "Process B" drug product is manufactured to commercial grade standards, allowing for consistent drug product across patients and a vector copy number (VCN) two to three fold higher than that administered to optimally-treated "Process A" patients.Once transduced, drug product was infused fresh into patients without any prior conditioning regimen. To evaluate transduction efficiency, an analysis of the proportion of the MMC-resistant colony forming cells was conducted. Both patients exhibited early signs of engraftment based on peripheral blood, VCN and/or MMC-resistance. Preliminary phenotypic correction was also apparent in both patients, as evidenced by stabilization or increases in blood cell lineages. No safety or tolerability issues have been reported.06:18ABBV AbbVie reports new results from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE clinical trial showing the potential of this fixed-duration combination therapy (86.98 )AbbVie announced new data from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE (PCYC-1142) clinical trial, evaluating IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) in combination with VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO (venetoclax) in previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Results showed that patients who received up to 12 cycles of the combination regimen achieved high rates of undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD) in both peripheral blood (PB; 75% of patients) and in bone marrow (BM; 72% of patients). Safety data were consistent with the known safety profiles of IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO used as individual therapies.Results showed uMRD -- defined as less than 1 CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes (MRD<0.01%) by flow cytometry of PB or BM samples -- was achieved at any time after baseline in PB for 75% of patients (122 of 163 patients) and in BM for 72% (111 of 155 patients). The proportion of patients who had uMRD in PB increased over time from 57% after 6 cycles, 68% after 9 cycles, and 73% after 12 cycles of IMBRUVICA plus VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO. The high rates of uMRD in BM were consistent across high-risk subgroups, including in patients with del(17p), del(17p) or TP53 mutation, del(11q), complex karyotype, and unmutated IGHV status. In patients with uMRD in PB with matched BM samples, 93% of patients had uMRD in both PB and BM. With median follow-up of 14.7 months, 3 patients (2%) experienced disease progression.06:17OBSV ObsEva reports positive Phase 3 trial results from PRIMROSE 2 trial of linzagolix for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids (4.57 )The responder rate was 93.9% (p <0.001) for women receiving 200 mg with ABT and 56.7% for women receiving 100 mg without ABT (p <0.001), compared to 29.4% in the placebo group. Both doses achieved significant rates of amenorrhea (p <0.001), reduction in pain (p <0.001), and improvement in quality of life (p <0.001). Additionally, significant improvement (p <0.001) in hemoglobin levels, a reduction in number of days of bleeding and reduction in uterine volume were observed. Furthermore, a significant reduction in fibroid volume was also observed for the 200 mg dose with ABT (p <0.008).The overall safety profile was in line with expectations and confirmed that linzagolix was well-tolerated. The most frequently observed adverse events (occurring in > 5% of patients) were headache, hot flushes, and anemia. Mean percentage change from baseline in BMD was consistent with previous clinical data."We look forward to the results from our second pivotal study, PRIMROSE 1 conducted in the US, in Q2 2020. Assuming positive results, we expect that it would lead to a Marketing Authorization Application submission with the European Medicines Agency by year-end 2020 and a New Drug Application submission with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by Q1 2021."06:16THOR Synthorx to be acquired by Sanofi (SNY) for $68/share in cash (25.03 )Under the terms of the merger agreement, Sanofi will commence a cash tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Synthorx common stock for $68 per share in cash for a total enterprise value of approximately $2.35 billion.

While the DOJ and SEC conduct separate investigations, the same facts have been shared by Ericsson with both authorities. The resolution relates to historical FCPA breaches ending Q1 2017. While the Company had a compliance program and a supporting control framework, they were not adequately implemented. Specifically, certain employees in some markets, some of whom were executives in those markets, acted in bad faith and knowingly failed to implement sufficient controls. They were able to enter into transactions for illegitimate purposes and, together with people under their influence, used sophisticated schemes in order to hide their wrongdoing.Separately, Ericsson agreed to resolve civil charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) relating to allegations of violations of the bribery and accounting provisions of the FCPA. Ericsson agreed to the entry of a judgment enjoining it from future violations of the FCPA and it agreed to pay a financial sanction of $458,380,000, plus pre-judgment interest of $81,540,000.As part of the settlement, Ericsson has agreed to engage an independent compliance monitor for a period of three years while the Company continues to undertake significant reforms to strengthen its Ethics & Compliance program.The combined payment of $1.06 b.

This may just be the calm before the storm considering all the macro-related events set to take place as the week unfolds. S&P Futures saw a relative quiet beginning with only a nine point overnight range. The market is currently trading around the 3144 area, with a high of 3148.50 and a low of 3139.50. In Asia, both China and Japan finished the day marginally higher. The Shanghai struggled to gain much following lighter than expected export data that saw a 1.1% fall in November, compared to a forecast of +0.8%.The Nikkei traded around in a narrow range that culminated with a gain of 0.3%. Heavyweights such as Softbank and Sony both gained more than 1% by day's end. European markets slightly under water. The weaker than expected Export data out of China has likely kept the EU markets in check. Energy names are seeing modest weakness with Crude Oil giving back about 1% in early action.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: -2.010 yr Note: 1.82%USD/JPY: 108.49 -0.07EUR/USD: 1.1067 +0.0007Europe: FTSE -0.2% DAX 0.0% CAC -0.2%Asia: Hang Seng 0.0% Shanghai +0.1% Nikkei +0.3%Gold (1467.40 +2.30) Silver (16.65 +0.05) Crude (58.63 -0.57)17:34WRAPX This week's biggest % gainers/losersThe following are this week's top percentage gainers and losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).This week's top % gainers Healthcare: BOLD (59.25 +104.1%), AUPH (15.44 +94.46%), THOR (25.03 +39.83%), LXRX (4.87 +37.96%), RUBY (10.62 +37.92%), RCKT (22.37 +27.15%), ALLK (117.36 +23.54%), PDCO (23.51 +20.81%)Consumer Discretionary: EXPR (5.49 +39.69%), GCO (48.82 +31.45%), LE (15.05 +27.76%), BIG (25.21 +20.62%)Information Technology: SCWX (15.11 +33.25%), GTT (11.3 +27.4%), DOMO (23.39 +24.41%), DQ (45.71 +20.04%)Financials: EZPW (6.19 +20.9%)Utilities: PCG (9.65 +29.36%)This week's top % losers Healthcare: SAGE (64.46 -58.35%), CLVS (9.61 -35.63%), CARA (16.76 -35.51%), PBYI (7.88 -16.97%), TGTX (7.12 -13.06%), FATE (13.67 -12.48%)Industrials: BE (5.28 -19.02%), EAF (12.29 -12.78%)Consumer Discretionary: HOME (5.67 -33.92%), MIK (6.69 -18.22%), CHS (4.03 -15.51%)Information Technology: ESTC (63.84 -19.61%), PAGS (28.82 -15.09%), MDB (131.17 -11.79%)Utilities: JE (2.1 -22.79%)16:37ALEC Alector presents Phase 1 data on AL002 (19.76 +0.37)Alector today reported safety and biomarker data from the single ascending dose (SAD) phase of the INVOKE Phase 1 study of its product candidate, AL002, in healthy volunteers. AL002 is a monoclonal antibody intended to enhance the activity of TREM2 and is being developed by Alector for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in collaboration with its partner AbbVie (ABBV). The data were presented today at the 12th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) meeting. The AL002 presentation at CTAD showcases the first data in humans showing that a TREM2 activating antibody engages its target and demonstrates downstream activity in the CNS. The data reported today are from the study's SAD phase in 56 healthy adults, who were enrolled into nine escalating dose cohorts. AL002 was found to be generally safe and well-tolerated. AL002 reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) soluble TREM2 in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating proof-of-target engagement in the brain. AL002 elevated a biomarker for microglia activity in the CSF, indicating proof-of-mechanism. The Phase 1b portion of the study in Alzheimer's disease patients is on-going.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD16:19WTRE Watford Holdings agrees to purchase Axeria IARD; terms not disclosed (26.47 +0.25)Axeria IARD is a property and casualty insurance company based in France.

China Car Sharing Market Forecast to 2025 with Profiles of Key operators - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireDecember 10, 2019 Tuesday 9:39 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 915 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Car Sharing Market in China - Forecast to 2025" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.This study analyzes opportunities and challenges in the car sharing market in China. It examines the current market structure and business models, as well as factors that drive and restrain the market growth. It also discusses the growth opportunities and trends up to 2025.The car sharing market in China has approximately 30 active operators. These companies are operated by automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), transportation companies and start-ups. The top 5 operators - EVCard (by SAIC Motor Co., Ltd.), Weigongjiao (by Geely), GoFun (by Beijing Shouqi Group Co., Ltd.), MoreFun (by BAIC Mobility Co., Ltd.) and PandAuto (by Chongqing Lifan Automobile Co., Ltd.) - accounted for 72.8% of the fleet size in 2018.In China, the sharing economic activity has been able to achieve lower cost, lower entry barriers and lower pollution, as well as higher efficiency, higher experience and higher credibility within the industry. Transportation sharing activities, including car sharing and ride sharing, have accounted for 8.4% of the sharing economy in the country in 2018. The Chinese are also gradually shifting towards Internet applications for their transportation needs, such as reserving riding services from mobile apps, finding solutions to traffic blocks, and using real-time navigation and traffic services.The operation charge fee per service is the main revenue generator for car sharing companies. However, the Chinese car sharing market has been undergoing restructuring since 2017. It has witnessed a few exits, such as the withdrawals of Youyouyongche, Ezzy, and Togo, and some collaborations - for instance, BMW AG has collaborated with EVCard, while Daimler Mobility Services GmbH has tied up with Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., Ltd. to carry out car sharing business in the country.In line with the Chinese government's vision of increasing electric vehicle (EV) penetration and promoting green development, automotive OEMs are expected to further expand their EV sales through their subsidiaries in the car sharing industry. For instance, the car sharing market is expected to be more competitive, especially for the vertical value chain and ecosystem integration developed by automotive OEMs and transportation companies.Key Features• To provide a strategic review of the car sharing ecosystem and market, involving main technology trends in China• To analyze the key car sharing operators and their business strategies in China• To identify car sharing market trends, such as strategic alliances and collaborative services• To evaluate the present market size and the growth opportunities for stakeholdersKey Issues Addressed• What is the present business environment for car sharing services?• Who are the key participants in the car sharing market?• What are the present and anticipated trends in the car sharing market?• What are the market drivers and restraints influencing the development of the car sharing market?• What are the policies and regulations established to manage the car sharing business in China?Key Topics Covered:1.

Want OxyContin in China? Pain pill addicts get drugs onlineAssociated Press InternationalDecember 31, 2019 Tuesday 5:21 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWS; Only on APLength: 1463 wordsByline: By ERIKA KINETZ, Associated PressDateline: SHANGHAI BodySHANGHAI (AP) - China has some of the strictest regulation of opioids in the world, but OxyContin and other pain pills are sold illegally online by vendors that take advantage of China's major e-commerce and social media sites, including platforms run by tech giants Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu, the Associated Press found.These black markets supply, among others, opioid users in China who became addicted the same way many Americans did, through a doctor's prescription, the AP found. The government admits that the scale of painkiller abuse within China remains poorly understood, making it difficult to assess abuse risks as pain care improves and China's consumption of opioids rises.______EDITOR'S NOTE: The Associated Press, supported by a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, is investigating the global spread of opioids and its consequences.______According to the latest public figures, just 11,132 cases of medical drug abuse were reported in China in 2016. But reporting is voluntary and drawn from a small sample of institutions including law enforcement agencies, drug rehabilitation centers and some hospitals. The China Food and Drug Administration said in the 2016 report that it was trying to do better but for the time being "the nature of medical drug abuse in the population cannot be confirmed."Wu Yi, a 32-year-old singer, survived cancer only to find he couldn't stop taking OxyContin. He said his doctor told him OxyContin is not addictive and that he could take as much as he needed. Because Wu was never identified as having a substance abuse problem, he is unlikely to have appeared in the government's tally.As his habit worsened, Wu started chewing OxyContin to intensify its effect and downed vast quantities of Chinese liquor and sleeping pills."I feel I am kind of like a drug addict, but I cannot do anything about it," he told AP earlier this year.Despite the officially low numbers, the Chinese government was worried enough about pain pill abuse that it pulled combination opioids from most pharmacies in September. Among the pills targeted was Tylox, made by the drug company Mallinckrodt's subsidiary SpecGx.The risks of opioid abuse in China may be growing as pharmaceutical companies look abroad to make up for falling opioid prescriptions in the U.S. OxyContin has been marketed in China with the same tactics that drove Purdue Pharma into bankruptcy in the U.S. and allegedly helped spark the deadliest drug abuse epidemic in U.S. history, according to interviews with current and former employees and documents published by the Associated Press last month.Purdue Pharma's China affiliate, Mundipharma, has denied allegations of wrongdoing and says it has "checks and balances in place including internal audits and reviews to ensure strict compliance with medical protocols, laws and regulations."U.S. social media platforms, like Facebook and Twitter, have also struggled to stop illicit listings for opioids. As opioid overdose deaths surged past 400,000 in the United States, online trafficking networks, many of which sourced chemicals in China, made it easier to buy black market drugs.But despite China's scrupulous monitoring of online activity, the AP found black markets for OxyContin and other pain pills on the open internet.An AP survey of China's major e-commerce and social media platforms identified thirteen vendors selling opioid painkillers. They often used one platform to draw in customers and another for sales.Eight of them used Tencent's popular WeChat app. Last week, in a closed group for cancer patients on Tencent's QQ app, one person tried to buy OxyContin and another offered to sell Tylox. Two vendors on Zhuan Zhuan, a second-hand marketplace backed by Tencent, offered to sell OxyContin, Tylox, and/or MSContin."We are vigilant against unscrupulous parties making unauthorized use of our platforms and services that include QQ and WeChat to pursue illegal activities," Tencent said in a statement, adding that it encourages users to report illegal activities.58.com, which runs Zhuan Zhuan, didn't respond to requests for comment.On Alibaba's second-hand marketplace, Xianyu, known as Idle Fish in English, AP found seven accounts, which appeared to be run by six different people, offering OxyContin or Tylox.One vendor created a fake storefront on Xianyu to execute transactions. After arranging an OxyContin sale on WeChat, the vendor sent a special link for a product listing on Xianyu for "flowers" that cost the agreed price: 1,200 yuan for 10 boxes of 10mg OxyContin pills. "Tell me when you've paid," the vendor wrote. "Pay before six and ships today."Idle Fish said it removed listings that violated marketplace policies after AP pointed out illicit opioid sales. The company said it prohibits "illegal behavior by third-party sellers on the platform," proactively monitors listings and welcomes user reports to facilitate takedowns.A thread about quitting drugs on Tieba, a forum run by tech giant Baidu, also led to opioid dealers. AP identified one person on Tieba selling OxyContin in December and earlier this year made contact with two other people selling painkillers and sleeping pills. One swore that OxyContin is not addictive and said it makes sex better and gives you an unparalleled "feeling of floating."Baidu said it constantly monitors its platforms keep them free of illegal activity, facilitates user reports of bad behavior and reports infractions to the police.In addition to the active vendors AP identified, Tianya, an internet forum, had dozens of postings by people selling or seeking OxyContin stretching back over several years. Wu, the cancer survivor, said he was offered pills after posting his contact information in a thread about OxyContin on Tianya in April. Tianya didn't respond to requests for comment.To evade detection, sellers used partial names or slang and posted stock photos of things like socks, a cactus or elaborate pink ceiling lamps. Postings often disappeared.The AP did not make any purchases and could not confirm the authenticity of the pills.One significant regulatory loophole in China is that family members try to resell OxyContin left over after a loved one dies.That's what Zhou Shalu did after her mother died of lung cancer and left her with hundreds of 40mg OxyContin pills, worth more than $1,000, sitting on a faux-marble coffee in her living room.The pills had been a lifeline for her mother in her last months, easing a pain so fierce it stopped her from eating, speaking and even opening her eyes. But now Zhou didn't know what to do with them.She was afraid to just throw them in the trash. So she offered the pills at a 35 percent discount in cancer support chat groups and internet forums. A pharmacist, Zhou knew OxyContin could be abused and asked all interested buyers to send her copies of their medical records."No sales to drug dealers," she wrote in an Aug. 29 post offering 20 boxes of 40mg OxyContin on the popular microblogging site Weibo, which has since been deleted.A month after her mother's death, she said she still hadn't found any buyers she considered legitimate.Sina Corp., which runs Weibo, said that after finding violations, it ran a campaign in March to clean-up illicit content about medicines and medical equipment and would continue to improve key word screening and image recognition.In August, the Ningjiang District People's Court in northeastern Jilin province convicted three people of trafficking thousands of pills of OxyContin and MSContin - both slow-release opioids sold by Purdue Pharma's China affiliate, Mundipharma.According to a copy of the judgment, they acquired pills from families who, like Zhou, had extra pain medicine. With online names like "Invincible Benevolent," "Soul Ferryman," and "Little Treasure," the network used WeChat, Xianyu and Zhuan Zhuan to find customers and execute sales, and delivered pills using a major courier service, SF Express. Among the witnesses was a customer who became addicted to opioids after taking them for a toothache and leg pain."Mundipharma China has no knowledge of the diversion of its products on e-commerce and social media platforms," the company said in a statement to AP.Mallinckrodt's specialty generics subsidiary SpecGx sells its pain pills to a Chinese importer. In a statement, the company said it "has no manufacturing, distribution, sales force or in-country presence in China."China's National Narcotics Control Commission and China's National Medical Products Administration did not respond to requests for comment.--Associated Press researcher Chen Si contributed to this report.

THE CHINA CHALLENGE CONTINUES TO MOUNTStates News ServiceNovember 29, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1220 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for the National Interest (former the Nixon Center):While aware that China suppresses freedom of expression within its borders and territories, we are rarely privy to how Beijing's propaganda keeps its citizenry acquiescent. Adopting Orwell's 1984's Newspeak the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) state-run media projects an image of a superior society with even greater safety and freedoms than in the west.Beijing's claims of greater safety are boosted when international headlines tell of multiple mass shootings of children in the USA.The reality though is just as gruesome within its borders; Attack at School in China Leaves at Least 8 Children Dead.For many reasons, American atrocities lead headlines even when the likes of the New York Times recently offered counterbalance: "Since 2018, there have been attacks on schools in Shaanxi Province, Hunan Province and in the cities of Shanghai, Beijing and Chongqing. But the authorities often play down news coverage of such violence out of concern for the potential to threaten social stability."China also has tripled the traffic-related deaths over the Americas as the World Health Organisation (WHO) reported; with 104 vs 33 deaths per 100,000 people respectively. Also, with "traditional" values and inadequate laws and enforcement, there are likely higher levels of unreported domestic violence among China's families.The obscured reality is that CCP governance does not provide more safety than western nations.When it comes to the second claim of more freedom, much-publicized rights violations are occurring; from the steady erosion of rights in Hong Kong, to Big Brother-like control with its Great Firewall for the internet and new digital apps, to forced detention of up to two million Uyghurs in Newspeak cognatic "Vocational Education and Training Centers" human rights violations are becoming more ubiquitous and severe.Uyghur incarceration to these de facto internment camps is justified as a panacea to the July 2009 urumqi riots. The uprising was in retaliation to suppression of freedoms by the state, Han immigrant domination of the economy to suppress Uyghurs economically and sparked by the Shaoguan incident in southern China several days earlier, where at least two Uyghurs had been killed.Most grievous, the Vocational Education and Training Centers are composed of razor wire and bars, provide forced sterilizations of women, and permanent disappearances of entire families. Internment is fostered by the all-data-gathering state-endorsed WeChat messaging service cell phone app. With its multi-purpose capabilities incorporated into necessary daily life WeChat is used daily by over 902 million Chinese.When western democracies condemn China's human rights practices the CCP counters with bluster abroad and repudiation at home, for an autocracy must occupy the rarefied air of superiority to sustain acquiescence.A recent example of propaganda disseminated within China occurred during the recent kerfuffle over NBA Huston Rockets general manager David Morley's "Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong" one Tweet last October.The CCP's retaliation at home was swift and unambiguous. Massive NBA banners were torn down from stadium exteriors in daylight, and CCTV's (China Central Television) blackout out of anticipated NBA entertainment expectations could not be concealed from millions by an Oz-like Media Wizard.To justify conspicuities like these Beijing adopts Orwell's 1984 Newspeak for justification. Rarely reported outside China, as in the following translation, is how Beijing projects righteousness within its borders. This time by the state-run Xinhua News Agency via Sina.com: "It can be seen that there is no so-called freedom of speech in the United States. In fact, in the United States, gender, ethnicity, and religious discrimination are untouchable forbidden places, including, of course, public order."CCP doublespeak is common though and often comes directly from its Chairman Xi Jinping. As evidenced in 2015 when Reuters published Xi's response to President Obama's South China Seas (SCS) concerns: "Relevant construction activity that China is undertaking in the Nansha Islands... there is no intention to militarize," using the Chinese name for the disputed Spratly archipelago.There are now four strategically located former atolls that have been transformed into military airbases. All done against the wishes of peaceful nations within close proximity and holding historical claims to the surrounding waters.While these new bases are far-flung from mainland China, the one-third$5.3 trillion worthof all global maritime trade shipped through the region annually is concerningly near and dear to CCP territorial ambitions. Furthermore, a state-owned oil company estimates the SCS has riches of 125 billion barrels of oil and 500 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to be gained.Recently China's influence has navigated from the geographic to the geopolitical. At the United Nations, Britain, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the United States, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden among 23 states called; on the Chinese government to uphold its national laws and international obligations and commitments to respect human rights, including freedom of religion or belief, in Xinjiang and across China, as described by Reuters. Beijing had to respond, so Belarus' U.N. Ambassador Valentin Rybakov addressed the General Assembly rights committee on behalf of China and 52 other countries, including; Pakistan, Russia, Egypt, Bolivia, Democratic Republic of Congo and Serbia, all nations censured for abuses in Human Rights Watch's 2019 Report, to condone China's rights violations.Looking forward, could some of these countries along China's Belt and Road initiative also adopt the "Vocational Education and Training Center" model to erase their "troublesome" minority populations, furthering Beijing's sway abroad?With the CCP's expanding leverage, economic and otherwise, a conundrum arises. What should or can the West do to ensure the maintenance of peace, the security of borders, and world trade with the rise of Xi's China?Affecting change from within China is challenging. China's Great Firewall shields the worldwide web's influence and state-controlled media feeds the CCP's Orwellian narrative. Should individuals cross the ever drifting censorship line online, on their cloistered social media or otherwise, severe consequences Are often meted out to the individual or their family, whether articulated within China or abroad. And with eyes and ears of state managing phones and apps, utilized by all, obedience to oppressive CCP style governance is won and maintained.There have been many adventurous predictions of China's pending economic collapse over the past two decades. As observed by TIME: "CCP legitimacy has been inextricably linked to economic growth and raising the living standards of the Chinese people." Would economic downfall spark an uprising to overthrow the CCP, just as Mao inspired overthrow of the KMT Nationalists in the late 1940s?Or must the West grin and bear this current version of China and hope for the best?Wayne Pajunen is a consultant, writer and former political aide at Canada's House of Commons.Load-Date: November 30, 2019End of Document

Hong Kong vs the Chilling BlizzardThe Delta Statement: Delta State UniversityNovember 22, 2019 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1638 wordsByline: Trey WrightBodyThe video game company Blizzard has been in a lot of hot water over the past month. At the end of a Hearthstone tournament in China, Blizzard banned the winner for shouting "Free Hong Kong." Blizzard has received major backlash because of this, and people became very angry with Blizzard for two main reasons. The first: Blizzard refused to give an actual apology to Blitzchung. The second: Blizzard's actions made it seem as if they were siding with China so that they could get a part of their massive market. What HappenedOn October 6, at the Hearthstone's Grandmasters Asia- Pacific Tournament, a player by the name of Wai Chung (AKA: Blitzchung) made it to grand finals and won the tournament. During his post-game interview, he donned a gas mask, similar to those used by the Chinese protestors in Hong Kong, and shouted, "Restore Hong Kong, revolution in our time."The two casters did not respond and simply hid themselves from the camera. The broadcast was then immediately cut and went to commercial.Blizzard responded to Blitzchung's actions by revoking his prize money, and banning him from entering any Hearthstone tournament for one year. They claim that he violated the 2019 Hearthstone Grandmasters Official Competition Rules section 6.1 (o) which states:"Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard's sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player's prize total to $0 USD, in addition to other remedies which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzard's Website Terms." Blizzard also proceeded to fire the two casters that interviewed Blitzchung. News of this event quickly spread across the internet, and fans soon began to express their anger towards Blizzard's approach on the matter. Blizzard responded by releasing a message on October 12 regarding their actions towards the matter. They said that Blitzchung used his winner's interview to promote his "personal beliefs" instead of talking about the game.  "Over the weekend, Bitzchung used his segment to make a statement about the situation in Hong Kong-in violation of rules he acknowledged and understood, and this is why we took action."Many people read this quote and saw it as Blizzard saying that "by wearing the mask and shouting 'Revolution!'" Blitzchung is offending others and making Blizzard look bad, which is a violation of the rules. Of course the "people that are being offended," in this case are corrupt Chinese government officials. And this only painted a bigger target for Blizzard. Now people are starting to believe that Blizzard supports the Chinese government like many other american companies such as Apple and the NBA.After a lot of push-back, Blizzard eventually returned the prize money to Blitzchung and reduced his suspension to six months.Blizzard's "First" responseIn their response on Oct. 12, Blizzard tries their best to sound reasonable and fair in their remarks. But unbeknownst to most people, this was actually Blizzard's second response on the matter.On October 8, just two days after the tournament, Blizzard's official Chinese twitter account posted a message that translates as follows:"We are very angered and disappointed at what happened at the event and do not condone it in any way. We also highly object the spreading of personal political beliefs in this manner. Effective immediately we've banned the contestant from events and terminated work with the broadcasters. We will always respect and defend the pride of our country." This post struck a chord with a lot of people online. Unlike the second post, this first response is much more serious and angry. And to make things even worse for Blizzard, this post paints them to be prideful allies of the Chinese government.Blizzard Fights BackAs soon as word got out about Blitzchung, fans flocked to the official Blizzard forums to discuss their views and opinions on the matter. Blizzard knew that if more people talked about Blitzchung the worse they were going to look. So they came up with a solution to combat these forum posts. If you posted anything about Blitzchung, China, Hong Kong etc. your account would be banned"FOR 1000 YEARS!" Yes, people were actually met with a message that read, "Your account has been banned until 3019.To no one's surprise, this backfired tremendously for Blizzard. This led to Blizzard fans and Hong Kong protestors uniting together in order to tarnish Blizzard's name any way they could.The Fans Fight BackHundreds of players deleted their Blizzard accounts to send a message to the company. In response to this, Blizzard sent a message right back. Due to the immense loss of their player base, Blizzard went to work and made it so thatno one from that point on could delete their Blizzard account. This "wise" move prompted players to go back to the drawing board and rethink their strategy. Although no official solution has been found, many players have come up with their own solutions. These solutions range anywhere from, "complaining about Blizzard online," to "logging on to their Blizzard games and saying the N-word until Blizzard bans them for them."  ...Chinese protesters also joined in by spreading a photo-shopped picture of Mei from Overwatch wearing a Free Hong Kong mask. Their goal was to make Mei a symbol of the Free Hong Kong movement which would in turn force the Chinese government to ban Blizzard products in China. Although it didn't fully work out, it did do a great job at spreading their cause....The hatred that Blizzard received over this incident was not just limited to people over the internet. A handful of Blizzard employees joined in on the protests as well. Outside of Blizzard's main office in Irvine, California lies a statue of an orc with various phrases written around it. In an act of protest, some unknown employees covered up phrases such as "think globally" and "Every voice matters."And Blizzard's employees didn't stop there. To show their support towards the Hong Kong movement, some employees staged a walk-out protest around the same statue. They all held umbrellas to symbolize how Chinese protestors use umbrellas to shield themselves from teargas. Lastly, as if things couldn't possibly get any worse for Blizzard, this whole ordeal just so happened to take place weeks before Blizzcon. People came from all over the country and even the world to show their support towards Hong Kong. There were Mei cosplayers wearing masks, people selling "Free Hong Kong" t-shirts and, of course, people came dressed as Winnie the Pooh. Blizzard's Response at Blizzcon  On November 1, during Blizzcon's opening ceremony, Blizzard President J. Allen Brack came out to address the ongoing Blitzchung incident. He responded with, "We moved too quickly in our decision, and then, to make matters worse, we were too slow to talk with all of you. We didn't live up to the high standards we set for ourselves. We failed in our purpose."Brack continued:"I am sorry and I accept accountability. What exactly is our purpose? BlizzCon is demonstrating it as we speak. We aspire to bring the world together in epic entertainment. I truly believe in the positive power of video games.When we get it right, we create a common ground where the community comes together to compete, connect, and play, irrespective of the things that divide us. BlizzCon has people from 59 countries all around the world at the show today. That is amazing. That is the positive power of video games - to transcend divisions around us. We will do better going forward. But our actions are going to matter more than any of these words. As you walk around this weekend, I hope it's clear how committed we are to people expressing themselves.We've seen many of you expressing yourselves this morning. Today you're going to see a lot of the hard work of the Blizzard team. I am personally so proud of what we are building and I hope you love it too. Thank you for joining us."Attendees initially replied to Brack's statement with applause and praise. But fans began to speculate Brack's remarks as the weekend went on. They claim that Blizzard's words were "lies," "empty words" and above all else "non sincere." People's main complaint with the response was that Blizzard never mentioned Blitzchung or China by name. It seemed as if they were trying to act sincere without actually supporting either side. This way they could still work with the Chinese government while looking as though they care about the people. Fans were also angered by the fact that they did not apologize to Blitzchung or even shed light on his punishment. Blitzchung and ChinaOn October 31, the Professional esports organization Tempo Storm announced that they would be adding Blitzchung to their Hearthstone team. Tempo Storm CEO Andrey Yanyuk mentions in an interview that, "We believe first and foremost in supporting players and encouraging them to engage and to speak out on the things about which they are most passionate... In many ways, we value the character and integrity of our players as much as, if not more than, their tournament placings. Blitzchung brings incredible talent, an infectious personality, and a great deal of enthusiasm, for Hearthstone as well as his community and others around him. He exemplifies what Tempo believes in, and we welcome him as an ambassador for our brand."These protests regarding Hong Kong and China are not a recent phenomenon, and have been going on for quite some time. For a more in depth look into why these protests started I recommend watching this quick video by Vox. They go into great detail on the history of Hong Kong's legal system and why the passing of a bill could jeopardize their freedom.https://youtu.be/6_RdnVtfZPYLoad-Date: November 22, 2019End of Document

PORTMAN COLUMN: OUR TAX DOLLARS SHOULDN'T GO TO FUEL CHINA'S RISEStates News ServiceNovember 21, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 705 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Ohio Senator Rob Portman:When U.S. taxpayers send their hard-earned money to the government, they shouldn't worry that it's being used to fuel economic and military growth in China. But that's exactly what's happening today. Every year, more than $150 billion in U.S. taxpayer money goes towards cutting-edge research conducted at our excellent network of universities and research institutions, helping us remain the global leader in science and technology. However, based on an eight-month bipartisan investigation by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations that I chair, China has worked to exploit our U.S. research systems for their own gain. Our report reveals how the American taxpayer has, in effect, unwittingly footed the bill for research that has gone to China to advance national security and economic interests over the past two decades while our own federal agencies have done little to stop it.Our investigation found that the Chinese government has used more than 200 so-called 'talent programs,' most notably their 'Thousand Talents Plan' to recruit American scientists and researchers to strategically acquire intellectual property from both America's public and private sectors, including advances in artificial intelligence and 5G technology.Since 2008, China has used its Thousand Talents Plan with large salaries and "shadow labs" to recruit more than 7,000 researchers from institutions in the U.S. and elsewhere. In exchange, these researchers sign legally binding contracts that can require them to hide their participation in the program from their research institution. This runs counter to U.S. regulations requiring federal grant recipients to disclose any funding they receive from non-U.S. sources. What's worse, the contracts sometimes require the researchers to acquire research from their government-funded labs and transfer it to China. In one case we found, a Thousand Talents Plan member used research created at a U.S. lab to file a patent under the name of a Chinese company, effectively stealing the U.S. government-funded research and claiming it for China.These talent recruitment programs are a win-win for China. First, U.S. taxpayers are funding this research, not China. Second, China uses that research it would not otherwise have to advance its own economic and military interest. The federal government has been aware of this problem for years, but has done nothing to correct it.Despite China publicly announcing the Thousand Talents Plan in 2008, it was not until last year that FBI headquarters took control of the response to the threat posed by the program. In response to our report, the FBI admitted that they wished that they had "taken more rapid and comprehensive action in the past" to address these talent programs.Likewise, the State Department, which issues visas to foreign researchers who can be Thousand Talents members, rarely denies visas to those it thinks may steal our research.Meanwhile, despite spending more than $150 billion of taxpayer money per year funding research and development, our federal grant-making agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Energy, and the National Science Foundation, don't coordinate how they award, track, and monitor those funds. That leaves our research dollars vulnerable.U.S. universities and research institutions must also take some responsibility for this problem. If universities can vet employees for scientific rigor or allegations of plagiarism, they can also vet for financial conflicts of interests and foreign sources of funding. These are complicated risks that the U.S. research community and the federal government must better understand.I am pleased to see that the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy has been a leader in working with federal agencies and U.S. research institutions to help them better respond to these threats. I plan to work with the White House, national research agencies, universities, and the State Department on legislative solutions to protect our research. I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to stop China's exploitation of our taxpayer-supported research.Load-Date: November 21, 2019End of Document

China Backs Off New Tariffs After 'Phase One' DealTheStreet.comDecember 16, 2019 Monday 11:44 AM EDTCopyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 497 wordsByline: Adam SmithHighlight: Following the breakthrough in trade talks leading up to the weekend, China halts some retaliatory fees on U.S. imports to that nation slated for Sunday.BodyFollowing the agreement of the "phase one" trade deal between Beijing and Washington, China has further halted tariffs that were planned on some U.S. imports to the nation.The import fees were supposed to be raised on products Sunday, according to a story by national news outlet Xinhua that was posted on China's State Council website on Sunday. Some existing tariffs on U.S. imports to China will remain in place, just as the U.S. will keep in place its existing tariffs ranging from 7.5% to 25% on about $370 billion of Chinese imports.But the proposed tariffs, which were supposed to be in retaliation to U.S. fees on Chinese imports to the U.S., would have included new fees on U.S. autos and parts. It would also have included tariffs on corn and other grains, according to Reuters. Washington was also planning to up tariffs on $160 billion worth of Chinese imports by Sunday, but changed course after a  . "This is totally done, absolutely" U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told CBS News' "Face the Nation" on Sunday about the deal that is set to be signed next month, pending some ironing out of the language and translation. "The Chinese side hopes that the two sides will work together on the basis of equality and mutual respect to properly address each other's core concerns and promote the stable development of Sino-US economic and trade relations," Xinhua quoted the Chinese government as saying.On the same day, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on FOX News' Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo that he viewed the existing 25% tariffs on $250 billion on Chinese imports as "insurance" to keep China in compliance with a deal. "We have adjusted trade tariffs down, the December 15th tariffs, and part of the September tariffs, we will still have $250 billion and 25 percent, which I look at as a bargaining and an insurance policy," Kudlow said, according to a transcript provided by Fox. Bartiromo probed whether the U.S. was actually able to secure any intellectual property safeguards through a trade deal, following new Chinese cyber security rules limiting the ability of foreign companies to encrypt data."Well, look. We will see," said Kudlow. "There's a large IP chapter in this deal and there's also a large forced technology transfer chapter in this deal. I don't think we know enough about these new Chinese rules and we'll have to look at that and by the way if they do violate then of course we will take action. That's part of the enforcement mechanism in the deal. But look, to take a look at what's actually there, you know, in the intellectual property theft chapter, counterfeiting, stealing tradable goods, that is going to be front and center. There's a whole process now where if you go out and you start stealing goods or as I say, counterfeiting goods, that's going to come under an enforcement process, multi-stages, individual companies..."Correction: Xinhua was misspelled in an earlier version of this story.Load-Date: December 17, 2019End of Document

American National Standards Institute Hosts Delegation From China's National Medical Products AdministrationTargeted News ServiceDecember 4, 2019 Wednesday 7:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 591 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyThe American National Standards Institute issued the following news release:On November 22, 2019, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) hosted a bilateral meeting with a delegation from China's National Medical Products Administration (NMPA). Under the newly formed State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), NMPA is the Chinese regulatory body for Chinese drugs and medical devices and has the responsibility of developing production standards for medical devices to ensure quality and safety. Led by Wang Zhexiong, the director-general of NMPA's department of medical device supervision, the delegation was invited by the United States Trade and Development Agency (USTDA). U.S. industry representatives had the opportunity to showcase their technologies and capabilities, as well as discuss opportunities for partnership and collaboration.During the meeting, the Chinese delegation met with ANSI staff from the international development team and China program, as well as representatives from the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI), an ANSI member and accredited standards developer.The meeting promoted dialogue on U.S. and Chinese standardization, consensus standards, and risk management in medical devices. ANSI spoke about the U.S. standardization system and China program activities. Joseph Lewelling, AAMI's vice president of emerging technology and health IT, provided background on AAMI's role in medical device standardization. He discussed the U.S. process for medical device standardization and described the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) committees and subcommittees that AAMI administers. Subject matter expert Patty-Krantz-Zuppan from Medtronic led a presentation on IEC 62304, the international standard on medical device software and risk management. NMPA's Mu Ruihong provided an introduction of medical device standards management in China.The presentations sparked conversation on the differences and similarities in medical device standard development, which helped both countries see how they could better collaborate in the future. In addition, each group discussed potential future challenges of medical device standardization, especially the complexity of standards for health IT. This bilateral meeting increased knowledge sharing and established a propitious foundation for the continuation of U.S.-Chinese collaboration with medical device standardization.Since 2018, the Chinese government has proactively reorganized its regulatory oversight and introduced several policies to regulate the medical device industry. Through the USTDA-funded U.S.-China Standards and Conformity Assessment Cooperation Program, ANSI coordinated and co-organized two medical device standardization workshops in partnership with NMPA and the U.S medical device industry in 2018 and 2019. These workshops aimed to help U.S. industry navigate pre-market registrations and testing requirements, discuss the interplay between voluntary standards and market approval in the U.S., and highlight the latest progress on standards development for medical robotics in China, the U.S., and around the world. Additionally, ANSI maintains a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the National Institutes for Food and Drug Control (NIFDC) in China. The MOU facilitates dialogue for information exchange on the standards systems and processes related to the U.S. and China.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6945984 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 4, 2019End of Document

CRU: China's Changing Coal Landscape Crucial to Global Urea OutlookPR NewswireNovember 28, 2019 Thursday 4:00 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 597 wordsDateline: LONDON, Nov. 28, 2019 BodyPR NewswireChina is arguably the most important country for the urea industry, accounting for 34% of global urea capacity and 10% of global trade in 2019. Chinese exports are also more influential than the volume alone suggests, as they supply the marginal tonnes to the market and as a result set the floor price of urea globally when the market is oversupplied.While natural gas is the primary feedstock for nitrogen producers around the world, most Chinese nitrogen capacity uses coal (anthracite and bituminous) as feedstock, meaning it is exposed to China's increasingly strict policies around air pollution and the environment. In September 2019, analysts from CRU's nitrogen team conducted a tour of Chinese nitrogen plants in the provinces of Anhui, Sichuan and Yunnan, to research how these policy changes are influencing urea output and future investments.The nitrogen industry in China is undergoing a restructuring process. The strict environmental mandates outlined above are hitting high-cost, anthracite coal-based producers hardest. The regulations necessitate permanent capacity closures, idling of capacity during the winter-heating season and significant capital investments to switch from fixed-bed gasification technologies to more energy-conserving technologies.The strict environmental controls have incentivised new supply among the lower-cost, more efficient bituminous coal-based nitrogen producers, with Chinese 'marginal' urea exports expected to be increasingly supplied by these producers. These plants are lower down the cost curve and present downside risk to global urea prices. This insight highlights the key takeaways from CRU's site visits and our expectations for the Chinese urea market going forward.More efficient low-cost coal, not natural gas, is replacing anthracite coal capacityFertilizer producers in China have come under increased scrutiny on emissions and pollution over the last five years. Despite lower commodity prices and a slowing of economic growth in China more recently, this scrutiny remains in place. The Chinese government has now implemented a range of policies affecting the nitrogen industry and producers are investing more to control their emissions. Permanent capacity closures are expected to accelerate in the near-term as a result.Read the full story:https://www.crugroup.com/knowledge-and-insights/insights/2019/china-s-changing-coal-landscape-crucial-to-global-urea-outlook/Read more about CRU:http://bit.ly/About_CRUAbout CRUCRU offers unrivalled business intelligence on the global metals, mining and fertilizer industries through market analysis, price assessments, consultancy and events.Since our foundation by Robert Perlman in 1969, we have consistently invested in primary research and robust methodologies, and developed expert teams in key locations worldwide, including in hard-to-reach markets such as China.CRU employs over 280 experts and has more than 11 offices around the world, in Europe, the Americas, China, Asia and Australia - our office in Beijing opened in 2004 and Singapore in 2018.When facing critical business decisions, you can rely on our first-hand knowledge to give you a complete view of a commodity market.

MALAYSIA APPOINTS UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE TO PROBE CHINA'S ALLEGED ABUSES AGAINST UYGHURSStates News ServiceDecember 31, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 584 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Malaysia has appointed an international institute at a local university to prepare a study examining reports about alleged rights abuses committed by Beijing against Uyghur Muslims in China's Xinjiang region, Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah said Monday.The government has selected the International Institute of Islamic Thought and Civilization (ISTAC) in Kuala Lumpur to study and verify the news reports on the alleged repression of the Uyghur community in Xinjiang, China, the state-run Bernama news service reported, citing Saifuddin.A foreign ministry official who sought anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service, that the minister made the statement during a public event in Pahang, east of Kuala Lumpur."Malaysia will neither blindly support any reports provided by the Chinese government nor openly criticize China," the English daily New Straits Times quoted Saifuddin as telling reporters. "We want to ensure the truth behind each and every report that we receive about the incidents there."ISTAC is housed at the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM), a campus established in the 1980s in Selangor state with the goal of becoming a leading international research center in the field of Islamic thought, culture and civilization, according to the university's website. Malaysia, along with several other Muslim-majority countries, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, Bangladesh and Pakistan, were co-sponsors of the university when it was founded.Saifuddin also recalled that during his meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Sept. 12, he promised that Malaysia "will adopt a civilized approach" about the controversy around the plight of the Uyghurs, which includes reports that Beijing began locking up 1.8 million Uyghurs and other Muslims at internment camps in Xinjiang."We need to verify this, including the Uyghur separatist movements at the Xinjiang province and whether there were elements of terrorism in the issue," the minister said, according to the New Straits Times.China began incarcerating Uyghurs in a vast network of internment camps in April 2017 over accusations that members of the minority Muslim group harbored "strong religious views" and "politically incorrect" ideas.Saifuddin's comments came after China's ambassador, Bai Tian, denounced pro-Uyghur protests that took place outside the Chinese Embassy in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday and Friday. Hundreds of demonstrators waved banners and signs urging China to "stop genocide of ethnic Uyghurs.""We will never accept irresponsible, utterly groundless accusations based on falsehoods," the Chinese envoy said Sunday.He made the statement days after Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad appeared to have taken a tougher stance, as he vowed not to extradite Uyghurs who seek refuge in his country.Although Beijing initially denied the existence of internment camps, China has tried to change the discussion, describing the facilities as "boarding schools" that provide vocational training for Uyghurs, discourage radicalization and help protect the country from terrorism."If Uyghurs are fleeing to Malaysia to seek asylum, Malaysia will not extradite them even if there is an application from China," Mahathir said. "They are allowed to go to the third country because they have valid fears over their safety."Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Load-Date: December 31, 2019End of Document

Didn't get billions in financial aid from Chinese govt: HuaweiStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeDecember 28, 2019 SaturdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MARKETS; Pg. 1Length: 456 wordsByline: Jean GarciaBodyThe company was also able to save as much as $25 billion in taxes between 2008 and 2018 thanks to incentives aimed at China's tech companies, and $2 billion on land purchases.In this sense, the chinese manufacturer, designated by Washington as a potential threat to national security, explained that all chinese technology companies have the right to receive subsidies provided that they comply with some conditions and has stated that in the past ten years, Huawei has received public subsidies at an amount of less than 0.3% of the total annual revenue and 0.2% in the case of 2018.It posted a long rebuttal accusing the Journal of using "false information" and a pattern of biased reporting, though it did not substantiate those allegations. The government, reportedly, used its influence to get Huawei a deal with Pakistan by offering the country a $124.7 million loan through the Export-Import Bank of China with minimal interests and a 20-year payout period.But Huawei said the story is based on "false information and poor reasoning", adding that it may take legal action following several "disingenuous" articles in the paper. Others' opinion is that the rise of Huawei to the top of the telecom industry was remarkably backed by the Chinese government's tax breaks/financial aid and policy favoring local traders of both the smartphones and telecom equipment and other network-connected devices.The total is $74.6 billion."This article speculates wildly about how Huawei has become what it is today", the company said in a lengthy statement.Ryan Reynolds Confirms Deadpool 3 Under Marvel StudiosHollywood superstar Ryan Reynolds just gave everyone something to get extra excited about as 2019 begins to fade away. Ryan Reynolds has said that he and his teams are in talks with Marvel.It requires so much effort to build backdoors into networking equipment that work across different global communications networks and system configurations that it likely is easier and more effective to bribe a telco executive, says Huawei's chief cybersecurity officer.As most of you know by now, Huawei was placed on a U.S. government blacklist in May.Meng Wanzhou at a court appearance in September 2019. The company has been trying its best to secure licenses to continue its dealings with American companies, going as far as suing the FTC and the FCC for allegedly imposing unlawful restrictions that are based on politics as opposed to real evidence. The company has repeatedly denied that it would do that.On December 26, Huawei responded.Despite this, Huawei has maintained its dominant market position.Some of the specific figures uncovered by WSJ include $46 billion in loans, credit lines and other financial aid from state lenders.Load-Date: December 29, 2019End of Document

Preclinical studies in a non-human primate (NHP) model showed that the combination of FSI-174 and magrolimab significantly depleted hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from the bone marrow, with no dose limiting toxicities. The data will be presented in a poster session at the 61st American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.In the preclinical data presented at ASH, FSI-174 demonstrated binding affinity to both human and NHP cKIT receptors, and induced phagocytosis as well as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, FSI-174 was well-tolerated when administered to NHPs as a single agent, with no dose-limiting toxicities. The no-observed-adverse-effect level was established at 50 mg/kg, the highest dose tested. When administered together, FSI-174 and magrolimab demonstrated a synergistic benefit, promoting the highest level of phagocytosis of cKIT expressing target cells and inducing significant HSC depletion nine days after infusion compared to placebo.Forty Seven expects to complete investigational new drug-enabling studies by the end of 2019, and subject to approval of the IND by the FDA, plans to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating FSI-174 in healthy volunteers in the first quarter of 2020.10:39MRK Merck and Seven and Eight BioPharmaceuticals sign clinical research collaboration agreement (88.59 -0.26)Seven and Eight BioPharmaceuticals has signed a clinical research collaboration agreement with Merck, through a subsidiary, to explore the combination of Seven and Eight's BDB001, an immune modulator targeting toll-like receptors (TLR) 7 and 8, and Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), in treating patients with advanced solid tumors. Under the terms of the agreement, Seven and Eight will sponsor and be responsible for the conduct of the clinical study.10:36ATRA Atara Biotherapeutics reports updated long-term clinical results from multicenter Expanded Access Protocol study of tab-cel for patients with EBV+ PTLD (14.72 +0.73)Atara Biotherapeutics presented long-term clinical results from a multicenter Expanded Access Protocol (EAP) study of tab-cel (tabelecleucel) for patients with Epstein-Barr virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (EBV+ PTLD) at the ASH Annual Meeting & Exposition. Results from this analysis demonstrate a high overall response rate , short time to response and favorable estimated long-term overall survival rates for tab-cel in patients with EBV+ PTLD following hematopoietic cell transplant or solid organ transplant who have failed rituximab-based therapy. Tab-cel was generally well-tolerated in all patients with EBV+ PTLD and other EBV-associated diseases.Safety analyses were presented for all patients treated with tab-cel (n=61; n=26 EBV+ PTLD and n=35 patients with other EBV-associated diseases). Consistent with prior studies, tab-cel was generally well-tolerated in all patients, and no tab-cel related adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred. Three graft versus host disease adverse events were reported, all in patients with prior allogeneic HCT. No other adverse events of special interest including cytokine release syndrome were reported.Median time to response of one month was seen in both EBV+ PTLD patient cohorts. In responders, two-year estimated overall survival rate was 86% for HCT (n=7) and 100% for SOT (n=10) with no patient deaths attributable to PTLD progression. Similar outcomes were observed in the EAP-201 subgroup of EBV+ PTLD patients (n=22) with adequate ECOG performance status, no CNS disease and no PLTD-related ventilatory support who would have likely met the eligibility criteria for Atara's ongoing tab-cel Phase 3 studies. Overall response rate was 55% and 82%, with a two-year estimated overall survival of 79% and 81%, in the HCT (n=11) and SOT (n=11) cohorts, respectively.10:32ACHN Achillion Pharma reports "positive" data from Phase 2 dose-finding study of danicopan at ASH (6.19 +0.02)Achillion Pharma today reported top-line data from a dose-finding Phase 2 trial assessing the safety and effectiveness of its oral small molecule factor D inhibitor danicopan (ACH-4471) in combination with intravenous eculizumab in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) patients who have an inadequate response to C5 monotherapy.The primary endpoint of the trial was an increase in hemoglobin from baseline. A mean increase of 2.4 g/dL at 24 weeks of treatment was achieved in this proof-of-concept trial. Danicopan, in combination with eculizumab, resulted in a significant reduction in blood transfusions with 10 patients receiving 34 transfusions (58 units) in the 6 months prior to screening to 1 patient receiving 1 transfusion (2 units) during the 24-week trial.In addition to improvements in hemoglobin and transfusions, there were also meaningful improvements in markers of hemolysis including bilirubin, reticulocytes, and PNH red blood clone size (%).In this clinical trial, danicopan was generally well tolerated. All treatment emergent adverse events were considered mild to moderate in severity except for Grade 3 severe adverse events that occurred in two patients. Both patients had resolution of their events, remained on danicopan, and completed the study.The company plans to initiate a global Phase 3 trial in early 2020.10:28NKTR Nektar Therapeutics announces presentation of new preclinical data for NKTR-255 at ASH (22.25 +1.80)NKTR-255 is an interleukin-15 (IL-15) receptor agonist that is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical study in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Details of the preclinical data presentations at ASH are as follows and are available on the scientific section of Nektar's website."The preclinical data being recognized at ASH demonstrate NKTR-255's promise in hematological malignancies through its potential to restore both NK cell and memory CD8 T cell compartments in patients," said Loui Madakamutil, Ph.D., SVP and Head of Discovery and Research at Nektar Therapeutics. "In studies presented by the laboratory of Dr. Nikhil Munshi at Dana-Farber, NKTR-255 enhanced the number and function of NK and CD8+ effector memory T cell populations in peripheral blood and bone marrow from patients with multiple myeloma and, also increased expression of activating receptors found on those NK cells. Separately, researchers from the laboratory of Dr. Cameron Turtle at Fred Hutchinson demonstrated NKTR-255 prevented tumor growth and increased survival of CAR T cells when added to a CD19-targeted CAR T cell regimen in models of B cell lymphoma. This preclinical data reinforces the basis of our ongoing clinical trial evaluating the potential of NKTR-255 in patients with multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."10:23XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (59.57 -0.18)The energy sector (-0.3%) displays relative weakness in the early going of today's session. Today's early underperformance comes after the sector gained 1.5% last week, finishing ahead of the remaining ten groups. Factors contributing to the underperformance:Pressure on the price of oil. WTI crude is down $0.27, or 0.5%, at $58.93/bbl. Granted, the energy component has climbed off its overnight low of $58.23 in recent trade, but it remains in negative territory, weighing on the energy sector. China reported a smaller than expected trade surplus for November, which supports the argument that the Chinese economy continues slowing down. This will continue posing a headwind to global growth. Pullback after last week's show of relative strength.Notable movers:Marathon Petroleum (MPC 58.95, -1.26, -2.1%): weakest sector component after being downgraded to Neutral from Overweight at JP Morgan. Chevron (CVX 117.27, -0.74, -0.6%): downgraded to Neutral from Buy at Citigroup. HollyFrontier (HFC 50.40, -0.54, -1.1%): trading at a three-month low. Occidental Petroleum (OXY 37.71, -0.51, -1.3%): on the verge of falling to a fresh 2019 low. Chevron (CVX 117.31, -0.70, -0.6%): looking to remain above its 50-day moving average (117.39). Baker Hughes (BKR 22.64, +0.43, +1.9%): showing relative strength in a weak sector.10:19CNST Constellation Pharmaceuticals provides updated preliminary data from MANIFEST clinical trial with CPI-0610 (56.82 +13.12)MANIFEST is an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of the company's bromodomain and extra-terminal domain protein inhibitor CPI-0610 in patients with myelofibrosis (MF). Arm 3 is evaluating CPI-0610 in combination with ruxolitinib in JAK-inhibitor-nave MF patients. Arms 1 and 2 are studying CPI-0610 as a monotherapy or in combination with ruxolitinib in ruxolitinib-resistant or -intolerant MF patients. Results include:Preliminary data showed continuing signs of activity across a broad range of parameters, suggesting possible disease-modifying effects of CPI-0610.In the first-line treatment arm, 12 out of 15 (80%) evaluable JAK-inhibitor-nave patients treated with a CPI-0610 / ruxolitinib combination achieved at least a 35% spleen volume response (SVR35) at 12 weeks. The median percent change in spleen volume reduction was -49.7%. Ten out of 14 (71%) evaluable patients achieved at least a 50% improvement in Total Symptom Score (TSS50) at 12 weeks. The median percent change in TSS at 12 weeks was -60.3%.Clinical activity, including SVR35 responses, TSS50 responses, and conversion from transfusion dependence to transfusion independence, was seen at 24 weeks in patients in the second-line treatment arm who added CPI-0610 to ruxolitinib, suggesting that treatment with CPI-0610 may have durable effects.CPI-0610 in combination with ruxolitinib in JAK-inhibitor-nave patients was generally well tolerated. No adverse events led to study discontinuation. Three patients (10%) had greater than or equal to Grade 3 anemia. One patient (3.3%) had Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, which was reversible. CPI-0610 as monotherapy or in combination with ruxolitinib in ruxolitinib-refractory or -intolerant patients (Arms 1 and 2) was generally well tolerated. The most common hematologic adverse event was thrombocytopenia.Constellation continues to enroll patients in MANIFEST. As a result of encouraging preliminary data, Constellation expanded Arm 3 of MANIFEST for JAK-inhibitor-nave patients from 43 to up to 101 patients. The company also expanded Cohort 2A, for TD ruxolitinib-resistant or -intolerant patients adding CPI-0610 to ruxolitinib, from 16 to up to 60 patients. Constellation has started planning for a randomized, active-controlled, pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial studying the combination of CPI-0610 and ruxolitinib versus ruxolitinib and placebo in JAK-inhibitor-nave patients with MF. The company expects this clinical trial to start in 2020.An investor event to discuss the MANIFEST update at ASH is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. EST today.10:18AGIO Agios Pharma presents updated data for mitapivat from extension phase of DRIVE PK Phase 2 study in patients with pyruvate kinase deficiency (44.64 +3.70)Agios Pharma today reported new data from the extension phase of the DRIVE PK Phase 2 study of mitapivat (AG-348) in adults with pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency at the 2019 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.In the extension phase, patients treated with mitapivat doses >25 mg twice daily in the core period undergo a dose taper and continue on a dose that maintained their Hb level at no lower than 1.0 g/dL below their pre-taper level. As of the March 27, 2019 data cutoff, 18 of the 36 patients remain in the extension phase with a median treatment duration of 35.6 months (range 28.7-41.9). For the 18 patients in the extension phase, improvements in hemoglobin and other markers of hemolysis including reticulocytes, indirect bilirubin, and haptoglobin achieved during the core period were sustained during the extension period up to 42 months, as of the data cutoff. Adverse events for patients who continued in the study (n=18) were comparable in the core and extension periods. In the extension, the most common AEs were headache (39%), insomnia (28%), fatigue (28%), and nasopharyngitis (28%). No new safety signals were identified in the extension period.The cumulative safety profile, says the company, continues to support long-term twice daily dosing of mitapivat.Mitapivat is an investigational, first-in-class, oral, small molecule allosteric activator of wild-type and a variety of mutated pyruvate kinase-R (PKR) enzymes that directly targets the underlying metabolic defect in PK deficiency, a rare, potentially debilitating, hemolytic anemia. In addition, data was shared from the Agios-sponsored Natural History Study of PK deficiency that detailed the comorbidities and complications associated with the disease and the impact of transfusion history.10:13OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:CLF Dec 9 calls are seeing interest following positive mention in Barrons with 3720 contracts trading vs. open int of 1570, pushing implied vol up around 6 points to ~50%.

The study was designed in two parts: Part A to establish an initial priming dose with flat dosing regimens and Part B to escalate dosing on subsequent administrations to the priming dose. Prophylactic treatment for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was mandated prior to each dose of XmAb13676. XmAb13676 was generally well tolerated, and a priming dose of 45 mcg/kg was chosen for continued dose escalation in Part B for patients with NHL. Safety was evaluated in all 53 patients. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were pyrexia (55%), CRS (53%), and anemia (41%). CRS was more frequent and generally higher grade on the first dose. Three patients (6%) experienced Grade 3 or 4 CRS on the first dose, all prior to the implementation of step-up dosing. AEs consistent with the symptoms of CRS, but not reported as such, were observed in an additional 23% of patients and were mild to moderate in severity.10:09SGEN Seattle Genetics and Takeda Pharma (TAK) announce additional analyses of results from ECHELON-1 and ECHELON-2 frontline phase 3 trials of ADCETRIS (116.36 -1.14)These analyses were presented at the 61st Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology. ADCETRIS (brentuximab vedotin) is an antibody-drug conjugate directed to CD30, a defining marker of classical Hodgkin lymphoma and expressed on the surface of several types of peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL). The ECHELON-1 analysis highlighted a four-year update of the phase 3 clinical trial in a poster presentation.ECHELON-1 is evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with AVD compared to ABVD in patients with Stage III or IV frontline classical Hodgkin lymphoma.As previously reported, the ECHELON-1 trial achieved its primary endpoint with the combination of ADCETRIS plus AVD resulting in a statistically significant improvement in modified progression-free survival compared to the control arm of ABVD as assessed by independent review facility. A four-year post-hoc exploratory analysis was conducted to examine PFS outcomes per investigator assessment in the intent-to-treat population of 1,334 patients, including results by PET2 status, age, stage and prognostic risk scores. Results include: The four-year PFS rate for patients in the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm was 81.7% compared to 75.1% in the ABVD arm, a difference of 6.6%. This represents a 31% reduction in the risk of progression or death. Median follow-up time was 48.4 months. A PFS benefit at four-years for ADCETRIS plus AVD was observed for all patients independent of PET2 status, including in patients who are less than 60 years old.Consistent improvement in PFS was observed among patients treated with ADCETRIS plus AVD compared with ABVD across the majority of pre-specified subgroups.As previously reported for the primary analysis, on the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm, peripheral neuropathy events were observed in 67% of patients compared to 43% in the ABVD arm. The four-year update shows that among patients with peripheral neuropathy, 83% in the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm and 84% in the ABVD arm reported complete resolution or improvement at last follow-up. The ECHELON-2 phase 3 clinical trial data were presented in an oral session at ASH and focused on the outcomes of the subset of patients who underwent consolidative stem cell transplant. ECHELON-2 is evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with CHP compared to CHOP in frontline CD30-expressing PTCL.As previously reported, the ECHELON-2 trial met its primary endpoint with the combination of ADCETRIS plus CHP resulting in a statistically significant improvement in PFS versus the control arm of CHOP per blinded independent central review. A post-hoc exploratory analysis evaluated the impact of consolidative stem cell transplant in the ECHELON-2 study for the patients who achieved CR treated with ADCETRIS plus CHP. In the ADCETRIS plus CHP arm, this included 38 patients in CR who received a stem cell transplant and 76 patients in CR who did not. Key findings of this analysis include:The PFS estimate favored the use of stem cell transplant (HR, 0.38; [95% CI: 0.18, 0.82]). After a median follow-up time of 35.9 months, the three-year PFS rate for the 38 patients who received a stem cell transplant was 76.1%. After a median follow-up time of 41.6 months, the three-year PFS rate for the 76 patients who did not receive a stem cell transplant was 53.3%. As previously reported, the safety profile of ADCETRIS plus CHP in the ECHELON-2 trial was comparable to CHOP and consistent with the established safety profile of ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy.10:08SWTX SpringWorks Therapeutics' collaborator GlaxoSmithKline presented data evaluating SpringWorks' nirogacestat alone and in combination with GlaxoSmithKline's belantamab mafodotin (27.00 +2.48)The data demonstrated that treatment of BCMA-expressing cancer cell lines with nirogacestat led to significantly increased levels of cell surface expression of BCMA and corresponding decreases in shedding of BCMA, as measured by levels of soluble BCMA. Further, the combination of nirogacestat and belantamab mafodotin resulted in synergistic increases in cancer cell killing as compared to belantamab mafodotin alone, with an up to ~3,000-fold improvement in cytotoxicity.09:40WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Stock market opens little changedThe major indices begin the day little changed.

It is the Company's intention to resume the Advantage Loan program as soon as management is confident its stated policies and procedures are being followed. However, it is presently difficult to estimate how long this suspension might last.The Advantage Loan program is a material component of the Bank's total loan originations. While it is difficult to quantify the financial impact of the program's temporary suspension, management anticipates a reduced level of near-term loan originations, slower overall loan portfolio growth, and less loan sales. However, management does not anticipate any credit related issues from previous loans made under the program due to the substantial amount of equity required for each borrower and the resulting strong collateral package for each loan. In order to mitigate the operational and financial impact of the Advantage Loan program's temporary suspension, the Company will continue to work on initiatives to diversify its overall loan production. Such initiatives include expanding the Bank's commercial lending efforts, including multifamily, tenant-in-common, construction, and commercial and industrial loans.

Weiss, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are highly encouraged by the first clinical data presented from our once daily, BTK inhibitor, TG-1701, which has demonstrated superior selectivity for BTK compared to ibrutinib in an in vitro whole kinome screening. The data presented today show that TG-1701 is an active BTK inhibitor as a single agent and that the combination of U2 plus TG-1701 has been generally well tolerated and active with 6 of 7 patients responding to the triple therapy at 100 mg QD, the lowest dose of TG-1701 tested. We look forward to continuing dose escalation of TG-1701 in the combination arm and identifying the optimal dose for this therapy." Mr. Weiss continued, "Our goal has always been to develop the best possible combination treatment options for patients, and we are excited to present the first data from a triple combination study in which all of the agents are being developed by TG. We believe this proprietary combination has the potential to enhance the results of BTK inhibitor therapy alone and offer patients early and deep responses with a tolerable safety profile."08:02GALT Galectin Therapeutics announces publication of results from its NASH-CX Phase 2 clinical trial in NASH cirrhosis in the peer-reviewed journal Gastroenterology (2.99 )The paper outlines that in a phase 2b study of 162 patients with NASH, cirrhosis, and portal hypertension, one year of biweekly infusion of belapectin was safe but not associated with significant reduction in HVPG or fibrosis, compared with placebo. However, in a subgroup analysis of patients without esophageal varices, 2 mg/kg belapectin (GR-MD-02) did reduce HVPG and development of varices. This subgroup analysis suggests that there may be benefits from belapectin in patients with NASH cirrhosis without esophageal varices. Further, if this observation can be reproduced in subsequent studies, belapectin may have a role in the management of patients with NASH cirrhosis and portal hypertension but no varices.08:01REPL Replimune names Jean M.

This was comparable to historical data with multiple doses of busulfan conditioning.CD117-ADC was well tolerated in non-human primates with no evidence of the often severe side effects seen with busulfan conditioning, including veno-occlusive disease, weight loss, diarrhea, mucositis, vomiting, pulmonary fibrosis or seizures.07:42TPX Tempur Sealy Int'l determines that it will record a charge of $30 mln (before tax) in Q4 in connection with the bankruptcy of one of its customers (85.89 )On December 6, 2019, Tempur Sealy determined that it will record a charge of $30 million (before tax) in the fourth quarter of 2019, in connection with the bankruptcy of one of its customers, Mattress PAL Holding, LLC ("Mattress PAL"), and the resulting significant liquidity issues of Mattress PAL's affiliates (collectively, "Mattress1One"). On April 7, 2019, Mattress PAL filed a voluntary petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division ("Bankruptcy Court") seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code ("Chapter 11 Proceedings"). On December 5, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court orally granted Mattress PAL's request to convert the Chapter 11 Proceedings to a Chapter 7 liquidation case. The Company plans to treat this charge, which does not involve any cash payments, as an adjustment in calculating adjusted EBITDA under the Company's senior secured credit agreement. Mattress1One represented less than 1% of the Company's global net sales in 2019, and the Company does not expect this charge, or the loss of Mattress1One as a customer, to have a material impact on the Company's 2019 guidance, 2020 outlook, or current or future liquidity.07:37IEP Icahn Enterprises commences private placement of Senior Notes due 2027 (61.61 )The proceeds from the offering will be used for general limited partnership purposes.07:35MBIO Mustang Bio highlights presentation of updated Phase 1/2 clinical data for MB-107 lentiviral gene therapy for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (3.85 )Lentiviral Gene Therapy with Low Dose Busulfan for Infants with X-SCID Results in the Development of a Functional Normal Immune System: Interim Results of an Ongoing Phase I/II Clinical Study Lentiviral gene therapy using low dose busulfan conditioning has been well tolerated, with no serious adverse events other than hematologic related to busulfanAll 11 patients had robust hematopoietic recovery within 3-4 weeks post cell infusion without blood product support Nine patients, with a follow up of greater than 3 months, achieved normal-for-age T-cell and natural killer (NK)-cell numbers within 3-4 months post gene therapy Five patients are off intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy thus far, of whom 3 responded to vaccines Median vector copy number (VCN) at 12 months post-gene therapy in seven patients, who have been followed for more than 12 months, was 2.25 VCN/cell (range: 1.24-3.03) in T cells, 0.34 VCN/cell (range: 0.23-1.25) in B cells, 1.55 VCN/cell (range 1.27-3.39) in NK cells, and 0.08 VCN/cell (range: 0.03-0.76) in myeloid cells in peripheral blood, and 0.10 (range: 0.05-0.66) in CD34+ bone marrow cells, respectivelyEnhanced Transduction Lentivector Gene Therapy for Treatment of Older Patients with X-Linked Severe Combined ImmunodeficiencyEarly outcome data for five older children and young adults with XSCID who received the lentivector (also known as lentiviral) gene therapy as salvage therapy after having previously received haplo-identical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as infants without chemotherapy-based conditioning were previously reported and published in Science Translational Medicine. By 2016, three additional patients were treated, and the cohort of eight patients (referred to as Cohort A) has now been followed for 3 to 7 years. Among Cohort A, gradual clinical benefit in the clearance of chronic norovirus and associated improved abdominal complaints, malabsorption, growth and IgG production were observed, and four patients were able to cease immunoglobulin replacement therapy.While the results were positive, the relatively inefficient transduction of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) required large quantities of vector. This resulted in relatively low VCN in myeloid cells in some patients, with delayed immune cell recovery and persistent clinical disease, especially in the last patient treated (patient 8). To address this, NIH developed a refined enhanced transduction (ET) procedure consisting of a single overnight transduction after 48 hours pre-stimulation in cytokines (Stem cell factor, Thrombopoietin, Flt3-ligand; 100ng/mL) and incorporated transduction enhancers LentiBoost 1:100 and dimethyl prostaglandin 2 (dmPGE2; 1uM).The presentation at the 2019 ASH Annual Meeting included data from six patients (referred to as Cohort B) treated by NIH, including re-treatment of patient 8. The patients, who were aged 12 to 36, had significant problems with donor T cell infiltration of liver, bone marrow and kidneys, and were nearly absent of B and NK cells. The enhanced transduction procedure achieved much greater transduction efficiencies than were observed in Cohort A, with greater than 10-fold less vector, and resulted in faster immune reconstitution and more significant clinical benefit by 3 months.07:33AR Antero Resources highlights agreements expected to reduce its gathering, processing and transportation costs by approximately $350 mln over the next four years, commences asset sale program targeting $750 mln to $1 bln in proceeds to be completed in 2020 (2.19 )The agreements include a growth incentive fee program with Antero Midstream Corporation (AM) that aligns with the Company's current 8% to 10% compound annual production growth plan through 2021 and additional agreements with other third party midstream providers.

The growth incentive fee program aligns with Antero Resources' current 8% to 10% compound annual net production growth plan in 2020 and 2021. The share repurchase and growth incentive fee reduction transactions have been negotiated and recommended by the Conflicts Committees of Antero Midstream and Antero Resources and approved by both Boards of Directors.Due to additional optimization of the midstream infrastructure buildout, Antero Midstream is now targeting a 2020 capital program of approximately $300 to $325 million. This represents a $75 to $100 million, or 22% reduction, compared to the previous target of $375 to $425 million. Antero Resources' previously announced preliminary 2020 target of 110 to 120 completions in 2020, with an average lateral length of 12,100 feet is unchanged.

All response-evaluable patients experienced tumor reduction (complete response + partial response + stable disease) following treatment with ADCETRIS in combination with OPDIVO. Median duration of response was not yet reached and the maximum duration of response was 22 months and ongoing (95% CI: 7.06, -). The most common treatment-related adverse events of any grade occurring in at least 20 percent of patients were fatigue, diarrhea, pyrexia, infusion related reaction, peripheral motor neuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy and increase in lipase. One treatment-related serious adverse event was pyrexia. Fifty-seven percent of patients (12/21) had at least one treatment-related adverse event greater than or equal to Grade 3, most commonly increase in lipase (24 percent, 5/21), peripheral motor neuropathy and peripheral sensory neuropathy (each 14 percent, 3/21), and fatigue and hyponatremia (each 10 percent, 2/21). Two-Year Follow-up Results from the Phase 1-2 Study of Brentuximab Vedotin in Combination with Nivolumab in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (Abstract #238, oral presentation at 2:45 p.m. ET on Saturday, December 7, 2019) Of the 91 treated patients, 85 percent (77/91) had an objective response, including 67 percent (61/91) with a complete response, 16 patients with a partial response and six patients had stable disease. Of the 91 treated patients, 67 patients received an ASCT per trial protocol with no additional salvage therapy. For all treated patients, the two-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 79 percent (95% CI: 68%, 87%). For the 67 patients who received an ASCT per trial protocol, the two-year PFS was 92 percent (95% CI: 80%, 97%). Median follow-up for all treated patients was 24.2 months (range 1.8-41.7) and the median PFS was not reached. Estimated overall survival at two years was 94 percent (95% CI: 85%, 97%) and median overall survival was not yet reached. Peripheral immune signatures were consistent with an activated T-cell response. Prior to ASCT, the most common adverse events of any grade occurring in more than 20 percent of patients were nausea, infusion related reaction, fatigue, diarrhea, pruritus, headache, vomiting and pyrexia. Other adverse events included peripheral neuropathy in 16 patients (18 percent) and neutropenia in six patients (7 percent). Two patients (2 percent) discontinued treatment due to adverse events, Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy and increased gamma-glutamyltransferase. Serious adverse events occurred in 14 patients (15 percent), including pneumonia, pneumonitis and pyrexia (two patients each); and Grade 3 Guillain-Barre syndrome (one patient).06:52GILD Gilead Sciences reports Long-term data from ZUMA-1 demonstrating about half of refractory large b-cell lymphoma patients were alive three years after Yescarta treatment (67.08 )Co announced new data from the ZUMA-1 trial of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) in adult patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma. These results included updated overall survival data from the pivotal phase 2 study after three years following a single infusion of Yescarta, as well as an analysis from a separate safety management cohort of patients receiving early steroid intervention for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events. Updated results from a separate ZUMA-1 safety management study (Cohort 4) were also presented at the meeting (Abstract #243). In this analysis, patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma treated with Yescarta received earlier steroid intervention, beginning when patients experienced Grade 1 neurologic events or experienced Grade 1 CRS with no improvement after three days of supportive care. Patients could receive optional bridging chemotherapy prior to Yescarta infusion. In the analysis, 41 patients had received Yescarta, with a median follow-up of 8.7 months; 73% of patients received corticosteroids and 76% received tocilizumab. Earlier steroid use appeared to decrease the percentage of patients with Grade > or =3 CRS (2%) and neurologic events (17%), each of which were numerically lower than rates in the registrational cohorts of ZUMA-1 (13% CRS, 31% neurologic events). There were no Grade 4 or 5 CRS or neurologic events and no Grade 5 AEs related to Yescarta in Cohort 4. Objective response rate per investigator assessment was 73% in Cohort 4, with 51% of patients achieving a complete response. The median duration of response was 8.9 months. Fifty-four percent of patients in this cohort remained in an ongoing response with at least six months of follow-up after Yescarta infusion. Median OS in Cohort 4 has not been reached.06:51CRTX Cortexyme reports new data revealing link between bacterial pathogen and genetic risk for Alzheimer's Disease (28.31 )Co announced the presentation of new data supporting the on-target activity of COR388, its lead investigational medicine, and linking the "gingipain hypothesis" for Alzheimer's disease (AD) to the significance of the APOE gene as a major risk factor for the disease.Gingipains from P. gingivalis cleave ApoE proteins and have a preference for cleaving ApoE4; and COR388, a gingipain inhibitor, prevents this. In in vitro experiments, cells infected with P. gingivalis exhibited gingipain-dependent ApoE cleavage activity that generated ApoE fragments similar to what was seen in the brains and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, uninfected cells had no significant ApoE protein-cleaving activity. Furthermore, P. gingivalis gingipains cleaved ApoE4 more readily than ApoE3. Finally, in the infected cells, COR388 alone was sufficient to block ApoE fragmentation. In a Phase 1b trial, COR388 reduced ApoE fragments in CSF. Cortexyme's Phase 1 clinical development program for COR388 included cohorts of healthy volunteers and subjects with Alzheimer's disease. In addition to assessing safety and initial clinical activity, investigators also assessed the level of ApoE fragmentation in the CSF of nine subjects with Alzheimer's disease. Six subjects received 50mg of COR388 twice daily while three subjects received placebo. After 28 days, a statistically significant decrease in ApoE fragments (both ApoE4 and ApoE3) was observed in subjects treated with COR388 versus those treated with placebo.06:51EGRX Eagle Pharma commences dosing in pilot study for novel estrogen receptor antagonist product candidate (56.43 )The company has commenced dosing in a pilot clinical study to assess the unique characteristics of its fulvestrant product candidate, which has the potential to enhance estrogen receptor ("ER") inhibition and improve outcomes for patients with ER-positive breast cancer.

All results are as of the data cutoff date of August 26, 2019.Groups A and B:As of the data cutoff date, seven out of nine total patients in Groups A and B (five out of seven in Group A and two out of two in Group B) did not require regular RBC transfusions post-treatment. Overall, patients in Groups A and B experienced a reduction, but not complete elimination of VOC and ACS events at two years post-treatment, suggesting that the levels of gene therapy-derived hemoglobin may have been sufficient to reduce but not eliminate continued sickle-related disease manifestations. Group C As of the data cutoff date, 17 patients were treated with LentiGlobin for SCD in Group C, with the longest follow-up at 21 months; none required regular RBC transfusions post-treatment. In patients with six or more months of follow-up (n=12), median levels of gene therapy-derived anti-sickling hemoglobin, HbAT87Q, were at least 40% of total hemoglobin. Total hemoglobin and HbAT87Q levels ranged from 9.3 -- 15.2 g/dL and 2.7 -- 9.0 g/dL, respectively, at last visit. Treatment with LentiGlobin for SCD reduced key markers of hemolysis, including reticulocyte counts, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and total bilirubin concentration, which suggests that treatment is improving biological markers of the disease. Among the nine patients with at least six months of follow-up who had four or more VOC or ACS events in the two years prior to treatment, there was a 99% reduction in annualized rate of VOC and ACS. There were no reports of ACS or serious VOC at up to 21 months post-treatment in these patients. As previously reported, there was one non-serious Grade 2 VOC was observed in a patient approximately 3.5 months post-LentiGlobin for SCD treatment.HGB-206 Exploratory Assays bluebird bio presented results from exploratory assays in samples from a subset of patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD from Groups A, B and C, to assess the relationship between drug product characteristics and RBC physiology. To demonstrate the pancellular expression of the gene therapy derived anti-sickling Hb, HbAT87Q, bluebird bio developed an assay that enables detection of HbAT87Q and HbS protein in individual RBCs. In 12 patients who had at least six months of follow-up, the proportion of RBCs positive for HbAT87Q at the last study visit was more than 70% in all cases; with more than 90% of RBCs positive for HbAT87Q in four patients.On average, HbAT87Q present in RBCs of patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD was within the range of non-sickling adult Hb, HbA, present in the RBCs from people with sickle cell trait. The RBCs also resembled sickle cell trait RBCs with regard to propensity to sickle under low oxygen conditions. Sickling of RBCs from patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD was significantly less than that seen in untreated patients with SCD.06:49MNK Mallinckrodt plc presents data on a novel predictive model to identify infants at risk for infantile spasms (3.41 )Co announced findings on the use of a novel predictive model designed to more quickly identify infants with infantile spasms (IS), a rare seizure disorder that typically occurs between three and seven months of age. Key FindingsDeductive models developed to identify the combinations of variables that predict IS prior to diagnosis and during the treatment pathway: 557 patients had =2 symptoms pertaining to IS -- seizures, developmental delay, lack of eye contact and lack of muscle tone -- and a moderate or high severity ED visit.In this group, 55 percent of patients (n=304) had an IS diagnosis within a median 0.8 months of the triggering event. The most notable deductive combinations focused on pre-diagnosis of IS. MethodsThe study utilized data from the Symphony Health Integrated Dataverse database to identify triggers for early identification of IS patients from medical and pharmacy claims from 10.8 million patients under 2 years of age between May 2017 and April 2018. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) procedure codes were evaluated to identify the codes most likely to predict a subsequent diagnosis of IS. Researchers also used input from IS medical experts to determine the clinical, electrographic, radiologic, procedural and medication variables that may predict IS development.06:48SGMO Sangamo Therapeutics announces preliminary results from first three patients treated in Phase 1/2 THALES study evaluating investigational ST-400 ex vivo gene-edited cell therapy in transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (11.66 )The three patients treated with ST-400 experienced prompt hematopoietic reconstitution, demonstrating neutrophil engraftment in 14-22 days and platelet engraftment in 22-35 days (Table 1). No emerging clonal hematopoiesis has to date been observed by on-target indel pattern monitoring in the three treated patients. Reported adverse events (AEs) are consistent with the known toxicities of mobilization, apheresis, and myeloablative busulfan conditioning. One serious adverse event (SAE) related to ST-400 was reported. As previously disclosed, Patient 1 experienced hypersensitivity during ST-400 infusion considered by the investigator to be likely related to the product cryoprotectant excipient, DMSO, and which resolved by the end of the infusion.06:47LITE Lumentum to offer $850 mln aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2026 (72.08 )Lumentum intends to use approximately $196 million of the net proceeds of the offering to repay in full all amounts outstanding under its term loan credit facility, and a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to purchase up to approximately $200 million of its common stock concurrently with the pricing of this offering in privately negotiated transactions effected through the initial purchaser of the notes or its affiliates as its agent.

The results from the pharmacokinetic and occupancy studies for the first seven patients have been in-line with expectations. The Company anticipates that a dose that achieves maximum target occupancy will be achieved in the next one or two dose cohorts. CPI-818 has been shown to bind covalently to ITK at low nanomolar concentrations without reacting with other kinases. In vitro studies demonstrated selective cytotoxicity to Sezary cells (malignant cells from patients with CTCL), while sparing normal T-cells, in three subjects not enrolled in the study. Preclinical murine models of lymphoproliferative and autoimmune disease showed CPI-818 inhibited the development of lymph node and spleen enlargement by preventing proliferation of abnormal T-cells. Treatment with CPI-818 led to regression of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly in animals with established disease.06:32CGC Canopy Growth names David Klein CEO effective January 14 (18.65 )In his current role as executive vice president and chief financial officer at Constellation Brands, David oversees all aspects of the company's finance operations, all mergers and acquisitions, as well as the company's information technology function.The appointment of David Klein follows a thorough recruitment process overseen by a special Hiring Committee of the Board using global recruitment company Heidrick & Struggles, which saw a wide variety of exceptional candidates vetted and interviewed.

Fourteen patients were evaluable at one month.AUTO3 was well-tolerated, with no patients experiencing > or = Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with primary infusion and 1 of 14 experiencing Grade 3 neurotoxicity that resolved swiftly with steroids. There were no pembrolizumab immune-related toxicities and the majority of grade 3 or higher adverse events were hematological. Low levels of serum cytokines are consistent with the observed low levels of CRS and neurotoxicity. Across all tested doses 5 patients achieved a complete response, with 4 of 5 complete responses ongoing, the longest at 18 months. All CRs were achieved without need for steroid or tocilizumab-based management of the patients or ICU level care.AUTO3 -- (Poster) - Phase 1/2 AMELIA clinical trial of AUTO3 in patients with relapsed/refractory pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pALL) (Abstract # 2620)AUTO3 was well-tolerated overall, with no patients experiencing = Grade 3 CRS and no patients experiencing > or = Grade 2 neurotoxicity, in doses > or =3x106 /kg CAR-T cells. No AUTO3-related deaths were reported.Among the 10 CAR T-nave patients, at a median follow-up time of 9.7 months (range 1.8- 18), 9 of 10 patients (90%) achieved a complete response, and 8 of 10 (80%) achieved complete molecular remission by PCR. Estimated overall survival at 12 months was 100%. There are 2 ongoing patients in complete molecular remission at 12 and 15 months post-AUTO3 infusion, respectively. The most common cause of relapse was due to loss of CAR T-cell persistence. The median persistence of CAR-T cells in blood was 170 days.06:29STOK Stoke Therapeutics presents new preclinical data on STK-001 for the treatment of Dravet syndrome (28.98 )Data from studies in non-human primates (NHP) showed STK-001 distributed throughout the brain and achieved target engagement and increased Nav1.1 protein expression throughout the cortex after a single intrathecal injection. Safety findings showed STK-001 to be well-tolerated at the two intrathecal dose levels studied. These data were presented in a poster session at the American Epilepsy Society (AES) Annual Meeting in Baltimore.Stoke plans to submit an investigational new drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in early 2020 and, subject to acceptance of the IND, plans to initiate a Phase 1/2 single-ascending dose study in children and adolescents with Dravet syndrome in the first half of 2020.06:28FATE Fate Therapeutics presents new in vivo preclinical data for FT596 -- company plans to initiate enrollment of first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in rarly 2020 (13.67 )FT596 is the first cellular immunotherapy engineered with three active anti-tumor components to be cleared for clinical investigation by the FDA. In addition to a proprietary CAR targeting CD19, FT596 expresses a novel high-affinity, non-cleavable CD16 (hnCD16) Fc receptor that has been modified to augment antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, enabling coincident targeting of CD19 and additional tumor-associated antigens such as CD20. FT596 also expresses an interleukin-15 receptor fusion (IL-15RF), a potent cytokine complex that promotes survival, proliferation and trans-activation of NK cells and CD8 T cells without the need for systemic cytokine support. Together, these features of FT596 are intended to maximize potency and minimize toxicity in treated patients. The Company plans to initiate enrollment of a first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in early 2020.New preclinical data presented at ASH showed that FT596 administered as a monotherapy exhibited durable tumor clearance and extended survival in vivo similar to primary CAR T cells in a humanized mouse model of CD19+ lymphoma. Additionally, when combined with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab, FT596 showed enhanced killing of CD20+ lymphoma cells in vivo as compared to rituximab alone. These data confirm previously presented in vitro findings that demonstrate the unique multi-antigen targeting functionality of FT596, and the product candidate's potential to effectively overcome CD19 antigen escape.The Company also announced that, in preparation for Phase 1 initiation, it had recently completed GMP production of FT596. In a single small-scale manufacturing campaign, the Company produced over 300 cryopreserved, infusion-ready doses of FT596 at a cost of approximately $2,500 per dose. The Company's iPSC product platform unites stem cell biology and precision genetic engineering to create renewable master engineered iPSC lines that can be repeatedly used to mass produce cancer-fighting immune cells, replacing the high production costs, weeks of manufacturing time, and complex manufacturing processes required for current-generation CAR T-cell immunotherapies with a lower-cost, easier-to-manufacture, well-characterized, off-the-shelf product that has the potential to reach many more patients.06:27SGMO Sangamo Therapeutics and Pfizer (PFE) report updated Phase 1/2 results showing sustained increased Factor VIII activity through 44 weeks (11.66 )Sangamo Therapeutics (SGMO) and Pfizer (PFE) announced updated follow-up results from the Phase 1/2 Alta study evaluating investigational SB-525 gene therapy in patients with severe hemophilia A. The data showed that SB-525 was generally well tolerated and demonstrated sustained increased Factor VIII (FVIII) levels following treatment with SB-525 through to 44 weeks, the extent of follow-up for the longest treated patient in the 3e13 vg/kg dose cohort.06:27KURA Kura Oncology provides clinical and regulatory updates for lead drug candidate, tipifarnib, in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (15.61 )In June 2019, Kura reported that the primary efficacy endpoint was achieved in each of the expansion cohorts in its Phase 2 trial of tipifarnib in relapsed or refractory PTCL: 1) patients with AITL, an aggressive form of T-cell lymphoma often characterized by high levels of CXCL12 expression, and 2) patients with PTCL who lack a single nucleotide variation in the 3'-untranslated region of the CXCL12 gene. Given the high level of activity observed among AITL patients, Kura continued to enroll patients to acquire more experience regarding safety and tolerability in this population. Based upon the 2016 revision of the World Health Organization classification of lymphoid neoplasms1, AITL and AITL-like histologies represent approximately one-third of all PTCL cases.As of the November 11, 2019 data cutoff date, a total of 26 patients with relapsed or refractory AITL were enrolled in all stages of the trial. Among the 20 patients evaluable for efficacy, five achieved a complete response (CR) and five achieved a partial response (PR), for an objective response rate (ORR) of 50% on an evaluable basis and 38% on an intent-to-treat basis. In addition, three patients experienced disease stabilization. Patients had a median of three prior regimens (range 1-7).Next-generation sequencing of 19 available patient biopsies showed that 10 (53%) carried C336R/Q386E variants in the killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) 3DL2, an immune checkpoint receptor. Four of the 10 patients with KIR3DL2 variants achieved a CR and three achieved a PR, for a CR rate of 40% and an ORR of 70%. This compares to a CR rate of 11% and an ORR of 22% among the nine AITL patients with KIR3DL2 wild type.Regulatory Update: Following FDA feedback from an end-of-Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting, Kura plans to initiate a Phase 2 registration-directed trial of tipifarnib in patients with relapsed or refractory AITL and related lymphomas in 2020. The multi-center, single-arm trial will target enrollment of 128 patients with AITL and AITL-like histologies who are relapsed or refractory to at least one prior systemic cytotoxic therapy.06:26PTLA Portola Pharma presents new interim results from ongoing Phase 2a study of cerdulatinib in patients with specific subtypes of T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (29.21 )As of the November 12, 2019 cut-off date, 64 PTCL patients and 40 CTCL patients treated with cerdulatinib as a single agent were evaluable for response. The overall response rate (ORR) was 34% in the PTCL cohort and 43% in the CTCL cohort. Among the subset of patients in the PTCL cohort with AITL, the ORR was 52% and the complete response rate (CR) was 37%.Among the 64 patients in the PTCL cohort, 14 patients (22%) achieved a CR and eight patients (12%) achieved a partial response (PR). In the subgroup of 27 patients with AITL, 10 patients (37%) achieved a CR, and four patients (15%) achieved a PR. The median duration of response is eight months for all PTCL patients and is greater than nine months in AITL patients. Follow-up is ongoing. Among the 40 patients in the CTCL cohort, three patients (8%) achieved a CR and 14 patients (35%) achieved a PR. Importantly, rapid improvements in pruritus, or severe itching -- a common and often serious condition associated with CTCL -- have been observed, as measured by the Likert scale.Cerdulatinib demonstrated good tolerability in both PTCL and CTCL. The most common Grade 3 or greater adverse events across the PTCL and CTCL cohorts with a frequency > 5% were lipase increase (25%), amylase increase (19%), neutropenia (12%), anemia (10%), diarrhea (8%), sepsis/bacteremia (6%), and febrile neutropenia (4%). The lipase and amylase changes were generally asymptomatic and not associated with pancreatitis.06:25XENE Xenon Pharmaceuticals provides updates on partnered neurology pipeline programs (13.95 )Xenon Pharmaceuticals announced that it will provide updates on its partnered epilepsy programs at the American Epilepsy Society Annual Meeting.Overview of clinical stage XEN901 and Related Patient Survey to be Presented in the "Genetic Epilepsies -- Updates in the Science and Diagnosis" on December 8thPre-clinical work suggests selective sodium channel inhibitors that reduce action potential firing in excitatory neurons, while sparing inhibitory interneurons, may provide promising drug profile06:25IMV IMV presents updated results from SPiReL at ASH (2.83 )The poster, which included additional data collected between the abstract submission and the presentation, continued to demonstrate a favorable therapeutic profile and treatment-associated clinical benefit in r/r DLBCL patients who received the DPX-Survivac combination regimen.06:24QURE uniQure presents updated clinical data on three patients treated in ongoing Phase IIb study of etranacogene dezaparvovec; additionally presents up to 4 years of follow-up data on the 10 patients in the Phase I/II trial of AMT-060 (66.05 )At Least One Year of Stable, Therapeutic Levels of FIX Activity in Patients Treated with Etranacogene Dezaparvovec: Featured in a poster presentation at ASH, the 52 weeks of follow-up data show that all three patients have stabilized and sustained FIX activity at therapeutic levels after the one-time administration of etranacogene dezaparvovec. Mean FIX activity for the three patients at 52 weeks after administration was 41% of normal, with the first patient achieving FIX activity of 50% of normal, the second patient achieving FIX activity of 31% of normal and the third patient achieving FIX activity of 41% of normal. The second and third patients had previously screen-failed and were excluded from another gene therapy study due to pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to a different AAV vector. Reported FIX activity was measured using an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay performed at a central laboratory.At one year after dosing, no patient in the study has reported any bleeding events. All patients have remained free of prophylaxis after receiving etranacogene dezaparvovec. One patient, who had earlier in the study undergone hip surgery due to a pre-existing condition, experienced back pain and treated himself with a single infusion of factor replacement, which was later determined by the patient and the investigator to be unrelated to a bleed. No other FIX infusions were reported by any patient.Stable FIX Expression and Durable Reductions in Bleeding and FIX Consumption for up to 4 Years Following AMT-060 Gene Therapy:In the ongoing Phase I/II study of AMT-060, all 10 patients continue to show long-term clinical benefit, including sustained increases in FIX activity, reduced usage of FIX replacement therapy, and decreased bleeding frequency. At up to 4 years of follow-up, AMT-060 continues to be well-tolerated, with no new serious adverse events and no development of inhibitors since the last reported data.All five patients in the second dose cohort of 2x1013 gc/kg (the dose being studied in the ongoing Phase III HOPE-B study of etranacogene dezaparvovec) continue to be free of routine FIX replacement therapy at 3.5 years after treatment. Based on the six months of data collected during the fourth year of follow-up, the mean annualized bleeding rate was zero compared to an average of 4 bleeds during the year prior to treatment, representing a 100% reduction. During this same period, the usage of FIX replacement therapy also declined 100% compared to the year prior to treatment. Mean FIX activity over 3.5 years was 7.5%.06:22FATE Fate Therapeutics reports clinical data from Landmark Phase 1 studies; no dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients (13.67 )Fate Therapeutics announced initial clinical data for its FT516 and FT500 off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived natural killer (NK) cell product candidates.No morphologic evidence of leukemia and complete neutrophil recovery observed in first patient treated with FT516 Monotherapy for AML following first dosing cycleNo dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients treated with FT500 for advanced solid tumorsFavorable FT500 Phase 1 Safety, Tolerability and Immunogenicity profile validates novel multi-dose treatment paradigm for off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived NK cell products.06:22BMY Bristol-Myers presents data from multiple studies evaluating lisocabtagene maraleucel at ASH (59.95 )These studies included an evaluation of liso-cel in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) (TRANSCEND CLL 004); a study in second-line patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients who were ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) (PILOT); and a separate analysis of patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma who received liso-cel in the outpatient setting across three studies."The results in relapsed or refractory CLL and SLL demonstrated a high rate of durable complete responses achieved in heavily pre-treated patients, including patients who have failed ibrutinib and venetoclax. We are encouraged by the potential of liso-cel to treat second-line relapsed or refractory large B-cell NHL patients who are not able to undergo a stem cell transplant. Finally, the analysis evaluating liso-cel administered in the outpatient setting demonstrates that not all patients require hospitalization and that the safety and efficacy profile across a variety of types of clinical sites is consistent."06:20LLY Eli Lilly presents interim clinical data from the LOXO-305 global Phase 1/2 BRUIN dose escalation trial (119.64 )At all doses studied, LOXO-305 delivered objective responses in patients who had received diverse prior therapies and had exhibited varied molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance.Of 16 CLL patients enrolled, there were 10 responders (8 partial responses, 2 partial response with ongoing lymphocytosis) among 13 patients eligible for response assessment, resulting in a 77% ORR. All patients with CLL have demonstrated tumor reduction, with evidence of deepening response over time. Responses were observed in patients with acquired resistance to prior BTK therapy (those with and without C481S mutations), in patients who were intolerant to prior BTK therapy, and in patients with acquired resistance to prior BCL2 therapy (including one with a known BCL G101V mutation). As expected, LOXO-305 treatment causes acute lymphocytosis, which resolves over time -- a well described pharmacodynamic response associated with effective BTK inhibition. Of the three CLL patients not yet eligible for response assessment (one with the BTK C481S mutation), all three have demonstrated lymphocytosis early in cycle 1. All CLL responding patients remain in response, and all CLL patients remain on study. Of eight MCL patients enrolled, there were three responses (1 complete response, 2 partial responses) among six patients eligible for response assessment, resulting in a 50% ORR. Two of the responders had progressed on prior BTK therapy (but without a documented C481x mutation). All MCL responding patients remain in response and on study. Three MCL patients discontinued therapy in cycle 1 due to progressive disease.Most treatment-emergent adverse events were Grade 1 in severity with the most commonly reported events, regardless of attribution, being fatigue (25% total: 21% Grade 1, 4% Grade 2) and diarrhea (18% total: 14% Grade 1, 4% Grade 2). Two adverse events > or =Grade 3 were attributed to LOXO-305 (Grade 3 leukocytosis and Grade 3 transient neutropenia). No dose limiting toxicities were reported and an MTD had not been reached.06:19AZN AstraZeneca reports full results from Phase III ELEVATE TN trial (47.68 )AstraZeneca presented results from the interim analysis of the Phase III ELEVATE TN trial, showing that CALQUENCE (acalabrutinib) combined with obinutuzumab or as monotherapy significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab, a standard chemo-immunotherapy treatment, in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemiaIn an exploratory analysis, CALQUENCE in combination or alone demonstrated consistent PFS improvements across most pre-specified subgroups of patients with high-risk disease characteristics, including the unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable gene (IGHV), del(11q) and complex karyotype. Overall, the safety and tolerability profile of CALQUENCE observed in the ELEVATE TN trial was consistent with its known profile.06:19BGNE BeiGene presents clinical data from three trials of its BTK inhibitor BRUKINSA at ASH (186.92 )In two oral presentations of BRUKINSA in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), the drug candidate demonstrated consistent safety and a high overall response rate (ORR); in the poster presentation of BRUKINSA combined with BeiGene's investigational anti-PD-1 antibody tislelizumab in patients with previously treated B-cell malignancies, the combination treatment showed preliminary efficacy and was generally well tolerated."The results presented today on BRUKINSA, a BTK inhibitor designed to maximize target occupancy and minimize off-target binding, demonstrated robust clinical activity and a safety profile consistent with what we've observed to date in our clinical trials, including safety data that supported the recent U.S. FDA accelerated approval in patients with previously treated mantle cell lymphoma," said Jane Huang, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, hematology at BeiGene. "CLL or SLL is the most common type of leukemia in adults, and despite the advancements of BTK inhibitor therapy for these cancers, there remains a need for highly selective BTK inhibitors capable of promoting long-term responses, and with a safety profile that is tolerable over time. The results presented here today further demonstrate the potential for BRUKINSA to help people living with these persistent, life-threatening cancers."06:18RCKT Rocket Pharmaceuticals presents "encouraging" preliminary results from its Phase 1 trial of commercial-grade RP-L102 'Process B' for Fanconi Anemia (22.37 )Results presented in the poster highlight preliminary Phase 1 data from two pediatric patients (age 5 and 6 years) who were treated with "Process B" RP-L102 prior to the development of severe bone marrow failure and are in ongoing follow-up. Drug product was successfully manufactured using "Process B" optimization, including transduction enhancers, commercial-grade vector, and modified cell processing. "Process B" drug product is manufactured to commercial grade standards, allowing for consistent drug product across patients and a vector copy number (VCN) two to three fold higher than that administered to optimally-treated "Process A" patients.Once transduced, drug product was infused fresh into patients without any prior conditioning regimen. To evaluate transduction efficiency, an analysis of the proportion of the MMC-resistant colony forming cells was conducted. Both patients exhibited early signs of engraftment based on peripheral blood, VCN and/or MMC-resistance. Preliminary phenotypic correction was also apparent in both patients, as evidenced by stabilization or increases in blood cell lineages. No safety or tolerability issues have been reported.06:18ABBV AbbVie reports new results from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE clinical trial showing the potential of this fixed-duration combination therapy (86.98 )AbbVie announced new data from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE (PCYC-1142) clinical trial, evaluating IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) in combination with VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO (venetoclax) in previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Results showed that patients who received up to 12 cycles of the combination regimen achieved high rates of undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD) in both peripheral blood (PB; 75% of patients) and in bone marrow (BM; 72% of patients). Safety data were consistent with the known safety profiles of IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO used as individual therapies.Results showed uMRD -- defined as less than 1 CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes (MRD<0.01%) by flow cytometry of PB or BM samples -- was achieved at any time after baseline in PB for 75% of patients (122 of 163 patients) and in BM for 72% (111 of 155 patients). The proportion of patients who had uMRD in PB increased over time from 57% after 6 cycles, 68% after 9 cycles, and 73% after 12 cycles of IMBRUVICA plus VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO. The high rates of uMRD in BM were consistent across high-risk subgroups, including in patients with del(17p), del(17p) or TP53 mutation, del(11q), complex karyotype, and unmutated IGHV status. In patients with uMRD in PB with matched BM samples, 93% of patients had uMRD in both PB and BM. With median follow-up of 14.7 months, 3 patients (2%) experienced disease progression.06:17OBSV ObsEva reports positive Phase 3 trial results from PRIMROSE 2 trial of linzagolix for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids (4.57 )The responder rate was 93.9% (p <0.001) for women receiving 200 mg with ABT and 56.7% for women receiving 100 mg without ABT (p <0.001), compared to 29.4% in the placebo group. Both doses achieved significant rates of amenorrhea (p <0.001), reduction in pain (p <0.001), and improvement in quality of life (p <0.001). Additionally, significant improvement (p <0.001) in hemoglobin levels, a reduction in number of days of bleeding and reduction in uterine volume were observed. Furthermore, a significant reduction in fibroid volume was also observed for the 200 mg dose with ABT (p <0.008).The overall safety profile was in line with expectations and confirmed that linzagolix was well-tolerated. The most frequently observed adverse events (occurring in > 5% of patients) were headache, hot flushes, and anemia. Mean percentage change from baseline in BMD was consistent with previous clinical data."We look forward to the results from our second pivotal study, PRIMROSE 1 conducted in the US, in Q2 2020. Assuming positive results, we expect that it would lead to a Marketing Authorization Application submission with the European Medicines Agency by year-end 2020 and a New Drug Application submission with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by Q1 2021."06:16THOR Synthorx to be acquired by Sanofi (SNY) for $68/share in cash (25.03 )Under the terms of the merger agreement, Sanofi will commence a cash tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Synthorx common stock for $68 per share in cash for a total enterprise value of approximately $2.35 billion.

While the DOJ and SEC conduct separate investigations, the same facts have been shared by Ericsson with both authorities. The resolution relates to historical FCPA breaches ending Q1 2017. While the Company had a compliance program and a supporting control framework, they were not adequately implemented. Specifically, certain employees in some markets, some of whom were executives in those markets, acted in bad faith and knowingly failed to implement sufficient controls. They were able to enter into transactions for illegitimate purposes and, together with people under their influence, used sophisticated schemes in order to hide their wrongdoing.Separately, Ericsson agreed to resolve civil charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) relating to allegations of violations of the bribery and accounting provisions of the FCPA. Ericsson agreed to the entry of a judgment enjoining it from future violations of the FCPA and it agreed to pay a financial sanction of $458,380,000, plus pre-judgment interest of $81,540,000.As part of the settlement, Ericsson has agreed to engage an independent compliance monitor for a period of three years while the Company continues to undertake significant reforms to strengthen its Ethics & Compliance program.The combined payment of $1.06 b.

Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD16:19WTRE Watford Holdings agrees to purchase Axeria IARD; terms not disclosed (26.47 +0.25)Axeria IARD is a property and casualty insurance company based in France.

The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is supported by data from the Phase 1b/2 CARTITUDE-1 study. Initial data from the CARTITUDE-1 study will be presented for the first time at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.16:16BLUE Bluebirdbio and Bristol-Myers (BMY) report "positive" top-line results from Ph 2 KarMMa study of ide-cel; met its primary endpoint and key secondary endpoint (79.42 -1.23)KarMMa enrolled 140 patients, of whom 128 patients were treated with ide-cel across the target dose levels of 150-450 x 106 CAR+ T cells. Ninety-four percent of patients were refractory to an anti-CD38 antibody and 84% percent were triple refractory (refractory to an IMiD agent, PI and anti-CD38 antibody). Results for the primary endpoint (overall response rate [ORR]) and key secondary endpoint (complete response rate [CR]), as well as duration of response (DoR) and progression-free survival (PFS) across the target dose levels and at each of the three target doses explored in the study are presented in the table below. The median follow-up duration for all subjects was 11.3 months.Overall, the safety results were consistent with those observed in the phase 1 CRB-401 study, which evaluated the preliminary safety and efficacy of ide-cel. Instances of grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in 5.5% (7/128) of patients, including one fatal CRS event. Investigator identified grade 3 or higher neurotoxicity events (iiNT) occurred in 3.1% (4/128) of patients and there were no Grade 4 iiNT events reported. Grade 3 or higher CRS and iiNT events were reported in <6% of subjects at each target dose. CRS of any grade occurred in 83.6% (107/128) of patients and iiNT of any grade occurred in 18% (23/128) of patients.

That outperformance is remarkable because it flies in the face of Goldman Sachs downgrading the stock to Sell from Neutral and slashing its price target to $12 from $17.Strikingly, Macy's has already exceeded its average daily volume less than two hours into the trading session. That heavy volume and the positive turn in the stock on a seemingly negative development are likely byproducts of the following factors:Investor belief that the Goldman Sachs analyst isn't breaking any new ground with the basis for the downgrade (secular headwinds weighing on comps and profitability). Shares of M were down 49% for the year before today's downgrade.Short-covering activity, which is often triggered when a beaten-up stock makes a counter-intuitive move.Momentum trading as speculators see an opportunity to force a short squeeze.Macy's is the picture of a tax-loss selling candidate, but the flip side of that understanding is that many tax-loss selling candidates are seen as good, bargain-hunting opportunities after the tax-loss selling is complete. The stock's resilience to selling interest today is apt to be helping its candidacy as a short-term, speculative rebound play.11:09TALKX Market Briefing: A mixed state of affairsThe stock market is mixed, and little changed, in today's early action. Buyers have reined in their efforts after Friday's post-employment report rally and ahead of a batch of key macro developments that will unfold this week, the most notable of which is the possible implementation of tariffs on Sunday of ~$160 billion worth of imported goods from China, most of which are consumer-oriented goods.Tucked in between will be the FOMC meeting, the ECB meeting, the UK election, and CPI and Retail Sales reports for November.Today, then, has the markings thus far of a wait-and-see day, yet the underlying bullish bias can still be described as bullish given the overall lack of selling interest with the market sitting close to an all-time high.The consumer discretionary sector (+0.3%), led by Amazon.com (AMZN 1758.58, +6.98, +0.4%), is today's bet-performing sector followed by the communication services sector (+0.2%), which is led by Alphabet (GOOG 1350.61, +9.99, +0.8%) and Facebook (FB 202.50, +1.45, +0.7%).Six sectors are up and five sectors are down in a reflection of the mixed state of things, which is also reflected in the recognition that the biggest sector winner is up just 0.3% while the biggest sector loser (industrials) is down just 0.2%.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.05%; the S&P 500 is flat; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000 are both down 0.1%.11:03APRE Aprea Therapeutics presents results from US and French Phase Ib/II clinical trials of APR-246 and azacitidine at ASH (29.62 +3.57)The trials evaluate the safety and efficacy of APR-246 in combination with azacitidine (AZA) for the treatment of TP53 mutated MDS and AML.U.S. Phase Ib/II clinical trial in patients with TP53 Mutant Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML):As of the data cutoff, the overall response rate (ORR) in 33 evaluable MDS patients was 88%, with a 61% complete remission (CR) rate, by International Working Group (IWG) criteria. With a median duration of follow-up of 10.8 months, the median duration of response was 8.4 months and the median duration of CR was 7.3 months. Seventeen (52%) evaluable MDS patients discontinued therapy to pursue stem cell transplant. Median overall survival (OS) for all enrolled patients (n=55) was 10.8 months. Median OS in responding patients versus non-responders was 13.7 vs. 3.9 months. Adverse events, regardless of causality, were mostly grade 1/2. Grade 3+ adverse events occurring in > or =20% of patients were limited to cytopenias and infection, consistent with underlying hematopoietic malignancies, and no exacerbation of the expected AZA-related safety profile has been observed.French Phase Ib/II clinical trial in MDS and AML:As of the data cutoff, the ORR in 24 evaluable MDS patients was 74%, with a 66% CR rate, based on IWG criteria. With a median duration of follow-up of 6.4 months, the median OS for all enrolled patients (n=53) had not been reached. In addition, all responding patients were alive at data cutoff. Relative to baseline, mutant TP53 variant allele frequency was significantly decreased in responding patients and undetectable in all patients who achieved a CR.10:44FTSV Forty Seven announces presentation of foundational preclinical data supporting development of FSI-174 in combination with magrolimab as novel all antibody conditioning regimen for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (24.81 +10.37)Forty Seven today announced preclinical proof-of-concept data for its novel all antibody conditioning regimen, comprised of FSI-174, its anti-cKIT antibody, and magrolimab, its anti-CD47 antibody. Preclinical studies in a non-human primate (NHP) model showed that the combination of FSI-174 and magrolimab significantly depleted hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from the bone marrow, with no dose limiting toxicities. The data will be presented in a poster session at the 61st American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.In the preclinical data presented at ASH, FSI-174 demonstrated binding affinity to both human and NHP cKIT receptors, and induced phagocytosis as well as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, FSI-174 was well-tolerated when administered to NHPs as a single agent, with no dose-limiting toxicities. The no-observed-adverse-effect level was established at 50 mg/kg, the highest dose tested. When administered together, FSI-174 and magrolimab demonstrated a synergistic benefit, promoting the highest level of phagocytosis of cKIT expressing target cells and inducing significant HSC depletion nine days after infusion compared to placebo.Forty Seven expects to complete investigational new drug-enabling studies by the end of 2019, and subject to approval of the IND by the FDA, plans to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating FSI-174 in healthy volunteers in the first quarter of 2020.10:39MRK Merck and Seven and Eight BioPharmaceuticals sign clinical research collaboration agreement (88.59 -0.26)Seven and Eight BioPharmaceuticals has signed a clinical research collaboration agreement with Merck, through a subsidiary, to explore the combination of Seven and Eight's BDB001, an immune modulator targeting toll-like receptors (TLR) 7 and 8, and Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), in treating patients with advanced solid tumors. Under the terms of the agreement, Seven and Eight will sponsor and be responsible for the conduct of the clinical study.10:36ATRA Atara Biotherapeutics reports updated long-term clinical results from multicenter Expanded Access Protocol study of tab-cel for patients with EBV+ PTLD (14.72 +0.73)Atara Biotherapeutics presented long-term clinical results from a multicenter Expanded Access Protocol (EAP) study of tab-cel (tabelecleucel) for patients with Epstein-Barr virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (EBV+ PTLD) at the ASH Annual Meeting & Exposition. Results from this analysis demonstrate a high overall response rate, short time to response, and favorable estimated long-term overall survival rates for tab-cel in patients with EBV+ PTLD following hematopoietic cell transplant or solid organ transplant who have failed rituximab-based therapy. Tab-cel was generally well-tolerated in all patients with EBV+ PTLD and other EBV-associated diseases.Safety analyses were presented for all patients treated with tab-cel (n=61; n=26 EBV+ PTLD and n=35 patients with other EBV-associated diseases). Consistent with prior studies, tab-cel was generally well-tolerated in all patients, and no tab-cel related adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred. Three graft versus host disease adverse events were reported, all in patients with prior allogeneic HCT. No other adverse events of special interest including cytokine release syndrome were reported.Median time to response of one month was seen in both EBV+ PTLD patient cohorts. In responders, two-year estimated overall survival rate was 86% for HCT (n=7) and 100% for SOT (n=10) with no patient deaths attributable to PTLD progression. Similar outcomes were observed in the EAP-201 subgroup of EBV+ PTLD patients (n=22) with adequate ECOG performance status, no CNS disease and no PLTD-related ventilatory support who would have likely met the eligibility criteria for Atara's ongoing tab-cel Phase 3 studies. Overall response rate was 55% and 82%, with a two-year estimated overall survival of 79% and 81%, in the HCT (n=11) and SOT (n=11) cohorts, respectively.10:32ACHN Achillion Pharma reports "positive" data from Phase 2 dose-finding study of danicopan at ASH (6.19 +0.02)Achillion Pharma today reported top-line data from a dose-finding Phase 2 trial assessing the safety and effectiveness of its oral small molecule factor D inhibitor danicopan (ACH-4471) in combination with intravenous eculizumab in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) patients who have an inadequate response to C5 monotherapy.The primary endpoint of the trial was an increase in hemoglobin from baseline. A mean increase of 2.4 g/dL at 24 weeks of treatment was achieved in this proof-of-concept trial. Danicopan, in combination with eculizumab, resulted in a significant reduction in blood transfusions with 10 patients receiving 34 transfusions (58 units) in the 6 months prior to screening to 1 patient receiving 1 transfusion (2 units) during the 24-week trial.In addition to improvements in hemoglobin and transfusions, there were also meaningful improvements in markers of hemolysis including bilirubin, reticulocytes, and PNH red blood clone size (%).In this clinical trial, danicopan was generally well tolerated. All treatment emergent adverse events were considered mild to moderate in severity except for Grade 3 severe adverse events that occurred in two patients. Both patients had resolution of their events, remained on danicopan, and completed the study.The company plans to initiate a global Phase 3 trial in early 2020.10:28NKTR Nektar Therapeutics announces presentation of new preclinical data for NKTR-255 at ASH (22.25 +1.80)NKTR-255 is an interleukin-15 (IL-15) receptor agonist that is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical study in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Details of the preclinical data presentations at ASH are as follows and are available on the scientific section of Nektar's website."The preclinical data being recognized at ASH demonstrate NKTR-255's promise in hematological malignancies through its potential to restore both NK cell and memory CD8 T cell compartments in patients," said Loui Madakamutil, Ph.D., SVP and Head of Discovery and Research at Nektar Therapeutics. "In studies presented by the laboratory of Dr. Nikhil Munshi at Dana-Farber, NKTR-255 enhanced the number and function of NK and CD8+ effector memory T cell populations in peripheral blood and bone marrow from patients with multiple myeloma and, also increased expression of activating receptors found on those NK cells. Separately, researchers from the laboratory of Dr. Cameron Turtle at Fred Hutchinson demonstrated NKTR-255 prevented tumor growth and increased survival of CAR T cells when added to a CD19-targeted CAR T cell regimen in models of B cell lymphoma. This preclinical data reinforces the basis of our ongoing clinical trial evaluating the potential of NKTR-255 in patients with multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."10:23XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (59.57 -0.18)The energy sector (-0.3%) displays relative weakness in the early going of today's session. Today's early underperformance comes after the sector gained 1.5% last week, finishing ahead of the remaining ten groups. Factors contributing to the underperformance:Pressure on the price of oil. WTI crude is down $0.27, or 0.5%, at $58.93/bbl. Granted, the energy component has climbed off its overnight low of $58.23 in recent trade, but it remains in negative territory, weighing on the energy sector. China reported a smaller than expected trade surplus for November, which supports the argument that the Chinese economy continues slowing down. This will continue posing a headwind to global growth. Pullback after last week's show of relative strength.Notable movers:Marathon Petroleum (MPC 58.95, -1.26, -2.1%): weakest sector component after being downgraded to Neutral from Overweight at JP Morgan. Chevron (CVX 117.27, -0.74, -0.6%): downgraded to Neutral from Buy at Citigroup. HollyFrontier (HFC 50.40, -0.54, -1.1%): trading at a three-month low. Occidental Petroleum (OXY 37.71, -0.51, -1.3%): on the verge of falling to a fresh 2019 low. Chevron (CVX 117.31, -0.70, -0.6%): looking to remain above its 50-day moving average (117.39). Baker Hughes (BKR 22.64, +0.43, +1.9%): showing relative strength in a weak sector.10:19CNST Constellation Pharmaceuticals provides updated preliminary data from MANIFEST clinical trial with CPI-0610 (56.82 +13.12)MANIFEST is an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of the company's bromodomain and extra-terminal domain protein inhibitor CPI-0610 in patients with myelofibrosis (MF). Arm 3 is evaluating CPI-0610 in combination with ruxolitinib in JAK-inhibitor-nave MF patients. Arms 1 and 2 are studying CPI-0610 as a monotherapy or in combination with ruxolitinib in ruxolitinib-resistant or -intolerant MF patients. Results include:Preliminary data showed continuing signs of activity across a broad range of parameters, suggesting possible disease-modifying effects of CPI-0610.In the first-line treatment arm, 12 out of 15 (80%) evaluable JAK-inhibitor-nave patients treated with a CPI-0610 / ruxolitinib combination achieved at least a 35% spleen volume response (SVR35) at 12 weeks. The median percent change in spleen volume reduction was -49.7%. Ten out of 14 (71%) evaluable patients achieved at least a 50% improvement in Total Symptom Score (TSS50) at 12 weeks. The median percent change in TSS at 12 weeks was -60.3%.Clinical activity, including SVR35 responses, TSS50 responses, and conversion from transfusion dependence to transfusion independence, was seen at 24 weeks in patients in the second-line treatment arm who added CPI-0610 to ruxolitinib, suggesting that treatment with CPI-0610 may have durable effects.CPI-0610 in combination with ruxolitinib in JAK-inhibitor-nave patients was generally well tolerated. No adverse events led to study discontinuation. Three patients (10%) had greater than or equal to Grade 3 anemia. One patient (3.3%) had Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, which was reversible. CPI-0610 as monotherapy or in combination with ruxolitinib in ruxolitinib-refractory or -intolerant patients (Arms 1 and 2) was generally well tolerated. The most common hematologic adverse event was thrombocytopenia.Constellation continues to enroll patients in MANIFEST. As a result of encouraging preliminary data, Constellation expanded Arm 3 of MANIFEST for JAK-inhibitor-nave patients from 43 to up to 101 patients. The company also expanded Cohort 2A, for TD ruxolitinib-resistant or -intolerant patients adding CPI-0610 to ruxolitinib, from 16 to up to 60 patients. Constellation has started planning for a randomized, active-controlled, pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial studying the combination of CPI-0610 and ruxolitinib versus ruxolitinib and placebo in JAK-inhibitor-nave patients with MF. The company expects this clinical trial to start in 2020.An investor event to discuss the MANIFEST update at ASH is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. EST today.10:18AGIO Agios Pharma presents updated data for mitapivat from extension phase of DRIVE PK Phase 2 study in patients with pyruvate kinase deficiency (44.64 +3.70)Agios Pharma today reported new data from the extension phase of the DRIVE PK Phase 2 study of mitapivat (AG-348) in adults with pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency at the 2019 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.In the extension phase, patients treated with mitapivat doses >25 mg twice daily in the core period undergo a dose taper and continue on a dose that maintained their Hb level at no lower than 1.0 g/dL below their pre-taper level. As of the March 27, 2019 data cutoff, 18 of the 36 patients remain in the extension phase with a median treatment duration of 35.6 months (range 28.7-41.9). For the 18 patients in the extension phase, improvements in hemoglobin and other markers of hemolysis including reticulocytes, indirect bilirubin, and haptoglobin achieved during the core period were sustained during the extension period up to 42 months, as of the data cutoff. Adverse events for patients who continued in the study (n=18) were comparable in the core and extension periods. In the extension, the most common AEs were headache (39%), insomnia (28%), fatigue (28%), and nasopharyngitis (28%). No new safety signals were identified in the extension period.The cumulative safety profile, says the company, continues to support long-term twice daily dosing of mitapivat.Mitapivat is an investigational, first-in-class, oral, small molecule allosteric activator of wild-type and a variety of mutated pyruvate kinase-R (PKR) enzymes that directly targets the underlying metabolic defect in PK deficiency, a rare, potentially debilitating, hemolytic anemia. In addition, data was shared from the Agios-sponsored Natural History Study of PK deficiency that detailed the comorbidities and complications associated with the disease and the impact of transfusion history.10:13OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:CLF Dec 9 calls are seeing interest following positive mention in Barrons with 3720 contracts trading vs. open int of 1570, pushing implied vol up around 6 points to ~50%.

The study was designed in two parts: Part A to establish an initial priming dose with flat dosing regimens and Part B to escalate dosing on subsequent administrations to the priming dose. Prophylactic treatment for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was mandated prior to each dose of XmAb13676. XmAb13676 was generally well tolerated, and a priming dose of 45 mcg/kg was chosen for continued dose escalation in Part B for patients with NHL. Safety was evaluated in all 53 patients. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were pyrexia (55%), CRS (53%), and anemia (41%). CRS was more frequent and generally higher grade on the first dose. Three patients (6%) experienced Grade 3 or 4 CRS on the first dose, all prior to the implementation of step-up dosing.

ADCETRIS (brentuximab vedotin) is an antibody-drug conjugate directed to CD30, a defining marker of classical Hodgkin lymphoma and expressed on the surface of several types of peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL). The ECHELON-1 analysis highlighted a four-year update of the phase 3 clinical trial in a poster presentation.ECHELON-1 is evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with AVD compared to ABVD in patients with Stage III or IV frontline classical Hodgkin lymphoma.As previously reported, the ECHELON-1 trial achieved its primary endpoint with the combination of ADCETRIS plus AVD resulting in a statistically significant improvement in modified progression-free survival compared to the control arm of ABVD as assessed by independent review facility. A four-year post-hoc exploratory analysis was conducted to examine PFS outcomes per investigator assessment in the intent-to-treat population of 1,334 patients, including results by PET2 status, age, stage and prognostic risk scores. Results include: The four-year PFS rate for patients in the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm was 81.7% compared to 75.1% in the ABVD arm, a difference of 6.6%. This represents a 31% reduction in the risk of progression or death. Median follow-up time was 48.4 months. A PFS benefit at four-years for ADCETRIS plus AVD was observed for all patients independent of PET2 status, including in patients who are less than 60 years old.Consistent improvement in PFS was observed among patients treated with ADCETRIS plus AVD compared with ABVD across the majority of pre-specified subgroups.As previously reported for the primary analysis, on the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm, peripheral neuropathy events were observed in 67% of patients compared to 43% in the ABVD arm. The four-year update shows that among patients with peripheral neuropathy, 83% in the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm and 84% in the ABVD arm reported complete resolution or improvement at last follow-up. The ECHELON-2 phase 3 clinical trial data were presented in an oral session at ASH and focused on the outcomes of the subset of patients who underwent consolidative stem cell transplant. ECHELON-2 is evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with CHP compared to CHOP in frontline CD30-expressing PTCL.As previously reported, the ECHELON-2 trial met its primary endpoint with the combination of ADCETRIS plus CHP resulting in a statistically significant improvement in PFS versus the control arm of CHOP per blinded independent central review. A post-hoc exploratory analysis evaluated the impact of consolidative stem cell transplant in the ECHELON-2 study for the patients who achieved CR treated with ADCETRIS plus CHP. In the ADCETRIS plus CHP arm, this included 38 patients in CR who received a stem cell transplant and 76 patients in CR who did not. Key findings of this analysis include:The PFS estimate favored the use of stem cell transplant (HR, 0.38; [95% CI: 0.18, 0.82]). After a median follow-up time of 35.9 months, the three-year PFS rate for the 38 patients who received a stem cell transplant was 76.1%. After a median follow-up time of 41.6 months, the three-year PFS rate for the 76 patients who did not receive a stem cell transplant was 53.3%. As previously reported, the safety profile of ADCETRIS plus CHP in the ECHELON-2 trial was comparable to CHOP and consistent with the established safety profile of ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy.10:08SWTX SpringWorks Therapeutics' collaborator GlaxoSmithKline presented data evaluating SpringWorks' nirogacestat alone and in combination with GlaxoSmithKline's belantamab mafodotin (27.00 +2.48)The data demonstrated that treatment of BCMA-expressing cancer cell lines with nirogacestat led to significantly increased levels of cell surface expression of BCMA and corresponding decreases in shedding of BCMA, as measured by levels of soluble BCMA. Further, the combination of nirogacestat and belantamab mafodotin resulted in synergistic increases in cancer cell killing as compared to belantamab mafodotin alone, with an up to ~3,000-fold improvement in cytotoxicity.09:40WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Stock market opens little changedThe major indices begin the day little changed.

It is the Company's intention to resume the Advantage Loan program as soon as management is confident its stated policies and procedures are being followed. However, it is presently difficult to estimate how long this suspension might last.The Advantage Loan program is a material component of the Bank's total loan originations. While it is difficult to quantify the financial impact of the program's temporary suspension, management anticipates a reduced level of near-term loan originations, slower overall loan portfolio growth, and less loan sales. However, management does not anticipate any credit related issues from previous loans made under the program due to the substantial amount of equity required for each borrower and the resulting strong collateral package for each loan. In order to mitigate the operational and financial impact of the Advantage Loan program's temporary suspension, the Company will continue to work on initiatives to diversify its overall loan production. Such initiatives include expanding the Bank's commercial lending efforts, including multifamily, tenant-in-common, construction, and commercial and industrial loans. In addition, management will continue to review new residential loan products that meet the needs of its customers in its served markets.08:13SCANX Gapping downGapping downIn reaction to disappointing earnings/guidance:THO -4.1%M&A news:DPLO -31.7% (to be acquired by UnitedHealth's (UNH) OptumRx for $4.00/share in cash)Other news:KALV -17.7% (announced results of the Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the use of KVD001) MNRL -4.4% (commences 11 mln common stock offering; 6 mln by the co and 5 mln by the selling stockholders) SYNH -3% (approves expansion and extension of the Company's existing stock repurchase program) AUPH -2.8% (commences registered underwritten public offering of $150 mln of its common shares) ERIC -0.7% (reaches resolution on US FCPA Investigations; combined payment of $1.06 bln) LITE -0.5% (to offer $850 mln aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2026)Analyst comments:M -2.1% (downgraded to Sell at Goldman)MMM -1.3% (downgraded to Neutral at Citigroup)ORLY -1.3% (downgraded to Neutral from Buy at Goldman)08:12APEI American Public Education Board authorizes program to repurchase up to an additional $25 mln of shares of the Company's common stock (25.12 )08:10SCANX Gapping upGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:N/A.M&A news:THOR +168.5% (to be acquired by Sanofi (SNY) for $68/share in cash) XBIT +136.1% (to divest Human antibody Bermekimab targeting IL-1a to Janssen) ARQL +100.6% (to be acquired by Merck (MRK) for $20 per share in cash for an approximate total equity value of $2.7 billion) RRTS +10.9% (announces the sale of its Flatbed business unit for $30 mln in cash)Other news:FATE +25.1% (reports clinical data from Landmark Phase 1 studies; no dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients; also presents new in vivo preclinical data for FT596 -- company plans to initiate enrollment of first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in rarly 2020) OBSV +22.1% (reports positive Phase 3 trial results from PRIMROSE 2 trial of linzagolix) TGTX +22.1% (presents triple therapy data from Phase I/II study of ublituximab in combination with umbralisib and venetoclax) PCG +21% (reaches agreement to resolve wildfires from 2017 and 2018) CRTX +14% (reports new data revealing link between bacterial pathogen and genetic risk for Alzheimer's Disease) AGIO +12.4% (announces that clinical proof-of-concept has been established based on preliminary analysis of Phase 2 trial of mitapivat in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia) DTIL +9.4% (announces updated interim clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1 trial of its lead investigational off-the-shelf chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy candidate, PBCAR0191) RCKT +7.3% (presents "encouraging" preliminary results from its Phase 1 trial of commercial-grade RP-L102 "Process B" for Fanconi Anemia) ALEC +6.8% (presents Phase 1 data on AL002) SGMO +5.5% (Sangamo Therapeutics and Pfizer (PFE) report updated Phase 1/2 results showing sustained increased Factor VIII activity through 44 weeks) KPTI +5.3% (reports new and updated XPOVIO data demonstrating 56% overall response) BLUE +5% (Bluebirdbio and Bristol-Myers (BMY) report "positive" top-line results from Ph 2 KarMMa study of ide-cel; met its primary endpoint and key secondary endpoint) APTO +3.9% (reports early clinical observations with CG-806 and APTO-253) CGC +3.3% (names David Klein CEO effective January 14) AM +2.9% (to repurchase $100 mln of shares from Antero Resources) CSIQ +2.8% (authorizes $150 mln share repurchase program) BMY +2.3% (presents data from multiple studies evaluating lisocabtagene maraleucel at ASH) MNK +2.1% (presents data on a novel predictive model to identify infants at risk for infantile spasms) SESN +1.7% (initiated the submission of its BLA for Vicinium for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer under Rolling Review to the FDA)MBIO +1.3% (highlights presentation of updated Phase 1/2 clinical data for MB-107 lentiviral gene therapy for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency)Analyst comments:QRVO +3.4% (upgraded to Buy from Underperform at BofA/Merrill)SWKS +2.2% (upgraded to Buy from Underpeform at BofA/Merrill)NUE +1.4% (upgraded to Buy at Longbow)STLD +1.1% (upgraded to Buy at Longbow)08:10BONDX Overnight Treasury Market SummaryRebound in ProgressU.S. Treasuries will attempt to snap their three-day skid after Treasury futures inched higher during a quiet overnight session.

Weiss, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are highly encouraged by the first clinical data presented from our once daily, BTK inhibitor, TG-1701, which has demonstrated superior selectivity for BTK compared to ibrutinib in an in vitro whole kinome screening. The data presented today show that TG-1701 is an active BTK inhibitor as a single agent and that the combination of U2 plus TG-1701 has been generally well tolerated and active with 6 of 7 patients responding to the triple therapy at 100 mg QD, the lowest dose of TG-1701 tested. We look forward to continuing dose escalation of TG-1701 in the combination arm and identifying the optimal dose for this therapy." Mr. Weiss continued, "Our goal has always been to develop the best possible combination treatment options for patients, and we are excited to present the first data from a triple combination study in which all of the agents are being developed by TG. We believe this proprietary combination has the potential to enhance the results of BTK inhibitor therapy alone and offer patients early and deep responses with a tolerable safety profile."08:02GALT Galectin Therapeutics announces publication of results from its NASH-CX Phase 2 clinical trial in NASH cirrhosis in the peer-reviewed journal Gastroenterology (2.99 )The paper outlines that in a phase 2b study of 162 patients with NASH, cirrhosis, and portal hypertension, one year of biweekly infusion of belapectin was safe but not associated with significant reduction in HVPG or fibrosis, compared with placebo. However, in a subgroup analysis of patients without esophageal varices, 2 mg/kg belapectin (GR-MD-02) did reduce HVPG and development of varices. This subgroup analysis suggests that there may be benefits from belapectin in patients with NASH cirrhosis without esophageal varices. Further, if this observation can be reproduced in subsequent studies, belapectin may have a role in the management of patients with NASH cirrhosis and portal hypertension but no varices.08:01REPL Replimune names Jean M.

This was comparable to historical data with multiple doses of busulfan conditioning.CD117-ADC was well tolerated in non-human primates with no evidence of the often severe side effects seen with busulfan conditioning, including veno-occlusive disease, weight loss, diarrhea, mucositis, vomiting, pulmonary fibrosis or seizures.07:42TPX Tempur Sealy Int'l determines that it will record a charge of $30 mln (before tax) in Q4 in connection with the bankruptcy of one of its customers (85.89 )On December 6, 2019, Tempur Sealy determined that it will record a charge of $30 mln (before tax) in the fourth quarter of 2019, in connection with the bankruptcy of one of its customers, Mattress PAL Holding, LLC, and the resulting significant liquidity issues of Mattress PAL's affiliates (collectively, "Mattress1One"). On April 7, 2019, Mattress PAL filed a voluntary petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code ("Chapter 11 Proceedings"). On December 5, the Bankruptcy Court orally granted Mattress PAL's request to convert the Chapter 11 Proceedings to a Chapter 7 liquidation case. The company plans to treat this charge, which does not involve any cash payments, as an adjustment in calculating adjusted EBITDA under the company's senior secured credit agreement. Mattress1One represented less than 1% of the company's global net sales in 2019, and the company does not expect this charge, or the loss of Mattress1One as a customer, to have a material impact on the company's 2019 guidance, 2020 outlook, or current or future liquidity.07:37IEP Icahn Enterprises commences private placement of Senior Notes due 2027 (61.61 )The proceeds from the offering will be used for general limited partnership purposes.07:35MBIO Mustang Bio highlights presentation of updated Phase 1/2 clinical data for MB-107 lentiviral gene therapy for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (3.85 )Lentiviral Gene Therapy with Low Dose Busulfan for Infants with X-SCID Results in the Development of a Functional Normal Immune System: Interim Results of an Ongoing Phase I/II Clinical Study Lentiviral gene therapy using low dose busulfan conditioning has been well tolerated, with no serious adverse events other than hematologic related to busulfanAll 11 patients had robust hematopoietic recovery within 3-4 weeks post cell infusion without blood product support Nine patients, with a follow up of greater than 3 months, achieved normal-for-age T-cell and natural killer (NK)-cell numbers within 3-4 months post gene therapy Five patients are off intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy thus far, of whom 3 responded to vaccines Median vector copy number (VCN) at 12 months post-gene therapy in seven patients, who have been followed for more than 12 months, was 2.25 VCN/cell (range: 1.24-3.03) in T cells, 0.34 VCN/cell (range: 0.23-1.25) in B cells, 1.55 VCN/cell (range 1.27-3.39) in NK cells, and 0.08 VCN/cell (range: 0.03-0.76) in myeloid cells in peripheral blood, and 0.10 (range: 0.05-0.66) in CD34+ bone marrow cells, respectivelyEnhanced Transduction Lentivector Gene Therapy for Treatment of Older Patients with X-Linked Severe Combined ImmunodeficiencyEarly outcome data for five older children and young adults with XSCID who received the lentivector (also known as lentiviral) gene therapy as salvage therapy after having previously received haplo-identical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as infants without chemotherapy-based conditioning were previously reported and published in Science Translational Medicine. By 2016, three additional patients were treated, and the cohort of eight patients (referred to as Cohort A) has now been followed for 3 to 7 years. Among Cohort A, gradual clinical benefit in the clearance of chronic norovirus and associated improved abdominal complaints, malabsorption, growth and IgG production were observed, and four patients were able to cease immunoglobulin replacement therapy.While the results were positive, the relatively inefficient transduction of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) required large quantities of vector. This resulted in relatively low VCN in myeloid cells in some patients, with delayed immune cell recovery and persistent clinical disease, especially in the last patient treated (patient 8). To address this, NIH developed a refined enhanced transduction (ET) procedure consisting of a single overnight transduction after 48 hours pre-stimulation in cytokines (Stem cell factor, Thrombopoietin, Flt3-ligand; 100ng/mL) and incorporated transduction enhancers LentiBoost 1:100 and dimethyl prostaglandin 2 (dmPGE2; 1uM).The presentation at the 2019 ASH Annual Meeting included data from six patients (referred to as Cohort B) treated by NIH, including re-treatment of patient 8. The patients, who were aged 12 to 36, had significant problems with donor T cell infiltration of liver, bone marrow and kidneys, and were nearly absent of B and NK cells. The enhanced transduction procedure achieved much greater transduction efficiencies than were observed in Cohort A, with greater than 10-fold less vector, and resulted in faster immune reconstitution and more significant clinical benefit by 3 months.07:33AR Antero Resources highlights agreements expected to reduce its gathering, processing and transportation costs by approximately $350 mln over the next four years, commences asset sale program targeting $750 mln to $1 bln in proceeds to be completed in 2020 (2.19 )The agreements include a growth incentive fee program with Antero Midstream Corporation (AM) that aligns with the Company's current 8% to 10% compound annual production growth plan through 2021 and additional agreements with other third party midstream providers.

The primary efficacy endpoint in the trial was change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 16 weeks compared to sham. The 6g dose showed a difference of +2.6 letters versus sham, which was not statistically significant (p=0.223), and the 3g dose showed a difference of +1.5 letters (p=0.465). No significant differences were observed in the secondary endpoints of central subfield thickness (CST) or the diabetic retinopathy severity scale (DRSS). KVD001 was generally safe and well tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events.07:01RCKT Rocket Pharmaceuticals announces prelim data from its Phase 1/2 clinical trial of RP-L201 for the treatment of Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency-I (22.36 )Initial results from the first pediatric patient treated with RP-L201 demonstrate early evidence of safety and potential efficacy. Analyses of peripheral vector copy number (VCN) and CD18-expressing neutrophils were performed through three months after infusion of RP-L201 to evaluate engraftment and phenotypic correction. The patient exhibited early signs of engraftment with myeloid-lineage VCN levels of 1.5 at three months and CD18 expression of 45%, compared to pre-treatment CD18 expressions of <1%. The patient also displayed visible improvement of multiple disease-related skin lesions after receiving therapy. The drug product VCN was 3.8. No safety or tolerability issues related to RP-L201 administration (or investigational product) have been identified to-date. These data are consistent with Rocket's preclinical studies, which demonstrated that administration of RP-L201 in murine models resulted in stable engraftment and phenotypic correction with restored neutrophil migration capability.07:00SUMRX Asian Markets Close: Nikkei +0.3%, Hang Seng UNCH, Shanghai +0.1%Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region began the week on a modestly higher, but quiet note.

All response-evaluable patients experienced tumor reduction (complete response + partial response + stable disease) following treatment with ADCETRIS in combination with OPDIVO. Median duration of response was not yet reached and the maximum duration of response was 22 months and ongoing (95% CI: 7.06, -). The most common treatment-related adverse events of any grade occurring in at least 20 percent of patients were fatigue, diarrhea, pyrexia, infusion related reaction, peripheral motor neuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy and increase in lipase. One treatment-related serious adverse event was pyrexia. Fifty-seven percent of patients (12/21) had at least one treatment-related adverse event greater than or equal to Grade 3, most commonly increase in lipase (24 percent, 5/21), peripheral motor neuropathy and peripheral sensory neuropathy (each 14 percent, 3/21), and fatigue and hyponatremia (each 10 percent, 2/21). Two-Year Follow-up Results from the Phase 1-2 Study of Brentuximab Vedotin in Combination with Nivolumab in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (Abstract #238, oral presentation at 2:45 p.m. ET on Saturday, December 7, 2019) Of the 91 treated patients, 85 percent (77/91) had an objective response, including 67 percent (61/91) with a complete response, 16 patients with a partial response and six patients had stable disease. Of the 91 treated patients, 67 patients received an ASCT per trial protocol with no additional salvage therapy. For all treated patients, the two-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 79 percent (95% CI: 68%, 87%). For the 67 patients who received an ASCT per trial protocol, the two-year PFS was 92 percent (95% CI: 80%, 97%). Median follow-up for all treated patients was 24.2 months (range 1.8-41.7) and the median PFS was not reached. Estimated overall survival at two years was 94 percent (95% CI: 85%, 97%) and median overall survival was not yet reached. Peripheral immune signatures were consistent with an activated T-cell response. Prior to ASCT, the most common adverse events of any grade occurring in more than 20 percent of patients were nausea, infusion related reaction, fatigue, diarrhea, pruritus, headache, vomiting and pyrexia. Other adverse events included peripheral neuropathy in 16 patients (18 percent) and neutropenia in six patients (7 percent). Two patients (2 percent) discontinued treatment due to adverse events, Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy and increased gamma-glutamyltransferase. Serious adverse events occurred in 14 patients (15 percent), including pneumonia, pneumonitis and pyrexia (two patients each); and Grade 3 Guillain-Barre syndrome (one patient).06:52GILD Gilead Sciences reports Long-term data from ZUMA-1 demonstrating about half of refractory large b-cell lymphoma patients were alive three years after Yescarta treatment (67.08 )Co announced new data from the ZUMA-1 trial of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) in adult patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma. These results included updated overall survival data from the pivotal phase 2 study after three years following a single infusion of Yescarta, as well as an analysis from a separate safety management cohort of patients receiving early steroid intervention for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events. Updated results from a separate ZUMA-1 safety management study (Cohort 4) were also presented at the meeting (Abstract #243). In this analysis, patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma treated with Yescarta received earlier steroid intervention, beginning when patients experienced Grade 1 neurologic events or experienced Grade 1 CRS with no improvement after three days of supportive care. Patients could receive optional bridging chemotherapy prior to Yescarta infusion. In the analysis, 41 patients had received Yescarta, with a median follow-up of 8.7 months; 73% of patients received corticosteroids and 76% received tocilizumab. Earlier steroid use appeared to decrease the percentage of patients with Grade > or =3 CRS (2%) and neurologic events (17%), each of which were numerically lower than rates in the registrational cohorts of ZUMA-1 (13% CRS, 31% neurologic events). There were no Grade 4 or 5 CRS or neurologic events and no Grade 5 AEs related to Yescarta in Cohort 4. Objective response rate per investigator assessment was 73% in Cohort 4, with 51% of patients achieving a complete response. The median duration of response was 8.9 months. Fifty-four percent of patients in this cohort remained in an ongoing response with at least six months of follow-up after Yescarta infusion. Median OS in Cohort 4 has not been reached.06:51CRTX Cortexyme reports new data revealing link between bacterial pathogen and genetic risk for Alzheimer's Disease (28.31 )Co announced the presentation of new data supporting the on-target activity of COR388, its lead investigational medicine, and linking the "gingipain hypothesis" for Alzheimer's disease (AD) to the significance of the APOE gene as a major risk factor for the disease.Gingipains from P. gingivalis cleave ApoE proteins and have a preference for cleaving ApoE4; and COR388, a gingipain inhibitor, prevents this. In in vitro experiments, cells infected with P. gingivalis exhibited gingipain-dependent ApoE cleavage activity that generated ApoE fragments similar to what was seen in the brains and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, uninfected cells had no significant ApoE protein-cleaving activity. Furthermore, P. gingivalis gingipains cleaved ApoE4 more readily than ApoE3. Finally, in the infected cells, COR388 alone was sufficient to block ApoE fragmentation. In a Phase 1b trial, COR388 reduced ApoE fragments in CSF. Cortexyme's Phase 1 clinical development program for COR388 included cohorts of healthy volunteers and subjects with Alzheimer's disease. In addition to assessing safety and initial clinical activity, investigators also assessed the level of ApoE fragmentation in the CSF of nine subjects with Alzheimer's disease. Six subjects received 50mg of COR388 twice daily while three subjects received placebo. After 28 days, a statistically significant decrease in ApoE fragments (both ApoE4 and ApoE3) was observed in subjects treated with COR388 versus those treated with placebo.06:51EGRX Eagle Pharma commences dosing in pilot study for novel estrogen receptor antagonist product candidate (56.43 )The company has commenced dosing in a pilot clinical study to assess the unique characteristics of its fulvestrant product candidate, which has the potential to enhance estrogen receptor ("ER") inhibition and improve outcomes for patients with ER-positive breast cancer.

All results are as of the data cutoff date of August 26, 2019.Groups A and B:As of the data cutoff date, seven out of nine total patients in Groups A and B (five out of seven in Group A and two out of two in Group B) did not require regular RBC transfusions post-treatment. Overall, patients in Groups A and B experienced a reduction, but not complete elimination of VOC and ACS events at two years post-treatment, suggesting that the levels of gene therapy-derived hemoglobin may have been sufficient to reduce but not eliminate continued sickle-related disease manifestations. Group C As of the data cutoff date, 17 patients were treated with LentiGlobin for SCD in Group C, with the longest follow-up at 21 months; none required regular RBC transfusions post-treatment. In patients with six or more months of follow-up (n=12), median levels of gene therapy-derived anti-sickling hemoglobin, HbAT87Q, were at least 40% of total hemoglobin. Total hemoglobin and HbAT87Q levels ranged from 9.3 -- 15.2 g/dL and 2.7 -- 9.0 g/dL, respectively, at last visit. Treatment with LentiGlobin for SCD reduced key markers of hemolysis, including reticulocyte counts, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and total bilirubin concentration, which suggests that treatment is improving biological markers of the disease. Among the nine patients with at least six months of follow-up who had four or more VOC or ACS events in the two years prior to treatment, there was a 99% reduction in annualized rate of VOC and ACS. There were no reports of ACS or serious VOC at up to 21 months post-treatment in these patients. As previously reported, there was one non-serious Grade 2 VOC was observed in a patient approximately 3.5 months post-LentiGlobin for SCD treatment.HGB-206 Exploratory Assays bluebird bio presented results from exploratory assays in samples from a subset of patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD from Groups A, B and C, to assess the relationship between drug product characteristics and RBC physiology. To demonstrate the pancellular expression of the gene therapy derived anti-sickling Hb, HbAT87Q, bluebird bio developed an assay that enables detection of HbAT87Q and HbS protein in individual RBCs. In 12 patients who had at least six months of follow-up, the proportion of RBCs positive for HbAT87Q at the last study visit was more than 70% in all cases; with more than 90% of RBCs positive for HbAT87Q in four patients.On average, HbAT87Q present in RBCs of patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD was within the range of non-sickling adult Hb, HbA, present in the RBCs from people with sickle cell trait. The RBCs also resembled sickle cell trait RBCs with regard to propensity to sickle under low oxygen conditions. Sickling of RBCs from patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD was significantly less than that seen in untreated patients with SCD.06:49MNK Mallinckrodt plc presents data on a novel predictive model to identify infants at risk for infantile spasms (3.41 )Co announced findings on the use of a novel predictive model designed to more quickly identify infants with infantile spasms (IS), a rare seizure disorder that typically occurs between three and seven months of age. Key FindingsDeductive models developed to identify the combinations of variables that predict IS prior to diagnosis and during the treatment pathway: 557 patients had =2 symptoms pertaining to IS -- seizures, developmental delay, lack of eye contact and lack of muscle tone -- and a moderate or high severity ED visit.In this group, 55 percent of patients (n=304) had an IS diagnosis within a median 0.8 months of the triggering event. The most notable deductive combinations focused on pre-diagnosis of IS. MethodsThe study utilized data from the Symphony Health Integrated Dataverse database to identify triggers for early identification of IS patients from medical and pharmacy claims from 10.8 million patients under 2 years of age between May 2017 and April 2018. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) procedure codes were evaluated to identify the codes most likely to predict a subsequent diagnosis of IS. Researchers also used input from IS medical experts to determine the clinical, electrographic, radiologic, procedural and medication variables that may predict IS development.06:48SGMO Sangamo Therapeutics announces preliminary results from first three patients treated in Phase 1/2 THALES study evaluating investigational ST-400 ex vivo gene-edited cell therapy in transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (11.66 )The three patients treated with ST-400 experienced prompt hematopoietic reconstitution, demonstrating neutrophil engraftment in 14-22 days and platelet engraftment in 22-35 days (Table 1). No emerging clonal hematopoiesis has to date been observed by on-target indel pattern monitoring in the three treated patients. Reported adverse events (AEs) are consistent with the known toxicities of mobilization, apheresis, and myeloablative busulfan conditioning. One serious adverse event (SAE) related to ST-400 was reported. As previously disclosed, Patient 1 experienced hypersensitivity during ST-400 infusion considered by the investigator to be likely related to the product cryoprotectant excipient, DMSO, and which resolved by the end of the infusion.06:47LITE Lumentum to offer $850 mln aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2026 (72.08 )Lumentum intends to use approximately $196 million of the net proceeds of the offering to repay in full all amounts outstanding under its term loan credit facility, and a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to purchase up to approximately $200 million of its common stock concurrently with the pricing of this offering in privately negotiated transactions effected through the initial purchaser of the notes or its affiliates as its agent.

"The Kyprolis arm of the STOMP study continues to show clear signs of clinical activity, including a complete response rate of 21%, in patients with heavily pretreated Kyprolis-nave multiple myeloma. Additionally, preliminary data from the Revlimid arm of the Phase 1b/2 STOMP study show early but encouraging clinical activity, including in one patient who achieved a complete response, in patients with multiple myeloma in the front-line setting. And finally, we are pleased to be presenting new data from the eltanexor program showing impressive early activity, including a high rate of complete responses in elderly patients with higher-risk MDS."06:39IPHA Innate Pharma presents new, long-term data from pivotal Phase III trial of Lumoxiti; data expands on efficacy results and affirms manageable safety profile (6.20 )The final analysis showed that 36 percent (29/80) of the relapsed or refractory hairy cell leukemia patients achieved durable complete response (CR) with Lumoxiti at Day 181 of patients' respective evaluation, compared to the primary analysis in which 30 percent durable CR rate was reported. In addition, there was a 61 percent probability that patients who achieved a CR would maintain it after five years.06:38AGIO Agios Pharma announces that clinical proof-of-concept has been established based on preliminary analysis of Phase 2 trial of mitapivat in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (40.94 )The Phase 2 study has enrolled 12 of the intended 17 patients (nine with -thalassemia and three with a-thalassemia). As of the November 14, 2019 data cutoff date, eight patients, all with -thalassemia, were evaluable for the primary endpoint of a hemoglobin increase of =1.0 g/dL from baseline in at least one assessment during Weeks 4-12. All eight patients were treated with 50 mg of mitapivat twice daily for the first six weeks and escalated to 100 mg twice daily, and all patients remain on treatment (range 12.4-34.3 weeks). Seven of eight efficacy evaluable patients achieved a hemoglobin increase of =1.0 g/dL, and for responders the mean hemoglobin increase from baseline was 1.76 g/dL (range, 0.9--3.3 g/dL) during Weeks 4-12. The majority of adverse events were Grade 1 or 2 and consistent with previously published Phase 2 data for mitapivat in patients with pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency. Updated results from the Phase 2 thalassemia study will be presented at a medical meeting in the first half of 2020.06:38PRNB Principia Biopharma reports positive data of PRN1008 for Immune Thrombocytopenia in ongoing Phase 1/2 Trial (37.39 )Co announced consistent positive data from an ongoing Phase 1/2 trial of its investigational treatment, PRN1008, in 31 highly treatment-resistant and refractory patients (median of six prior therapies) with immune thrombocytopenia.Of the 31 patients, 39 percent (80 percent confidence interval (CI) 28, 50), irrespective of dose and duration of treatment, achieved the trial's primary endpoint of =2 consecutive platelet counts of =50,000/L, separated by at least five days, and increased by =20,000/L from baseline, without requiring rescue medication. In addition, 45 percent (80 percent CI 34, 57) of enrolled patients achieved any two platelet counts =50,000/L. Most patients who achieved the primary endpoint had a platelet count >30,000/L by the first week of treatment. Preliminary data on 13 patients treated at higher doses (300mg and 400mg twice daily) and who had completed at least 12 weeks of therapy, demonstrated a response rate of 54 percent (80 percent CI 37, 70) and 62 percent (80 percent CI 44, 77) for both endpoints respectively. To date PRN1008 has been well-tolerated at all doses studied, whether given as a monotherapy or with allowed concomitant ITP therapy (thrombopoietin and steroids), with no reported treatment related bleeding or thrombotic events. Related treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 35 percent of patients and were all grade 1 or 2.06:37ZIOP ZIOPHARM presents pre-clinical data of Rapid Personalized Manufacture (5.16 )Data were presented today in the poster presentation "Rapid Personalized Manufacture (RPM) of Sleeping Beauty System-generated NY-ESO-1-specific TCR-T Cells Co-Expressing Membrane-bound IL-15 Yields Antitumor Responses" and demonstrated:T cells can be genetically modified with the Sleeping Beauty system to express TCR and mbIL15T cells expressing TCR and mbIL15 exhibited superior anti-tumor effects compared with TCR-modified T cells without mbIL15T cells expressing TCR and mbIL15 are infused the day after gene transfer per RPMLow-dose of T cells genetically modified per RPM to express TCR and mbIL15 exhibit anti-tumor effectsT cells expressing TCR and mbIL15 persist in mouse model06:36TGTX TG Therapeutics presents triple therapy data from Phase I/II study of ublituximab in combination with umbralisib and venetoclax in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (7.12 )Title: A Phase 1/2 Study of Umbralisib, Ublituximab and Venetoclax in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)Overall response rate (ORR) of 87% (20/23) after U2 induction period at cycle 3, prior to introduction of venetoclax, in relapsed/refractory CLL patients, including patients refractory to ibrutinibU2 induction appeared to reduce venetoclax TLS risk, with no patients remaining as TLS high-risk following 3 cycles of U213 patients treated for >7 cycles and 9 patients for > 12 cycles: 100% ORR (13/13) after cycle 7 for the triple combination 100% ORR (9/9) including 44% Complete Response (CR) after cycle 12 for the combination100% (9/9) of patients had undetectable minimal residual disease (MRD) (<0.01%) in peripheral blood after 12 cycles of therapy; and78% (7/9) of patients who completed 12 cycles of therapy had undetectable MRD in bone marrow and have stopped therapy No patients (n = 27) have progressed to date with a median follow-up of 6.4 monthsTriple combination was generally well tolerated with no events of TLS observed06:36TAK Takeda Pharma presents Phase 3 TOURMALINE-AL1 results (20.26 )Co announced that results of the TOURMALINE-AL1 trial. Key findings, to be presented by Dr. Angela Dispenzieri, include: The first of two primary endpoints was not met in TOURMALINE-AL1. Hematologic responses were seen in 53% versus 51% of patients receiving NINLARO plus dexamethasone versus physician's choice (odds ratio 1.10 [95% CI 0.60-2.01], p=0.762).Complete response (CR) rate was 26% in the NINLARO plus dexamethasone arm versus 18% in the physician's choice arm. The second primary endpoint, two-year vital organ deterioration or death, was not mature at the time of analysis.Safety data includes: Drug-related adverse events (AE) were experienced by 82% of patients receiving NINLARO plus dexamethasone compared to 81% of patients receiving physician's choice. Serious adverse events (SAE) were experienced by 47% of patients in the NINLARO plus dexamethasone arm compared to 33% in the physician's choice arm.06:34BPMC Blueprint Medicines announces initial data from Phase 2 PIONEER clinical trial of avapritinib in patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis (78.48 )Initial data from the dose-finding Part 1 of the PIONEER trial showed rapid and robust reductions in serum tryptase, a well-established measure of mast cell burden, in patients treated with 25 mg, 50 mg or 100 mg of avapritinib once daily (QD). All dose levels of avapritinib tested were well-tolerated, and no patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse event (AE).Blueprint Medicines plans to report additional data from Part 1 of the PIONEER trial that will inform the selection of a recommended Part 2 dose (RP2D), including the change in patient-reported disease symptoms as measured by the Indolent SM Symptom Assessment Form (ISM-SAF), in the first quarter of 2020. The registration-enabling Part 2 of the PIONEER trial is anticipated to initiate patient screening in the first half of 2020.06:34REGN Regeneron Pharma announces initial clinical data for REGN5458 in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma (372.26 )Results were presented today at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting from the first two dose groups (3 mg and 6 mg weekly doses). Patients had a median of seven lines of prior systemic therapy, and all had failed CD38 antibody treatment. Responses were observed in 4 of 7 (57%) patients, including 3 of 4 (75%) in the 6 mg dose group. In the 6 mg dose group, 2 patients (50%) were also minimal residual disease (MRD) negative, meaning that no cancer cells were detectable in their bone marrow.As of data cutoff, there have been no neurotoxicity, dose-limiting toxicities or treatment discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs). The most common treatment-emergent AEs were lymphopenia (n=5), anemia (n=4) and thrombocytopenia and cytokine release syndrome (n=3 each).

The results from the pharmacokinetic and occupancy studies for the first seven patients have been in-line with expectations. The Company anticipates that a dose that achieves maximum target occupancy will be achieved in the next one or two dose cohorts. CPI-818 has been shown to bind covalently to ITK at low nanomolar concentrations without reacting with other kinases. In vitro studies demonstrated selective cytotoxicity to Sezary cells (malignant cells from patients with CTCL), while sparing normal T-cells, in three subjects not enrolled in the study. Preclinical murine models of lymphoproliferative and autoimmune disease showed CPI-818 inhibited the development of lymph node and spleen enlargement by preventing proliferation of abnormal T-cells. Treatment with CPI-818 led to regression of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly in animals with established disease.06:32CGC Canopy Growth names David Klein CEO effective January 14 (18.65 )In his current role as executive vice president and chief financial officer at Constellation Brands, David oversees all aspects of the company's finance operations, all mergers and acquisitions, as well as the company's information technology function.The appointment of David Klein follows a thorough recruitment process overseen by a special Hiring Committee of the Board using global recruitment company Heidrick & Struggles, which saw a wide variety of exceptional candidates vetted and interviewed.

Fourteen patients were evaluable at one month.AUTO3 was well-tolerated, with no patients experiencing > or = Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with primary infusion and 1 of 14 experiencing Grade 3 neurotoxicity that resolved swiftly with steroids. There were no pembrolizumab immune-related toxicities and the majority of grade 3 or higher adverse events were hematological. Low levels of serum cytokines are consistent with the observed low levels of CRS and neurotoxicity. Across all tested doses 5 patients achieved a complete response, with 4 of 5 complete responses ongoing, the longest at 18 months. All CRs were achieved without need for steroid or tocilizumab-based management of the patients or ICU level care.AUTO3 -- (Poster) - Phase 1/2 AMELIA clinical trial of AUTO3 in patients with relapsed/refractory pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pALL) (Abstract # 2620)AUTO3 was well-tolerated overall, with no patients experiencing = Grade 3 CRS and no patients experiencing > or = Grade 2 neurotoxicity, in doses > or =3x106 /kg CAR-T cells. No AUTO3-related deaths were reported.Among the 10 CAR T-nave patients, at a median follow-up time of 9.7 months (range 1.8- 18), 9 of 10 patients (90%) achieved a complete response, and 8 of 10 (80%) achieved complete molecular remission by PCR. Estimated overall survival at 12 months was 100%. There are 2 ongoing patients in complete molecular remission at 12 and 15 months post-AUTO3 infusion, respectively. The most common cause of relapse was due to loss of CAR T-cell persistence. The median persistence of CAR-T cells in blood was 170 days.06:29STOK Stoke Therapeutics presents new preclinical data on STK-001 for the treatment of Dravet syndrome (28.98 )Data from studies in non-human primates (NHP) showed STK-001 distributed throughout the brain and achieved target engagement and increased Nav1.1 protein expression throughout the cortex after a single intrathecal injection. Safety findings showed STK-001 to be well-tolerated at the two intrathecal dose levels studied. These data were presented in a poster session at the American Epilepsy Society (AES) Annual Meeting in Baltimore.Stoke plans to submit an investigational new drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in early 2020 and, subject to acceptance of the IND, plans to initiate a Phase 1/2 single-ascending dose study in children and adolescents with Dravet syndrome in the first half of 2020.06:28FATE Fate Therapeutics presents new in vivo preclinical data for FT596 -- company plans to initiate enrollment of first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in rarly 2020 (13.67 )FT596 is the first cellular immunotherapy engineered with three active anti-tumor components to be cleared for clinical investigation by the FDA. In addition to a proprietary CAR targeting CD19, FT596 expresses a novel high-affinity, non-cleavable CD16 (hnCD16) Fc receptor that has been modified to augment antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, enabling coincident targeting of CD19 and additional tumor-associated antigens such as CD20. FT596 also expresses an interleukin-15 receptor fusion (IL-15RF), a potent cytokine complex that promotes survival, proliferation and trans-activation of NK cells and CD8 T cells without the need for systemic cytokine support. Together, these features of FT596 are intended to maximize potency and minimize toxicity in treated patients. The Company plans to initiate enrollment of a first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in early 2020.New preclinical data presented at ASH showed that FT596 administered as a monotherapy exhibited durable tumor clearance and extended survival in vivo similar to primary CAR T cells in a humanized mouse model of CD19+ lymphoma. Additionally, when combined with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab, FT596 showed enhanced killing of CD20+ lymphoma cells in vivo as compared to rituximab alone. These data confirm previously presented in vitro findings that demonstrate the unique multi-antigen targeting functionality of FT596, and the product candidate's potential to effectively overcome CD19 antigen escape.The Company also announced that, in preparation for Phase 1 initiation, it had recently completed GMP production of FT596. In a single small-scale manufacturing campaign, the Company produced over 300 cryopreserved, infusion-ready doses of FT596 at a cost of approximately $2,500 per dose. The Company's iPSC product platform unites stem cell biology and precision genetic engineering to create renewable master engineered iPSC lines that can be repeatedly used to mass produce cancer-fighting immune cells, replacing the high production costs, weeks of manufacturing time, and complex manufacturing processes required for current-generation CAR T-cell immunotherapies with a lower-cost, easier-to-manufacture, well-characterized, off-the-shelf product that has the potential to reach many more patients.06:27SGMO Sangamo Therapeutics and Pfizer (PFE) report updated Phase 1/2 results showing sustained increased Factor VIII activity through 44 weeks (11.66 )Sangamo Therapeutics (SGMO) and Pfizer (PFE) announced updated follow-up results from the Phase 1/2 Alta study evaluating investigational SB-525 gene therapy in patients with severe hemophilia A. The data showed that SB-525 was generally well tolerated and demonstrated sustained increased Factor VIII (FVIII) levels following treatment with SB-525 through to 44 weeks, the extent of follow-up for the longest treated patient in the 3e13 vg/kg dose cohort.06:27KURA Kura Oncology provides clinical and regulatory updates for lead drug candidate, tipifarnib, in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (15.61 )In June 2019, Kura reported that the primary efficacy endpoint was achieved in each of the expansion cohorts in its Phase 2 trial of tipifarnib in relapsed or refractory PTCL: 1) patients with AITL, an aggressive form of T-cell lymphoma often characterized by high levels of CXCL12 expression, and 2) patients with PTCL who lack a single nucleotide variation in the 3'-untranslated region of the CXCL12 gene. Given the high level of activity observed among AITL patients, Kura continued to enroll patients to acquire more experience regarding safety and tolerability in this population. Based upon the 2016 revision of the World Health Organization classification of lymphoid neoplasms1, AITL and AITL-like histologies represent approximately one-third of all PTCL cases.As of the November 11, 2019 data cutoff date, a total of 26 patients with relapsed or refractory AITL were enrolled in all stages of the trial. Among the 20 patients evaluable for efficacy, five achieved a complete response (CR) and five achieved a partial response (PR), for an objective response rate (ORR) of 50% on an evaluable basis and 38% on an intent-to-treat basis. In addition, three patients experienced disease stabilization. Patients had a median of three prior regimens (range 1-7).Next-generation sequencing of 19 available patient biopsies showed that 10 (53%) carried C336R/Q386E variants in the killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) 3DL2, an immune checkpoint receptor. Four of the 10 patients with KIR3DL2 variants achieved a CR and three achieved a PR, for a CR rate of 40% and an ORR of 70%. This compares to a CR rate of 11% and an ORR of 22% among the nine AITL patients with KIR3DL2 wild type.Regulatory Update: Following FDA feedback from an end-of-Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting, Kura plans to initiate a Phase 2 registration-directed trial of tipifarnib in patients with relapsed or refractory AITL and related lymphomas in 2020. The multi-center, single-arm trial will target enrollment of 128 patients with AITL and AITL-like histologies who are relapsed or refractory to at least one prior systemic cytotoxic therapy.06:26PTLA Portola Pharma presents new interim results from ongoing Phase 2a study of cerdulatinib in patients with specific subtypes of T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (29.21 )As of the November 12, 2019 cut-off date, 64 PTCL patients and 40 CTCL patients treated with cerdulatinib as a single agent were evaluable for response. The overall response rate (ORR) was 34% in the PTCL cohort and 43% in the CTCL cohort. Among the subset of patients in the PTCL cohort with AITL, the ORR was 52% and the complete response rate (CR) was 37%.Among the 64 patients in the PTCL cohort, 14 patients (22%) achieved a CR and eight patients (12%) achieved a partial response (PR). In the subgroup of 27 patients with AITL, 10 patients (37%) achieved a CR, and four patients (15%) achieved a PR. The median duration of response is eight months for all PTCL patients and is greater than nine months in AITL patients. Follow-up is ongoing. Among the 40 patients in the CTCL cohort, three patients (8%) achieved a CR and 14 patients (35%) achieved a PR. Importantly, rapid improvements in pruritus, or severe itching -- a common and often serious condition associated with CTCL -- have been observed, as measured by the Likert scale.Cerdulatinib demonstrated good tolerability in both PTCL and CTCL. The most common Grade 3 or greater adverse events across the PTCL and CTCL cohorts with a frequency > 5% were lipase increase (25%), amylase increase (19%), neutropenia (12%), anemia (10%), diarrhea (8%), sepsis/bacteremia (6%), and febrile neutropenia (4%). The lipase and amylase changes were generally asymptomatic and not associated with pancreatitis.06:25XENE Xenon Pharmaceuticals provides updates on partnered neurology pipeline programs (13.95 )Xenon Pharmaceuticals announced that it will provide updates on its partnered epilepsy programs at the American Epilepsy Society Annual Meeting.Overview of clinical stage XEN901 and Related Patient Survey to be Presented in the "Genetic Epilepsies -- Updates in the Science and Diagnosis" on December 8thPre-clinical work suggests selective sodium channel inhibitors that reduce action potential firing in excitatory neurons, while sparing inhibitory interneurons, may provide promising drug profile06:25IMV IMV presents updated results from SPiReL at ASH (2.83 )The poster, which included additional data collected between the abstract submission and the presentation, continued to demonstrate a favorable therapeutic profile and treatment-associated clinical benefit in r/r DLBCL patients who received the DPX-Survivac combination regimen.06:24QURE uniQure presents updated clinical data on three patients treated in ongoing Phase IIb study of etranacogene dezaparvovec; additionally presents up to 4 years of follow-up data on the 10 patients in the Phase I/II trial of AMT-060 (66.05 )At Least One Year of Stable, Therapeutic Levels of FIX Activity in Patients Treated with Etranacogene Dezaparvovec: Featured in a poster presentation at ASH, the 52 weeks of follow-up data show that all three patients have stabilized and sustained FIX activity at therapeutic levels after the one-time administration of etranacogene dezaparvovec. Mean FIX activity for the three patients at 52 weeks after administration was 41% of normal, with the first patient achieving FIX activity of 50% of normal, the second patient achieving FIX activity of 31% of normal and the third patient achieving FIX activity of 41% of normal. The second and third patients had previously screen-failed and were excluded from another gene therapy study due to pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to a different AAV vector. Reported FIX activity was measured using an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay performed at a central laboratory.At one year after dosing, no patient in the study has reported any bleeding events. All patients have remained free of prophylaxis after receiving etranacogene dezaparvovec. One patient, who had earlier in the study undergone hip surgery due to a pre-existing condition, experienced back pain and treated himself with a single infusion of factor replacement, which was later determined by the patient and the investigator to be unrelated to a bleed. No other FIX infusions were reported by any patient.Stable FIX Expression and Durable Reductions in Bleeding and FIX Consumption for up to 4 Years Following AMT-060 Gene Therapy:In the ongoing Phase I/II study of AMT-060, all 10 patients continue to show long-term clinical benefit, including sustained increases in FIX activity, reduced usage of FIX replacement therapy, and decreased bleeding frequency. At up to 4 years of follow-up, AMT-060 continues to be well-tolerated, with no new serious adverse events and no development of inhibitors since the last reported data.All five patients in the second dose cohort of 2x1013 gc/kg (the dose being studied in the ongoing Phase III HOPE-B study of etranacogene dezaparvovec) continue to be free of routine FIX replacement therapy at 3.5 years after treatment. Based on the six months of data collected during the fourth year of follow-up, the mean annualized bleeding rate was zero compared to an average of 4 bleeds during the year prior to treatment, representing a 100% reduction. During this same period, the usage of FIX replacement therapy also declined 100% compared to the year prior to treatment. Mean FIX activity over 3.5 years was 7.5%.06:22FATE Fate Therapeutics reports clinical data from Landmark Phase 1 studies; no dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients (13.67 )Fate Therapeutics announced initial clinical data for its FT516 and FT500 off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived natural killer (NK) cell product candidates.No morphologic evidence of leukemia and complete neutrophil recovery observed in first patient treated with FT516 Monotherapy for AML following first dosing cycleNo dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients treated with FT500 for advanced solid tumorsFavorable FT500 Phase 1 Safety, Tolerability and Immunogenicity profile validates novel multi-dose treatment paradigm for off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived NK cell products.06:22BMY Bristol-Myers presents data from multiple studies evaluating lisocabtagene maraleucel at ASH (59.95 )These studies included an evaluation of liso-cel in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) (TRANSCEND CLL 004); a study in second-line patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients who were ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) (PILOT); and a separate analysis of patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma who received liso-cel in the outpatient setting across three studies."The results in relapsed or refractory CLL and SLL demonstrated a high rate of durable complete responses achieved in heavily pre-treated patients, including patients who have failed ibrutinib and venetoclax. We are encouraged by the potential of liso-cel to treat second-line relapsed or refractory large B-cell NHL patients who are not able to undergo a stem cell transplant. Finally, the analysis evaluating liso-cel administered in the outpatient setting demonstrates that not all patients require hospitalization and that the safety and efficacy profile across a variety of types of clinical sites is consistent."06:20LLY Eli Lilly presents interim clinical data from the LOXO-305 global Phase 1/2 BRUIN dose escalation trial (119.64 )At all doses studied, LOXO-305 delivered objective responses in patients who had received diverse prior therapies and had exhibited varied molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance.Of 16 CLL patients enrolled, there were 10 responders (8 partial responses, 2 partial response with ongoing lymphocytosis) among 13 patients eligible for response assessment, resulting in a 77% ORR. All patients with CLL have demonstrated tumor reduction, with evidence of deepening response over time. Responses were observed in patients with acquired resistance to prior BTK therapy (those with and without C481S mutations), in patients who were intolerant to prior BTK therapy, and in patients with acquired resistance to prior BCL2 therapy (including one with a known BCL G101V mutation). As expected, LOXO-305 treatment causes acute lymphocytosis, which resolves over time -- a well described pharmacodynamic response associated with effective BTK inhibition. Of the three CLL patients not yet eligible for response assessment (one with the BTK C481S mutation), all three have demonstrated lymphocytosis early in cycle 1. All CLL responding patients remain in response, and all CLL patients remain on study. Of eight MCL patients enrolled, there were three responses (1 complete response, 2 partial responses) among six patients eligible for response assessment, resulting in a 50% ORR. Two of the responders had progressed on prior BTK therapy (but without a documented C481x mutation). All MCL responding patients remain in response and on study. Three MCL patients discontinued therapy in cycle 1 due to progressive disease.Most treatment-emergent adverse events were Grade 1 in severity with the most commonly reported events, regardless of attribution, being fatigue (25% total: 21% Grade 1, 4% Grade 2) and diarrhea (18% total: 14% Grade 1, 4% Grade 2). Two adverse events > or =Grade 3 were attributed to LOXO-305 (Grade 3 leukocytosis and Grade 3 transient neutropenia). No dose limiting toxicities were reported and an MTD had not been reached.06:19AZN AstraZeneca reports full results from Phase III ELEVATE TN trial (47.68 )AstraZeneca presented results from the interim analysis of the Phase III ELEVATE TN trial, showing that CALQUENCE (acalabrutinib) combined with obinutuzumab or as monotherapy significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab, a standard chemo-immunotherapy treatment, in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemiaIn an exploratory analysis, CALQUENCE in combination or alone demonstrated consistent PFS improvements across most pre-specified subgroups of patients with high-risk disease characteristics, including the unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable gene (IGHV), del(11q) and complex karyotype. Overall, the safety and tolerability profile of CALQUENCE observed in the ELEVATE TN trial was consistent with its known profile.06:19BGNE BeiGene presents clinical data from three trials of its BTK inhibitor BRUKINSA at ASH (186.92 )In two oral presentations of BRUKINSA in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), the drug candidate demonstrated consistent safety and a high overall response rate (ORR); in the poster presentation of BRUKINSA combined with BeiGene's investigational anti-PD-1 antibody tislelizumab in patients with previously treated B-cell malignancies, the combination treatment showed preliminary efficacy and was generally well tolerated."The results presented today on BRUKINSA, a BTK inhibitor designed to maximize target occupancy and minimize off-target binding, demonstrated robust clinical activity and a safety profile consistent with what we've observed to date in our clinical trials, including safety data that supported the recent U.S. FDA accelerated approval in patients with previously treated mantle cell lymphoma," said Jane Huang, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, hematology at BeiGene. "CLL or SLL is the most common type of leukemia in adults, and despite the advancements of BTK inhibitor therapy for these cancers, there remains a need for highly selective BTK inhibitors capable of promoting long-term responses, and with a safety profile that is tolerable over time. The results presented here today further demonstrate the potential for BRUKINSA to help people living with these persistent, life-threatening cancers."06:18RCKT Rocket Pharmaceuticals presents "encouraging" preliminary results from its Phase 1 trial of commercial-grade RP-L102 'Process B' for Fanconi Anemia (22.37 )Results presented in the poster highlight preliminary Phase 1 data from two pediatric patients (age 5 and 6 years) who were treated with "Process B" RP-L102 prior to the development of severe bone marrow failure and are in ongoing follow-up. Drug product was successfully manufactured using "Process B" optimization, including transduction enhancers, commercial-grade vector, and modified cell processing. "Process B" drug product is manufactured to commercial grade standards, allowing for consistent drug product across patients and a vector copy number (VCN) two to three fold higher than that administered to optimally-treated "Process A" patients.Once transduced, drug product was infused fresh into patients without any prior conditioning regimen. To evaluate transduction efficiency, an analysis of the proportion of the MMC-resistant colony forming cells was conducted. Both patients exhibited early signs of engraftment based on peripheral blood, VCN and/or MMC-resistance. Preliminary phenotypic correction was also apparent in both patients, as evidenced by stabilization or increases in blood cell lineages. No safety or tolerability issues have been reported.06:18ABBV AbbVie reports new results from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE clinical trial showing the potential of this fixed-duration combination therapy (86.98 )AbbVie announced new data from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE (PCYC-1142) clinical trial, evaluating IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) in combination with VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO (venetoclax) in previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Results showed that patients who received up to 12 cycles of the combination regimen achieved high rates of undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD) in both peripheral blood (PB; 75% of patients) and in bone marrow (BM; 72% of patients). Safety data were consistent with the known safety profiles of IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO used as individual therapies.Results showed uMRD -- defined as less than 1 CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes (MRD<0.01%) by flow cytometry of PB or BM samples -- was achieved at any time after baseline in PB for 75% of patients (122 of 163 patients) and in BM for 72% (111 of 155 patients). The proportion of patients who had uMRD in PB increased over time from 57% after 6 cycles, 68% after 9 cycles, and 73% after 12 cycles of IMBRUVICA plus VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO. The high rates of uMRD in BM were consistent across high-risk subgroups, including in patients with del(17p), del(17p) or TP53 mutation, del(11q), complex karyotype, and unmutated IGHV status. In patients with uMRD in PB with matched BM samples, 93% of patients had uMRD in both PB and BM. With median follow-up of 14.7 months, 3 patients (2%) experienced disease progression.06:17OBSV ObsEva reports positive Phase 3 trial results from PRIMROSE 2 trial of linzagolix for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids (4.57 )The responder rate was 93.9% (p <0.001) for women receiving 200 mg with ABT and 56.7% for women receiving 100 mg without ABT (p <0.001), compared to 29.4% in the placebo group. Both doses achieved significant rates of amenorrhea (p <0.001), reduction in pain (p <0.001), and improvement in quality of life (p <0.001). Additionally, significant improvement (p <0.001) in hemoglobin levels, a reduction in number of days of bleeding and reduction in uterine volume were observed. Furthermore, a significant reduction in fibroid volume was also observed for the 200 mg dose with ABT (p <0.008).The overall safety profile was in line with expectations and confirmed that linzagolix was well-tolerated. The most frequently observed adverse events (occurring in > 5% of patients) were headache, hot flushes, and anemia. Mean percentage change from baseline in BMD was consistent with previous clinical data."We look forward to the results from our second pivotal study, PRIMROSE 1 conducted in the US, in Q2 2020. Assuming positive results, we expect that it would lead to a Marketing Authorization Application submission with the European Medicines Agency by year-end 2020 and a New Drug Application submission with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by Q1 2021."06:16THOR Synthorx to be acquired by Sanofi (SNY) for $68/share in cash (25.03 )Under the terms of the merger agreement, Sanofi will commence a cash tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Synthorx common stock for $68 per share in cash for a total enterprise value of approximately $2.35 billion.

While the DOJ and SEC conduct separate investigations, the same facts have been shared by Ericsson with both authorities. The resolution relates to historical FCPA breaches ending Q1 2017. While the Company had a compliance program and a supporting control framework, they were not adequately implemented. Specifically, certain employees in some markets, some of whom were executives in those markets, acted in bad faith and knowingly failed to implement sufficient controls. They were able to enter into transactions for illegitimate purposes and, together with people under their influence, used sophisticated schemes in order to hide their wrongdoing.Separately, Ericsson agreed to resolve civil charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) relating to allegations of violations of the bribery and accounting provisions of the FCPA. Ericsson agreed to the entry of a judgment enjoining it from future violations of the FCPA and it agreed to pay a financial sanction of $458,380,000, plus pre-judgment interest of $81,540,000.As part of the settlement, Ericsson has agreed to engage an independent compliance monitor for a period of three years while the Company continues to undertake significant reforms to strengthen its Ethics & Compliance program.The combined payment of $1.06 b.

This may just be the calm before the storm considering all the macro-related events set to take place as the week unfolds. S&P Futures saw a relative quiet beginning with only a nine point overnight range. The market is currently trading around the 3144 area, with a high of 3148.50 and a low of 3139.50. In Asia, both China and Japan finished the day marginally higher. The Shanghai struggled to gain much following lighter than expected export data that saw a 1.1% fall in November, compared to a forecast of +0.8%.The Nikkei traded around in a narrow range that culminated with a gain of 0.3%. Heavyweights such as Softbank and Sony both gained more than 1% by day's end. European markets slightly under water. The weaker than expected Export data out of China has likely kept the EU markets in check.

AL002 is a monoclonal antibody intended to enhance the activity of TREM2 and is being developed by Alector for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in collaboration with its partner AbbVie (ABBV). The data were presented today at the 12th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) meeting. The AL002 presentation at CTAD showcases the first data in humans showing that a TREM2 activating antibody engages its target and demonstrates downstream activity in the CNS. The data reported today are from the study's SAD phase in 56 healthy adults, who were enrolled into nine escalating dose cohorts. AL002 was found to be generally safe and well-tolerated. AL002 reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) soluble TREM2 in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating proof-of-target engagement in the brain. AL002 elevated a biomarker for microglia activity in the CSF, indicating proof-of-mechanism. The Phase 1b portion of the study in Alzheimer's disease patients is on-going.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD16:19WTRE Watford Holdings agrees to purchase Axeria IARD; terms not disclosed (26.47 +0.25)Axeria IARD is a property and casualty insurance company based in France.

Ninety-four percent of patients were refractory to an anti-CD38 antibody and 84% percent were triple refractory (refractory to an IMiD agent, PI and anti-CD38 antibody). Results for the primary endpoint (overall response rate [ORR]) and key secondary endpoint (complete response rate [CR]), as well as duration of response (DoR) and progression-free survival (PFS) across the target dose levels and at each of the three target doses explored in the study are presented in the table below. The median follow-up duration for all subjects was 11.3 months.Overall, the safety results were consistent with those observed in the phase 1 CRB-401 study, which evaluated the preliminary safety and efficacy of ide-cel. Instances of grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in 5.5% (7/128) of patients, including one fatal CRS event. Investigator identified grade 3 or higher neurotoxicity events (iiNT) occurred in 3.1% (4/128) of patients and there were no Grade 4 iiNT events reported.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is unchanged.December 15 is fast approaching, and the market is hoping that the U.S. and China can reach a deal to possibly delay the tariffs scheduled to hit that day. Scattered throughout this week will be policy decisions from the Fed and ECB, as well as reports on consumer inflation and retail sales for November.In the meantime, it's been tough for the market to gain any traction amid the losses in Apple (AAPL 265.26, -5.44, -2.0%) and the S&P 500 health care sector (-0.5%). Conversely, the S&P 500 communication services (+0.3%) and consumer discretionary (+0.3%) sectors have provided some support.M&A activity seen some huge premiums, especially in the biotech space. ArQule (ARQL 19.70, +10.04, +103.4%) will be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for about $2.7 billion. Synthorx (THOR 67.66, +42.63, +170.3%) will be acquired by French company Sanofi (SNY 45.35, -0.68, -1.5%) for about $2.4 billion. Both are cash deals.Elsewhere, Texas Capital (TCBI 62.92, +5.03, +8.9%) and Independent Bank Group (IBTX 61.01, +1.75, +3.0%) have agreed to a $5.5 billion all-stock merger of equals.Separately, shares of Macy's (M 15.58, +0.43, +2.8%) have defied a downgrade to Sell at Goldman Sachs. Qorvo (QRVO 109.40, +2.78, +2.6%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.86, +2.53, +2.5%) were "double" upgraded to Buy from Underperform at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Overall losses are very modest, but there has been a noticeable increase in hedging interest and an uptick in defensive positioning. The CBOE Volatility Index is up 9.4% to 14.90, while the benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.82%.Investors did not receive any notable economic data.12:55SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ARQL (51.13 mln +103.83%), ACB (25.3 mln +4.94%), DHR (15.9 mln -0.26%), DPLO (14.31 mln -32.01%), CGC (13.75 mln +13.62%)Materials: FCX (18.84 mln +4.39%)Industrials: GE (13.66 mln -0.81%)Consumer Discretionary: M (23.44 mln +2.77%), NIO (22.42 mln -3.54%), F (11.26 mln -0.03%)Information Technology: AAPL (16.52 mln -1.96%), AMD (16.34 mln -1.01%)Financials: BAC (14.35 mln -0.5%), ITUB (12.41 mln +2.09%)Energy: CHK (37.97 mln +3.16%), KOS (14.66 mln -13.41%), SWN (12.99 mln -0.49%), AR (12.22 mln +25.11%)Utilities: PCG (28.32 mln +17.2%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: THOR (29.66x +170.22%), ARQL (21.4x +103.83%), FATE (8.02x +41.99%), DPLO (7.89x -32.01%), ABEO (6.19x +0.85%), TGTX (3.91x +25.37%), RCKT (3.43x -1.27%), PDLI (2.93x +22.03%), DHR (2.72x -0.26%), SGMO (2.54x -8.32%), BLUE (2.29x -5.29%)Industrials: DY (2.16x -5.63%)Consumer Discretionary: BIG (2.57x +5.51%)Information Technology: LPL (2.34x +10.75%)Financials: IBTX (7.6x +3.8%), TCBI (4.63x +9.29%), AB (2.93x -2.02%), USIG (2.43x +0.14%)Energy: KOS (2.41x -13.41%), KLXE (2.33x +13.56%)12:55SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (70) outpacing new lows (13) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: A, ACEL, ACN, ADUS, ALLE, ANSS, ARQL, ARVN, AVP, BBIO, BBY, BHC, BOLD, BRMK, BXMT, CARE, CASY, CBRE, CDAY, CIM, CMC, CODI, COF, CZZ, DAR, DCPH, DEA, DEI, DKS, DOCU, DTIL, EIDX, EPZM, FMC, FTSV, GBT, GCO, GL, GMRE, GOOGL, INFO, INSG, INSP, INSW, KDMN, KRYS, LAMR, LPG, LULU, MCO, MPW, NKE, OSK, QRVO, RCKT, RS, RYI, SPXC, SSW, STWD, SWKS, TBBK, THC, THOR, TNK, VCTR, VICI, VRTX, WWD, XBITStocks that traded to 52 week lows: AGX, BNFT, CERS, GCI, MNRL, NVEE, OSTK, OXY, PBT, S, SIGA, SYRS, TRXCThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: POWLETFs that traded to 52 week highs: EWK, EWN, FAN, IBB, IYK, JO, OEF, PALL, PBD, QAI, SEA, XBIETFs that traded to 52 week lows: UNG12:54SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: THOR (67.64 +170.22%), ARQL (19.7 +103.83%), FATE (19.41 +41.99%), TGTX (8.93 +25.37%), PDLI (3.6 +22.03%), DERM (9.01 +14.34%), DVAX (6.49 +13.86%), CGC (21.19 +13.62%), NKTR (23.07 +12.81%), ITCI (11.23 +10.1%)Consumer Discretionary: HOME (6.23 +9.88%)Information Technology: LPL (6.9 +10.75%)Energy: AR (2.74 +25.11%), AM (5.3 +18.14%), KLXE (6.28 +13.56%), ALTM (2.25 +10.05%), SDRL (1.29 +9.32%)Utilities: PCG (11.31 +17.2%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: DPLO (3.95 -32.01%), TVTY (19.9 -12.1%), TBIO (9.1 -8.91%), ATNX (16.26 -8.39%), SGMO (10.69 -8.32%), BPMC (72.09 -8.14%), GBT (74.15 -6.55%), CRSP (68.33 -5.58%), ATRS (4.62 -5.52%), BLUE (75.22 -5.29%), ACAD (48.71 -5.23%)Materials: IFF (134.39 -5.39%)Industrials: DY (48.07 -5.63%)Consumer Discretionary: GTX (10.25 -11.71%), MCFT (15.18 -5.36%)Information Technology: SMAR (42.07 -5.8%)Financials: JT (1.46 -5.81%)Energy: KOS (5.23 -13.41%), CCJ (9.21 -5.78%)Consumer Staples: DF (0.06 -7.89%)12:54SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Synthorx (THOR) soars upon premium acquisition agreement -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersTHOR (67.55 +169.88%): To be acquired by Sanofi (SNY) for a premium $68/share in cash, representing an aggregate equity value of approx. $2.5 bln, as Sanofi seeks to enhance its position in oncology and in immuno-oncology through the addition of co's THOR-707, said to have potential to become the best-in-class IL-2 therapeutic for the treatment of solid tumors, and co's other earlier-stage cytokine programs to its pipeline. At all-time highs. ARQL (19.7 +103.83%): To be acquired by Merck (MRK) for a premium $20/share in cash, representing an approximate total equity value of approx. $2.7 bln; Merck sees co's assets strengthening Merck's pipeline, most notably co's ARQ 531, which Merck names as "a compelling candidate for the treatment of B-cell malignancies." Co also today announced final Phase 1 clinical results for ARQ 531 in patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies; ARQ 531 reportedly demonstrated substantial anti-tumor activity and a manageable safety profile, and the data set "confirms the potential utility of ARQ 531 for the treatment of [...] heavily pretreated CLL patients," according to co's management. At multi-year highs. FTSV (26.48 +83.38%): Presented updated magrolimab clinical data in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. In higher-risk MDS, the ORR was 92%, including a complete response rate of 50%, while in untreated AML, the ORR was 64%, among other data. Co, with FDA guidance, has developed a protocol that will allow it "two distinct opportunities to achieve an accelerated approval" while remaining on-track to file an initial BLA in Q4 of 2021. Also announced preclinical proof-of-concept data for its novel all antibody conditioning regimen, comprised of FSI-174 and magrolimab, for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Reaches new all-time highs.Small Cap LosersDTIL (10.21 -48.07%): After spiking to record highs early in the session, the stock now gives up the majority of a substantial run higher that it had netted since mid-November. The volatility follows co's announcement of updated interim clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1 trial of PBCAR0191, its lead investigational allogeneic CAR T cell therapy candidate. Of nine patients treated with PBCAR0191, seven had objective evidence of tumor shrinkage at any timepoint. In the R/R non-Hodgkin lymphoma cohort, four of six patients achieved an objective response at day 28+, including three partial responses (two patients treated at Dose Level 1 and one at DL2) and one complete response (treated at DL2); the remaining two NHL patients achieved early responses at day 14 -- both patients had evidence of disease progression at day 28. In the B-ALL cohort treated at DL2, one of three patients achieved a complete response at day 28+; the remaining two patients did not respond at day 28. The trial is ongoing; treatment of patients at a third dose level recently commenced.DPLO (3.95 -32.1%): Agreed to be acquired by UnitedHealth's (UNH) OptumRx for $4.00/share through a cash tender offer, following a careful review of strategic options by co's Board of Directors. The stock had established new record lows below $3 in mid-November following co's issuance of Q3 results, at which time co's pursuit of a comprehensive strategic alternatives process remained ongoing; by Friday's close, the stock had improved by circa +139% from those lows. TVTY (19.7 -13%): Pulls back to multi-week lows on above average volume after disclosing that the employment relationship between co and its COO, Dawn M. Zier, has been mutually terminated and that co has entered into a Separation and Release Agreement with Ms. Zier that provides that she will receive those payments and benefits that she is entitled to under her employment agreement in respect of a termination without cause. Ms. Zier had served as CEO at Nutrisystem prior to co's acquisition of Nutrisystem, which was completed in March.12:27SFIX Stitch Fix Earnings Preview (25.04 +0.95)Stitch Fix (SFIX) will report Q1 earnings after the market closes (16:05 last quarter).

Other Q2 notables:"In Canada, the transfer of successful practices at DSW in the U.S. to our Canadian banners fueled continued positive momentum in this business," Roger Rawlins, CEO, said. "We were particularly pleased with the growth in Canada of both the loyalty programs and e-commerce sales. Similarly, Camuto Group is delivering exactly what we expected giving us differentiation and bringing added excitement to our retail segments. The Camuto Group team has unveiled the DSW Spring 2020 private label offering and based on the fashion, styles and quality shown, we believe we will be in a solid position to not only see the gross margin benefit as we convert the production of our DSW private label to Camuto Group next Spring, but also to increase brand loyalty and further drive sales within our warehouse footprint."DBI has a $1.24 bln market cap and trades at a Forward P/E of 8x vs competitors such as KSS (10x).12:15AZO AutoZone to report tomorrow morning (1180.16 +7.50)AutoZone (AZO 1180.16, +7.50, +0.6%) will report its Q1 results before tomorrow's opening bell, followed by the management's conference call at 10:00 ET.The Capital IQ consensus expects the auto parts retailer to report a 2.0% yr/yr increase in EPS to $13.74 on a 4.7% yr/yr increase in revenue to $27.67 bln. The company's Board of Directors authorized a $1.25 bln increase to the company's buyback program on October 8. Nomura initiated coverage of the stock with a Buy rating on November 8 while Raymond James initiated coverage with an Outperform rating on October 8. The company has a long history of expanding margins. AZO's gross margin hit a record of 53.72% in Q3 before ticking down to 53.65% in Q4. Another uptick in gross margin would be welcomed by investors. The stock hit a record high on November 29, extending this year's gain to 41.7%. Today, the stock trades within 1.0% of its November high.AutoZone trades at 17.6x forward earnings expectations, which represents a premium to Advance Auto Parts (AAP 151.76, -2.86, -1.9%) but a discount to O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY 443.57, -2.00, -0.5%).11:30BONDX New SupplyTreasury Auction Preview$38 bln 3-year Treasury note auction (results at 13:00 ET) Prior auction results: High yield: 1.630% Bid-to-cover: 2.60 Indirect bid: 53.3% Direct bid: 16.9% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.059% Bid-to-cover: 2.50 Indirect bid: 47.1% Direct bid: 16.5%11:29M Macy's shakes off analyst downgrade (15.43 +0.28)Shares of department store retailer Macy's (M 15.43, +0.28, +1.8%) are outperforming today in an otherwise flat market. That outperformance is remarkable because it flies in the face of Goldman Sachs downgrading the stock to Sell from Neutral and slashing its price target to $12 from $17.Strikingly, Macy's has already exceeded its average daily volume less than two hours into the trading session. That heavy volume and the positive turn in the stock on a seemingly negative development are likely byproducts of the following factors:Investor belief that the Goldman Sachs analyst isn't breaking any new ground with the basis for the downgrade (secular headwinds weighing on comps and profitability). Shares of M were down 49% for the year before today's downgrade.Short-covering activity, which is often triggered when a beaten-up stock makes a counter-intuitive move.Momentum trading as speculators see an opportunity to force a short squeeze.Macy's is the picture of a tax-loss selling candidate, but the flip side of that understanding is that many tax-loss selling candidates are seen as good, bargain-hunting opportunities after the tax-loss selling is complete. The stock's resilience to selling interest today is apt to be helping its candidacy as a short-term, speculative rebound play.11:09TALKX Market Briefing: A mixed state of affairsThe stock market is mixed, and little changed, in today's early action. Buyers have reined in their efforts after Friday's post-employment report rally and ahead of a batch of key macro developments that will unfold this week, the most notable of which is the possible implementation of tariffs on Sunday of ~$160 billion worth of imported goods from China, most of which are consumer-oriented goods.Tucked in between will be the FOMC meeting, the ECB meeting, the UK election, and CPI and Retail Sales reports for November.Today, then, has the markings thus far of a wait-and-see day, yet the underlying bullish bias can still be described as bullish given the overall lack of selling interest with the market sitting close to an all-time high.The consumer discretionary sector (+0.3%), led by Amazon.com (AMZN 1758.58, +6.98, +0.4%), is today's bet-performing sector followed by the communication services sector (+0.2%), which is led by Alphabet (GOOG 1350.61, +9.99, +0.8%) and Facebook (FB 202.50, +1.45, +0.7%).Six sectors are up and five sectors are down in a reflection of the mixed state of things, which is also reflected in the recognition that the biggest sector winner is up just 0.3% while the biggest sector loser (industrials) is down just 0.2%.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.05%; the S&P 500 is flat; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000 are both down 0.1%.11:03APRE Aprea Therapeutics presents results from US and French Phase Ib/II clinical trials of APR-246 and azacitidine at ASH (29.62 +3.57)The trials evaluate the safety and efficacy of APR-246 in combination with azacitidine (AZA) for the treatment of TP53 mutated MDS and AML.U.S. Phase Ib/II clinical trial in patients with TP53 Mutant Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML):As of the data cutoff, the overall response rate (ORR) in 33 evaluable MDS patients was 88%, with a 61% complete remission (CR) rate, by International Working Group (IWG) criteria. With a median duration of follow-up of 10.8 months, the median duration of response was 8.4 months and the median duration of CR was 7.3 months. Seventeen (52%) evaluable MDS patients discontinued therapy to pursue stem cell transplant. Median overall survival (OS) for all enrolled patients (n=55) was 10.8 months. Median OS in responding patients versus non-responders was 13.7 vs. 3.9 months. Adverse events, regardless of causality, were mostly grade 1/2. Grade 3+ adverse events occurring in > or =20% of patients were limited to cytopenias and infection, consistent with underlying hematopoietic malignancies, and no exacerbation of the expected AZA-related safety profile has been observed.French Phase Ib/II clinical trial in MDS and AML:As of the data cutoff, the ORR in 24 evaluable MDS patients was 74%, with a 66% CR rate, based on IWG criteria. With a median duration of follow-up of 6.4 months, the median OS for all enrolled patients (n=53) had not been reached. In addition, all responding patients were alive at data cutoff. Relative to baseline, mutant TP53 variant allele frequency was significantly decreased in responding patients and undetectable in all patients who achieved a CR.10:44FTSV Forty Seven announces presentation of foundational preclinical data supporting development of FSI-174 in combination with magrolimab as novel all antibody conditioning regimen for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (24.81 +10.37)Forty Seven today announced preclinical proof-of-concept data for its novel all antibody conditioning regimen, comprised of FSI-174, its anti-cKIT antibody, and magrolimab, its anti-CD47 antibody. Preclinical studies in a non-human primate (NHP) model showed that the combination of FSI-174 and magrolimab significantly depleted hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from the bone marrow, with no dose limiting toxicities. The data will be presented in a poster session at the 61st American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.In the preclinical data presented at ASH, FSI-174 demonstrated binding affinity to both human and NHP cKIT receptors, and induced phagocytosis as well as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, FSI-174 was well-tolerated when administered to NHPs as a single agent, with no dose-limiting toxicities. The no-observed-adverse-effect level was established at 50 mg/kg, the highest dose tested. When administered together, FSI-174 and magrolimab demonstrated a synergistic benefit, promoting the highest level of phagocytosis of cKIT expressing target cells and inducing significant HSC depletion nine days after infusion compared to placebo.Forty Seven expects to complete investigational new drug-enabling studies by the end of 2019, and subject to approval of the IND by the FDA, plans to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating FSI-174 in healthy volunteers in the first quarter of 2020.10:39MRK Merck and Seven and Eight BioPharmaceuticals sign clinical research collaboration agreement (88.59 -0.26)Seven and Eight BioPharmaceuticals has signed a clinical research collaboration agreement with Merck, through a subsidiary, to explore the combination of Seven and Eight's BDB001, an immune modulator targeting toll-like receptors (TLR) 7 and 8, and Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), in treating patients with advanced solid tumors. Under the terms of the agreement, Seven and Eight will sponsor and be responsible for the conduct of the clinical study.10:36ATRA Atara Biotherapeutics reports updated long-term clinical results from multicenter Expanded Access Protocol study of tab-cel for patients with EBV+ PTLD (14.72 +0.73)Atara Biotherapeutics presented long-term clinical results from a multicenter Expanded Access Protocol (EAP) study of tab-cel (tabelecleucel) for patients with Epstein-Barr virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (EBV+ PTLD) at the ASH Annual Meeting & Exposition. Results from this analysis demonstrate a high overall response rate, short time to response, and favorable estimated long-term overall survival rates for tab-cel in patients with EBV+ PTLD following hematopoietic cell transplant or solid organ transplant who have failed rituximab-based therapy. Tab-cel was generally well-tolerated in all patients with EBV+ PTLD and other EBV-associated diseases.Safety analyses were presented for all patients treated with tab-cel (n=61; n=26 EBV+ PTLD and n=35 patients with other EBV-associated diseases). Consistent with prior studies, tab-cel was generally well-tolerated in all patients, and no tab-cel related adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred. Three graft versus host disease adverse events were reported, all in patients with prior allogeneic HCT. No other adverse events of special interest including cytokine release syndrome were reported.Median time to response of one month was seen in both EBV+ PTLD patient cohorts. In responders, two-year estimated overall survival rate was 86% for HCT (n=7) and 100% for SOT (n=10) with no patient deaths attributable to PTLD progression. Similar outcomes were observed in the EAP-201 subgroup of EBV+ PTLD patients (n=22) with adequate ECOG performance status, no CNS disease and no PLTD-related ventilatory support who would have likely met the eligibility criteria for Atara's ongoing tab-cel Phase 3 studies. Overall response rate was 55% and 82%, with a two-year estimated overall survival of 79% and 81%, in the HCT (n=11) and SOT (n=11) cohorts, respectively.10:32ACHN Achillion Pharma reports "positive" data from Phase 2 dose-finding study of danicopan at ASH (6.19 +0.02)Achillion Pharma today reported top-line data from a dose-finding Phase 2 trial assessing the safety and effectiveness of its oral small molecule factor D inhibitor danicopan (ACH-4471) in combination with intravenous eculizumab in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) patients who have an inadequate response to C5 monotherapy.The primary endpoint of the trial was an increase in hemoglobin from baseline. A mean increase of 2.4 g/dL at 24 weeks of treatment was achieved in this proof-of-concept trial. Danicopan, in combination with eculizumab, resulted in a significant reduction in blood transfusions with 10 patients receiving 34 transfusions (58 units) in the 6 months prior to screening to 1 patient receiving 1 transfusion (2 units) during the 24-week trial.In addition to improvements in hemoglobin and transfusions, there were also meaningful improvements in markers of hemolysis including bilirubin, reticulocytes, and PNH red blood clone size (%).In this clinical trial, danicopan was generally well tolerated. All treatment emergent adverse events were considered mild to moderate in severity except for Grade 3 severe adverse events that occurred in two patients. Both patients had resolution of their events, remained on danicopan, and completed the study.The company plans to initiate a global Phase 3 trial in early 2020.10:28NKTR Nektar Therapeutics announces presentation of new preclinical data for NKTR-255 at ASH (22.25 +1.80)NKTR-255 is an interleukin-15 (IL-15) receptor agonist that is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical study in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Details of the preclinical data presentations at ASH are as follows and are available on the scientific section of Nektar's website."The preclinical data being recognized at ASH demonstrate NKTR-255's promise in hematological malignancies through its potential to restore both NK cell and memory CD8 T cell compartments in patients," said Loui Madakamutil, Ph.D., SVP and Head of Discovery and Research at Nektar Therapeutics. "In studies presented by the laboratory of Dr. Nikhil Munshi at Dana-Farber, NKTR-255 enhanced the number and function of NK and CD8+ effector memory T cell populations in peripheral blood and bone marrow from patients with multiple myeloma and, also increased expression of activating receptors found on those NK cells. Separately, researchers from the laboratory of Dr. Cameron Turtle at Fred Hutchinson demonstrated NKTR-255 prevented tumor growth and increased survival of CAR T cells when added to a CD19-targeted CAR T cell regimen in models of B cell lymphoma. This preclinical data reinforces the basis of our ongoing clinical trial evaluating the potential of NKTR-255 in patients with multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."10:23XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (59.57 -0.18)The energy sector (-0.3%) displays relative weakness in the early going of today's session. Today's early underperformance comes after the sector gained 1.5% last week, finishing ahead of the remaining ten groups. Factors contributing to the underperformance:Pressure on the price of oil. WTI crude is down $0.27, or 0.5%, at $58.93/bbl. Granted, the energy component has climbed off its overnight low of $58.23 in recent trade, but it remains in negative territory, weighing on the energy sector. China reported a smaller than expected trade surplus for November, which supports the argument that the Chinese economy continues slowing down. This will continue posing a headwind to global growth. Pullback after last week's show of relative strength.Notable movers:Marathon Petroleum (MPC 58.95, -1.26, -2.1%): weakest sector component after being downgraded to Neutral from Overweight at JP Morgan. Chevron (CVX 117.27, -0.74, -0.6%): downgraded to Neutral from Buy at Citigroup. HollyFrontier (HFC 50.40, -0.54, -1.1%): trading at a three-month low. Occidental Petroleum (OXY 37.71, -0.51, -1.3%): on the verge of falling to a fresh 2019 low. Chevron (CVX 117.31, -0.70, -0.6%): looking to remain above its 50-day moving average (117.39). Baker Hughes (BKR 22.64, +0.43, +1.9%): showing relative strength in a weak sector.10:19CNST Constellation Pharmaceuticals provides updated preliminary data from MANIFEST clinical trial with CPI-0610 (56.82 +13.12)MANIFEST is an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of the company's bromodomain and extra-terminal domain protein inhibitor CPI-0610 in patients with myelofibrosis (MF). Arm 3 is evaluating CPI-0610 in combination with ruxolitinib in JAK-inhibitor-nave MF patients. Arms 1 and 2 are studying CPI-0610 as a monotherapy or in combination with ruxolitinib in ruxolitinib-resistant or -intolerant MF patients. Results include:Preliminary data showed continuing signs of activity across a broad range of parameters, suggesting possible disease-modifying effects of CPI-0610.In the first-line treatment arm, 12 out of 15 (80%) evaluable JAK-inhibitor-nave patients treated with a CPI-0610 / ruxolitinib combination achieved at least a 35% spleen volume response (SVR35) at 12 weeks. The median percent change in spleen volume reduction was -49.7%. Ten out of 14 (71%) evaluable patients achieved at least a 50% improvement in Total Symptom Score (TSS50) at 12 weeks. The median percent change in TSS at 12 weeks was -60.3%.Clinical activity, including SVR35 responses, TSS50 responses, and conversion from transfusion dependence to transfusion independence, was seen at 24 weeks in patients in the second-line treatment arm who added CPI-0610 to ruxolitinib, suggesting that treatment with CPI-0610 may have durable effects.CPI-0610 in combination with ruxolitinib in JAK-inhibitor-nave patients was generally well tolerated. No adverse events led to study discontinuation. Three patients (10%) had greater than or equal to Grade 3 anemia. One patient (3.3%) had Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, which was reversible. CPI-0610 as monotherapy or in combination with ruxolitinib in ruxolitinib-refractory or -intolerant patients (Arms 1 and 2) was generally well tolerated. The most common hematologic adverse event was thrombocytopenia.Constellation continues to enroll patients in MANIFEST. As a result of encouraging preliminary data, Constellation expanded Arm 3 of MANIFEST for JAK-inhibitor-nave patients from 43 to up to 101 patients. The company also expanded Cohort 2A, for TD ruxolitinib-resistant or -intolerant patients adding CPI-0610 to ruxolitinib, from 16 to up to 60 patients. Constellation has started planning for a randomized, active-controlled, pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial studying the combination of CPI-0610 and ruxolitinib versus ruxolitinib and placebo in JAK-inhibitor-nave patients with MF. The company expects this clinical trial to start in 2020.An investor event to discuss the MANIFEST update at ASH is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. EST today.10:18AGIO Agios Pharma presents updated data for mitapivat from extension phase of DRIVE PK Phase 2 study in patients with pyruvate kinase deficiency (44.64 +3.70)Agios Pharma today reported new data from the extension phase of the DRIVE PK Phase 2 study of mitapivat (AG-348) in adults with pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency at the 2019 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.In the extension phase, patients treated with mitapivat doses >25 mg twice daily in the core period undergo a dose taper and continue on a dose that maintained their Hb level at no lower than 1.0 g/dL below their pre-taper level. As of the March 27, 2019 data cutoff, 18 of the 36 patients remain in the extension phase with a median treatment duration of 35.6 months (range 28.7-41.9). For the 18 patients in the extension phase, improvements in hemoglobin and other markers of hemolysis including reticulocytes, indirect bilirubin, and haptoglobin achieved during the core period were sustained during the extension period up to 42 months, as of the data cutoff. Adverse events for patients who continued in the study (n=18) were comparable in the core and extension periods. In the extension, the most common AEs were headache (39%), insomnia (28%), fatigue (28%), and nasopharyngitis (28%). No new safety signals were identified in the extension period.The cumulative safety profile, says the company, continues to support long-term twice daily dosing of mitapivat.Mitapivat is an investigational, first-in-class, oral, small molecule allosteric activator of wild-type and a variety of mutated pyruvate kinase-R (PKR) enzymes that directly targets the underlying metabolic defect in PK deficiency, a rare, potentially debilitating, hemolytic anemia. In addition, data was shared from the Agios-sponsored Natural History Study of PK deficiency that detailed the comorbidities and complications associated with the disease and the impact of transfusion history.10:13OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:CLF Dec 9 calls are seeing interest following positive mention in Barrons with 3720 contracts trading vs. open int of 1570, pushing implied vol up around 6 points to ~50%.

The study was designed in two parts: Part A to establish an initial priming dose with flat dosing regimens and Part B to escalate dosing on subsequent administrations to the priming dose. Prophylactic treatment for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was mandated prior to each dose of XmAb13676. XmAb13676 was generally well tolerated, and a priming dose of 45 mcg/kg was chosen for continued dose escalation in Part B for patients with NHL. Safety was evaluated in all 53 patients. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were pyrexia (55%), CRS (53%), and anemia (41%). CRS was more frequent and generally higher grade on the first dose. Three patients (6%) experienced Grade 3 or 4 CRS on the first dose, all prior to the implementation of step-up dosing. AEs consistent with the symptoms of CRS, but not reported as such, were observed in an additional 23% of patients and were mild to moderate in severity.10:09SGEN Seattle Genetics and Takeda Pharma (TAK) announce additional analyses of results from ECHELON-1 and ECHELON-2 frontline phase 3 trials of ADCETRIS (116.36 -1.14)These analyses were presented at the 61st Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology. ADCETRIS (brentuximab vedotin) is an antibody-drug conjugate directed to CD30, a defining marker of classical Hodgkin lymphoma and expressed on the surface of several types of peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL). The ECHELON-1 analysis highlighted a four-year update of the phase 3 clinical trial in a poster presentation.ECHELON-1 is evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with AVD compared to ABVD in patients with Stage III or IV frontline classical Hodgkin lymphoma.As previously reported, the ECHELON-1 trial achieved its primary endpoint with the combination of ADCETRIS plus AVD resulting in a statistically significant improvement in modified progression-free survival compared to the control arm of ABVD as assessed by independent review facility. A four-year post-hoc exploratory analysis was conducted to examine PFS outcomes per investigator assessment in the intent-to-treat population of 1,334 patients, including results by PET2 status, age, stage and prognostic risk scores. Results include: The four-year PFS rate for patients in the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm was 81.7% compared to 75.1% in the ABVD arm, a difference of 6.6%. This represents a 31% reduction in the risk of progression or death. Median follow-up time was 48.4 months. A PFS benefit at four-years for ADCETRIS plus AVD was observed for all patients independent of PET2 status, including in patients who are less than 60 years old.Consistent improvement in PFS was observed among patients treated with ADCETRIS plus AVD compared with ABVD across the majority of pre-specified subgroups.As previously reported for the primary analysis, on the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm, peripheral neuropathy events were observed in 67% of patients compared to 43% in the ABVD arm. The four-year update shows that among patients with peripheral neuropathy, 83% in the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm and 84% in the ABVD arm reported complete resolution or improvement at last follow-up. The ECHELON-2 phase 3 clinical trial data were presented in an oral session at ASH and focused on the outcomes of the subset of patients who underwent consolidative stem cell transplant. ECHELON-2 is evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with CHP compared to CHOP in frontline CD30-expressing PTCL.As previously reported, the ECHELON-2 trial met its primary endpoint with the combination of ADCETRIS plus CHP resulting in a statistically significant improvement in PFS versus the control arm of CHOP per blinded independent central review. A post-hoc exploratory analysis evaluated the impact of consolidative stem cell transplant in the ECHELON-2 study for the patients who achieved CR treated with ADCETRIS plus CHP. In the ADCETRIS plus CHP arm, this included 38 patients in CR who received a stem cell transplant and 76 patients in CR who did not. Key findings of this analysis include:The PFS estimate favored the use of stem cell transplant (HR, 0.38; [95% CI: 0.18, 0.82]). After a median follow-up time of 35.9 months, the three-year PFS rate for the 38 patients who received a stem cell transplant was 76.1%. After a median follow-up time of 41.6 months, the three-year PFS rate for the 76 patients who did not receive a stem cell transplant was 53.3%. As previously reported, the safety profile of ADCETRIS plus CHP in the ECHELON-2 trial was comparable to CHOP and consistent with the established safety profile of ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy.10:08SWTX SpringWorks Therapeutics' collaborator GlaxoSmithKline presented data evaluating SpringWorks' nirogacestat alone and in combination with GlaxoSmithKline's belantamab mafodotin (27.00 +2.48)The data demonstrated that treatment of BCMA-expressing cancer cell lines with nirogacestat led to significantly increased levels of cell surface expression of BCMA and corresponding decreases in shedding of BCMA, as measured by levels of soluble BCMA. Further, the combination of nirogacestat and belantamab mafodotin resulted in synergistic increases in cancer cell killing as compared to belantamab mafodotin alone, with an up to ~3,000-fold improvement in cytotoxicity.09:40WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Stock market opens little changedThe major indices begin the day little changed.

It is the Company's intention to resume the Advantage Loan program as soon as management is confident its stated policies and procedures are being followed. However, it is presently difficult to estimate how long this suspension might last.The Advantage Loan program is a material component of the Bank's total loan originations. While it is difficult to quantify the financial impact of the program's temporary suspension, management anticipates a reduced level of near-term loan originations, slower overall loan portfolio growth, and less loan sales. However, management does not anticipate any credit related issues from previous loans made under the program due to the substantial amount of equity required for each borrower and the resulting strong collateral package for each loan. In order to mitigate the operational and financial impact of the Advantage Loan program's temporary suspension, the Company will continue to work on initiatives to diversify its overall loan production. Such initiatives include expanding the Bank's commercial lending efforts, including multifamily, tenant-in-common, construction, and commercial and industrial loans. In addition, management will continue to review new residential loan products that meet the needs of its customers in its served markets.08:13SCANX Gapping downGapping downIn reaction to disappointing earnings/guidance:THO -4.1%M&A news:DPLO -31.7% (to be acquired by UnitedHealth's (UNH) OptumRx for $4.00/share in cash)Other news:KALV -17.7% (announced results of the Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the use of KVD001) MNRL -4.4% (commences 11 mln common stock offering; 6 mln by the co and 5 mln by the selling stockholders) SYNH -3% (approves expansion and extension of the Company's existing stock repurchase program) AUPH -2.8% (commences registered underwritten public offering of $150 mln of its common shares) ERIC -0.7% (reaches resolution on US FCPA Investigations; combined payment of $1.06 bln) LITE -0.5% (to offer $850 mln aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2026)Analyst comments:M -2.1% (downgraded to Sell at Goldman)MMM -1.3% (downgraded to Neutral at Citigroup)ORLY -1.3% (downgraded to Neutral from Buy at Goldman)08:12APEI American Public Education Board authorizes program to repurchase up to an additional $25 mln of shares of the Company's common stock (25.12 )08:10SCANX Gapping upGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:N/A.M&A news:THOR +168.5% (to be acquired by Sanofi (SNY) for $68/share in cash) XBIT +136.1% (to divest Human antibody Bermekimab targeting IL-1a to Janssen) ARQL +100.6% (to be acquired by Merck (MRK) for $20 per share in cash for an approximate total equity value of $2.7 billion) RRTS +10.9% (announces the sale of its Flatbed business unit for $30 mln in cash)Other news:FATE +25.1% (reports clinical data from Landmark Phase 1 studies; no dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients; also presents new in vivo preclinical data for FT596 -- company plans to initiate enrollment of first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in rarly 2020) OBSV +22.1% (reports positive Phase 3 trial results from PRIMROSE 2 trial of linzagolix) TGTX +22.1% (presents triple therapy data from Phase I/II study of ublituximab in combination with umbralisib and venetoclax) PCG +21% (reaches agreement to resolve wildfires from 2017 and 2018) CRTX +14% (reports new data revealing link between bacterial pathogen and genetic risk for Alzheimer's Disease) AGIO +12.4% (announces that clinical proof-of-concept has been established based on preliminary analysis of Phase 2 trial of mitapivat in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia) DTIL +9.4% (announces updated interim clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1 trial of its lead investigational off-the-shelf chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy candidate, PBCAR0191) RCKT +7.3% (presents "encouraging" preliminary results from its Phase 1 trial of commercial-grade RP-L102 "Process B" for Fanconi Anemia) ALEC +6.8% (presents Phase 1 data on AL002) SGMO +5.5% (Sangamo Therapeutics and Pfizer (PFE) report updated Phase 1/2 results showing sustained increased Factor VIII activity through 44 weeks) KPTI +5.3% (reports new and updated XPOVIO data demonstrating 56% overall response) BLUE +5% (Bluebirdbio and Bristol-Myers (BMY) report "positive" top-line results from Ph 2 KarMMa study of ide-cel; met its primary endpoint and key secondary endpoint) APTO +3.9% (reports early clinical observations with CG-806 and APTO-253) CGC +3.3% (names David Klein CEO effective January 14) AM +2.9% (to repurchase $100 mln of shares from Antero Resources) CSIQ +2.8% (authorizes $150 mln share repurchase program) BMY +2.3% (presents data from multiple studies evaluating lisocabtagene maraleucel at ASH) MNK +2.1% (presents data on a novel predictive model to identify infants at risk for infantile spasms) SESN +1.7% (initiated the submission of its BLA for Vicinium for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer under Rolling Review to the FDA)MBIO +1.3% (highlights presentation of updated Phase 1/2 clinical data for MB-107 lentiviral gene therapy for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency)Analyst comments:QRVO +3.4% (upgraded to Buy from Underperform at BofA/Merrill)SWKS +2.2% (upgraded to Buy from Underpeform at BofA/Merrill)NUE +1.4% (upgraded to Buy at Longbow)STLD +1.1% (upgraded to Buy at Longbow)08:10BONDX Overnight Treasury Market SummaryRebound in ProgressU.S. Treasuries will attempt to snap their three-day skid after Treasury futures inched higher during a quiet overnight session.

Weiss, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are highly encouraged by the first clinical data presented from our once daily, BTK inhibitor, TG-1701, which has demonstrated superior selectivity for BTK compared to ibrutinib in an in vitro whole kinome screening. The data presented today show that TG-1701 is an active BTK inhibitor as a single agent and that the combination of U2 plus TG-1701 has been generally well tolerated and active with 6 of 7 patients responding to the triple therapy at 100 mg QD, the lowest dose of TG-1701 tested. We look forward to continuing dose escalation of TG-1701 in the combination arm and identifying the optimal dose for this therapy." Mr. Weiss continued, "Our goal has always been to develop the best possible combination treatment options for patients, and we are excited to present the first data from a triple combination study in which all of the agents are being developed by TG. We believe this proprietary combination has the potential to enhance the results of BTK inhibitor therapy alone and offer patients early and deep responses with a tolerable safety profile."08:02GALT Galectin Therapeutics announces publication of results from its NASH-CX Phase 2 clinical trial in NASH cirrhosis in the peer-reviewed journal Gastroenterology (2.99 )The paper outlines that in a phase 2b study of 162 patients with NASH, cirrhosis, and portal hypertension, one year of biweekly infusion of belapectin was safe but not associated with significant reduction in HVPG or fibrosis, compared with placebo. However, in a subgroup analysis of patients without esophageal varices, 2 mg/kg belapectin (GR-MD-02) did reduce HVPG and development of varices. This subgroup analysis suggests that there may be benefits from belapectin in patients with NASH cirrhosis without esophageal varices. Further, if this observation can be reproduced in subsequent studies, belapectin may have a role in the management of patients with NASH cirrhosis and portal hypertension but no varices.08:01REPL Replimune names Jean M.

This was comparable to historical data with multiple doses of busulfan conditioning.CD117-ADC was well tolerated in non-human primates with no evidence of the often severe side effects seen with busulfan conditioning, including veno-occlusive disease, weight loss, diarrhea, mucositis, vomiting, pulmonary fibrosis or seizures.07:42TPX Tempur Sealy Int'l determines that it will record a charge of $30 mln (before tax) in Q4 in connection with the bankruptcy of one of its customers (85.89 )On December 6, 2019, Tempur Sealy determined that it will record a charge of $30 mln (before tax) in the fourth quarter of 2019, in connection with the bankruptcy of one of its customers, Mattress PAL Holding, LLC, and the resulting significant liquidity issues of Mattress PAL's affiliates (collectively, "Mattress1One"). On April 7, 2019, Mattress PAL filed a voluntary petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code ("Chapter 11 Proceedings"). On December 5, the Bankruptcy Court orally granted Mattress PAL's request to convert the Chapter 11 Proceedings to a Chapter 7 liquidation case. The company plans to treat this charge, which does not involve any cash payments, as an adjustment in calculating adjusted EBITDA under the company's senior secured credit agreement. Mattress1One represented less than 1% of the company's global net sales in 2019, and the company does not expect this charge, or the loss of Mattress1One as a customer, to have a material impact on the company's 2019 guidance, 2020 outlook, or current or future liquidity.07:37IEP Icahn Enterprises commences private placement of Senior Notes due 2027 (61.61 )The proceeds from the offering will be used for general limited partnership purposes.07:35MBIO Mustang Bio highlights presentation of updated Phase 1/2 clinical data for MB-107 lentiviral gene therapy for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (3.85 )Lentiviral Gene Therapy with Low Dose Busulfan for Infants with X-SCID Results in the Development of a Functional Normal Immune System: Interim Results of an Ongoing Phase I/II Clinical Study Lentiviral gene therapy using low dose busulfan conditioning has been well tolerated, with no serious adverse events other than hematologic related to busulfanAll 11 patients had robust hematopoietic recovery within 3-4 weeks post cell infusion without blood product support Nine patients, with a follow up of greater than 3 months, achieved normal-for-age T-cell and natural killer (NK)-cell numbers within 3-4 months post gene therapy Five patients are off intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy thus far, of whom 3 responded to vaccines Median vector copy number (VCN) at 12 months post-gene therapy in seven patients, who have been followed for more than 12 months, was 2.25 VCN/cell (range: 1.24-3.03) in T cells, 0.34 VCN/cell (range: 0.23-1.25) in B cells, 1.55 VCN/cell (range 1.27-3.39) in NK cells, and 0.08 VCN/cell (range: 0.03-0.76) in myeloid cells in peripheral blood, and 0.10 (range: 0.05-0.66) in CD34+ bone marrow cells, respectivelyEnhanced Transduction Lentivector Gene Therapy for Treatment of Older Patients with X-Linked Severe Combined ImmunodeficiencyEarly outcome data for five older children and young adults with XSCID who received the lentivector (also known as lentiviral) gene therapy as salvage therapy after having previously received haplo-identical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as infants without chemotherapy-based conditioning were previously reported and published in Science Translational Medicine. By 2016, three additional patients were treated, and the cohort of eight patients (referred to as Cohort A) has now been followed for 3 to 7 years. Among Cohort A, gradual clinical benefit in the clearance of chronic norovirus and associated improved abdominal complaints, malabsorption, growth and IgG production were observed, and four patients were able to cease immunoglobulin replacement therapy.While the results were positive, the relatively inefficient transduction of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) required large quantities of vector. This resulted in relatively low VCN in myeloid cells in some patients, with delayed immune cell recovery and persistent clinical disease, especially in the last patient treated (patient 8). To address this, NIH developed a refined enhanced transduction (ET) procedure consisting of a single overnight transduction after 48 hours pre-stimulation in cytokines (Stem cell factor, Thrombopoietin, Flt3-ligand; 100ng/mL) and incorporated transduction enhancers LentiBoost 1:100 and dimethyl prostaglandin 2 (dmPGE2; 1uM).The presentation at the 2019 ASH Annual Meeting included data from six patients (referred to as Cohort B) treated by NIH, including re-treatment of patient 8. The patients, who were aged 12 to 36, had significant problems with donor T cell infiltration of liver, bone marrow and kidneys, and were nearly absent of B and NK cells. The enhanced transduction procedure achieved much greater transduction efficiencies than were observed in Cohort A, with greater than 10-fold less vector, and resulted in faster immune reconstitution and more significant clinical benefit by 3 months.07:33AR Antero Resources highlights agreements expected to reduce its gathering, processing and transportation costs by approximately $350 mln over the next four years, commences asset sale program targeting $750 mln to $1 bln in proceeds to be completed in 2020 (2.19 )The agreements include a growth incentive fee program with Antero Midstream Corporation (AM) that aligns with the Company's current 8% to 10% compound annual production growth plan through 2021 and additional agreements with other third party midstream providers.

All response-evaluable patients experienced tumor reduction (complete response + partial response + stable disease) following treatment with ADCETRIS in combination with OPDIVO. Median duration of response was not yet reached and the maximum duration of response was 22 months and ongoing (95% CI: 7.06, -). The most common treatment-related adverse events of any grade occurring in at least 20 percent of patients were fatigue, diarrhea, pyrexia, infusion related reaction, peripheral motor neuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy and increase in lipase. One treatment-related serious adverse event was pyrexia. Fifty-seven percent of patients (12/21) had at least one treatment-related adverse event greater than or equal to Grade 3, most commonly increase in lipase (24 percent, 5/21), peripheral motor neuropathy and peripheral sensory neuropathy (each 14 percent, 3/21), and fatigue and hyponatremia (each 10 percent, 2/21). Two-Year Follow-up Results from the Phase 1-2 Study of Brentuximab Vedotin in Combination with Nivolumab in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (Abstract #238, oral presentation at 2:45 p.m. ET on Saturday, December 7, 2019) Of the 91 treated patients, 85 percent (77/91) had an objective response, including 67 percent (61/91) with a complete response, 16 patients with a partial response and six patients had stable disease. Of the 91 treated patients, 67 patients received an ASCT per trial protocol with no additional salvage therapy. For all treated patients, the two-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 79 percent (95% CI: 68%, 87%). For the 67 patients who received an ASCT per trial protocol, the two-year PFS was 92 percent (95% CI: 80%, 97%). Median follow-up for all treated patients was 24.2 months (range 1.8-41.7) and the median PFS was not reached. Estimated overall survival at two years was 94 percent (95% CI: 85%, 97%) and median overall survival was not yet reached. Peripheral immune signatures were consistent with an activated T-cell response. Prior to ASCT, the most common adverse events of any grade occurring in more than 20 percent of patients were nausea, infusion related reaction, fatigue, diarrhea, pruritus, headache, vomiting and pyrexia. Other adverse events included peripheral neuropathy in 16 patients (18 percent) and neutropenia in six patients (7 percent). Two patients (2 percent) discontinued treatment due to adverse events, Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy and increased gamma-glutamyltransferase. Serious adverse events occurred in 14 patients (15 percent), including pneumonia, pneumonitis and pyrexia (two patients each); and Grade 3 Guillain-Barre syndrome (one patient).06:52GILD Gilead Sciences reports Long-term data from ZUMA-1 demonstrating about half of refractory large b-cell lymphoma patients were alive three years after Yescarta treatment (67.08 )Co announced new data from the ZUMA-1 trial of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) in adult patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma. These results included updated overall survival data from the pivotal phase 2 study after three years following a single infusion of Yescarta, as well as an analysis from a separate safety management cohort of patients receiving early steroid intervention for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events. Updated results from a separate ZUMA-1 safety management study (Cohort 4) were also presented at the meeting (Abstract #243). In this analysis, patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma treated with Yescarta received earlier steroid intervention, beginning when patients experienced Grade 1 neurologic events or experienced Grade 1 CRS with no improvement after three days of supportive care. Patients could receive optional bridging chemotherapy prior to Yescarta infusion. In the analysis, 41 patients had received Yescarta, with a median follow-up of 8.7 months; 73% of patients received corticosteroids and 76% received tocilizumab. Earlier steroid use appeared to decrease the percentage of patients with Grade > or =3 CRS (2%) and neurologic events (17%), each of which were numerically lower than rates in the registrational cohorts of ZUMA-1 (13% CRS, 31% neurologic events). There were no Grade 4 or 5 CRS or neurologic events and no Grade 5 AEs related to Yescarta in Cohort 4. Objective response rate per investigator assessment was 73% in Cohort 4, with 51% of patients achieving a complete response. The median duration of response was 8.9 months. Fifty-four percent of patients in this cohort remained in an ongoing response with at least six months of follow-up after Yescarta infusion. Median OS in Cohort 4 has not been reached.06:51CRTX Cortexyme reports new data revealing link between bacterial pathogen and genetic risk for Alzheimer's Disease (28.31 )Co announced the presentation of new data supporting the on-target activity of COR388, its lead investigational medicine, and linking the "gingipain hypothesis" for Alzheimer's disease (AD) to the significance of the APOE gene as a major risk factor for the disease.Gingipains from P. gingivalis cleave ApoE proteins and have a preference for cleaving ApoE4; and COR388, a gingipain inhibitor, prevents this. In in vitro experiments, cells infected with P. gingivalis exhibited gingipain-dependent ApoE cleavage activity that generated ApoE fragments similar to what was seen in the brains and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, uninfected cells had no significant ApoE protein-cleaving activity. Furthermore, P. gingivalis gingipains cleaved ApoE4 more readily than ApoE3. Finally, in the infected cells, COR388 alone was sufficient to block ApoE fragmentation. In a Phase 1b trial, COR388 reduced ApoE fragments in CSF. Cortexyme's Phase 1 clinical development program for COR388 included cohorts of healthy volunteers and subjects with Alzheimer's disease. In addition to assessing safety and initial clinical activity, investigators also assessed the level of ApoE fragmentation in the CSF of nine subjects with Alzheimer's disease. Six subjects received 50mg of COR388 twice daily while three subjects received placebo. After 28 days, a statistically significant decrease in ApoE fragments (both ApoE4 and ApoE3) was observed in subjects treated with COR388 versus those treated with placebo.06:51EGRX Eagle Pharma commences dosing in pilot study for novel estrogen receptor antagonist product candidate (56.43 )The company has commenced dosing in a pilot clinical study to assess the unique characteristics of its fulvestrant product candidate, which has the potential to enhance estrogen receptor ("ER") inhibition and improve outcomes for patients with ER-positive breast cancer.

All results are as of the data cutoff date of August 26, 2019.Groups A and B:As of the data cutoff date, seven out of nine total patients in Groups A and B (five out of seven in Group A and two out of two in Group B) did not require regular RBC transfusions post-treatment. Overall, patients in Groups A and B experienced a reduction, but not complete elimination of VOC and ACS events at two years post-treatment, suggesting that the levels of gene therapy-derived hemoglobin may have been sufficient to reduce but not eliminate continued sickle-related disease manifestations. Group C As of the data cutoff date, 17 patients were treated with LentiGlobin for SCD in Group C, with the longest follow-up at 21 months; none required regular RBC transfusions post-treatment. In patients with six or more months of follow-up (n=12), median levels of gene therapy-derived anti-sickling hemoglobin, HbAT87Q, were at least 40% of total hemoglobin. Total hemoglobin and HbAT87Q levels ranged from 9.3 -- 15.2 g/dL and 2.7 -- 9.0 g/dL, respectively, at last visit. Treatment with LentiGlobin for SCD reduced key markers of hemolysis, including reticulocyte counts, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and total bilirubin concentration, which suggests that treatment is improving biological markers of the disease. Among the nine patients with at least six months of follow-up who had four or more VOC or ACS events in the two years prior to treatment, there was a 99% reduction in annualized rate of VOC and ACS. There were no reports of ACS or serious VOC at up to 21 months post-treatment in these patients. As previously reported, there was one non-serious Grade 2 VOC was observed in a patient approximately 3.5 months post-LentiGlobin for SCD treatment.HGB-206 Exploratory Assays bluebird bio presented results from exploratory assays in samples from a subset of patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD from Groups A, B and C, to assess the relationship between drug product characteristics and RBC physiology. To demonstrate the pancellular expression of the gene therapy derived anti-sickling Hb, HbAT87Q, bluebird bio developed an assay that enables detection of HbAT87Q and HbS protein in individual RBCs. In 12 patients who had at least six months of follow-up, the proportion of RBCs positive for HbAT87Q at the last study visit was more than 70% in all cases; with more than 90% of RBCs positive for HbAT87Q in four patients.On average, HbAT87Q present in RBCs of patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD was within the range of non-sickling adult Hb, HbA, present in the RBCs from people with sickle cell trait. The RBCs also resembled sickle cell trait RBCs with regard to propensity to sickle under low oxygen conditions. Sickling of RBCs from patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD was significantly less than that seen in untreated patients with SCD.06:49MNK Mallinckrodt plc presents data on a novel predictive model to identify infants at risk for infantile spasms (3.41 )Co announced findings on the use of a novel predictive model designed to more quickly identify infants with infantile spasms (IS), a rare seizure disorder that typically occurs between three and seven months of age. Key FindingsDeductive models developed to identify the combinations of variables that predict IS prior to diagnosis and during the treatment pathway: 557 patients had =2 symptoms pertaining to IS -- seizures, developmental delay, lack of eye contact and lack of muscle tone -- and a moderate or high severity ED visit. In this group, 55 percent of patients (n=304) had an IS diagnosis within a median 0.8 months of the triggering event. The most notable deductive combinations focused on pre-diagnosis of IS. MethodsThe study utilized data from the Symphony Health Integrated Dataverse database to identify triggers for early identification of IS patients from medical and pharmacy claims from 10.8 million patients under 2 years of age between May 2017 and April 2018. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) procedure codes were evaluated to identify the codes most likely to predict a subsequent diagnosis of IS. Researchers also used input from IS medical experts to determine the clinical, electrographic, radiologic, procedural and medication variables that may predict IS development.06:48SGMO Sangamo Therapeutics announces preliminary results from first three patients treated in Phase 1/2 THALES study evaluating investigational ST-400 ex vivo gene-edited cell therapy in transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (11.66 )The three patients treated with ST-400 experienced prompt hematopoietic reconstitution, demonstrating neutrophil engraftment in 14-22 days and platelet engraftment in 22-35 days (Table 1). No emerging clonal hematopoiesis has to date been observed by on-target indel pattern monitoring in the three treated patients. Reported adverse events (AEs) are consistent with the known toxicities of mobilization, apheresis, and myeloablative busulfan conditioning. One serious adverse event (SAE) related to ST-400 was reported. As previously disclosed, Patient 1 experienced hypersensitivity during ST-400 infusion considered by the investigator to be likely related to the product cryoprotectant excipient, DMSO, and which resolved by the end of the infusion.06:47LITE Lumentum to offer $850 mln aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2026 (72.08 )Lumentum intends to use approximately $196 million of the net proceeds of the offering to repay in full all amounts outstanding under its term loan credit facility, and a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to purchase up to approximately $200 million of its common stock concurrently with the pricing of this offering in privately negotiated transactions effected through the initial purchaser of the notes or its affiliates as its agent.

Fourteen patients were evaluable at one month.AUTO3 was well-tolerated, with no patients experiencing > or = Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with primary infusion and 1 of 14 experiencing Grade 3 neurotoxicity that resolved swiftly with steroids. There were no pembrolizumab immune-related toxicities and the majority of grade 3 or higher adverse events were hematological. Low levels of serum cytokines are consistent with the observed low levels of CRS and neurotoxicity. Across all tested doses 5 patients achieved a complete response, with 4 of 5 complete responses ongoing, the longest at 18 months. All CRs were achieved without need for steroid or tocilizumab-based management of the patients or ICU level care.AUTO3 -- (Poster) - Phase 1/2 AMELIA clinical trial of AUTO3 in patients with relapsed/refractory pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pALL) (Abstract # 2620)AUTO3 was well-tolerated overall, with no patients experiencing = Grade 3 CRS and no patients experiencing > or = Grade 2 neurotoxicity, in doses > or =3x106 /kg CAR-T cells. No AUTO3-related deaths were reported.Among the 10 CAR T-nave patients, at a median follow-up time of 9.7 months (range 1.8- 18), 9 of 10 patients (90%) achieved a complete response, and 8 of 10 (80%) achieved complete molecular remission by PCR. Estimated overall survival at 12 months was 100%. There are 2 ongoing patients in complete molecular remission at 12 and 15 months post-AUTO3 infusion, respectively. The most common cause of relapse was due to loss of CAR T-cell persistence. The median persistence of CAR-T cells in blood was 170 days.06:29STOK Stoke Therapeutics presents new preclinical data on STK-001 for the treatment of Dravet syndrome (28.98 )Data from studies in non-human primates (NHP) showed STK-001 distributed throughout the brain and achieved target engagement and increased Nav1.1 protein expression throughout the cortex after a single intrathecal injection. Safety findings showed STK-001 to be well-tolerated at the two intrathecal dose levels studied. These data were presented in a poster session at the American Epilepsy Society (AES) Annual Meeting in Baltimore.Stoke plans to submit an investigational new drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in early 2020 and, subject to acceptance of the IND, plans to initiate a Phase 1/2 single-ascending dose study in children and adolescents with Dravet syndrome in the first half of 2020.06:28FATE Fate Therapeutics presents new in vivo preclinical data for FT596 -- company plans to initiate enrollment of first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in rarly 2020 (13.67 )FT596 is the first cellular immunotherapy engineered with three active anti-tumor components to be cleared for clinical investigation by the FDA. In addition to a proprietary CAR targeting CD19, FT596 expresses a novel high-affinity, non-cleavable CD16 (hnCD16) Fc receptor that has been modified to augment antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, enabling coincident targeting of CD19 and additional tumor-associated antigens such as CD20. FT596 also expresses an interleukin-15 receptor fusion (IL-15RF), a potent cytokine complex that promotes survival, proliferation and trans-activation of NK cells and CD8 T cells without the need for systemic cytokine support. Together, these features of FT596 are intended to maximize potency and minimize toxicity in treated patients. The Company plans to initiate enrollment of a first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in early 2020.New preclinical data presented at ASH showed that FT596 administered as a monotherapy exhibited durable tumor clearance and extended survival in vivo similar to primary CAR T cells in a humanized mouse model of CD19+ lymphoma. Additionally, when combined with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab, FT596 showed enhanced killing of CD20+ lymphoma cells in vivo as compared to rituximab alone. These data confirm previously presented in vitro findings that demonstrate the unique multi-antigen targeting functionality of FT596, and the product candidate's potential to effectively overcome CD19 antigen escape.The Company also announced that, in preparation for Phase 1 initiation, it had recently completed GMP production of FT596. In a single small-scale manufacturing campaign, the Company produced over 300 cryopreserved, infusion-ready doses of FT596 at a cost of approximately $2,500 per dose. The Company's iPSC product platform unites stem cell biology and precision genetic engineering to create renewable master engineered iPSC lines that can be repeatedly used to mass produce cancer-fighting immune cells, replacing the high production costs, weeks of manufacturing time, and complex manufacturing processes required for current-generation CAR T-cell immunotherapies with a lower-cost, easier-to-manufacture, well-characterized, off-the-shelf product that has the potential to reach many more patients.06:27SGMO Sangamo Therapeutics and Pfizer (PFE) report updated Phase 1/2 results showing sustained increased Factor VIII activity through 44 weeks (11.66 )Sangamo Therapeutics (SGMO) and Pfizer (PFE) announced updated follow-up results from the Phase 1/2 Alta study evaluating investigational SB-525 gene therapy in patients with severe hemophilia A. The data showed that SB-525 was generally well tolerated and demonstrated sustained increased Factor VIII (FVIII) levels following treatment with SB-525 through to 44 weeks, the extent of follow-up for the longest treated patient in the 3e13 vg/kg dose cohort.06:27KURA Kura Oncology provides clinical and regulatory updates for lead drug candidate, tipifarnib, in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (15.61 )In June 2019, Kura reported that the primary efficacy endpoint was achieved in each of the expansion cohorts in its Phase 2 trial of tipifarnib in relapsed or refractory PTCL: 1) patients with AITL, an aggressive form of T-cell lymphoma often characterized by high levels of CXCL12 expression, and 2) patients with PTCL who lack a single nucleotide variation in the 3'-untranslated region of the CXCL12 gene. Given the high level of activity observed among AITL patients, Kura continued to enroll patients to acquire more experience regarding safety and tolerability in this population. Based upon the 2016 revision of the World Health Organization classification of lymphoid neoplasms1, AITL and AITL-like histologies represent approximately one-third of all PTCL cases.As of the November 11, 2019 data cutoff date, a total of 26 patients with relapsed or refractory AITL were enrolled in all stages of the trial. Among the 20 patients evaluable for efficacy, five achieved a complete response (CR) and five achieved a partial response (PR), for an objective response rate (ORR) of 50% on an evaluable basis and 38% on an intent-to-treat basis. In addition, three patients experienced disease stabilization. Patients had a median of three prior regimens (range 1-7).Next-generation sequencing of 19 available patient biopsies showed that 10 (53%) carried C336R/Q386E variants in the killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) 3DL2, an immune checkpoint receptor. Four of the 10 patients with KIR3DL2 variants achieved a CR and three achieved a PR, for a CR rate of 40% and an ORR of 70%. This compares to a CR rate of 11% and an ORR of 22% among the nine AITL patients with KIR3DL2 wild type.Regulatory Update: Following FDA feedback from an end-of-Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting, Kura plans to initiate a Phase 2 registration-directed trial of tipifarnib in patients with relapsed or refractory AITL and related lymphomas in 2020. The multi-center, single-arm trial will target enrollment of 128 patients with AITL and AITL-like histologies who are relapsed or refractory to at least one prior systemic cytotoxic therapy.06:26PTLA Portola Pharma presents new interim results from ongoing Phase 2a study of cerdulatinib in patients with specific subtypes of T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (29.21 )As of the November 12, 2019 cut-off date, 64 PTCL patients and 40 CTCL patients treated with cerdulatinib as a single agent were evaluable for response. The overall response rate (ORR) was 34% in the PTCL cohort and 43% in the CTCL cohort. Among the subset of patients in the PTCL cohort with AITL, the ORR was 52% and the complete response rate (CR) was 37%.Among the 64 patients in the PTCL cohort, 14 patients (22%) achieved a CR and eight patients (12%) achieved a partial response (PR). In the subgroup of 27 patients with AITL, 10 patients (37%) achieved a CR, and four patients (15%) achieved a PR. The median duration of response is eight months for all PTCL patients and is greater than nine months in AITL patients. Follow-up is ongoing. Among the 40 patients in the CTCL cohort, three patients (8%) achieved a CR and 14 patients (35%) achieved a PR. Importantly, rapid improvements in pruritus, or severe itching -- a common and often serious condition associated with CTCL -- have been observed, as measured by the Likert scale.Cerdulatinib demonstrated good tolerability in both PTCL and CTCL. The most common Grade 3 or greater adverse events across the PTCL and CTCL cohorts with a frequency > 5% were lipase increase (25%), amylase increase (19%), neutropenia (12%), anemia (10%), diarrhea (8%), sepsis/bacteremia (6%), and febrile neutropenia (4%). The lipase and amylase changes were generally asymptomatic and not associated with pancreatitis.06:25XENE Xenon Pharmaceuticals provides updates on partnered neurology pipeline programs (13.95 )Xenon Pharmaceuticals announced that it will provide updates on its partnered epilepsy programs at the American Epilepsy Society Annual Meeting.Overview of clinical stage XEN901 and Related Patient Survey to be Presented in the "Genetic Epilepsies -- Updates in the Science and Diagnosis" on December 8th.Pre-clinical work suggests selective sodium channel inhibitors that reduce action potential firing in excitatory neurons, while sparing inhibitory interneurons, may provide promising drug profile.06:25IMV IMV presents updated results from SPiReL at ASH (2.83 )The poster, which included additional data collected between the abstract submission and the presentation, continued to demonstrate a favorable therapeutic profile and treatment-associated clinical benefit in r/r DLBCL patients who received the DPX-Survivac combination regimen.06:24QURE uniQure presents updated clinical data on three patients treated in ongoing Phase IIb study of etranacogene dezaparvovec; additionally presents up to 4 years of follow-up data on the 10 patients in the Phase I/II trial of AMT-060 (66.05 )At Least One Year of Stable, Therapeutic Levels of FIX Activity in Patients Treated with Etranacogene Dezaparvovec: Featured in a poster presentation at ASH, the 52 weeks of follow-up data show that all three patients have stabilized and sustained FIX activity at therapeutic levels after the one-time administration of etranacogene dezaparvovec. Mean FIX activity for the three patients at 52 weeks after administration was 41% of normal, with the first patient achieving FIX activity of 50% of normal, the second patient achieving FIX activity of 31% of normal and the third patient achieving FIX activity of 41% of normal. The second and third patients had previously screen-failed and were excluded from another gene therapy study due to pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to a different AAV vector. Reported FIX activity was measured using an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay performed at a central laboratory.At one year after dosing, no patient in the study has reported any bleeding events. All patients have remained free of prophylaxis after receiving etranacogene dezaparvovec. One patient, who had earlier in the study undergone hip surgery due to a pre-existing condition, experienced back pain and treated himself with a single infusion of factor replacement, which was later determined by the patient and the investigator to be unrelated to a bleed. No other FIX infusions were reported by any patient.Stable FIX Expression and Durable Reductions in Bleeding and FIX Consumption for up to 4 Years Following AMT-060 Gene Therapy:In the ongoing Phase I/II study of AMT-060, all 10 patients continue to show long-term clinical benefit, including sustained increases in FIX activity, reduced usage of FIX replacement therapy, and decreased bleeding frequency. At up to 4 years of follow-up, AMT-060 continues to be well-tolerated, with no new serious adverse events and no development of inhibitors since the last reported data.All five patients in the second dose cohort of 2x1013 gc/kg (the dose being studied in the ongoing Phase III HOPE-B study of etranacogene dezaparvovec) continue to be free of routine FIX replacement therapy at 3.5 years after treatment. Based on the six months of data collected during the fourth year of follow-up, the mean annualized bleeding rate was zero compared to an average of 4 bleeds during the year prior to treatment, representing a 100% reduction. During this same period, the usage of FIX replacement therapy also declined 100% compared to the year prior to treatment. Mean FIX activity over 3.5 years was 7.5%.06:22FATE Fate Therapeutics reports clinical data from Landmark Phase 1 studies; no dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients (13.67 )Fate Therapeutics announced initial clinical data for its FT516 and FT500 off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived natural killer (NK) cell product candidates.No morphologic evidence of leukemia and complete neutrophil recovery observed in first patient treated with FT516 Monotherapy for AML following first dosing cycleNo dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients treated with FT500 for advanced solid tumorsFavorable FT500 Phase 1 Safety, Tolerability and Immunogenicity profile validates novel multi-dose treatment paradigm for off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived NK cell products.06:22BMY Bristol-Myers presents data from multiple studies evaluating lisocabtagene maraleucel at ASH (59.95 )These studies included an evaluation of liso-cel in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) (TRANSCEND CLL 004); a study in second-line patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients who were ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) (PILOT); and a separate analysis of patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma who received liso-cel in the outpatient setting across three studies."The results in relapsed or refractory CLL and SLL demonstrated a high rate of durable complete responses achieved in heavily pre-treated patients, including patients who have failed ibrutinib and venetoclax. We are encouraged by the potential of liso-cel to treat second-line relapsed or refractory large B-cell NHL patients who are not able to undergo a stem cell transplant. Finally, the analysis evaluating liso-cel administered in the outpatient setting demonstrates that not all patients require hospitalization and that the safety and efficacy profile across a variety of types of clinical sites is consistent."06:20LLY Eli Lilly presents interim clinical data from the LOXO-305 global Phase 1/2 BRUIN dose escalation trial (119.64 )At all doses studied, LOXO-305 delivered objective responses in patients who had received diverse prior therapies and had exhibited varied molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance.Of 16 CLL patients enrolled, there were 10 responders (8 partial responses, 2 partial response with ongoing lymphocytosis) among 13 patients eligible for response assessment, resulting in a 77% ORR. All patients with CLL have demonstrated tumor reduction, with evidence of deepening response over time. Responses were observed in patients with acquired resistance to prior BTK therapy (those with and without C481S mutations), in patients who were intolerant to prior BTK therapy, and in patients with acquired resistance to prior BCL2 therapy (including one with a known BCL G101V mutation). As expected, LOXO-305 treatment causes acute lymphocytosis, which resolves over time -- a well described pharmacodynamic response associated with effective BTK inhibition. Of the three CLL patients not yet eligible for response assessment (one with the BTK C481S mutation), all three have demonstrated lymphocytosis early in cycle 1. All CLL responding patients remain in response, and all CLL patients remain on study. Of eight MCL patients enrolled, there were three responses (1 complete response, 2 partial responses) among six patients eligible for response assessment, resulting in a 50% ORR. Two of the responders had progressed on prior BTK therapy (but without a documented C481x mutation). All MCL responding patients remain in response and on study. Three MCL patients discontinued therapy in cycle 1 due to progressive disease.Most treatment-emergent adverse events were Grade 1 in severity with the most commonly reported events, regardless of attribution, being fatigue (25% total: 21% Grade 1, 4% Grade 2) and diarrhea (18% total: 14% Grade 1, 4% Grade 2). Two adverse events > or =Grade 3 were attributed to LOXO-305 (Grade 3 leukocytosis and Grade 3 transient neutropenia). No dose limiting toxicities were reported and an MTD had not been reached.06:19AZN AstraZeneca reports full results from Phase III ELEVATE TN trial (47.68 )AstraZeneca presented results from the interim analysis of the Phase III ELEVATE TN trial, showing that CALQUENCE (acalabrutinib) combined with obinutuzumab or as monotherapy significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab, a standard chemo-immunotherapy treatment, in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia.In an exploratory analysis, CALQUENCE in combination or alone demonstrated consistent PFS improvements across most pre-specified subgroups of patients with high-risk disease characteristics, including the unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable gene (IGHV), del(11q) and complex karyotype. Overall, the safety and tolerability profile of CALQUENCE observed in the ELEVATE TN trial was consistent with its known profile.06:19BGNE BeiGene presents clinical data from three trials of its BTK inhibitor BRUKINSA at ASH (186.92 )In two oral presentations of BRUKINSA in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), the drug candidate demonstrated consistent safety and a high overall response rate (ORR); in the poster presentation of BRUKINSA combined with BeiGene's investigational anti-PD-1 antibody tislelizumab in patients with previously treated B-cell malignancies, the combination treatment showed preliminary efficacy and was generally well tolerated."The results presented today on BRUKINSA, a BTK inhibitor designed to maximize target occupancy and minimize off-target binding, demonstrated robust clinical activity and a safety profile consistent with what we've observed to date in our clinical trials, including safety data that supported the recent U.S. FDA accelerated approval in patients with previously treated mantle cell lymphoma," said Jane Huang, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, hematology at BeiGene. "CLL or SLL is the most common type of leukemia in adults, and despite the advancements of BTK inhibitor therapy for these cancers, there remains a need for highly selective BTK inhibitors capable of promoting long-term responses, and with a safety profile that is tolerable over time. The results presented here today further demonstrate the potential for BRUKINSA to help people living with these persistent, life-threatening cancers."06:18RCKT Rocket Pharmaceuticals presents "encouraging" preliminary results from its Phase 1 trial of commercial-grade RP-L102 'Process B' for Fanconi Anemia (22.37 )Results presented in the poster highlight preliminary Phase 1 data from two pediatric patients (age 5 and 6 years) who were treated with "Process B" RP-L102 prior to the development of severe bone marrow failure and are in ongoing follow-up. Drug product was successfully manufactured using "Process B" optimization, including transduction enhancers, commercial-grade vector, and modified cell processing. "Process B" drug product is manufactured to commercial grade standards, allowing for consistent drug product across patients and a vector copy number (VCN) two to three fold higher than that administered to optimally-treated "Process A" patients.Once transduced, drug product was infused fresh into patients without any prior conditioning regimen. To evaluate transduction efficiency, an analysis of the proportion of the MMC-resistant colony forming cells was conducted. Both patients exhibited early signs of engraftment based on peripheral blood, VCN and/or MMC-resistance. Preliminary phenotypic correction was also apparent in both patients, as evidenced by stabilization or increases in blood cell lineages. No safety or tolerability issues have been reported.06:18ABBV AbbVie reports new results from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE clinical trial showing the potential of this fixed-duration combination therapy (86.98 )AbbVie announced new data from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE (PCYC-1142) clinical trial, evaluating IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) in combination with VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO (venetoclax) in previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Results showed that patients who received up to 12 cycles of the combination regimen achieved high rates of undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD) in both peripheral blood (PB; 75% of patients) and in bone marrow (BM; 72% of patients). Safety data were consistent with the known safety profiles of IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO used as individual therapies.Results showed uMRD -- defined as less than 1 CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes (MRD<0.01%) by flow cytometry of PB or BM samples -- was achieved at any time after baseline in PB for 75% of patients (122 of 163 patients) and in BM for 72% (111 of 155 patients). The proportion of patients who had uMRD in PB increased over time from 57% after 6 cycles, 68% after 9 cycles, and 73% after 12 cycles of IMBRUVICA plus VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO. The high rates of uMRD in BM were consistent across high-risk subgroups, including in patients with del(17p), del(17p) or TP53 mutation, del(11q), complex karyotype, and unmutated IGHV status. In patients with uMRD in PB with matched BM samples, 93% of patients had uMRD in both PB and BM. With median follow-up of 14.7 months, 3 patients (2%) experienced disease progression.06:17OBSV ObsEva reports positive Phase 3 trial results from PRIMROSE 2 trial of linzagolix for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids (4.57 )The responder rate was 93.9% (p <0.001) for women receiving 200 mg with ABT and 56.7% for women receiving 100 mg without ABT (p <0.001), compared to 29.4% in the placebo group. Both doses achieved significant rates of amenorrhea (p <0.001), reduction in pain (p <0.001), and improvement in quality of life (p <0.001). Additionally, significant improvement (p <0.001) in hemoglobin levels, a reduction in number of days of bleeding and reduction in uterine volume were observed. Furthermore, a significant reduction in fibroid volume was also observed for the 200 mg dose with ABT (p <0.008).The overall safety profile was in line with expectations and confirmed that linzagolix was well-tolerated. The most frequently observed adverse events (occurring in > 5% of patients) were headache, hot flushes, and anemia. Mean percentage change from baseline in BMD was consistent with previous clinical data."We look forward to the results from our second pivotal study, PRIMROSE 1 conducted in the US, in Q2 2020. Assuming positive results, we expect that it would lead to a Marketing Authorization Application submission with the European Medicines Agency by year-end 2020 and a New Drug Application submission with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by Q1 2021."06:16THOR Synthorx to be acquired by Sanofi (SNY) for $68/share in cash (25.03 )Under the terms of the merger agreement, Sanofi will commence a cash tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Synthorx common stock for $68 per share in cash for a total enterprise value of approximately $2.35 billion.

This may just be the calm before the storm considering all the macro-related events set to take place as the week unfolds. S&P Futures saw a relative quiet beginning with only a nine point overnight range. The market is currently trading around the 3144 area, with a high of 3148.50 and a low of 3139.50. In Asia, both China and Japan finished the day marginally higher. The Shanghai struggled to gain much following lighter than expected export data that saw a 1.1% fall in November, compared to a forecast of +0.8%.The Nikkei traded around in a narrow range that culminated with a gain of 0.3%.

AL002 is a monoclonal antibody intended to enhance the activity of TREM2 and is being developed by Alector for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in collaboration with its partner AbbVie (ABBV). The data were presented today at the 12th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) meeting. The AL002 presentation at CTAD showcases the first data in humans showing that a TREM2 activating antibody engages its target and demonstrates downstream activity in the CNS. The data reported today are from the study's SAD phase in 56 healthy adults, who were enrolled into nine escalating dose cohorts. AL002 was found to be generally safe and well-tolerated. AL002 reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) soluble TREM2 in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating proof-of-target engagement in the brain. AL002 elevated a biomarker for microglia activity in the CSF, indicating proof-of-mechanism. The Phase 1b portion of the study in Alzheimer's disease patients is on-going.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD16:19WTRE Watford Holdings agrees to purchase Axeria IARD; terms not disclosed (26.47 +0.25)Axeria IARD is a property and casualty insurance company based in France.

Tiny China Trade Deal Seals Beijing's Victory Over Trump; Dow Jones SteadyInvestor's Business DailyDecember 13, 2019Copyright 2019 Investor's Business Daily, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: ECONOMYLength: 742 wordsByline: JED GRAHAMBodyhttps://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Econ01-disarm-121319-AP.jpgBeijing confirmed Friday that it has agreed to a China trade deal with the U.S., briefly lifting the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a record high. Yet China stopped short of committing to a level of U.S. agricultural purchases, a key demand of President Donald Trump, while the U.S. agreed to a minimal reduction of tariffs.Trump said via tweet that the  on roughly $110 billion in Chinese imports. Earlier, he blasted as "Fake News" a Thursday Wall Street Journal report that the U.S. would slash tariffs in half on $360 billion in imports.Trump also said that 15% tariffs won't take effect, as scheduled for Dec. 15, on laptops, footwear, apparel and Apple iPhones.In short, the China trade deal looks tiny and papers over serious disagreement on the central issue of whether Beijing will back its vow to buy U.S. goods with any specific dollar amounts.Meanwhile, Trump said negotiations on a phase-two agreement would begin right after the deal is signed. Yet the limited nature of the phase-one deal suggests a tough road for future talks over more contentious issues, like China's state subsidies.The Big Picture On The China Trade DealSo should investors worry? Probably not.The big picture is that Trump has concluded there's nothing to be gained by pursuing the China trade war during an election year. He's ready to de-escalate the conflict and cut tariffs, though it's unclear how Beijing will reciprocate.CNBC reported that the U.S. pushed China to agree to $200 billion in annual purchases, including $50 billion in agricultural purchases. But Beijing insists purchases must be based on need and market dynamics. China also doesn't want to upset other trading partners by shifting its business to the U.S. on Trump's demand.A statement from U.S. Trade Rep. Robert Lighthizer said Beijing would make "substantial additional purchases."The U.S. ran a goods deficit of $369 billion with China over the past 12 months through October.Dow Jones, Treasury Yield ReactionAfter darting up more than 100 points on Beijing's confirmation of the deal, the Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed lower, then erased losses to close essentially flat. The S&P 500 also closed with a razor-thin gain, while the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.2% in Friday's .The 10-year Treasury yield slipped 7 basis points, reversing the bulk of Thursday's rise, amid a soft retail sales report and indications of a smaller-than-expected China trade deal.China Trade Deal Looks Different A Day LaterOn Thursday, the WSJ report suggested that Trump had unlocked greater Chinese purchases with bigger-than-expected tariff cuts. A day later, it appears that Trump faced a stone wall from China on purchases. Instead of going big, he decided to opt for the smallest tariff cut he could get away with.Beijing has said its concessions — and purchases — will only match U.S. actions. That's in keeping with its insistence upon a trade deal based on "mutual respect and equality."Bottom line: Trump probably didn't buy much by cutting annualized tariff collections by about $8 billion, about 10% of the total. Tariffs of 25% also will remain on $250 billion in Chinese imports.How Beijing Won The China Trade WarFor China, whose economy has been battered by the trade war, the deal signals that the worst of the confrontation is over. Most importantly, China has bought time to wean itself off American technology.That process is moving forward. Huawei, which Trump hit with an export ban last year, developed its latest cellphone without American parts. Last week, the Chinese government ordered state offices to displace foreign software and hardware over three years, a negative for Microsoft and other U.S. tech companies. That indicates China's grand Made in China 2025 ambitions are very much intact.Beijing apparently never feared that Trump would carry out the Dec. 15 tariffs because of his vulnerability in the 2020 election. Since negotiations restarted in September, China had set the terms of debate. The deal Trump has agreed to looks quite weak, even compared to his Oct. 11 announcement of a preliminary deal.At the time, Trump said nothing about reducing current tariffs, while China was said to have agreed to buy $40 billion-$50 billion in agricultural goods per year.Please follow Jed Graham on Twitter @IBD_JGraham for insight on economic policy and financial markets.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Load-Date: December 15, 2019End of Document

Pros and Cons of Buying Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock - Correction AppendedUSNEWS.comNovember 4, 2019 Monday Correction AppendedCopyright 2019 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: INVESTING; Stock Market News; Vol.; No.Length: 1441 wordsByline: John DivineHighlight: Widely known as the "Amazon of China," Alibaba draws intense interest from investors.BodyFor years, analysts have called e-tailer Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (ticker: BABA) the "Amazon of China" and for good reason -- it's one of the few e-commerce companies in the world that can hold a candle to Amazon's (            AMZN) size and growth potential. The online-only retailer, founded in 1999, went public in the U.S. in 2014. Alibaba's initial public offering was the largest ever IPO at the time, with a market cap of $231 billion. Anyone who bought into the BABA IPO and held has done quite well since then, as BABA now carries a market capitalization of nearly $460 billion. It's hard to argue with doubling your money in five years. One of the most glaring risks with Alibaba stock, however, is the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, which has lasted longer than many analysts initially expected. [READ7 Stocks With the Most to Lose in China]That said, if and when a resolution is reached, BABA will have even greater potential than it does today. BABA Stock at a GlanceAnalysts and money managers seem to share a positive view of Alibaba, despite all the trade hullaballoo. Alibaba stock is trading around $180 per share, and, although lower than where it was even 18 months ago, there remains massive bullish sentiment -- the consensus target price among the 47 analysts who track the stock is $222, representing upside of 24%. Revenue grew by 40% last quarter -- a fabulous figure for a company of almost any size, but for the world's seventh-most valuable public company, that figure is borderline miraculous. It makes a little more sense, however, when you take a look at Alibaba's incredible scale. Users simply love its products; active consumers grew by 19 million last quarter from the previous quarter to 693 million. Mobile monthly active users ticked even higher, growing by 30 million in just three months, reaching 785 million. The company aims to serve more than 1 billion customers by 2024, and it looks as if it'll reach that goal. Alibaba's growth, however, doesn't solely originate from its core e-commerce business segment. Growth in its cloud computing segment clocked in at 64% year-over-year, while digital media and entertainment grew by 23% annually. Perhaps you see even more clearly why BABA is known as the Chinese Amazon -- like its U.S. peer, cloud growth is helping to fuel overall revenue numbers, and Alibaba has its own Prime Video-like streaming video offerings to boot. Pros to Buying BABA StockAs with many stocks, the best way to play Alibaba intelligently is by taking the long view. This centers around the company's superb position in the world's fastest-growing major economy, a trend that's far more compelling and irreversible than the headline-grabbing but shorter-term trade war catalyst. Alibaba's continued strength in e-commerce is fueled by its vast data insights on Chinese shoppers and its gain of market share in the cloud computing industry. Like Amazon, Alibaba's once-small cloud division has burgeoned into a major part of its business, and a leading provider for its native country's top enterprises. In the most recent quarter, no other segment outside of its core commerce business was as large as cloud computing. After 64% growth last quarter, it accounts for about 8% of Alibaba's overall revenue. In the same quarter three years ago, the cloud division made up just 4% of all revenue. Yes, Alibaba does a lot well on its own accord -- you don't become a business of this size by being mediocre. But investors should also appreciate that BABA has a few secular and macro trends going for it; there's an incredible rise of the Chinese middle class going on right now, as more and more citizens are lifted out of poverty. That extra discretionary income has proven to be crucial to Alibaba's sustained high growth. Also, it doesn't hurt to have the Chinese government as a safety net -- it's well-known that China subsidizes its star companies and goes to bat for them on the international stage. BABA's American counterpart, Amazon, has the opposite dynamic, facing regular zings from President Donald Trump on Twitter, and, more materially, antitrust investigations from regulators. It'd be foolish to say that protectionism from the Chinese government didn't work strongly in favor of BABA stock, helping to push it into the "buy" column. "The most commonly cited reason for owning it is the belief that Chinese government policies favor domestic companies, preventing foreign players who might otherwise be competitive from seriously entering the market," says Bernard George, a former hedge fund portfolio manager and now CEO of Nvstr.com, a social stock trading platform. "Our platform users also believe their Singles Day commercialization has grabbed a lot of global mindshare." [See:10 of the Best Tech Stocks to Buy for 2019.]Cons to Buying BABA StockTrade conflicts with the U.S. could derail BABA's impressive growth. Arguably the ongoing feud has already impaired Alibaba's results, which likely could've been even stronger in recent quarters if the U.S. weren't pressuring the Chinese economy. Gil Luria, director of research for D.A. Davidson & Co., an investment banking company, spells out just how the trade war hurts a company like Alibaba. "Not only would the cross-border piece of the business be impacted, a reduction in U.S.-China trade could also weigh on the Chinese consumer, which is driving Alibaba's domestic growth," Luria says. "Furthermore, growth in the U.S. is part of Alibaba's long-term strategy and is already being impaired by restrictions on Chinese investments. "Alibaba shares are a good way to invest in the growth of the Chinese economy, but are also very much at risk from escalating trade tensions," Luria says. Should the apparent denouement in the trade war fall apart, don't be at all surprised to see BABA shares fall as well. Other risks, as far as the stock market is concerned, are generally tame in the grand scheme of things. Still, it'd be imprudent to ignore them. Firstly, the company is virtually without its enigmatic founder and longtime leader, Jack Ma, who stepped down as chairman of the board in September. Though he still holds a board seat, he'll step down from that position as well in 2020. There are always risks when a visionary entrepreneur -- the company's founder and former CEO, no less -- leaves the company. It remains to be seen what impact this will have. Another risk, which may seem benign but can be quite ugly in practice, is the absurdly high bar the company has set for itself. Investors have come to take 40% growth at a $460 billion company as run of the mill; the day after Alibaba's most recent earnings were released, shares traded a mere 2% higher, despite crushing both top- and bottom-line expectations. The risk is that when this growth inevitably decelerates, it'll have to decelerate at just the right speed for analysts, or BABA will likely experience a swift selloff from "what have you done for me lately" growth investors, of which there are many. The Bottom Line on BABA StockUltimately, Alibaba's continued success is likely. It's got one of the most enviable competitive landscapes of any company in the world. Few economies hold more financial potential than China, and Alibaba's immense market share in a number of high-growth, scalable, tech-based fields (e-commerce, cloud computing, digital media and entertainment, etc.) makes it perfectly positioned to dominate in the years ahead. That said, it's true that China isn't exactly the perfect home country a company could ask for -- the government can do whatever it wants at any time, and there's certainly a risk of excessive government oversight. Plus, the trade war must be taken into consideration. [Artificial Intelligence Stocks: The 10 Best AI Companies.]Even with Alibaba founder Jack Ma on the way out and these risks in mind, a quick look at Alibaba's valuation in comparison to its results over the last few quarters suggests that perhaps investors are paying too much attention to the trade war. The stock trades at 32 times earnings -- despite revenue growth of 40% and earnings per share jumping 36% last quarter. As far as large-cap growth stocks are concerned, BABA stock is an absolute bargain; you won't find growth like that for such a low multiple. Perhaps that's not a surprise, with shares trading lower than they did 18 months ago. Reward requires risk, as any experienced investor knows. Buying Alibaba stock at these levels is a calculated risk, and one that could pay off big -- either very quickly if the trade war dies down, or over the long-term, barring a sudden change in its momentum. CorrectionUpdate 11/04/19: This article was published on an earlier date and has updated with new information.Graphic Picture, The ongoing U.S.-China trade war could derail BABA's impressive growth., (David Becker/Getty Images)Load-Date: November 5, 2019End of Document

A reading above 50 indicates a sector is expanding, while one below 50 suggests it's contracting.Similarly, the Caixin/IHS Markit manufacturing PMI reading was 51.8, signaling the sector's fastest rate of expansion since December 2016. Economists polled by Reuters expected the index to have dropped from 51.7 in October to 51.4 in November."The PMI data out today supports the idea that the global growth slowdown is bottoming out," Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said in a morning note.The Chinese government tends to poll more large companies and state-owned enterprises, while the Caixin and IHS Markit survey focuses more on small and mid-sized firms.The Chinese manufacturing rally comes after President Donald Trump said in October that the US had reached a "very substantial phase one deal" with China in their talks to end the two nations' trade war. However, Chinese officials are insisting that a phase-one deal will require Trump to not only delay tariffs scheduled to take effect on December 15, but roll back existing tariffs, according to Global Times, a Chinese state newspaper.NOW WATCH: A big-money investor in juggernauts like Facebook and Netflix breaks down the '3rd wave' firms that are leading the next round of tech disruptionSee Also:• Cruise-line workers reveal one of the worst parts of living on a cruise ship• A Wall Street expert who called the stock market's late-2018 meltdown warns another plunge could arrive in December - and shares his investing advice for 2020• 'I like the fact that there's a lot of fear': A Wall Street expert explains why it's the perfect time to buy stocks tied to the economy, even though they're stuck in a huge slumpLoad-Date: December 2, 2019End of Document

Tech, often a beneficiary of favorable trade sentiment with China, is perhaps benefiting from news out over the weekend that China may step up efforts to protect intellectual property rights and enforce stricter penalties against IP theft, a precursor to trade talk progression toward a Phase One deal.Conversely, McDonald's (MCD 191.80, -1.34, -0.69%) and Exxon Mobil (XOM 68.92, -0.45, -0.65%) continue to jostle for the bottom rung on the standings today. McDonald's was the subject of a favorable note out of sell side Longbow where analysts suggested Q4 US comps had stabilized; WSJ also reported that MCD settled a labor dispute in California.The DJIA now holds gains of 3.59% on the month.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $40 bln 2-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.601% on a bid-to-cover of 2.63.12:55 ETDow +121.27 at 27996.8, Nasdaq +99.87 at 8619.75, S&P +18.42 at 3128.71[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (+0.6%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.2%) have set new all-time highs today following reported progress in a Phase One trade deal and a healthy dose of M&A activity. The Russell 2000 (+1.9%) outperforms, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) trails the pack.The Chinese government released a document stating intentions to better deter IP theft by increasing the penalties on violations, according to Bloomberg. The news is taking precedent over a Reuters report that suggested a Phase Two deal is unlikely to be completed before the presidential election next year.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.1%), which tends to outperform when trade sentiment is positive, is the lone sector up more than 1.0% today. Leading the group higher are the semiconductor stocks, especially NVIDIA (NVDA 219.64, +8.75, +4.2%) after it was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.1%.Following suit are the health care (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.8%), and industrials (+0.6%) sectors. The utilities (-0.2%), energy (-0.1%), and consumer staples (unch) sectors are the lone holdouts.As for M&A activity, some of today's announcements have already been on the market's radar like Charles Schwab (SCHW 48.76, +0.56, +1.2%) agreeing to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.19, +3.06, +6.3%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreeing to acquire Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.07, +7.56, +6.0%) for $16.2 billion in cash.The confirmed deals have still been supportive for risk sentiment, though, and the market has been treated with new deals in Novartis (NVS 91.23, +0.73, +0.8%) agreeing to acquire The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.86, +15.31, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash and eBay (EBAY 35.55, +0.42, +1.2%) reportedly being close to selling StubHub to Viagogo for $4 billion.U.S. Treasuries are little changed despite the solid gains being registered in the stock market. The benchmark 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.34.Investors did not receive any notable economic data today.12:25 ETDow +119.06 at 27994.59, Nasdaq +99.28 at 8619.16, S&P +18.06 at 3128.35[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade sideways with a gain of 0.6%.Each of the FAANG stocks -- Amazon (AMZN 1769.40, +23.88, +1.4%), Apple (AAPL 265.02, +3.24, +1.2%), Alphabet (GOOG 1307.38, +12.04, +0.9%), Facebook (FB 200.69, +1.87, +0.9%) and Netflix (NFLX 313.54, +3.06, +1.0%) -- are up around 1.0%. Netflix is shrugging off a downgrade to Underperform at Wells Fargo.Interestingly, despite the solid gains in the stock market, U.S. Treasuries are not selling off. An uptick in demand has the pushed benchmark 10-yr yield down two basis points to 1.75%.11:55 ETDow +129.08 at 28004.61, Nasdaq +98.92 at 8618.8, S&P +18.87 at 3129.16[BRIEFING.COM] The Nasdaq Composite (+1.2%) remains ahead of both the S&P 500 (+0.6%) and Dow (+0.5%) but behind the Russell 2000 (+1.8%).Apple (AAPL 265.09, +3.32, +1.3%) shares remain an influential force behind the gains in the large-cap indices. Digitimes reported today that the company gave its supply chains strong shipment forecasts for the 5G iPhone. AAPL is now up 68% this year.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a higher note. Germany's DAX increased 0.6%, UK's FTSE increased 0.9%, and France's CAC increased 0.5%. The Europe Stoxx 600 increased 1.1%.11:25 ETDow +126.16 at 28001.69, Nasdaq +99.16 at 8619.04, S&P +18.84 at 3129.13[BRIEFING.COM] Stocks have come down from slightly session highs, but the S&P 500 is still trading comfortably higher with a gain of 0.6%.Shares of TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.43, +3.30, +6.9%) and Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.02, +0.83, +1.8%) have climbed to session highs, though, in a slow reaction to the official announcement that Schwab is acquiring TD for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction. The S&P 500 financials sector is up 0.5%.Elsewhere, shares of eBay (EBAY 35.55, +0.43, +1.2%) are up modestly on news that the company is nearing a deal to sell StubHub to Viagogo for $4 billion.10:55 ETDow +140.82 at 28016.35, Nasdaq +101.30 at 8621.18, S&P +20.11 at 3130.4[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.7%. Trade headlines remain in the news, and the latest update has the market in a good mood.The Chinese government reportedly released a document stating it plans on better protecting intellectual property rights from theft, which could help both sides reach a Phase One agreement soon. Both the U.S. and China continued to say over the weekend that a deal is near.The news is conflicting with a less-covered story from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal, whatever that may look like, may not be completed before the 2020 presidential election. The report may be receiving less attention because it was not based on comments from any top trade negotiators or high-ranking officials.10:25 ETDow +143.23 at 28018.76, Nasdaq +89.70 at 8609.58, S&P +18.87 at 3129.16[BRIEFING.COM] Both the S&P 500 (+0.6%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%) have set all-time highs today.In the health care space, The Medicines Co.

Shares of Alnylam Pharma (ALNY 112.93, +6.02, +5.5%), Arrowhead (ARWR 56.86, +7.66, +15.7%), Dicerna Pharmaceuticals (DRNA 23.95, +1.45, +6.4%) have reacted positively.Separately, shares of Uber (UBER 24.47, -0.10, -0.3%) have recouped most of their pre-market losses that followed news that London rejected the company's application to operate in the city.09:55 ETDow +111.50 at 27987.03, Nasdaq +75.78 at 8595.66, S&P +16.59 at 3126.88[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.5%, and the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.6%.NVIDIA (NVDA 220.15, +9.23, +4.4%) leads the semiconductor stocks higher after it was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley with price target of $259. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 1.8%.Netflix (NFLX 306.25, -4.17, -1.2%) shares, on the other hand, are being excluded from today's positive start after the stock was downgraded to Underperform from Market Perform at Wells Fargo on concerns about spending levels.09:40 ETDow +86.16 at 27961.69, Nasdaq +65.49 at 8585.37, S&P +15.56 at 3125.85[BRIEFING.COM] The major indices begin the day higher in a mostly broad-based advance led by the technology stocks. The S&P 500 is up 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.8%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows information technology (+0.9%), consumer discretionary (+0.6%), and health care (+0.5%) leading today's early advance. The energy sector (-0.2%) is the lone sector trading lower.U.S. Treasuries are little changed. The 2-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.62%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.76%.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +36.10.U.S. stocks are looking to begin the session on a higher note, with the S&P 500 futures trading 11 points, or 0.4%, above fair value. Many are attributing a positive-sounding trade update and some sizable M&A deals for the positive bias today.China is aiming to step up efforts to protect intellectual property rights and enforce stricter penalties against IP theft, according to Bloomberg News. This could help both sides reach a Phase One agreement, although a report from Reuters is suggesting that a Phase Two agreement before the presidential election is less likely.In notable M&A activity:TD Ameritrade (AMTD 49.65, +1.52, +3.2%) will be acquired by Charles Schwab (SCHW 47.90, -0.30, -0.6%) for about $26 billion in an all-stock transaction.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) edged above the S&P 500 (+0.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%), and Russell 2000 (+0.3%).The market heard from both President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, President Xi, on Friday. Mr. Xi called for mutual respect and equality in talks, but reiterated Beijing is willing to fight back if necessary. Mr. Trump said talks are moving along nicely and closing in on a deal, but the president suggested a deal should not be equal and should favor the U.S. instead.The takeaway was that the market still doesn't know for certain if a Phase One trade agreement will be signed this year, but talks are ongoing and appear to not be escalating. Separately, an upwardly revised reading in the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November was supportive for equities today.Leading the market in gains were the S&P 500 financials (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.7%), and industrials (+0.5%) sectors. The real estate (-0.5%) and energy (-0.4%) sectors were today's laggards.Nordstrom (JWN 37.95, +3.63, +10.6%) and Gap (GPS 16.94, +0.72, +4.4%) were among the biggest earnings-driven gainers in the consumer discretionary space, while an earnings-driven decline in Intuit (INTU 259.81, -11.34, -4.2%) put some pressure on the information technology sector (-0.1%).Elsewhere, the futuristic design of Tesla's (TSLA 333.04, -21.79, -6.1%) Cybertruck pickup was met with some confusion and mixed reviews. Ultimately, it appeared to be a sell-the-news case after the stock climbed about 40% in the past month.U.S. Treasuries ended the week on a flat note. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield was unchanged at 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.26. WTI crude declined 1.2%, or $0.70, to $57.88/bbl.Friday's economic data was limited to the revised reading for the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November:The final November reading for the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index checked in at 96.8 (Briefing.com consensus 94.9), which exceeded the preliminary estimate of 95.7 and the final October reading of 95.5. The November reading is in close proximity to the average level (97.0) since the start of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is the acknowledgment that consumers aren't anticipating sizable increases in inflation, unemployment, and interest rates, which suggests consumer spending activity should remain supportive for the U.S. economy.Investors will not receive any economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +28.4% YTDS&P 500 +24.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.5% YTDRussell 2000 +17.8% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1717/1152. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1778/1303.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: November 25, 2019End of Document

Data from Incyte's oncology portfolio was accepted ahead of the company's American Society of Hematology (ASH) presentation on December 7-10, 2019. L Brands continues recent gains in light of reports the company may be exploring strategic alternatives amid pressure from activists. Mylan gains in the face of a Bloomberg report that drugmakers have been in talks with the U.S. Department of Justice in an attempt to resolve a criminal antitrust probe of alleged price fixing.Conversely, Comcast (CMCSA 43.47, -1.33, -2.97%) sits at the bottom of the index despite a dearth of corporate news.14:00 ETDow +134.74 at 28010.27, Nasdaq +101.52 at 8621.4, S&P +18.64 at 3128.93[BRIEFING.COM] The Nasdaq Composite still sits atop the standings with two hours to go on Monday, +1.19%.Gold futures settled $6.60 lower (-0.5%) to $1,457.00/oz as the market digested positive trade developments out over the weekend.The U.S. Dollar Index sits under 0.1% higher to 98.34.13:30 ETDow +141.79 at 28017.32, Nasdaq +102.94 at 8622.82, S&P +19.79 at 3130.08[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages all sit near afternoon highs in recent trade with the Dow Jones Industrial Average holding the softest advance, up 0.51%.Some of the best performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average today include technology names like Intel (INTC 58.66, +1.05, +1.82%), Cisco Systems (CSCO 45.42, +0.57, +1.27%), and Apple (AAPL 265.01, +3.23, +1.23%). Tech, often a beneficiary of favorable trade sentiment with China, is perhaps benefiting from news out over the weekend that China may step up efforts to protect intellectual property rights and enforce stricter penalties against IP theft, a precursor to trade talk progression toward a Phase One deal.Conversely, McDonald's (MCD 191.80, -1.34, -0.69%) and Exxon Mobil (XOM 68.92, -0.45, -0.65%) continue to jostle for the bottom rung on the standings today. McDonald's was the subject of a favorable note out of sell side Longbow where analysts suggested Q4 US comps had stabilized; WSJ also reported that MCD settled a labor dispute in California.The DJIA now holds gains of 3.59% on the month.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $40 bln 2-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.601% on a bid-to-cover of 2.63.12:55 ETDow +121.27 at 27996.8, Nasdaq +99.87 at 8619.75, S&P +18.42 at 3128.71[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (+0.6%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.2%) have set new all-time highs today following reported progress in a Phase One trade deal and a healthy dose of M&A activity. The Russell 2000 (+1.9%) outperforms, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) trails the pack.The Chinese government released a document stating intentions to better deter IP theft by increasing the penalties on violations, according to Bloomberg. The news is taking precedent over a Reuters report that suggested a Phase Two deal is unlikely to be completed before the presidential election next year.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.1%), which tends to outperform when trade sentiment is positive, is the lone sector up more than 1.0% today. Leading the group higher are the semiconductor stocks, especially NVIDIA (NVDA 219.64, +8.75, +4.2%) after it was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.1%.Following suit are the health care (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.8%), and industrials (+0.6%) sectors. The utilities (-0.2%), energy (-0.1%), and consumer staples (unch) sectors are the lone holdouts.As for M&A activity, some of today's announcements have already been on the market's radar like Charles Schwab (SCHW 48.76, +0.56, +1.2%) agreeing to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.19, +3.06, +6.3%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreeing to acquire Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.07, +7.56, +6.0%) for $16.2 billion in cash.The confirmed deals have still been supportive for risk sentiment, though, and the market has been treated with new deals in Novartis (NVS 91.23, +0.73, +0.8%) agreeing to acquire The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.86, +15.31, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash and eBay (EBAY 35.55, +0.42, +1.2%) reportedly being close to selling StubHub to Viagogo for $4 billion.U.S. Treasuries are little changed despite the solid gains being registered in the stock market. The benchmark 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.34.Investors did not receive any notable economic data today.12:25 ETDow +119.06 at 27994.59, Nasdaq +99.28 at 8619.16, S&P +18.06 at 3128.35[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade sideways with a gain of 0.6%.Each of the FAANG stocks -- Amazon (AMZN 1769.40, +23.88, +1.4%), Apple (AAPL 265.02, +3.24, +1.2%), Alphabet (GOOG 1307.38, +12.04, +0.9%), Facebook (FB 200.69, +1.87, +0.9%) and Netflix (NFLX 313.54, +3.06, +1.0%) -- are up around 1.0%. Netflix is shrugging off a downgrade to Underperform at Wells Fargo.Interestingly, despite the solid gains in the stock market, U.S. Treasuries are not selling off. An uptick in demand has the pushed benchmark 10-yr yield down two basis points to 1.75%.11:55 ETDow +129.08 at 28004.61, Nasdaq +98.92 at 8618.8, S&P +18.87 at 3129.16[BRIEFING.COM] The Nasdaq Composite (+1.2%) remains ahead of both the S&P 500 (+0.6%) and Dow (+0.5%) but behind the Russell 2000 (+1.8%).Apple (AAPL 265.09, +3.32, +1.3%) shares remain an influential force behind the gains in the large-cap indices. Digitimes reported today that the company gave its supply chains strong shipment forecasts for the 5G iPhone. AAPL is now up 68% this year.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a higher note. Germany's DAX increased 0.6%, UK's FTSE increased 0.9%, and France's CAC increased 0.5%. The Europe Stoxx 600 increased 1.1%.11:25 ETDow +126.16 at 28001.69, Nasdaq +99.16 at 8619.04, S&P +18.84 at 3129.13[BRIEFING.COM] Stocks have come down from slightly session highs, but the S&P 500 is still trading comfortably higher with a gain of 0.6%.Shares of TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.43, +3.30, +6.9%) and Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.02, +0.83, +1.8%) have climbed to session highs, though, in a slow reaction to the official announcement that Schwab is acquiring TD for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction. The S&P 500 financials sector is up 0.5%.Elsewhere, shares of eBay (EBAY 35.55, +0.43, +1.2%) are up modestly on news that the company is nearing a deal to sell StubHub to Viagogo for $4 billion.10:55 ETDow +140.82 at 28016.35, Nasdaq +101.30 at 8621.18, S&P +20.11 at 3130.4[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.7%. Trade headlines remain in the news, and the latest update has the market in a good mood.The Chinese government reportedly released a document stating it plans on better protecting intellectual property rights from theft, which could help both sides reach a Phase One agreement soon. Both the U.S. and China continued to say over the weekend that a deal is near.The news is conflicting with a less-covered story from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal, whatever that may look like, may not be completed before the 2020 presidential election. The report may be receiving less attention because it was not based on comments from any top trade negotiators or high-ranking officials.10:25 ETDow +143.23 at 28018.76, Nasdaq +89.70 at 8609.58, S&P +18.87 at 3129.16[BRIEFING.COM] Both the S&P 500 (+0.6%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%) have set all-time highs today.In the health care space, The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.90, +15.34, +22.4%) has agreed to be acquired by Novartis (NVS 90.82, +0.34, +0.4%) for $85.00/share in cash, valued at $9.7 billion. Shares of Alnylam Pharma (ALNY 112.93, +6.02, +5.5%), Arrowhead (ARWR 56.86, +7.66, +15.7%), Dicerna Pharmaceuticals (DRNA 23.95, +1.45, +6.4%) have reacted positively.Separately, shares of Uber (UBER 24.47, -0.10, -0.3%) have recouped most of their pre-market losses that followed news that London rejected the company's application to operate in the city.09:55 ETDow +111.50 at 27987.03, Nasdaq +75.78 at 8595.66, S&P +16.59 at 3126.88[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.5%, and the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.6%.NVIDIA (NVDA 220.15, +9.23, +4.4%) leads the semiconductor stocks higher after it was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley with price target of $259. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 1.8%.Netflix (NFLX 306.25, -4.17, -1.2%) shares, on the other hand, are being excluded from today's positive start after the stock was downgraded to Underperform from Market Perform at Wells Fargo on concerns about spending levels.09:40 ETDow +86.16 at 27961.69, Nasdaq +65.49 at 8585.37, S&P +15.56 at 3125.85[BRIEFING.COM] The major indices begin the day higher in a mostly broad-based advance led by the technology stocks. The S&P 500 is up 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.8%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows information technology (+0.9%), consumer discretionary (+0.6%), and health care (+0.5%) leading today's early advance. The energy sector (-0.2%) is the lone sector trading lower.U.S. Treasuries are little changed. The 2-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.62%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.37. WTI crude is down 0.1% to $57.69/bbl.09:12 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: +11.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +36.10.U.S. stocks are looking to begin the session on a higher note, with the S&P 500 futures trading 11 points, or 0.4%, above fair value. Many are attributing a positive-sounding trade update and some sizable M&A deals for the positive bias today.China is aiming to step up efforts to protect intellectual property rights and enforce stricter penalties against IP theft, according to Bloomberg News. This could help both sides reach a Phase One agreement, although a report from Reuters is suggesting that a Phase Two agreement before the presidential election is less likely.In notable M&A activity:TD Ameritrade (AMTD 49.65, +1.52, +3.2%) will be acquired by Charles Schwab (SCHW 47.90, -0.30, -0.6%) for about $26 billion in an all-stock transaction.

Japan's Ministry of Finance may reportedly increase its issuance of 40-yr JGBs while reducing the supply of 5-yr and 10-yr JGBs.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) edged above the S&P 500 (+0.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%), and Russell 2000 (+0.3%).The market heard from both President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, President Xi, on Friday. Mr. Xi called for mutual respect and equality in talks, but reiterated Beijing is willing to fight back if necessary. Mr. Trump said talks are moving along nicely and closing in on a deal, but the president suggested a deal should not be equal and should favor the U.S. instead.The takeaway was that the market still doesn't know for certain if a Phase One trade agreement will be signed this year, but talks are ongoing and appear to not be escalating. Separately, an upwardly revised reading in the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November was supportive for equities today.Leading the market in gains were the S&P 500 financials (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.7%), and industrials (+0.5%) sectors. The real estate (-0.5%) and energy (-0.4%) sectors were today's laggards.Nordstrom (JWN 37.95, +3.63, +10.6%) and Gap (GPS 16.94, +0.72, +4.4%) were among the biggest earnings-driven gainers in the consumer discretionary space, while an earnings-driven decline in Intuit (INTU 259.81, -11.34, -4.2%) put some pressure on the information technology sector (-0.1%).Elsewhere, the futuristic design of Tesla's (TSLA 333.04, -21.79, -6.1%) Cybertruck pickup was met with some confusion and mixed reviews. Ultimately, it appeared to be a sell-the-news case after the stock climbed about 40% in the past month.U.S. Treasuries ended the week on a flat note. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield was unchanged at 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.26. WTI crude declined 1.2%, or $0.70, to $57.88/bbl.Friday's economic data was limited to the revised reading for the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November:The final November reading for the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index checked in at 96.8 (Briefing.com consensus 94.9), which exceeded the preliminary estimate of 95.7 and the final October reading of 95.5. The November reading is in close proximity to the average level (97.0) since the start of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is the acknowledgment that consumers aren't anticipating sizable increases in inflation, unemployment, and interest rates, which suggests consumer spending activity should remain supportive for the U.S. economy.Investors will not receive any economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +28.4% YTDS&P 500 +24.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.5% YTDRussell 2000 +17.8% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1717/1152. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1778/1303.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: November 25, 2019End of Document

The Russell 2000 continues to outperform with a gain of 2.1%.Today's M&A activity has spanned four different sectors -- financials, consumer discretionary, health care, and information technology -- which has benefited not only the company being acquired but the acquirer as well. The gains in all stocks involved has represented investors' approval for the deals.Looking ahead, Best Buy (BBY 74.43, +1.79, +2.5%), Dollar Tree (DLTR 112.74, +3.70, +3.4%), and Analog Devices (ADI 112.87, +2.22, +2.0%) will report earnings tomorrow morning.14:30 ETDow +143.37 at 28018.9, Nasdaq +104.07 at 8623.95, S&P +19.33 at 3129.62[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 still sits firmly in second place among the major averages, up 0.62%.Top movers in the S&P 500 on Friday include Incyte (INCY 93.81, +5.08, +5.73%), L Brands (LB 19.02, +1.01, +5.61%), and Mylan (MYL 18.05, +0.71, +4.09%). Data from Incyte's oncology portfolio was accepted ahead of the company's American Society of Hematology (ASH) presentation on December 7-10, 2019. L Brands continues recent gains in light of reports the company may be exploring strategic alternatives amid pressure from activists. Mylan gains in the face of a Bloomberg report that drugmakers have been in talks with the U.S. Department of Justice in an attempt to resolve a criminal antitrust probe of alleged price fixing.Conversely, Comcast (CMCSA 43.47, -1.33, -2.97%) sits at the bottom of the index despite a dearth of corporate news.14:00 ETDow +134.74 at 28010.27, Nasdaq +101.52 at 8621.4, S&P +18.64 at 3128.93[BRIEFING.COM] The Nasdaq Composite still sits atop the standings with two hours to go on Monday, +1.19%.Gold futures settled $6.60 lower (-0.5%) to $1,457.00/oz as the market digested positive trade developments out over the weekend.The U.S. Dollar Index sits under 0.1% higher to 98.34.13:30 ETDow +141.79 at 28017.32, Nasdaq +102.94 at 8622.82, S&P +19.79 at 3130.08[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages all sit near afternoon highs in recent trade with the Dow Jones Industrial Average holding the softest advance, up 0.51%.Some of the best performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average today include technology names like Intel (INTC 58.66, +1.05, +1.82%), Cisco Systems (CSCO 45.42, +0.57, +1.27%), and Apple (AAPL 265.01, +3.23, +1.23%). Tech, often a beneficiary of favorable trade sentiment with China, is perhaps benefiting from news out over the weekend that China may step up efforts to protect intellectual property rights and enforce stricter penalties against IP theft, a precursor to trade talk progression toward a Phase One deal.Conversely, McDonald's (MCD 191.80, -1.34, -0.69%) and Exxon Mobil (XOM 68.92, -0.45, -0.65%) continue to jostle for the bottom rung on the standings today. McDonald's was the subject of a favorable note out of sell side Longbow where analysts suggested Q4 US comps had stabilized; WSJ also reported that MCD settled a labor dispute in California.The DJIA now holds gains of 3.59% on the month.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $40 bln 2-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.601% on a bid-to-cover of 2.63.12:55 ETDow +121.27 at 27996.8, Nasdaq +99.87 at 8619.75, S&P +18.42 at 3128.71[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (+0.6%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.2%) have set new all-time highs today following reported progress in a Phase One trade deal and a healthy dose of M&A activity. The Russell 2000 (+1.9%) outperforms, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) trails the pack.The Chinese government released a document stating intentions to better deter IP theft by increasing the penalties on violations, according to Bloomberg. The news is taking precedent over a Reuters report that suggested a Phase Two deal is unlikely to be completed before the presidential election next year.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.1%), which tends to outperform when trade sentiment is positive, is the lone sector up more than 1.0% today. Leading the group higher are the semiconductor stocks, especially NVIDIA (NVDA 219.64, +8.75, +4.2%) after it was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.1%.Following suit are the health care (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.8%), and industrials (+0.6%) sectors. The utilities (-0.2%), energy (-0.1%), and consumer staples (unch) sectors are the lone holdouts.As for M&A activity, some of today's announcements have already been on the market's radar like Charles Schwab (SCHW 48.76, +0.56, +1.2%) agreeing to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.19, +3.06, +6.3%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreeing to acquire Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.07, +7.56, +6.0%) for $16.2 billion in cash.The confirmed deals have still been supportive for risk sentiment, though, and the market has been treated with new deals in Novartis (NVS 91.23, +0.73, +0.8%) agreeing to acquire The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.86, +15.31, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash and eBay (EBAY 35.55, +0.42, +1.2%) reportedly being close to selling StubHub to Viagogo for $4 billion.U.S. Treasuries are little changed despite the solid gains being registered in the stock market. The benchmark 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.34.Investors did not receive any notable economic data today.12:25 ETDow +119.06 at 27994.59, Nasdaq +99.28 at 8619.16, S&P +18.06 at 3128.35[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade sideways with a gain of 0.6%.Each of the FAANG stocks -- Amazon (AMZN 1769.40, +23.88, +1.4%), Apple (AAPL 265.02, +3.24, +1.2%), Alphabet (GOOG 1307.38, +12.04, +0.9%), Facebook (FB 200.69, +1.87, +0.9%) and Netflix (NFLX 313.54, +3.06, +1.0%) -- are up around 1.0%. Netflix is shrugging off a downgrade to Underperform at Wells Fargo.Interestingly, despite the solid gains in the stock market, U.S. Treasuries are not selling off. An uptick in demand has the pushed benchmark 10-yr yield down two basis points to 1.75%.11:55 ETDow +129.08 at 28004.61, Nasdaq +98.92 at 8618.8, S&P +18.87 at 3129.16[BRIEFING.COM] The Nasdaq Composite (+1.2%) remains ahead of both the S&P 500 (+0.6%) and Dow (+0.5%) but behind the Russell 2000 (+1.8%).Apple (AAPL 265.09, +3.32, +1.3%) shares remain an influential force behind the gains in the large-cap indices. Digitimes reported today that the company gave its supply chains strong shipment forecasts for the 5G iPhone. AAPL is now up 68% this year.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a higher note. Germany's DAX increased 0.6%, UK's FTSE increased 0.9%, and France's CAC increased 0.5%. The Europe Stoxx 600 increased 1.1%.11:25 ETDow +126.16 at 28001.69, Nasdaq +99.16 at 8619.04, S&P +18.84 at 3129.13[BRIEFING.COM] Stocks have come down from slightly session highs, but the S&P 500 is still trading comfortably higher with a gain of 0.6%.Shares of TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.43, +3.30, +6.9%) and Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.02, +0.83, +1.8%) have climbed to session highs, though, in a slow reaction to the official announcement that Schwab is acquiring TD for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction. The S&P 500 financials sector is up 0.5%.Elsewhere, shares of eBay (EBAY 35.55, +0.43, +1.2%) are up modestly on news that the company is nearing a deal to sell StubHub to Viagogo for $4 billion.10:55 ETDow +140.82 at 28016.35, Nasdaq +101.30 at 8621.18, S&P +20.11 at 3130.4[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.7%. Trade headlines remain in the news, and the latest update has the market in a good mood.The Chinese government reportedly released a document stating it plans on better protecting intellectual property rights from theft, which could help both sides reach a Phase One agreement soon. Both the U.S. and China continued to say over the weekend that a deal is near.The news is conflicting with a less-covered story from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal, whatever that may look like, may not be completed before the 2020 presidential election. The report may be receiving less attention because it was not based on comments from any top trade negotiators or high-ranking officials.10:25 ETDow +143.23 at 28018.76, Nasdaq +89.70 at 8609.58, S&P +18.87 at 3129.16[BRIEFING.COM] Both the S&P 500 (+0.6%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%) have set all-time highs today.In the health care space, The Medicines Co.

The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 1.8%.Netflix (NFLX 306.25, -4.17, -1.2%) shares, on the other hand, are being excluded from today's positive start after the stock was downgraded to Underperform from Market Perform at Wells Fargo on concerns about spending levels.09:40 ETDow +86.16 at 27961.69, Nasdaq +65.49 at 8585.37, S&P +15.56 at 3125.85[BRIEFING.COM] The major indices begin the day higher in a mostly broad-based advance led by the technology stocks. The S&P 500 is up 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.8%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows information technology (+0.9%), consumer discretionary (+0.6%), and health care (+0.5%) leading today's early advance.

Many are attributing a positive-sounding trade update and some sizable M&A deals for the positive bias today.China is aiming to step up efforts to protect intellectual property rights and enforce stricter penalties against IP theft, according to Bloomberg News. This could help both sides reach a Phase One agreement, although a report from Reuters is suggesting that a Phase Two agreement before the presidential election is less likely.In notable M&A activity:TD Ameritrade (AMTD 49.65, +1.52, +3.2%) will be acquired by Charles Schwab (SCHW 47.90, -0.30, -0.6%) for about $26 billion in an all-stock transaction.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) edged above the S&P 500 (+0.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%), and Russell 2000 (+0.3%).The market heard from both President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, President Xi, on Friday. Mr. Xi called for mutual respect and equality in talks, but reiterated Beijing is willing to fight back if necessary. Mr. Trump said talks are moving along nicely and closing in on a deal, but the president suggested a deal should not be equal and should favor the U.S. instead.The takeaway was that the market still doesn't know for certain if a Phase One trade agreement will be signed this year, but talks are ongoing and appear to not be escalating. Separately, an upwardly revised reading in the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November was supportive for equities today.Leading the market in gains were the S&P 500 financials (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.7%), and industrials (+0.5%) sectors. The real estate (-0.5%) and energy (-0.4%) sectors were today's laggards.Nordstrom (JWN 37.95, +3.63, +10.6%) and Gap (GPS 16.94, +0.72, +4.4%) were among the biggest earnings-driven gainers in the consumer discretionary space, while an earnings-driven decline in Intuit (INTU 259.81, -11.34, -4.2%) put some pressure on the information technology sector (-0.1%).Elsewhere, the futuristic design of Tesla's (TSLA 333.04, -21.79, -6.1%) Cybertruck pickup was met with some confusion and mixed reviews. Ultimately, it appeared to be a sell-the-news case after the stock climbed about 40% in the past month.U.S. Treasuries ended the week on a flat note. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield was unchanged at 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.26. WTI crude declined 1.2%, or $0.70, to $57.88/bbl.Friday's economic data was limited to the revised reading for the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November:The final November reading for the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index checked in at 96.8 (Briefing.com consensus 94.9), which exceeded the preliminary estimate of 95.7 and the final October reading of 95.5. The November reading is in close proximity to the average level (97.0) since the start of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is the acknowledgment that consumers aren't anticipating sizable increases in inflation, unemployment, and interest rates, which suggests consumer spending activity should remain supportive for the U.S. economy.Investors will not receive any economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +28.4% YTDS&P 500 +24.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.5% YTDRussell 2000 +17.8% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1717/1152. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1778/1303.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: November 25, 2019End of Document

Data from Incyte's oncology portfolio was accepted ahead of the company's American Society of Hematology (ASH) presentation on December 7-10, 2019. L Brands continues recent gains in light of reports the company may be exploring strategic alternatives amid pressure from activists. Mylan gains in the face of a Bloomberg report that drugmakers have been in talks with the U.S. Department of Justice in an attempt to resolve a criminal antitrust probe of alleged price fixing.Conversely, Comcast (CMCSA 43.47, -1.33, -2.97%) sits at the bottom of the index despite a dearth of corporate news.14:00 ETDow +134.74 at 28010.27, Nasdaq +101.52 at 8621.4, S&P +18.64 at 3128.93[BRIEFING.COM] The Nasdaq Composite still sits atop the standings with two hours to go on Monday, +1.19%.Gold futures settled $6.60 lower (-0.5%) to $1,457.00/oz as the market digested positive trade developments out over the weekend.The U.S. Dollar Index sits under 0.1% higher to 98.34.13:30 ETDow +141.79 at 28017.32, Nasdaq +102.94 at 8622.82, S&P +19.79 at 3130.08[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages all sit near afternoon highs in recent trade with the Dow Jones Industrial Average holding the softest advance, up 0.51%.Some of the best performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average today include technology names like Intel (INTC 58.66, +1.05, +1.82%), Cisco Systems (CSCO 45.42, +0.57, +1.27%), and Apple (AAPL 265.01, +3.23, +1.23%). Tech, often a beneficiary of favorable trade sentiment with China, is perhaps benefiting from news out over the weekend that China may step up efforts to protect intellectual property rights and enforce stricter penalties against IP theft, a precursor to trade talk progression toward a Phase One deal.Conversely, McDonald's (MCD 191.80, -1.34, -0.69%) and Exxon Mobil (XOM 68.92, -0.45, -0.65%) continue to jostle for the bottom rung on the standings today.

The Russell 2000 (+1.9%) outperforms, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) trails the pack.The Chinese government released a document stating intentions to better deter IP theft by increasing the penalties on violations, according to Bloomberg. The news is taking precedent over a Reuters report that suggested a Phase Two deal is unlikely to be completed before the presidential election next year.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.1%), which tends to outperform when trade sentiment is positive, is the lone sector up more than 1.0% today. Leading the group higher are the semiconductor stocks, especially NVIDIA (NVDA 219.64, +8.75, +4.2%) after it was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.1%.Following suit are the health care (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.8%), and industrials (+0.6%) sectors. The utilities (-0.2%), energy (-0.1%), and consumer staples (unch) sectors are the lone holdouts.As for M&A activity, some of today's announcements have already been on the market's radar like Charles Schwab (SCHW 48.76, +0.56, +1.2%) agreeing to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.19, +3.06, +6.3%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreeing to acquire Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.07, +7.56, +6.0%) for $16.2 billion in cash.The confirmed deals have still been supportive for risk sentiment, though, and the market has been treated with new deals in Novartis (NVS 91.23, +0.73, +0.8%) agreeing to acquire The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.86, +15.31, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash and eBay (EBAY 35.55, +0.42, +1.2%) reportedly being close to selling StubHub to Viagogo for $4 billion.U.S. Treasuries are little changed despite the solid gains being registered in the stock market.

Netflix is shrugging off a downgrade to Underperform at Wells Fargo.Interestingly, despite the solid gains in the stock market, U.S. Treasuries are not selling off. An uptick in demand has the pushed benchmark 10-yr yield down two basis points to 1.75%.11:55 ETDow +129.08 at 28004.61, Nasdaq +98.92 at 8618.8, S&P +18.87 at 3129.16[BRIEFING.COM] The Nasdaq Composite (+1.2%) remains ahead of both the S&P 500 (+0.6%) and Dow (+0.5%) but behind the Russell 2000 (+1.8%).Apple (AAPL 265.09, +3.32, +1.3%) shares remain an influential force behind the gains in the large-cap indices. Digitimes reported today that the company gave its supply chains strong shipment forecasts for the 5G iPhone. AAPL is now up 68% this year.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a higher note. Germany's DAX increased 0.6%, UK's FTSE increased 0.9%, and France's CAC increased 0.5%.

The S&P 500 financials sector is up 0.5%.Elsewhere, shares of eBay (EBAY 35.55, +0.43, +1.2%) are up modestly on news that the company is nearing a deal to sell StubHub to Viagogo for $4 billion.10:55 ETDow +140.82 at 28016.35, Nasdaq +101.30 at 8621.18, S&P +20.11 at 3130.4[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.7%. Trade headlines remain in the news, and the latest update has the market in a good mood.The Chinese government reportedly released a document stating it plans on better protecting intellectual property rights from theft, which could help both sides reach a Phase One agreement soon. Both the U.S. and China continued to say over the weekend that a deal is near.The news is conflicting with a less-covered story from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal, whatever that may look like, may not be completed before the 2020 presidential election. The report may be receiving less attention because it was not based on comments from any top trade negotiators or high-ranking officials.10:25 ETDow +143.23 at 28018.76, Nasdaq +89.70 at 8609.58, S&P +18.87 at 3129.16[BRIEFING.COM] Both the S&P 500 (+0.6%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%) have set all-time highs today.In the health care space, The Medicines Co.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) edged above the S&P 500 (+0.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%), and Russell 2000 (+0.3%).The market heard from both President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, President Xi, on Friday. Mr. Xi called for mutual respect and equality in talks, but reiterated Beijing is willing to fight back if necessary. Mr. Trump said talks are moving along nicely and closing in on a deal, but the president suggested a deal should not be equal and should favor the U.S. instead.The takeaway was that the market still doesn't know for certain if a Phase One trade agreement will be signed this year, but talks are ongoing and appear to not be escalating. Separately, an upwardly revised reading in the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November was supportive for equities today.Leading the market in gains were the S&P 500 financials (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.7%), and industrials (+0.5%) sectors. The real estate (-0.5%) and energy (-0.4%) sectors were today's laggards.Nordstrom (JWN 37.95, +3.63, +10.6%) and Gap (GPS 16.94, +0.72, +4.4%) were among the biggest earnings-driven gainers in the consumer discretionary space, while an earnings-driven decline in Intuit (INTU 259.81, -11.34, -4.2%) put some pressure on the information technology sector (-0.1%).Elsewhere, the futuristic design of Tesla's (TSLA 333.04, -21.79, -6.1%) Cybertruck pickup was met with some confusion and mixed reviews. Ultimately, it appeared to be a sell-the-news case after the stock climbed about 40% in the past month.U.S. Treasuries ended the week on a flat note. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield was unchanged at 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.26. WTI crude declined 1.2%, or $0.70, to $57.88/bbl.Friday's economic data was limited to the revised reading for the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November:The final November reading for the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index checked in at 96.8 (Briefing.com consensus 94.9), which exceeded the preliminary estimate of 95.7 and the final October reading of 95.5. The November reading is in close proximity to the average level (97.0) since the start of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is the acknowledgment that consumers aren't anticipating sizable increases in inflation, unemployment, and interest rates, which suggests consumer spending activity should remain supportive for the U.S. economy.Investors will not receive any economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +28.4% YTDS&P 500 +24.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.5% YTDRussell 2000 +17.8% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1717/1152. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1778/1303.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: November 25, 2019End of Document

The Russell 2000 (+1.9%) outperforms, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) trails the pack.The Chinese government released a document stating intentions to better deter IP theft by increasing the penalties on violations, according to Bloomberg. The news is taking precedent over a Reuters report that suggested a Phase Two deal is unlikely to be completed before the presidential election next year.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.1%), which tends to outperform when trade sentiment is positive, is the lone sector up more than 1.0% today. Leading the group higher are the semiconductor stocks, especially NVIDIA (NVDA 219.64, +8.75, +4.2%) after it was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.1%.Following suit are the health care (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.8%), and industrials (+0.6%) sectors. The utilities (-0.2%), energy (-0.1%), and consumer staples (unch) sectors are the lone holdouts.As for M&A activity, some of today's announcements have already been on the market's radar like Charles Schwab (SCHW 48.76, +0.56, +1.2%) agreeing to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.19, +3.06, +6.3%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreeing to acquire Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.07, +7.56, +6.0%) for $16 billion in cash.The confirmed deals have still been supportive for risk sentiment, though, and the market has been treated with new deals in Novartis (NVS 91.23, +0.73, +0.8%) agreeing to acquire The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.86, +15.31, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash and eBay (EBAY 35.55, +0.42, +1.2%) reportedly close to selling StubHub to Viagogo for $4 billion.U.S. Treasuries are little changed despite the gains being registered in the stock market.

Netflix is shrugging off a downgrade to Underperform at Wells Fargo.Interestingly, despite the solid gains in the stock market, U.S. Treasuries are not selling off. An uptick in demand has the pushed benchmark 10-yr yield down two basis points to 1.75%.11:55 ETDow +129.08 at 28004.61, Nasdaq +98.92 at 8618.8, S&P +18.87 at 3129.16[BRIEFING.COM] The Nasdaq Composite (+1.2%) remains ahead of both the S&P 500 (+0.6%) and Dow (+0.5%) but behind the Russell 2000 (+1.8%).Apple (AAPL 265.09, +3.32, +1.3%) shares remain an influential force behind the gains in the large-cap indices. Digitimes reported today that the company gave its supply chains strong shipment forecasts for the 5G iPhone.

The S&P 500 financials sector is up 0.5%.Elsewhere, shares of eBay (EBAY 35.55, +0.43, +1.2%) are up modestly on news that the company is nearing a deal to sell StubHub to Viagogo for $4 billion.10:55 ETDow +140.82 at 28016.35, Nasdaq +101.30 at 8621.18, S&P +20.11 at 3130.4[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.7%. Trade headlines remain in the news, and the latest update has the market in a good mood.The Chinese government reportedly released a document stating it plans on better protecting intellectual property rights from theft, which could help both sides reach a Phase One agreement soon. Both the U.S. and China continued to say over the weekend that a deal is near.The news is conflicting with a less-covered story from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal, whatever that may look like, may not be completed before the 2020 presidential election. The report may be receiving less attention because it was not based on comments from any top trade negotiators or high-ranking officials.10:25 ETDow +143.23 at 28018.76, Nasdaq +89.70 at 8609.58, S&P +18.87 at 3129.16[BRIEFING.COM] Both the S&P 500 (+0.6%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%) have set all-time highs today.In the health care space, The Medicines Co.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) edged above the S&P 500 (+0.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%), and Russell 2000 (+0.3%).The market heard from both President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, President Xi, on Friday. Mr. Xi called for mutual respect and equality in talks, but reiterated Beijing is willing to fight back if necessary. Mr. Trump said talks are moving along nicely and closing in on a deal, but the president suggested a deal should not be equal and should favor the U.S. instead.The takeaway was that the market still doesn't know for certain if a Phase One trade agreement will be signed this year, but talks are ongoing and appear to not be escalating. Separately, an upwardly revised reading in the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November was supportive for equities today.Leading the market in gains were the S&P 500 financials (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.7%), and industrials (+0.5%) sectors. The real estate (-0.5%) and energy (-0.4%) sectors were today's laggards.Nordstrom (JWN 37.95, +3.63, +10.6%) and Gap (GPS 16.94, +0.72, +4.4%) were among the biggest earnings-driven gainers in the consumer discretionary space, while an earnings-driven decline in Intuit (INTU 259.81, -11.34, -4.2%) put some pressure on the information technology sector (-0.1%).Elsewhere, the futuristic design of Tesla's (TSLA 333.04, -21.79, -6.1%) Cybertruck pickup was met with some confusion and mixed reviews. Ultimately, it appeared to be a sell-the-news case after the stock climbed about 40% in the past month.U.S. Treasuries ended the week on a flat note. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield was unchanged at 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.26. WTI crude declined 1.2%, or $0.70, to $57.88/bbl.Friday's economic data was limited to the revised reading for the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November:The final November reading for the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index checked in at 96.8 (Briefing.com consensus 94.9), which exceeded the preliminary estimate of 95.7 and the final October reading of 95.5. The November reading is in close proximity to the average level (97.0) since the start of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is the acknowledgment that consumers aren't anticipating sizable increases in inflation, unemployment, and interest rates, which suggests consumer spending activity should remain supportive for the U.S. economy.Investors will not receive any economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +28.4% YTDS&P 500 +24.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.5% YTDRussell 2000 +17.8% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1717/1152. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1778/1303.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: November 25, 2019End of Document

China allows its cannabis industry to thrive, even if it says no to marijuanaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 25, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 927 wordsBodyQujing, China, Nov 25. (Dow Jones) -- In China, marijuana is considered a dangerous narcotic, and its possession is strictly punished. But that hasn't stopped the country from trying to become a powerhouse in the fast-growing cannabis products industry in the country.China has grown hemp, a cannabis strain, for thousands of years to use in traditional clothing and medicine, and is one of the world's largest producers of hemp. The country is using that foothold to produce cannabidiol (CBD), an unregulated chemical that is related to marijuana and is currently reaching products as diverse as bathing liquids and pet food.At the heart of these efforts is in Yunnan, in southwestern China, the first province to legalize cannabis cultivation on an industrial scale. Here, farmers have planted large plots of hemp that rise above their heads and stretch for miles. In the fall, these leaves and flowers are harvested by hand, dried in the sun and converted into CBD powders and oils for export."It's an industry that can revitalize farmers' activities," said Yang Liu, field manager in Qujing, a small town in Yunnan. "I'm already in love with that, and I feel like this will bring me a lot of benefits in the future."American farmers are also planting more hemp to meet the growing demand for CBD, which is said to provide relief from pain and anxiety without producing the psychotic effects of marijuana. Brightfield Group, a cannabis research firm, expects the market to be worth $23 billion by 2023.The nascent interest in CBD is unlikely to change China's severe stance on marijuana. Trafficking in tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the psychoactive component of cannabis, may involve a life sentence or even the death penalty.In an April briefing, Liu Yuejin, deputy director of China's National Narcotics Control Commission, said that as cannabis is legalized in many countries, "China will more strictly strengthen oversight of industrial cannabis, it will ream all loopholes and will improve various management systems."Sales of CBD products that are ingested are also strictly regulated in the country. That means that almost everything China grows is shipped abroad, competing for market share with other major producers, such as the United States and Canada."Like many things in China, there is a fear of how much production exists and how it might overwhelm a certain market," said Adams Lee, an international trade lawyer at Harris Bricken, a Chinese-focused law firm and Cannabis cases.According to Hemp Business Journal, China accounted for approximately 11% of the global CBD market that is valued at $800 million in 2018, behind Europe and the United States.As the industry matures, aspiring centite people are buying more landand increasing its production. And despite the long history of hemp agriculture, local governments recently developed more formal regulations."China is currently moving at the speed of light to develop the CBD industry," said Henri Sant-Cassia, who has been touring Asia in search of new CBD-producing companies for Cannabis Fund, which invests in cannabis companies in its period Initial.The Chinese government maintains strong control over the entire process. Plants cannot have more than 0.3% THC. Farmers must obtain their licence in one of the two provinces where the industry has been legalized. Factories that mine CBD are equipped with security cameras and are monitored by local police.Paul Vincent Murray, who started Hempson BioTech in 2015 to produce CBD and other cannabis extracts in Yunnan, said that for every kilogram of oil extracted at the company's facilities, automated machines incinerate approximately one kilogram THC. "There is absolutely no way to cheat," he said. So far, the company has produced 20 tons of oil including CBD.Another new CBD company has been working with a data partner backed by Tencent Holdings, which, like other tech giants in China, collects large amounts of information and often works with authorities to share data.Glenn Davies said his company, CannAcubed, had been in talks with Tencent's private company Lingchen Security Technology to create a system to track the amount of CBD and THC in crops, and monitor the extraction process. That information must be shared with public safety offices, he said. Tencent said that Lingchen Security has not reached any formal agreement with CannAcubed and that it had not provided him with any products or services.In the far northeast of China, along the border with Siberia, Heilongjiang is the second province of China to legalize the industrial cultivation of Cannabis. Jilin, a neighboring province, is also taking steps towards legalization.As more companies enter the industry, they will struggle to make money, said Tan Xin, chairman and co-founder of Hanma Investment Group, one of China's first cannabis companies.CBD prices have already plummeted since HMI entered space in 2013, when 1 kilogram of CBD was sold at around $50,000 in the US market, he said. Last year, prices averaged six thousand dollars, a direct result of farmers growing more hemp. So he predicts next year they'll fall below a thousand dollars.However, Tan said his company can make a profit as long as prices stay above $300, thanks to China's advantage in cheap labor and processing costs."I guess that's going to drive America's CBD producers crazy," Tan said. "Being profitable at $300 is a very scary thing for some."Translated by Luis Felipe CedilloEdited by Michelle del CampoCopyright © 2019 Dow Jones &Company;, Inc.

It is the Company's intention to resume the Advantage Loan program as soon as management is confident its stated policies and procedures are being followed. However, it is presently difficult to estimate how long this suspension might last.The Advantage Loan program is a material component of the Bank's total loan originations. While it is difficult to quantify the financial impact of the program's temporary suspension, management anticipates a reduced level of near-term loan originations, slower overall loan portfolio growth, and less loan sales. However, management does not anticipate any credit related issues from previous loans made under the program due to the substantial amount of equity required for each borrower and the resulting strong collateral package for each loan. In order to mitigate the operational and financial impact of the Advantage Loan program's temporary suspension, the Company will continue to work on initiatives to diversify its overall loan production. Such initiatives include expanding the Bank's commercial lending efforts, including multifamily, tenant-in-common, construction, and commercial and industrial loans. In addition, management will continue to review new residential loan products that meet the needs of its customers in its served markets.08:13SCANX Gapping downGapping downIn reaction to disappointing earnings/guidance:THO -4.1%M&A news:DPLO -31.7% (to be acquired by UnitedHealth's (UNH) OptumRx for $4.00/share in cash)Other news:KALV -17.7% (announced results of the Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the use of KVD001 ) MNRL -4.4% (commences 11 mln common stock offering; 6 mln by the co and 5 mln by the selling stockholders) SYNH -3% (approves expansion and extension of the Company's existing stock repurchase program) AUPH -2.8% (commences registered underwritten public offering of $150 mln of its common shares) ERIC -0.7% (reaches resolution on US FCPA Investigations; combined payment of $1.06 bln) LITE -0.5% (to offer $850 mln aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2026)Analyst comments:M -2.1% (downgraded to Sell at Goldman)MMM -1.3% (downgraded to Neutral at Citigroup)ORLY -1.3% (downgraded to Neutral from Buy at Goldman)08:12APEI American Public Education Board authorizes program to repurchase up to an additional $25 mln of shares of the Company's common stock (25.12 )08:10SCANX Gapping upGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:N/A.M&A news:THOR +168.5% (to be acquired by Sanofi (SNY) for $68/share in cash) XBIT +136.1% (to divest Human antibody Bermekimab targeting IL-1a to Janssen) ARQL +100.6% (to be acquired by Merck (MRK) for $20 per share in cash for an approximate total equity value of $2.7 billion) RRTS +10.9% (announces the sale of its Flatbed business unit, for $30 mlnin cash)Other news:FATE +25.1% (reports clinical data from Landmark Phase 1 studies; No dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients; also presents new in vivo preclinical data for FT596 -- company plans to initiate enrollment of first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in rarly 2020) OBSV +22.1% (reports positive Phase 3 trial results from PRIMROSE 2 trial of linzagolix) TGTX +22.1% (presents triple therapy data from Phase I/II study of ublituximab in combination with umbralisib and venetoclax) PCG +21% (reaches agreement to resolve wildfires from 2017 and 2018) CRTX +14% (reports new data revealing link between bacterial pathogen and genetic risk for Alzheimer's Disease) AGIO +12.4% (announces that clinical proof-of-concept has been established based on preliminary analysis of Phase 2 trial of mitapivat in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia) DTIL +9.4% (announces updated interim clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1 trial of its lead investigational off-the-shelf (allogeneic) chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy candidate, PBCAR0191) RCKT +7.3% (presents 'encouraging' preliminary results from its Phase 1 trial of commercial-grade RP-L102 "Process B" for Fanconi Anemia) ALEC +6.8% (presents Phase 1 data on AL002) SGMO +5.5% (Sangamo Therapeutics and Pfizer (PFE) report updated Phase 1/2 results showing sustained increased Factor VIII activity through 44 weeks ) KPTI +5.3% (reports new and updated XPOVIO data demonstrating 56% overall response) BLUE +5% (Bluebirdbio and Bristol-Myers (BMY) report "positive" top-line results from Ph 2 KarMMa study of ide-cel; met its primary endpoint and key secondary endpoint) APTO +3.9% (reports early clinical observations with CG-806 and APTO-253) CGC +3.3% (names David Klein CEO effective January 14) AM +2.9% (to repurchase $100 mln of shares from Antero Resources) CSIQ +2.8% (authorizes $150 mln share repurchase program ) BMY +2.3% (presents data from multiple studies evaluating lisocabtagene maraleucel at ASH) MNK +2.1% (presents data on a novel predictive model to identify infants at risk for infantile spasms) SESN +1.7% (initiated the submission of its BLA for Vicinium for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer under Rolling Review to the FDAMBIO +1.3% (highlights presentation of updated Phase 1/2 clinical data for MB-107 lentiviral gene therapy for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency)Analyst comments:QRVO +3.4% (upgraded to Buy (from Underperform) at BofA/Merrill)SWKS +2.2% (upgraded to Buy (from Underpeform) at BofA/Merrill)NUE +1.4% (upgraded to Buy at Longbow)STLD +1.1% (upgraded to Buy at Longbow)08:10BONDX Overnight Treasury Market SummaryRebound in ProgressU.S. Treasuries will attempt to snap their three-day skid after Treasury futures inched higher during a quiet overnight session.

Weiss, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are highly encouraged by the first clinical data presented from our once daily, BTK inhibitor, TG-1701, which has demonstrated superior selectivity for BTK compared to ibrutinib in an in vitro whole kinome screening. The data presented today show that TG-1701 is an active BTK inhibitor as a single agent and that the combination of U2 plus TG-1701 has been generally well tolerated and active with 6 of 7 patients responding to the triple therapy at 100 mg QD, the lowest dose of TG-1701 tested. We look forward to continuing dose escalation of TG-1701 in the combination arm and identifying the optimal dose for this therapy." Mr. Weiss continued, "Our goal has always been to develop the best possible combination treatment options for patients, and we are excited to present the first data from a triple combination study in which all of the agents are being developed by TG. We believe this proprietary combination has the potential to enhance the results of BTK inhibitor therapy alone and offer patients early and deep responses with a tolerable safety profile."08:02GALT Galectin Therapeutics announces publication of results from its NASH-CX Phase 2 clinical trial in NASH cirrhosis in the peer-reviewed journal Gastroenterology (2.99 )The paper outlines that in a phase 2b study of 162 patients with NASH, cirrhosis, and portal hypertension, one year of biweekly infusion of belapectin was safe but not associated with significant reduction in HVPG or fibrosis, compared with placebo. However, in a subgroup analysis of patients without esophageal varices, 2 mg/kg belapectin (GR-MD-02) did reduce HVPG and development of varices. This subgroup analysis suggests that there may be benefits from belapectin in patients with NASH cirrhosis without esophageal varices. Further, if this observation can be reproduced in subsequent studies, belapectin may have a role in the management of patients with NASH cirrhosis and portal hypertension but no varices.08:01REPL Replimune names Jean M.

This was comparable to historical data with multiple doses of busulfan conditioning.CD117-ADC was well tolerated in non-human primates with no evidence of the often severe side effects seen with busulfan conditioning, including veno-occlusive disease, weight loss, diarrhea, mucositis, vomiting, pulmonary fibrosis or seizures.07:42TPX Tempur Sealy Int'l determines that it will record a charge of $30 mln (before tax) in Q4 in connection with the bankruptcy of one of its customers (85.89 )On December 6, 2019, Tempur Sealy determined that it will record a charge of $30 million (before tax) in the fourth quarter of 2019, in connection with the bankruptcy of one of its customers, Mattress PAL Holding, LLC ("Mattress PAL"), and the resulting significant liquidity issues of Mattress PAL's affiliates (collectively, "Mattress1One"). On April 7, 2019, Mattress PAL filed a voluntary petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division ("Bankruptcy Court") seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code ("Chapter 11 Proceedings"). On December 5, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court orally granted Mattress PAL's request to convert the Chapter 11 Proceedings to a Chapter 7 liquidation case. The Company plans to treat this charge, which does not involve any cash payments, as an adjustment in calculating adjusted EBITDA under the Company's senior secured credit agreement. Mattress1One represented less than 1% of the Company's global net sales in 2019, and the Company does not expect this charge, or the loss of Mattress1One as a customer, to have a material impact on the Company's 2019 guidance, 2020 outlook, or current or future liquidity.07:37IEP Icahn Enterprises commences private placement of Senior Notes due 2027 (61.61 )The proceeds from the offering will be used for general limited partnership purposes.07:35MBIO Mustang Bio highlights presentation of updated Phase 1/2 clinical data for MB-107 lentiviral gene therapy for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (3.85 )Lentiviral Gene Therapy with Low Dose Busulfan for Infants with X-SCID Results in the Development of a Functional Normal Immune System: Interim Results of an Ongoing Phase I/II Clinical Study Lentiviral gene therapy using low dose busulfan conditioning has been well tolerated, with no serious adverse events other than hematologic related to busulfanAll 11 patients had robust hematopoietic recovery within 3-4 weeks post cell infusion without blood product support Nine patients, with a follow up of greater than 3 months, achieved normal-for-age T-cell and natural killer (NK)-cell numbers within 3-4 months post gene therapy Five patients are off intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy thus far, of whom 3 responded to vaccines Median vector copy number (VCN) at 12 months post-gene therapy in seven patients, who have been followed for more than 12 months, was 2.25 VCN/cell (range: 1.24-3.03) in T cells, 0.34 VCN/cell (range: 0.23-1.25) in B cells, 1.55 VCN/cell (range 1.27-3.39) in NK cells, and 0.08 VCN/cell (range: 0.03-0.76) in myeloid cells in peripheral blood, and 0.10 (range: 0.05-0.66) in CD34+ bone marrow cells, respectivelyEnhanced Transduction Lentivector Gene Therapy for Treatment of Older Patients with X-Linked Severe Combined ImmunodeficiencyEarly outcome data for five older children and young adults with XSCID who received the lentivector (also known as lentiviral) gene therapy as salvage therapy after having previously received haplo-identical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as infants without chemotherapy-based conditioning were previously reported and published in Science Translational Medicine. By 2016, three additional patients were treated, and the cohort of eight patients (referred to as Cohort A) has now been followed for 3 to 7 years. Among Cohort A, gradual clinical benefit in the clearance of chronic norovirus and associated improved abdominal complaints, malabsorption, growth and IgG production were observed, and four patients were able to cease immunoglobulin replacement therapy.While the results were positive, the relatively inefficient transduction of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) required large quantities of vector. This resulted in relatively low VCN in myeloid cells in some patients, with delayed immune cell recovery and persistent clinical disease, especially in the last patient treated (patient 8). To address this, NIH developed a refined enhanced transduction (ET) procedure consisting of a single overnight transduction after 48 hours pre-stimulation in cytokines (Stem cell factor, Thrombopoietin, Flt3-ligand; 100ng/mL) and incorporated transduction enhancers LentiBoost 1:100 and dimethyl prostaglandin 2 (dmPGE2; 1uM).The presentation at the 2019 ASH Annual Meeting included data from six patients (referred to as Cohort B) treated by NIH, including re-treatment of patient 8. The patients, who were aged 12 to 36, had significant problems with donor T cell infiltration of liver, bone marrow and kidneys, and were nearly absent of B and NK cells. The enhanced transduction procedure achieved much greater transduction efficiencies than were observed in Cohort A, with greater than 10-fold less vector, and resulted in faster immune reconstitution and more significant clinical benefit by 3 months.07:33AR Antero Resources highlights agreements expected to reduce its gathering, processing and transportation costs by approximately $350 mln over the next four years, commences asset sale program targeting $750 mln to $1 bln in proceeds to be completed in 2020 (2.19 )The agreements include a growth incentive fee program with Antero Midstream Corporation (AM) that aligns with the Company's current 8% to 10% compound annual production growth plan through 2021 and additional agreements with other third party midstream providers.

All response-evaluable patients experienced tumor reduction (complete response + partial response + stable disease) following treatment with ADCETRIS in combination with OPDIVO. Median duration of response was not yet reached and the maximum duration of response was 22 months and ongoing (95% CI: 7.06, -). The most common treatment-related adverse events of any grade occurring in at least 20 percent of patients were fatigue, diarrhea, pyrexia, infusion related reaction, peripheral motor neuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy and increase in lipase. One treatment-related serious adverse event was pyrexia. Fifty-seven percent of patients (12/21) had at least one treatment-related adverse event greater than or equal to Grade 3, most commonly increase in lipase (24 percent, 5/21), peripheral motor neuropathy and peripheral sensory neuropathy (each 14 percent, 3/21), and fatigue and hyponatremia (each 10 percent, 2/21).

Of the 91 treated patients, 67 patients received an ASCT per trial protocol with no additional salvage therapy. For all treated patients, the two-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 79 percent (95% CI: 68%, 87%). For the 67 patients who received an ASCT per trial protocol, the two-year PFS was 92 percent (95% CI: 80%, 97%). Median follow-up for all treated patients was 24.2 months (range 1.8-41.7) and the median PFS was not reached. Estimated overall survival at two years was 94 percent (95% CI: 85%, 97%) and median overall survival was not yet reached. Peripheral immune signatures were consistent with an activated T-cell response. Prior to ASCT, the most common adverse events of any grade occurring in more than 20 percent of patients were nausea, infusion related reaction, fatigue, diarrhea, pruritus, headache, vomiting and pyrexia. Other adverse events included peripheral neuropathy in 16 patients (18 percent) and neutropenia in six patients (7 percent). Two patients (2 percent) discontinued treatment due to adverse events, Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy and increased gamma-glutamyltransferase. Serious adverse events occurred in 14 patients (15 percent), including pneumonia, pneumonitis and pyrexia (two patients each); and Grade 3 Guillain-Barre syndrome (one patient).06:52GILD Gilead Sciences reports Long-term data from ZUMA-1 demonstrating about half of refractory large b-cell lymphoma patients were alive three years after Yescarta treatment (67.08 )Co announced new data from the ZUMA-1 trial of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) in adult patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma. These results included updated overall survival data from the pivotal phase 2 study after three years following a single infusion of Yescarta, as well as an analysis from a separate safety management cohort of patients receiving early steroid intervention for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events. Updated results from a separate ZUMA-1 safety management study (Cohort 4) were also presented at the meeting (Abstract #243). In this analysis, patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma treated with Yescarta received earlier steroid intervention, beginning when patients experienced Grade 1 neurologic events or experienced Grade 1 CRS with no improvement after three days of supportive care. Patients could receive optional bridging chemotherapy prior to Yescarta infusion. In the analysis, 41 patients had received Yescarta, with a median follow-up of 8.7 months; 73 percent of patients received corticosteroids and 76 percent received tocilizumab. Earlier steroid use appeared to decrease the percentage of patients with Grade =3 CRS (2 percent) and neurologic events (17 percent), each of which were numerically lower than rates in the registrational cohorts of ZUMA-1 (13 percent CRS, 31 percent neurologic events). There were no Grade 4 or 5 CRS or neurologic events and no Grade 5 AEs related to Yescarta in Cohort 4. Objective response rate per investigator assessment was 73 percent in Cohort 4, with 51 percent of patients achieving a complete response. The median duration of response was 8.9 months. Fifty-four percent of patients in this cohort remained in an ongoing response with at least six months of follow-up after Yescarta infusion. Median OS in Cohort 4 has not been reached.06:51CRTX Cortexyme reports new data revealing link between bacterial pathogen and genetic risk for Alzheimer's Disease (28.31 )Co announced the presentation of new data supporting the on-target activity of COR388, its lead investigational medicine, and linking the "gingipain hypothesis" for Alzheimer's disease (AD) to the significance of the APOE gene as a major risk factor for the disease.Gingipains from P. gingivalis cleave ApoE proteins and have a preference for cleaving ApoE4; and COR388, a gingipain inhibitor, prevents this. In in vitro experiments, cells infected with P. gingivalis exhibited gingipain-dependent ApoE cleavage activity that generated ApoE fragments similar to what was seen in the brains and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, uninfected cells had no significant ApoE protein-cleaving activity. Furthermore, P. gingivalis gingipains cleaved ApoE4 more readily than ApoE3. Finally, in the infected cells, COR388 alone was sufficient to block ApoE fragmentation. In a Phase 1b trial, COR388 reduced ApoE fragments in CSF. Cortexyme's Phase 1 clinical development program for COR388 included cohorts of healthy volunteers and subjects with Alzheimer's disease. In addition to assessing safety and initial clinical activity, investigators also assessed the level of ApoE fragmentation in the CSF of nine subjects with Alzheimer's disease. Six subjects received 50mg of COR388 twice daily while three subjects received placebo. After 28 days, a statistically significant decrease in ApoE fragments (both ApoE4 and ApoE3) was observed in subjects treated with COR388 versus those treated with placebo.06:51EGRX Eagle Pharma commences dosing in pilot study for novel estrogen receptor antagonist product candidate (56.43 )Co announces that the Company has commenced dosing in a pilot clinical study to assess the unique characteristics of its fulvestrant product candidate, which has the potential to enhance estrogen receptor ("ER") inhibition and improve patient outcomes. The results of the pilot study will inform the design of the Company's pivotal trial, which Eagle expects to commence in 2020.06:51BLUE Bluebirdbio presents new data from ongoing Phase 1/2 HGB-206 study of investigational LentiGlobin gene therapy for sickle cell disease (79.42 )HGB-206 is an ongoing, Phase 1/2 open-label study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LentiGlobin gene therapy for SCD that includes three treatment cohorts: Groups A, B and C. All results are as of the data cutoff date of August 26, 2019.Groups A and B:As of the data cutoff date, seven out of nine total patients in Groups A and B (five out of seven in Group A and two out of two in Group B) did not require regular RBC transfusions post-treatment. Overall, patients in Groups A and B experienced a reduction, but not complete elimination of VOC and ACS events at two years post-treatment, suggesting that the levels of gene therapy-derived hemoglobin may have been sufficient to reduce but not eliminate continued sickle-related disease manifestations. Group C As of the data cutoff date, 17 patients were treated with LentiGlobin for SCD in Group C, with the longest follow-up at 21 months; none required regular RBC transfusions post-treatment. In patients with six or more months of follow-up (n=12), median levels of gene therapy-derived anti-sickling hemoglobin, HbAT87Q, were at least 40% of total hemoglobin. Total hemoglobin and HbAT87Q levels ranged from 9.3 -- 15.2 g/dL and 2.7 -- 9.0 g/dL, respectively, at last visit. Treatment with LentiGlobin for SCD reduced key markers of hemolysis, including reticulocyte counts, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and total bilirubin concentration, which suggests that treatment is improving biological markers of the disease. Among the nine patients with at least six months of follow-up who had four or more VOC or ACS events in the two years prior to treatment, there was a 99% reduction in annualized rate of VOC and ACS. There were no reports of ACS or serious VOC at up to 21 months post-treatment in these patients. As previously reported, there was one non-serious Grade 2 VOC was observed in a patient approximately 3.5 months post-LentiGlobin for SCD treatment.HGB-206 Exploratory Assays bluebird bio presented results from exploratory assays in samples from a subset of patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD from Groups A, B and C, to assess the relationship between drug product characteristics and RBC physiology. To demonstrate the pancellular expression of the gene therapy derived anti-sickling Hb, HbAT87Q, bluebird bio developed an assay that enables detection of HbAT87Q and HbS protein in individual RBCs. In 12 patients who had at least six months of follow-up, the proportion of RBCs positive for HbAT87Q at the last study visit was more than 70% in all cases; with more than 90% of RBCs positive for HbAT87Q in four patients.On average, HbAT87Q present in RBCs of patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD was within the range of non-sickling adult Hb, HbA, present in the RBCs from people with sickle cell trait. The RBCs also resembled sickle cell trait RBCs with regard to propensity to sickle under low oxygen conditions. Sickling of RBCs from patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD was significantly less than that seen in untreated patients with SCD.06:49MNK Mallinckrodt plc presents data on a novel predictive model to identify infants at risk for infantile spasms (3.41 )Co announced findings on the use of a novel predictive model designed to more quickly identify infants with infantile spasms (IS), a rare seizure disorder that typically occurs between three and seven months of age. Key FindingsDeductive models developed to identify the combinations of variables that predict IS prior to diagnosis and during the treatment pathway: 557 patients had =2 symptoms pertaining to IS -- seizures, developmental delay, lack of eye contact and lack of muscle tone -- and a moderate or high severity ED visit.In this group, 55 percent of patients (n=304) had an IS diagnosis within a median 0.8 months of the triggering event. The most notable deductive combinations focused on pre-diagnosis of IS. MethodsThe study utilized data from the Symphony Health Integrated Dataverse database to identify triggers for early identification of IS patients from medical and pharmacy claims from 10.8 million patients under 2 years of age between May 2017 and April 2018. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) procedure codes were evaluated to identify the codes most likely to predict a subsequent diagnosis of IS. Researchers also used input from IS medical experts to determine the clinical, electrographic, radiologic, procedural and medication variables that may predict IS development.06:48SGMO Sangamo Therapeutics announces preliminary results from first three patients treated in Phase 1/2 THALES study evaluating investigational ST-400 ex vivo gene-edited cell therapy in transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (11.66 )The three patients treated with ST-400 experienced prompt hematopoietic reconstitution, demonstrating neutrophil engraftment in 14-22 days and platelet engraftment in 22-35 days (Table 1). No emerging clonal hematopoiesis has to date been observed by on-target indel pattern monitoring in the three treated patients. Reported adverse events (AEs) are consistent with the known toxicities of mobilization, apheresis, and myeloablative busulfan conditioning. One serious adverse event (SAE) related to ST-400 was reported. As previously disclosed, Patient 1 experienced hypersensitivity during ST-400 infusion considered by the investigator to be likely related to the product cryoprotectant excipient, DMSO, and which resolved by the end of the infusion.06:47LITE Lumentum to offer $850 mln aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2026 (72.08 )Lumentum intends to use approximately $196 million of the net proceeds of the offering to repay in full all amounts outstanding under its term loan credit facility, and a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to purchase up to approximately $200 million of its common stock concurrently with the pricing of this offering in privately negotiated transactions effected through the initial purchaser of the notes or its affiliates as its agent.

The results from the pharmacokinetic and occupancy studies for the first seven patients have been in-line with expectations. The Company anticipates that a dose that achieves maximum target occupancy will be achieved in the next one or two dose cohorts. CPI-818 has been shown to bind covalently to ITK at low nanomolar concentrations without reacting with other kinases. In vitro studies demonstrated selective cytotoxicity to Sezary cells (malignant cells from patients with CTCL), while sparing normal T-cells, in three subjects not enrolled in the study. Preclinical murine models of lymphoproliferative and autoimmune disease showed CPI-818 inhibited the development of lymph node and spleen enlargement by preventing proliferation of abnormal T-cells. Treatment with CPI-818 led to regression of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly in animals with established disease.06:32CGC Canopy Growth names David Klein CEO effective January 14 (18.65 )In his current role as executive vice president and chief financial officer at Constellation Brands, David oversees all aspects of the company's finance operations, all mergers and acquisitions, as well as the company's information technology function.The appointment of David Klein follows a thorough recruitment process overseen by a special Hiring Committee of the Board using global recruitment company Heidrick & Struggles, which saw a wide variety of exceptional candidates vetted and interviewed.

Fourteen patients were evaluable at one month.AUTO3 was well-tolerated, with no patients experiencing > or = Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with primary infusion and 1 of 14 experiencing Grade 3 neurotoxicity that resolved swiftly with steroids. There were no pembrolizumab immune-related toxicities and the majority of grade 3 or higher adverse events were hematological. Low levels of serum cytokines are consistent with the observed low levels of CRS and neurotoxicity. Across all tested doses 5 patients achieved a complete response, with 4 of 5 complete responses ongoing, the longest at 18 months. All CRs were achieved without need for steroid or tocilizumab-based management of the patients or ICU level care.AUTO3 -- (Poster) - Phase 1/2 AMELIA clinical trial of AUTO3 in patients with relapsed/refractory pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pALL) (Abstract # 2620)AUTO3 was well-tolerated overall, with no patients experiencing = Grade 3 CRS and no patients experiencing > or = Grade 2 neurotoxicity, in doses > or =3x106 /kg CAR-T cells. No AUTO3-related deaths were reported.Among the 10 CAR T-nave patients, at a median follow-up time of 9.7 months (range 1.8- 18), 9 of 10 patients (90%) achieved a complete response, and 8 of 10 (80%) achieved complete molecular remission by PCR. Estimated overall survival at 12 months was 100%. There are 2 ongoing patients in complete molecular remission at 12 and 15 months post-AUTO3 infusion, respectively. The most common cause of relapse was due to loss of CAR T-cell persistence. The median persistence of CAR-T cells in blood was 170 days.06:29STOK Stoke Therapeutics presents new preclinical data on STK-001 for the treatment of Dravet syndrome (28.98 )Data from studies in non-human primates (NHP) showed STK-001 distributed throughout the brain and achieved target engagement and increased Nav1.1 protein expression throughout the cortex after a single intrathecal injection. Safety findings showed STK-001 to be well-tolerated at the two intrathecal dose levels studied. These data were presented in a poster session at the American Epilepsy Society (AES) Annual Meeting in Baltimore.Stoke plans to submit an investigational new drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in early 2020 and, subject to acceptance of the IND, plans to initiate a Phase 1/2 single-ascending dose study in children and adolescents with Dravet syndrome in the first half of 2020.06:28FATE Fate Therapeutics presents new in vivo preclinical data for FT596 -- company plans to initiate enrollment of first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in rarly 2020 (13.67 )FT596 is the first cellular immunotherapy engineered with three active anti-tumor components to be cleared for clinical investigation by the FDA. In addition to a proprietary CAR targeting CD19, FT596 expresses a novel high-affinity, non-cleavable CD16 (hnCD16) Fc receptor that has been modified to augment antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, enabling coincident targeting of CD19 and additional tumor-associated antigens such as CD20. FT596 also expresses an interleukin-15 receptor fusion (IL-15RF), a potent cytokine complex that promotes survival, proliferation and trans-activation of NK cells and CD8 T cells without the need for systemic cytokine support. Together, these features of FT596 are intended to maximize potency and minimize toxicity in treated patients. The Company plans to initiate enrollment of a first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in early 2020.New preclinical data presented at ASH showed that FT596 administered as a monotherapy exhibited durable tumor clearance and extended survival in vivo similar to primary CAR T cells in a humanized mouse model of CD19+ lymphoma. Additionally, when combined with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab, FT596 showed enhanced killing of CD20+ lymphoma cells in vivo as compared to rituximab alone. These data confirm previously presented in vitro findings that demonstrate the unique multi-antigen targeting functionality of FT596, and the product candidate's potential to effectively overcome CD19 antigen escape.The Company also announced that, in preparation for Phase 1 initiation, it had recently completed GMP production of FT596. In a single small-scale manufacturing campaign, the Company produced over 300 cryopreserved, infusion-ready doses of FT596 at a cost of approximately $2,500 per dose. The Company's iPSC product platform unites stem cell biology and precision genetic engineering to create renewable master engineered iPSC lines that can be repeatedly used to mass produce cancer-fighting immune cells, replacing the high production costs, weeks of manufacturing time, and complex manufacturing processes required for current-generation CAR T-cell immunotherapies with a lower-cost, easier-to-manufacture, well-characterized, off-the-shelf product that has the potential to reach many more patients.06:27SGMO Sangamo Therapeutics and Pfizer (PFE) report updated Phase 1/2 results showing sustained increased Factor VIII activity through 44 weeks (11.66 )Sangamo Therapeutics (SGMO) and Pfizer (PFE) announced updated follow-up results from the Phase 1/2 Alta study evaluating investigational SB-525 gene therapy in patients with severe hemophilia A. The data showed that SB-525 was generally well tolerated and demonstrated sustained increased Factor VIII (FVIII) levels following treatment with SB-525 through to 44 weeks, the extent of follow-up for the longest treated patient in the 3e13 vg/kg dose cohort.06:27KURA Kura Oncology provides clinical and regulatory updates for lead drug candidate, tipifarnib, in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (15.61 )In June 2019, Kura reported that the primary efficacy endpoint was achieved in each of the expansion cohorts in its Phase 2 trial of tipifarnib in relapsed or refractory PTCL: 1) patients with AITL, an aggressive form of T-cell lymphoma often characterized by high levels of CXCL12 expression, and 2) patients with PTCL who lack a single nucleotide variation in the 3'-untranslated region of the CXCL12 gene. Given the high level of activity observed among AITL patients, Kura continued to enroll patients to acquire more experience regarding safety and tolerability in this population. Based upon the 2016 revision of the World Health Organization classification of lymphoid neoplasms1, AITL and AITL-like histologies represent approximately one-third of all PTCL cases.As of the November 11, 2019 data cutoff date, a total of 26 patients with relapsed or refractory AITL were enrolled in all stages of the trial. Among the 20 patients evaluable for efficacy, five achieved a complete response (CR) and five achieved a partial response (PR), for an objective response rate (ORR) of 50% on an evaluable basis and 38% on an intent-to-treat basis. In addition, three patients experienced disease stabilization. Patients had a median of three prior regimens (range 1-7).Next-generation sequencing of 19 available patient biopsies showed that 10 (53%) carried C336R/Q386E variants in the killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) 3DL2, an immune checkpoint receptor. Four of the 10 patients with KIR3DL2 variants achieved a CR and three achieved a PR, for a CR rate of 40% and an ORR of 70%. This compares to a CR rate of 11% and an ORR of 22% among the nine AITL patients with KIR3DL2 wild type.Regulatory Update: Following FDA feedback from an end-of-Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting, Kura plans to initiate a Phase 2 registration-directed trial of tipifarnib in patients with relapsed or refractory AITL and related lymphomas in 2020. The multi-center, single-arm trial will target enrollment of 128 patients with AITL and AITL-like histologies who are relapsed or refractory to at least one prior systemic cytotoxic therapy.06:26PTLA Portola Pharma presents new interim results from ongoing Phase 2a study of cerdulatinib in patients with specific subtypes of T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (29.21 )As of the November 12, 2019 cut-off date, 64 PTCL patients and 40 CTCL patients treated with cerdulatinib as a single agent were evaluable for response. The overall response rate (ORR) was 34% in the PTCL cohort and 43% in the CTCL cohort. Among the subset of patients in the PTCL cohort with AITL, the ORR was 52% and the complete response rate (CR) was 37%.Among the 64 patients in the PTCL cohort, 14 patients (22%) achieved a CR and eight patients (12%) achieved a partial response (PR). In the subgroup of 27 patients with AITL, 10 patients (37%) achieved a CR, and four patients (15%) achieved a PR. The median duration of response is eight months for all PTCL patients and is greater than nine months in AITL patients. Follow-up is ongoing. Among the 40 patients in the CTCL cohort, three patients (8%) achieved a CR and 14 patients (35%) achieved a PR. Importantly, rapid improvements in pruritus, or severe itching -- a common and often serious condition associated with CTCL -- have been observed, as measured by the Likert scale.Cerdulatinib demonstrated good tolerability in both PTCL and CTCL. The most common Grade 3 or greater adverse events across the PTCL and CTCL cohorts with a frequency > 5% were lipase increase (25%), amylase increase (19%), neutropenia (12%), anemia (10%), diarrhea (8%), sepsis/bacteremia (6%), and febrile neutropenia (4%). The lipase and amylase changes were generally asymptomatic and not associated with pancreatitis.06:25XENE Xenon Pharmaceuticals provides updates on partnered neurology pipeline programs (13.95 )Xenon Pharmaceuticals announced that it will provide updates on its partnered epilepsy programs at the American Epilepsy Society Annual Meeting.Overview of clinical stage XEN901 and Related Patient Survey to be Presented in the "Genetic Epilepsies -- Updates in the Science and Diagnosis" on December 8thPre-clinical work suggests selective sodium channel inhibitors that reduce action potential firing in excitatory neurons, while sparing inhibitory interneurons, may provide promising drug profile06:25IMV IMV presents updated results from SPiReL at ASH (2.83 )The poster, which included additional data collected between the abstract submission and the presentation, continued to demonstrate a favorable therapeutic profile and treatment-associated clinical benefit in r/r DLBCL patients who received the DPX-Survivac combination regimen.06:24QURE uniQure presents updated clinical data on three patients treated in ongoing Phase IIb study of etranacogene dezaparvovec; additionally presents up to 4 years of follow-up data on the 10 patients in the Phase I/II trial of AMT-060 (66.05 )At Least One Year of Stable, Therapeutic Levels of FIX Activity in Patients Treated with Etranacogene Dezaparvovec: Featured in a poster presentation at ASH, the 52 weeks of follow-up data show that all three patients have stabilized and sustained FIX activity at therapeutic levels after the one-time administration of etranacogene dezaparvovec. Mean FIX activity for the three patients at 52 weeks after administration was 41% of normal, with the first patient achieving FIX activity of 50% of normal, the second patient achieving FIX activity of 31% of normal and the third patient achieving FIX activity of 41% of normal. The second and third patients had previously screen-failed and were excluded from another gene therapy study due to pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to a different AAV vector. Reported FIX activity was measured using an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay performed at a central laboratory.At one year after dosing, no patient in the study has reported any bleeding events. All patients have remained free of prophylaxis after receiving etranacogene dezaparvovec. One patient, who had earlier in the study undergone hip surgery due to a pre-existing condition, experienced back pain and treated himself with a single infusion of factor replacement, which was later determined by the patient and the investigator to be unrelated to a bleed. No other FIX infusions were reported by any patient.Stable FIX Expression and Durable Reductions in Bleeding and FIX Consumption for up to 4 Years Following AMT-060 Gene Therapy:In the ongoing Phase I/II study of AMT-060, all 10 patients continue to show long-term clinical benefit, including sustained increases in FIX activity, reduced usage of FIX replacement therapy, and decreased bleeding frequency. At up to 4 years of follow-up, AMT-060 continues to be well-tolerated, with no new serious adverse events and no development of inhibitors since the last reported data.All five patients in the second dose cohort of 2x1013 gc/kg (the dose being studied in the ongoing Phase III HOPE-B study of etranacogene dezaparvovec) continue to be free of routine FIX replacement therapy at 3.5 years after treatment. Based on the six months of data collected during the fourth year of follow-up, the mean annualized bleeding rate was zero compared to an average of 4 bleeds during the year prior to treatment, representing a 100% reduction. During this same period, the usage of FIX replacement therapy also declined 100% compared to the year prior to treatment. Mean FIX activity over 3.5 years was 7.5%.06:22FATE Fate Therapeutics reports clinical data from Landmark Phase 1 studies; No dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients (13.67 )Fate Therapeutics announced initial clinical data for its FT516 and FT500 off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived natural killer (NK) cell product candidates.No morphologic evidence of leukemia and complete neutrophil recovery observed in first patient treated with FT516 Monotherapy for AML following first dosing cycleNo dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients treated with FT500 for advanced solid tumorsFavorable FT500 Phase 1 Safety, Tolerability and Immunogenicity profile validates novel multi-dose treatment paradigm for off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived NK cell products.06:22BMY Bristol-Myers presents data from multiple studies evaluating lisocabtagene maraleucel at ASH (59.95 )These studies included an evaluation of liso-cel in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) (TRANSCEND CLL 004); a study in second-line patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients who were ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) (PILOT); and a separate analysis of patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma who received liso-cel in the outpatient setting across three studies."The results in relapsed or refractory CLL and SLL demonstrated a high rate of durable complete responses achieved in heavily pre-treated patients, including patients who have failed ibrutinib and venetoclax. We are encouraged by the potential of liso-cel to treat second-line relapsed or refractory large B-cell NHL patients who are not able to undergo a stem cell transplant. Finally, the analysis evaluating liso-cel administered in the outpatient setting demonstrates that not all patients require hospitalization and that the safety and efficacy profile across a variety of types of clinical sites is consistent."06:20LLY Eli Lilly presents interim clinical data from the LOXO-305 global Phase 1/2 BRUIN dose escalation trial (119.64 )At all doses studied, LOXO-305 delivered objective responses in patients who had received diverse prior therapies and had exhibited varied molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance.Of 16 CLL patients enrolled, there were 10 responders (8 partial responses, 2 partial response with ongoing lymphocytosis) among 13 patients eligible for response assessment, resulting in a 77% ORR. All patients with CLL have demonstrated tumor reduction, with evidence of deepening response over time. Responses were observed in patients with acquired resistance to prior BTK therapy (those with and without C481S mutations), in patients who were intolerant to prior BTK therapy, and in patients with acquired resistance to prior BCL2 therapy (including one with a known BCL G101V mutation). As expected, LOXO-305 treatment causes acute lymphocytosis, which resolves over time-a well described pharmacodynamic response associated with effective BTK inhibition. Of the three CLL patients not yet eligible for response assessment (one with the BTK C481S mutation), all three have demonstrated lymphocytosis early in cycle 1. All CLL responding patients remain in response and all CLL patients remain on study. Of eight MCL patients enrolled, there were three responses (1 complete response, 2 partial responses) among six patients eligible for response assessment, resulting in a 50% ORR. Two of the responders had progressed on prior BTK therapy (but without a documented C481x mutation). All MCL responding patients remain in response and on study. Three MCL patients discontinued therapy in cycle 1 due to progressive disease.Most treatment-emergent adverse events were Grade 1 in severity with the most commonly reported events, regardless of attribution, being fatigue (25% total: 21% Grade 1, 4% Grade 2) and diarrhea (18% total: 14% Grade 1, 4% Grade 2). Two adverse events =Grade 3 were attributed to LOXO-305 (Grade 3 leukocytosis and Grade 3 transient neutropenia). No dose limiting toxicities were reported and an MTD had not been reached.06:19AZN AstraZeneca reports full results from Phase III ELEVATE TN trial (47.68 )AstraZeneca presented results from the interim analysis of the Phase III ELEVATE TN trial, showing that CALQUENCE (acalabrutinib) combined with obinutuzumab or as monotherapy significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab, a standard chemo-immunotherapy treatment, in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemiaIn an exploratory analysis, CALQUENCE in combination or alone demonstrated consistent PFS improvements across most pre-specified subgroups of patients with high-risk disease characteristics, including the unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable gene (IGHV), del(11q) and complex karyotype. Overall, the safety and tolerability profile of CALQUENCE observed in the ELEVATE TN trial was consistent with its known profile.06:19BGNE BeiGene presents clinical data from three trials of its BTK inhibitor BRUKINSA at ASH (186.92 )In two oral presentations of BRUKINSA in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), the drug candidate demonstrated consistent safety and a high overall response rate (ORR); in the poster presentation of BRUKINSA combined with BeiGene's investigational anti-PD-1 antibody tislelizumab in patients with previously treated B-cell malignancies, the combination treatment showed preliminary efficacy and was generally well tolerated."The results presented today on BRUKINSA, a BTK inhibitor designed to maximize target occupancy and minimize off-target binding, demonstrated robust clinical activity and a safety profile consistent with what we've observed to date in our clinical trials, including safety data that supported the recent U.S. FDA accelerated approval in patients with previously treated mantle cell lymphoma," said Jane Huang, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, hematology at BeiGene. "CLL or SLL is the most common type of leukemia in adults, and despite the advancements of BTK inhibitor therapy for these cancers, there remains a need for highly selective BTK inhibitors capable of promoting long-term responses, and with a safety profile that is tolerable over time. The results presented here today further demonstrate the potential for BRUKINSA to help people living with these persistent, life-threatening cancers."06:18RCKT Rocket Pharmaceuticals presents 'encouraging' preliminary results from its Phase 1 trial of commercial-grade RP-L102 'Process B' for Fanconi Anemia (22.37 )Results presented in the poster highlight preliminary Phase 1 data from two pediatric patients (age 5 and 6 years) who were treated with "Process B" RP-L102 prior to the development of severe bone marrow failure and are in ongoing follow-up. Drug product was successfully manufactured using "Process B" optimization, including transduction enhancers, commercial-grade vector and modified cell processing. "Process B" drug product is manufactured to commercial grade standards, allowing for consistent drug product across patients and a vector copy number (VCN) two to three fold higher than that administered to optimally-treated "Process A" patients.Once transduced, drug product was infused fresh into patients without any prior conditioning regimen. To evaluate transduction efficiency, an analysis of the proportion of the MMC-resistant colony forming cells (CFC's) was conducted. Both patients exhibited early signs of engraftment based on peripheral blood, VCN and/or MMC-resistance. Preliminary phenotypic correction was also apparent in both patients, as evidenced by stabilization or increases in blood cell lineages. No safety or tolerability issues have been reported.06:18ABBV AbbVie reports new results from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE clinical trial showing the potential of this fixed-duration combination therapy (86.98 )AbbVie announced new data from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE (PCYC-1142) clinical trial,1 evaluating IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) in combination with VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO (venetoclax) in previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Results showed that patients who received up to 12 cycles of the combination regimen achieved high rates of undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD) in both peripheral blood (PB; 75 percent of patients) and in bone marrow (BM; 72 percent of patients). Safety data were consistent with the known safety profiles of IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO used as individual therapies.Results showed uMRD -- defined as less than 1 CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes (MRD<0.01 percent) by flow cytometry of PB or BM samples -- was achieved at any time after baseline in PB for 75 percent of patients (122 of 163 patients) and in BM for 72 percent (111 of 155 patients). The proportion of patients who had uMRD in PB increased over time from 57 percent after 6 cycles, 68 percent after 9 cycles, and 73 percent after 12 cycles of IMBRUVICA plus VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO. The high rates of uMRD in BM were consistent across high-risk subgroups, including in patients with del(17p), del(17p) or TP53 mutation, del(11q), complex karyotype, and unmutated IGHV status. In patients with uMRD in PB with matched BM samples, 93 percent of patients had uMRD in both PB and BM. With median follow-up of 14.7 months, 3 patients (2 percent) experienced disease progression.06:17OBSV ObsEva reports positive Phase 3 trial results from PRIMROSE 2 trial of linzagolix for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids (4.57 )The responder rate was 93.9% (p < 0.001) for women receiving 200 mg with ABT and 56.7% for women receiving 100 mg without ABT (p < 0.001), compared to 29.4% in the placebo group. Both doses achieved significant rates of amenorrhea (p < 0.001), reduction in pain (p < 0.001), and improvement in quality of life (p < 0.001). Additionally, significant improvement (p < 0.001) in hemoglobin levels, a reduction in number of days of bleeding and reduction in uterine volume were observed. Furthermore, a significant reduction in fibroid volume was also observed for the 200 mg dose with ABT (p < 0.008).The overall safety profile was in line with expectations and confirmed that linzagolix was well-tolerated. The most frequently observed adverse events (occurring in > 5% of patients) were headache, hot flushes, and anemia. Mean percentage change from baseline in BMD was consistent with previous clinical data."We look forward to the results from our second pivotal study, PRIMROSE 1 conducted in the US, in Q2 2020. Assuming positive results, we expect that it would lead to a Marketing Authorization Application submission with the European Medicines Agency by year-end 2020 and a New Drug Application submission with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by Q1 2021."06:16THOR Synthorx to be acquired by Sanofi (SNY) for $68/share in cash (25.03 )Under the terms of the merger agreement, Sanofi will commence a cash tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Synthorx common stock for $68 per share in cash for a total enterprise value of approximately $2.35 billion.

While the DOJ and SEC conduct separate investigations, the same facts have been shared by Ericsson with both authorities. The resolution relates to historical FCPA breaches ending Q1 2017. While the Company had a compliance program and a supporting control framework, they were not adequately implemented. Specifically, certain employees in some markets, some of whom were executives in those markets, acted in bad faith and knowingly failed to implement sufficient controls. They were able to enter into transactions for illegitimate purposes and, together with people under their influence, used sophisticated schemes in order to hide their wrongdoing.Separately, Ericsson agreed to resolve civil charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) relating to allegations of violations of the bribery and accounting provisions of the FCPA. Ericsson agreed to the entry of a judgment enjoining it from future violations of the FCPA and it agreed to pay a financial sanction of $458,380,000, plus pre-judgment interest of $81,540,000.As part of the settlement, Ericsson has agreed to engage an independent compliance monitor for a period of three years while the Company continues to undertake significant reforms to strengthen its Ethics & Compliance program.The combined payment of $1.06 b.

This may just be the calm before the storm considering all the macro-related events set to take place as the week unfolds. S&P Futures saw a relative quiet beginning with only a nine point overnight range. The market is currently trading around the 3144 area, with a high of 3148.50 and a low of 3139.50. In Asia, both China and Japan finished the day marginally higher. The Shanghai struggled to gain much following lighter than expected export data that saw a 1.1% fall in November, compared to a forecast of +0.8%.The Nikkei traded around in a narrow range that culminated with a gain of 0.3%. Heavyweights such as Softbank and Sony both gained more than 1% by day's end. European markets slightly under water. The weaker than expected Export data out of China has likely kept the EU markets in check. Energy names are seeing modest weakness with Crude Oil giving back about 1% in early action.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: -2.010 yr Note: 1.82%USD/JPY: 108.49 -0.07EUR/USD: 1.1067 +0.0007Europe: FTSE -0.2% DAX 0.0% CAC -0.2%Asia: Hang Seng 0.0% Shanghai +0.1% Nikkei +0.3%Gold (1467.40 +2.30) Silver (16.65 +0.05) Crude (58.63 -0.57)17:34WRAPX This week's biggest % gainers/losersThe following are this week's top percentage gainers and losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).This week's top % gainers Healthcare: BOLD (59.25 +104.1%), AUPH (15.44 +94.46%), THOR (25.03 +39.83%), LXRX (4.87 +37.96%), RUBY (10.62 +37.92%), RCKT (22.37 +27.15%), ALLK (117.36 +23.54%), PDCO (23.51 +20.81%)Consumer Discretionary: EXPR (5.49 +39.69%), GCO (48.82 +31.45%), LE (15.05 +27.76%), BIG (25.21 +20.62%)Information Technology: SCWX (15.11 +33.25%), GTT (11.3 +27.4%), DOMO (23.39 +24.41%), DQ (45.71 +20.04%)Financials: EZPW (6.19 +20.9%)Utilities: PCG (9.65 +29.36%)This week's top % losers Healthcare: SAGE (64.46 -58.35%), CLVS (9.61 -35.63%), CARA (16.76 -35.51%), PBYI (7.88 -16.97%), TGTX (7.12 -13.06%), FATE (13.67 -12.48%)Industrials: BE (5.28 -19.02%), EAF (12.29 -12.78%)Consumer Discretionary: HOME (5.67 -33.92%), MIK (6.69 -18.22%), CHS (4.03 -15.51%)Information Technology: ESTC (63.84 -19.61%), PAGS (28.82 -15.09%), MDB (131.17 -11.79%)Utilities: JE (2.1 -22.79%)16:37ALEC Alector presents Phase 1 data on AL002 (19.76 +0.37)Alector today reported safety and biomarker data from the single ascending dose (SAD) phase of the INVOKE Phase 1 study of its product candidate, AL002, in healthy volunteers. AL002 is a monoclonal antibody intended to enhance the activity of TREM2 and is being developed by Alector for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in collaboration with its partner AbbVie (ABBV). The data were presented today at the 12th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) meeting. The AL002 presentation at CTAD showcases the first data in humans showing that a TREM2 activating antibody engages its target and demonstrates downstream activity in the CNS. The data reported today are from the study's SAD phase in 56 healthy adults, who were enrolled into nine escalating dose cohorts. AL002 was found to be generally safe and well-tolerated. AL002 reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) soluble TREM2 in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating proof-of-target engagement in the brain. AL002 elevated a biomarker for microglia activity in the CSF, indicating proof-of-mechanism. The Phase 1b portion of the study in Alzheimer's disease patients is on-going. Alector expects to initiate the AL002 Phase 2, proof-of-concept study in 202016:31PNM PNM Resources increases quarterly stock dividend to $0.3075/share from $0.29/share (48.78 -0.05)16:22SCANX Market Internals -Technical-DOW closes up at 28015 (+1.22%).

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD16:19WTRE Watford Holdings agrees to purchase Axeria IARD; terms not disclosed (26.47 +0.25)Axeria IARD is a property and casualty insurance company based in France.

Ninety-four percent of patients were refractory to an anti-CD38 antibody and 84% percent were triple refractory (refractory to an IMiD agent, PI and anti-CD38 antibody). Results for the primary endpoint (overall response rate [ORR]) and key secondary endpoint (complete response rate [CR]), as well as duration of response (DoR) and progression-free survival (PFS) across the target dose levels and at each of the three target doses explored in the study are presented in the table below. The median follow-up duration for all subjects was 11.3 months.Overall, the safety results were consistent with those observed in the phase 1 CRB-401 study, which evaluated the preliminary safety and efficacy of ide-cel. Instances of grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in 5.5% (7/128) of patients, including one fatal CRS event. Investigator identified grade 3 or higher neurotoxicity events (iiNT) occurred in 3.1% (4/128) of patients and there were no Grade 4 iiNT events reported. Grade 3 or higher CRS and iiNT events were reported in <6% of subjects at each target dose. CRS of any grade occurred in 83.6% (107/128) of patients and iiNT of any grade occurred in 18% (23/128) of patients.

It is the Company's intention to resume the Advantage Loan program as soon as management is confident its stated policies and procedures are being followed. However, it is presently difficult to estimate how long this suspension might last.The Advantage Loan program is a material component of the Bank's total loan originations. While it is difficult to quantify the financial impact of the program's temporary suspension, management anticipates a reduced level of near-term loan originations, slower overall loan portfolio growth, and less loan sales. However, management does not anticipate any credit related issues from previous loans made under the program due to the substantial amount of equity required for each borrower and the resulting strong collateral package for each loan. In order to mitigate the operational and financial impact of the Advantage Loan program's temporary suspension, the Company will continue to work on initiatives to diversify its overall loan production. Such initiatives include expanding the Bank's commercial lending efforts, including multifamily, tenant-in-common, construction, and commercial and industrial loans. In addition, management will continue to review new residential loan products that meet the needs of its customers in its served markets.08:13SCANX Gapping downGapping downIn reaction to disappointing earnings/guidance:THO -4.1%M&A news:DPLO -31.7% (to be acquired by UnitedHealth's (UNH) OptumRx for $4.00/share in cash)Other news:KALV -17.7% (announced results of the Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the use of KVD001) MNRL -4.4% (commences 11 mln common stock offering; 6 mln by the co and 5 mln by the selling stockholders) SYNH -3% (approves expansion and extension of the Company's existing stock repurchase program) AUPH -2.8% (commences registered underwritten public offering of $150 mln of its common shares) ERIC -0.7% (reaches resolution on US FCPA Investigations; combined payment of $1.06 bln) LITE -0.5% (to offer $850 mln aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2026)Analyst comments:M -2.1% (downgraded to Sell at Goldman)MMM -1.3% (downgraded to Neutral at Citigroup)ORLY -1.3% (downgraded to Neutral from Buy at Goldman)08:12APEI American Public Education Board authorizes program to repurchase up to an additional $25 mln of shares of the Company's common stock (25.12 )08:10SCANX Gapping upGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:N/A.M&A news:THOR +168.5% (to be acquired by Sanofi (SNY) for $68/share in cash) XBIT +136.1% (to divest Human antibody Bermekimab targeting IL-1a to Janssen) ARQL +100.6% (to be acquired by Merck (MRK) for $20 per share in cash for an approximate total equity value of $2.7 billion) RRTS +10.9% (announces the sale of its Flatbed business unit for $30 mln in cash)Other news:FATE +25.1% (reports clinical data from Landmark Phase 1 studies; no dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients; also presents new in vivo preclinical data for FT596 -- company plans to initiate enrollment of first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in rarly 2020) OBSV +22.1% (reports positive Phase 3 trial results from PRIMROSE 2 trial of linzagolix) TGTX +22.1% (presents triple therapy data from Phase I/II study of ublituximab in combination with umbralisib and venetoclax) PCG +21% (reaches agreement to resolve wildfires from 2017 and 2018) CRTX +14% (reports new data revealing link between bacterial pathogen and genetic risk for Alzheimer's Disease) AGIO +12.4% (announces that clinical proof-of-concept has been established based on preliminary analysis of Phase 2 trial of mitapivat in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia) DTIL +9.4% (announces updated interim clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1 trial of its lead investigational off-the-shelf chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy candidate, PBCAR0191) RCKT +7.3% (presents "encouraging" preliminary results from its Phase 1 trial of commercial-grade RP-L102 "Process B" for Fanconi Anemia) ALEC +6.8% (presents Phase 1 data on AL002) SGMO +5.5% (Sangamo Therapeutics and Pfizer (PFE) report updated Phase 1/2 results showing sustained increased Factor VIII activity through 44 weeks) KPTI +5.3% (reports new and updated XPOVIO data demonstrating 56% overall response) BLUE +5% (Bluebirdbio and Bristol-Myers (BMY) report "positive" top-line results from Ph 2 KarMMa study of ide-cel; met its primary endpoint and key secondary endpoint) APTO +3.9% (reports early clinical observations with CG-806 and APTO-253) CGC +3.3% (names David Klein CEO effective January 14) AM +2.9% (to repurchase $100 mln of shares from Antero Resources) CSIQ +2.8% (authorizes $150 mln share repurchase program) BMY +2.3% (presents data from multiple studies evaluating lisocabtagene maraleucel at ASH) MNK +2.1% (presents data on a novel predictive model to identify infants at risk for infantile spasms) SESN +1.7% (initiated the submission of its BLA for Vicinium for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer under Rolling Review to the FDA)MBIO +1.3% (highlights presentation of updated Phase 1/2 clinical data for MB-107 lentiviral gene therapy for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency)Analyst comments:QRVO +3.4% (upgraded to Buy from Underperform at BofA/Merrill)SWKS +2.2% (upgraded to Buy from Underpeform at BofA/Merrill)NUE +1.4% (upgraded to Buy at Longbow)STLD +1.1% (upgraded to Buy at Longbow)08:10BONDX Overnight Treasury Market SummaryRebound in ProgressU.S. Treasuries will attempt to snap their three-day skid after Treasury futures inched higher during a quiet overnight session.

Weiss, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are highly encouraged by the first clinical data presented from our once daily, BTK inhibitor, TG-1701, which has demonstrated superior selectivity for BTK compared to ibrutinib in an in vitro whole kinome screening. The data presented today show that TG-1701 is an active BTK inhibitor as a single agent and that the combination of U2 plus TG-1701 has been generally well tolerated and active with 6 of 7 patients responding to the triple therapy at 100 mg QD, the lowest dose of TG-1701 tested. We look forward to continuing dose escalation of TG-1701 in the combination arm and identifying the optimal dose for this therapy." Mr. Weiss continued, "Our goal has always been to develop the best possible combination treatment options for patients, and we are excited to present the first data from a triple combination study in which all of the agents are being developed by TG. We believe this proprietary combination has the potential to enhance the results of BTK inhibitor therapy alone and offer patients early and deep responses with a tolerable safety profile."08:02GALT Galectin Therapeutics announces publication of results from its NASH-CX Phase 2 clinical trial in NASH cirrhosis in the peer-reviewed journal Gastroenterology (2.99 )The paper outlines that in a phase 2b study of 162 patients with NASH, cirrhosis, and portal hypertension, one year of biweekly infusion of belapectin was safe but not associated with significant reduction in HVPG or fibrosis, compared with placebo. However, in a subgroup analysis of patients without esophageal varices, 2 mg/kg belapectin (GR-MD-02) did reduce HVPG and development of varices. This subgroup analysis suggests that there may be benefits from belapectin in patients with NASH cirrhosis without esophageal varices. Further, if this observation can be reproduced in subsequent studies, belapectin may have a role in the management of patients with NASH cirrhosis and portal hypertension but no varices.08:01REPL Replimune names Jean M.

This was comparable to historical data with multiple doses of busulfan conditioning.CD117-ADC was well tolerated in non-human primates with no evidence of the often severe side effects seen with busulfan conditioning, including veno-occlusive disease, weight loss, diarrhea, mucositis, vomiting, pulmonary fibrosis or seizures.07:42TPX Tempur Sealy Int'l determines that it will record a charge of $30 mln (before tax) in Q4 in connection with the bankruptcy of one of its customers (85.89 )On December 6, 2019, Tempur Sealy determined that it will record a charge of $30 million (before tax) in the fourth quarter of 2019, in connection with the bankruptcy of one of its customers, Mattress PAL Holding, LLC ("Mattress PAL"), and the resulting significant liquidity issues of Mattress PAL's affiliates (collectively, "Mattress1One"). On April 7, 2019, Mattress PAL filed a voluntary petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division ("Bankruptcy Court") seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code ("Chapter 11 Proceedings"). On December 5, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court orally granted Mattress PAL's request to convert the Chapter 11 Proceedings to a Chapter 7 liquidation case. The Company plans to treat this charge, which does not involve any cash payments, as an adjustment in calculating adjusted EBITDA under the Company's senior secured credit agreement. Mattress1One represented less than 1% of the Company's global net sales in 2019, and the Company does not expect this charge, or the loss of Mattress1One as a customer, to have a material impact on the Company's 2019 guidance, 2020 outlook, or current or future liquidity.07:37IEP Icahn Enterprises commences private placement of Senior Notes due 2027 (61.61 )The proceeds from the offering will be used for general limited partnership purposes.07:35MBIO Mustang Bio highlights presentation of updated Phase 1/2 clinical data for MB-107 lentiviral gene therapy for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (3.85 )Lentiviral Gene Therapy with Low Dose Busulfan for Infants with X-SCID Results in the Development of a Functional Normal Immune System: Interim Results of an Ongoing Phase I/II Clinical Study Lentiviral gene therapy using low dose busulfan conditioning has been well tolerated, with no serious adverse events other than hematologic related to busulfanAll 11 patients had robust hematopoietic recovery within 3-4 weeks post cell infusion without blood product support Nine patients, with a follow up of greater than 3 months, achieved normal-for-age T-cell and natural killer (NK)-cell numbers within 3-4 months post gene therapy Five patients are off intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy thus far, of whom 3 responded to vaccines Median vector copy number (VCN) at 12 months post-gene therapy in seven patients, who have been followed for more than 12 months, was 2.25 VCN/cell (range: 1.24-3.03) in T cells, 0.34 VCN/cell (range: 0.23-1.25) in B cells, 1.55 VCN/cell (range 1.27-3.39) in NK cells, and 0.08 VCN/cell (range: 0.03-0.76) in myeloid cells in peripheral blood, and 0.10 (range: 0.05-0.66) in CD34+ bone marrow cells, respectivelyEnhanced Transduction Lentivector Gene Therapy for Treatment of Older Patients with X-Linked Severe Combined ImmunodeficiencyEarly outcome data for five older children and young adults with XSCID who received the lentivector (also known as lentiviral) gene therapy as salvage therapy after having previously received haplo-identical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as infants without chemotherapy-based conditioning were previously reported and published in Science Translational Medicine. By 2016, three additional patients were treated, and the cohort of eight patients (referred to as Cohort A) has now been followed for 3 to 7 years. Among Cohort A, gradual clinical benefit in the clearance of chronic norovirus and associated improved abdominal complaints, malabsorption, growth and IgG production were observed, and four patients were able to cease immunoglobulin replacement therapy.While the results were positive, the relatively inefficient transduction of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) required large quantities of vector. This resulted in relatively low VCN in myeloid cells in some patients, with delayed immune cell recovery and persistent clinical disease, especially in the last patient treated (patient 8). To address this, NIH developed a refined enhanced transduction (ET) procedure consisting of a single overnight transduction after 48 hours pre-stimulation in cytokines (Stem cell factor, Thrombopoietin, Flt3-ligand; 100ng/mL) and incorporated transduction enhancers LentiBoost 1:100 and dimethyl prostaglandin 2 (dmPGE2; 1uM).The presentation at the 2019 ASH Annual Meeting included data from six patients (referred to as Cohort B) treated by NIH, including re-treatment of patient 8. The patients, who were aged 12 to 36, had significant problems with donor T cell infiltration of liver, bone marrow and kidneys, and were nearly absent of B and NK cells. The enhanced transduction procedure achieved much greater transduction efficiencies than were observed in Cohort A, with greater than 10-fold less vector, and resulted in faster immune reconstitution and more significant clinical benefit by 3 months.07:33AR Antero Resources highlights agreements expected to reduce its gathering, processing and transportation costs by approximately $350 mln over the next four years, commences asset sale program targeting $750 mln to $1 bln in proceeds to be completed in 2020 (2.19 )The agreements include a growth incentive fee program with Antero Midstream Corporation (AM) that aligns with the Company's current 8% to 10% compound annual production growth plan through 2021 and additional agreements with other third party midstream providers.

All response-evaluable patients experienced tumor reduction (complete response + partial response + stable disease) following treatment with ADCETRIS in combination with OPDIVO. Median duration of response was not yet reached and the maximum duration of response was 22 months and ongoing (95% CI: 7.06, -). The most common treatment-related adverse events of any grade occurring in at least 20 percent of patients were fatigue, diarrhea, pyrexia, infusion related reaction, peripheral motor neuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy and increase in lipase. One treatment-related serious adverse event was pyrexia. Fifty-seven percent of patients (12/21) had at least one treatment-related adverse event greater than or equal to Grade 3, most commonly increase in lipase (24 percent, 5/21), peripheral motor neuropathy and peripheral sensory neuropathy (each 14 percent, 3/21), and fatigue and hyponatremia (each 10 percent, 2/21). Two-Year Follow-up Results from the Phase 1-2 Study of Brentuximab Vedotin in Combination with Nivolumab in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (Abstract #238, oral presentation at 2:45 p.m. ET on Saturday, December 7, 2019) Of the 91 treated patients, 85 percent (77/91) had an objective response, including 67 percent (61/91) with a complete response, 16 patients with a partial response and six patients had stable disease. Of the 91 treated patients, 67 patients received an ASCT per trial protocol with no additional salvage therapy. For all treated patients, the two-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 79 percent (95% CI: 68%, 87%). For the 67 patients who received an ASCT per trial protocol, the two-year PFS was 92 percent (95% CI: 80%, 97%). Median follow-up for all treated patients was 24.2 months (range 1.8-41.7) and the median PFS was not reached. Estimated overall survival at two years was 94 percent (95% CI: 85%, 97%) and median overall survival was not yet reached. Peripheral immune signatures were consistent with an activated T-cell response. Prior to ASCT, the most common adverse events of any grade occurring in more than 20 percent of patients were nausea, infusion related reaction, fatigue, diarrhea, pruritus, headache, vomiting and pyrexia. Other adverse events included peripheral neuropathy in 16 patients (18 percent) and neutropenia in six patients (7 percent). Two patients (2 percent) discontinued treatment due to adverse events, Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy and increased gamma-glutamyltransferase. Serious adverse events occurred in 14 patients (15 percent), including pneumonia, pneumonitis and pyrexia (two patients each); and Grade 3 Guillain-Barre syndrome (one patient).06:52GILD Gilead Sciences reports Long-term data from ZUMA-1 demonstrating about half of refractory large b-cell lymphoma patients were alive three years after Yescarta treatment (67.08 )Co announced new data from the ZUMA-1 trial of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) in adult patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma. These results included updated overall survival data from the pivotal phase 2 study after three years following a single infusion of Yescarta, as well as an analysis from a separate safety management cohort of patients receiving early steroid intervention for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events. Updated results from a separate ZUMA-1 safety management study (Cohort 4) were also presented at the meeting (Abstract #243). In this analysis, patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma treated with Yescarta received earlier steroid intervention, beginning when patients experienced Grade 1 neurologic events or experienced Grade 1 CRS with no improvement after three days of supportive care. Patients could receive optional bridging chemotherapy prior to Yescarta infusion. In the analysis, 41 patients had received Yescarta, with a median follow-up of 8.7 months; 73% of patients received corticosteroids and 76% received tocilizumab. Earlier steroid use appeared to decrease the percentage of patients with Grade > or =3 CRS (2%) and neurologic events (17%), each of which were numerically lower than rates in the registrational cohorts of ZUMA-1 (13% CRS, 31% neurologic events). There were no Grade 4 or 5 CRS or neurologic events and no Grade 5 AEs related to Yescarta in Cohort 4. Objective response rate per investigator assessment was 73% in Cohort 4, with 51% of patients achieving a complete response. The median duration of response was 8.9 months. Fifty-four percent of patients in this cohort remained in an ongoing response with at least six months of follow-up after Yescarta infusion. Median OS in Cohort 4 has not been reached.06:51CRTX Cortexyme reports new data revealing link between bacterial pathogen and genetic risk for Alzheimer's Disease (28.31 )Co announced the presentation of new data supporting the on-target activity of COR388, its lead investigational medicine, and linking the "gingipain hypothesis" for Alzheimer's disease (AD) to the significance of the APOE gene as a major risk factor for the disease.Gingipains from P. gingivalis cleave ApoE proteins and have a preference for cleaving ApoE4; and COR388, a gingipain inhibitor, prevents this. In in vitro experiments, cells infected with P. gingivalis exhibited gingipain-dependent ApoE cleavage activity that generated ApoE fragments similar to what was seen in the brains and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, uninfected cells had no significant ApoE protein-cleaving activity. Furthermore, P. gingivalis gingipains cleaved ApoE4 more readily than ApoE3. Finally, in the infected cells, COR388 alone was sufficient to block ApoE fragmentation. In a Phase 1b trial, COR388 reduced ApoE fragments in CSF. Cortexyme's Phase 1 clinical development program for COR388 included cohorts of healthy volunteers and subjects with Alzheimer's disease. In addition to assessing safety and initial clinical activity, investigators also assessed the level of ApoE fragmentation in the CSF of nine subjects with Alzheimer's disease. Six subjects received 50mg of COR388 twice daily while three subjects received placebo. After 28 days, a statistically significant decrease in ApoE fragments (both ApoE4 and ApoE3) was observed in subjects treated with COR388 versus those treated with placebo.06:51EGRX Eagle Pharma commences dosing in pilot study for novel estrogen receptor antagonist product candidate (56.43 )The company has commenced dosing in a pilot clinical study to assess the unique characteristics of its fulvestrant product candidate, which has the potential to enhance estrogen receptor ("ER") inhibition and improve outcomes for patients with ER-positive breast cancer.

All results are as of the data cutoff date of August 26, 2019.Groups A and B:As of the data cutoff date, seven out of nine total patients in Groups A and B (five out of seven in Group A and two out of two in Group B) did not require regular RBC transfusions post-treatment. Overall, patients in Groups A and B experienced a reduction, but not complete elimination of VOC and ACS events at two years post-treatment, suggesting that the levels of gene therapy-derived hemoglobin may have been sufficient to reduce but not eliminate continued sickle-related disease manifestations. Group C As of the data cutoff date, 17 patients were treated with LentiGlobin for SCD in Group C, with the longest follow-up at 21 months; none required regular RBC transfusions post-treatment. In patients with six or more months of follow-up (n=12), median levels of gene therapy-derived anti-sickling hemoglobin, HbAT87Q, were at least 40% of total hemoglobin. Total hemoglobin and HbAT87Q levels ranged from 9.3 -- 15.2 g/dL and 2.7 -- 9.0 g/dL, respectively, at last visit. Treatment with LentiGlobin for SCD reduced key markers of hemolysis, including reticulocyte counts, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and total bilirubin concentration, which suggests that treatment is improving biological markers of the disease. Among the nine patients with at least six months of follow-up who had four or more VOC or ACS events in the two years prior to treatment, there was a 99% reduction in annualized rate of VOC and ACS. There were no reports of ACS or serious VOC at up to 21 months post-treatment in these patients. As previously reported, there was one non-serious Grade 2 VOC was observed in a patient approximately 3.5 months post-LentiGlobin for SCD treatment.HGB-206 Exploratory Assays bluebird bio presented results from exploratory assays in samples from a subset of patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD from Groups A, B and C, to assess the relationship between drug product characteristics and RBC physiology. To demonstrate the pancellular expression of the gene therapy derived anti-sickling Hb, HbAT87Q, bluebird bio developed an assay that enables detection of HbAT87Q and HbS protein in individual RBCs. In 12 patients who had at least six months of follow-up, the proportion of RBCs positive for HbAT87Q at the last study visit was more than 70% in all cases; with more than 90% of RBCs positive for HbAT87Q in four patients.On average, HbAT87Q present in RBCs of patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD was within the range of non-sickling adult Hb, HbA, present in the RBCs from people with sickle cell trait. The RBCs also resembled sickle cell trait RBCs with regard to propensity to sickle under low oxygen conditions. Sickling of RBCs from patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD was significantly less than that seen in untreated patients with SCD.06:49MNK Mallinckrodt plc presents data on a novel predictive model to identify infants at risk for infantile spasms (3.41 )Co announced findings on the use of a novel predictive model designed to more quickly identify infants with infantile spasms (IS), a rare seizure disorder that typically occurs between three and seven months of age. Key FindingsDeductive models developed to identify the combinations of variables that predict IS prior to diagnosis and during the treatment pathway: 557 patients had =2 symptoms pertaining to IS -- seizures, developmental delay, lack of eye contact and lack of muscle tone -- and a moderate or high severity ED visit.In this group, 55 percent of patients (n=304) had an IS diagnosis within a median 0.8 months of the triggering event. The most notable deductive combinations focused on pre-diagnosis of IS. MethodsThe study utilized data from the Symphony Health Integrated Dataverse database to identify triggers for early identification of IS patients from medical and pharmacy claims from 10.8 million patients under 2 years of age between May 2017 and April 2018. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) procedure codes were evaluated to identify the codes most likely to predict a subsequent diagnosis of IS. Researchers also used input from IS medical experts to determine the clinical, electrographic, radiologic, procedural and medication variables that may predict IS development.06:48SGMO Sangamo Therapeutics announces preliminary results from first three patients treated in Phase 1/2 THALES study evaluating investigational ST-400 ex vivo gene-edited cell therapy in transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (11.66 )The three patients treated with ST-400 experienced prompt hematopoietic reconstitution, demonstrating neutrophil engraftment in 14-22 days and platelet engraftment in 22-35 days (Table 1). No emerging clonal hematopoiesis has to date been observed by on-target indel pattern monitoring in the three treated patients. Reported adverse events (AEs) are consistent with the known toxicities of mobilization, apheresis, and myeloablative busulfan conditioning. One serious adverse event (SAE) related to ST-400 was reported. As previously disclosed, Patient 1 experienced hypersensitivity during ST-400 infusion considered by the investigator to be likely related to the product cryoprotectant excipient, DMSO, and which resolved by the end of the infusion.06:47LITE Lumentum to offer $850 mln aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2026 (72.08 )Lumentum intends to use approximately $196 million of the net proceeds of the offering to repay in full all amounts outstanding under its term loan credit facility, and a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to purchase up to approximately $200 million of its common stock concurrently with the pricing of this offering in privately negotiated transactions effected through the initial purchaser of the notes or its affiliates as its agent.

The results from the pharmacokinetic and occupancy studies for the first seven patients have been in-line with expectations. The Company anticipates that a dose that achieves maximum target occupancy will be achieved in the next one or two dose cohorts. CPI-818 has been shown to bind covalently to ITK at low nanomolar concentrations without reacting with other kinases. In vitro studies demonstrated selective cytotoxicity to Sezary cells (malignant cells from patients with CTCL), while sparing normal T-cells, in three subjects not enrolled in the study. Preclinical murine models of lymphoproliferative and autoimmune disease showed CPI-818 inhibited the development of lymph node and spleen enlargement by preventing proliferation of abnormal T-cells. Treatment with CPI-818 led to regression of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly in animals with established disease.06:32CGC Canopy Growth names David Klein CEO effective January 14 (18.65 )In his current role as executive vice president and chief financial officer at Constellation Brands, David oversees all aspects of the company's finance operations, all mergers and acquisitions, as well as the company's information technology function.The appointment of David Klein follows a thorough recruitment process overseen by a special Hiring Committee of the Board using global recruitment company Heidrick & Struggles, which saw a wide variety of exceptional candidates vetted and interviewed.

Fourteen patients were evaluable at one month.AUTO3 was well-tolerated, with no patients experiencing > or = Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with primary infusion and 1 of 14 experiencing Grade 3 neurotoxicity that resolved swiftly with steroids. There were no pembrolizumab immune-related toxicities and the majority of grade 3 or higher adverse events were hematological. Low levels of serum cytokines are consistent with the observed low levels of CRS and neurotoxicity. Across all tested doses 5 patients achieved a complete response, with 4 of 5 complete responses ongoing, the longest at 18 months. All CRs were achieved without need for steroid or tocilizumab-based management of the patients or ICU level care.AUTO3 -- (Poster) - Phase 1/2 AMELIA clinical trial of AUTO3 in patients with relapsed/refractory pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pALL) (Abstract # 2620)AUTO3 was well-tolerated overall, with no patients experiencing = Grade 3 CRS and no patients experiencing > or = Grade 2 neurotoxicity, in doses > or =3x106 /kg CAR-T cells. No AUTO3-related deaths were reported.Among the 10 CAR T-nave patients, at a median follow-up time of 9.7 months (range 1.8- 18), 9 of 10 patients (90%) achieved a complete response, and 8 of 10 (80%) achieved complete molecular remission by PCR. Estimated overall survival at 12 months was 100%. There are 2 ongoing patients in complete molecular remission at 12 and 15 months post-AUTO3 infusion, respectively. The most common cause of relapse was due to loss of CAR T-cell persistence. The median persistence of CAR-T cells in blood was 170 days.06:29STOK Stoke Therapeutics presents new preclinical data on STK-001 for the treatment of Dravet syndrome (28.98 )Data from studies in non-human primates (NHP) showed STK-001 distributed throughout the brain and achieved target engagement and increased Nav1.1 protein expression throughout the cortex after a single intrathecal injection. Safety findings showed STK-001 to be well-tolerated at the two intrathecal dose levels studied. These data were presented in a poster session at the American Epilepsy Society (AES) Annual Meeting in Baltimore.Stoke plans to submit an investigational new drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in early 2020 and, subject to acceptance of the IND, plans to initiate a Phase 1/2 single-ascending dose study in children and adolescents with Dravet syndrome in the first half of 2020.06:28FATE Fate Therapeutics presents new in vivo preclinical data for FT596 -- company plans to initiate enrollment of first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in rarly 2020 (13.67 )FT596 is the first cellular immunotherapy engineered with three active anti-tumor components to be cleared for clinical investigation by the FDA. In addition to a proprietary CAR targeting CD19, FT596 expresses a novel high-affinity, non-cleavable CD16 (hnCD16) Fc receptor that has been modified to augment antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, enabling coincident targeting of CD19 and additional tumor-associated antigens such as CD20. FT596 also expresses an interleukin-15 receptor fusion (IL-15RF), a potent cytokine complex that promotes survival, proliferation and trans-activation of NK cells and CD8 T cells without the need for systemic cytokine support. Together, these features of FT596 are intended to maximize potency and minimize toxicity in treated patients. The Company plans to initiate enrollment of a first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in early 2020.New preclinical data presented at ASH showed that FT596 administered as a monotherapy exhibited durable tumor clearance and extended survival in vivo similar to primary CAR T cells in a humanized mouse model of CD19+ lymphoma. Additionally, when combined with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab, FT596 showed enhanced killing of CD20+ lymphoma cells in vivo as compared to rituximab alone. These data confirm previously presented in vitro findings that demonstrate the unique multi-antigen targeting functionality of FT596, and the product candidate's potential to effectively overcome CD19 antigen escape.The Company also announced that, in preparation for Phase 1 initiation, it had recently completed GMP production of FT596. In a single small-scale manufacturing campaign, the Company produced over 300 cryopreserved, infusion-ready doses of FT596 at a cost of approximately $2,500 per dose. The Company's iPSC product platform unites stem cell biology and precision genetic engineering to create renewable master engineered iPSC lines that can be repeatedly used to mass produce cancer-fighting immune cells, replacing the high production costs, weeks of manufacturing time, and complex manufacturing processes required for current-generation CAR T-cell immunotherapies with a lower-cost, easier-to-manufacture, well-characterized, off-the-shelf product that has the potential to reach many more patients.06:27SGMO Sangamo Therapeutics and Pfizer (PFE) report updated Phase 1/2 results showing sustained increased Factor VIII activity through 44 weeks (11.66 )Sangamo Therapeutics (SGMO) and Pfizer (PFE) announced updated follow-up results from the Phase 1/2 Alta study evaluating investigational SB-525 gene therapy in patients with severe hemophilia A. The data showed that SB-525 was generally well tolerated and demonstrated sustained increased Factor VIII (FVIII) levels following treatment with SB-525 through to 44 weeks, the extent of follow-up for the longest treated patient in the 3e13 vg/kg dose cohort.06:27KURA Kura Oncology provides clinical and regulatory updates for lead drug candidate, tipifarnib, in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (15.61 )In June 2019, Kura reported that the primary efficacy endpoint was achieved in each of the expansion cohorts in its Phase 2 trial of tipifarnib in relapsed or refractory PTCL: 1) patients with AITL, an aggressive form of T-cell lymphoma often characterized by high levels of CXCL12 expression, and 2) patients with PTCL who lack a single nucleotide variation in the 3'-untranslated region of the CXCL12 gene. Given the high level of activity observed among AITL patients, Kura continued to enroll patients to acquire more experience regarding safety and tolerability in this population. Based upon the 2016 revision of the World Health Organization classification of lymphoid neoplasms1, AITL and AITL-like histologies represent approximately one-third of all PTCL cases.As of the November 11, 2019 data cutoff date, a total of 26 patients with relapsed or refractory AITL were enrolled in all stages of the trial. Among the 20 patients evaluable for efficacy, five achieved a complete response (CR) and five achieved a partial response (PR), for an objective response rate (ORR) of 50% on an evaluable basis and 38% on an intent-to-treat basis. In addition, three patients experienced disease stabilization. Patients had a median of three prior regimens (range 1-7).Next-generation sequencing of 19 available patient biopsies showed that 10 (53%) carried C336R/Q386E variants in the killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) 3DL2, an immune checkpoint receptor. Four of the 10 patients with KIR3DL2 variants achieved a CR and three achieved a PR, for a CR rate of 40% and an ORR of 70%. This compares to a CR rate of 11% and an ORR of 22% among the nine AITL patients with KIR3DL2 wild type.Regulatory Update: Following FDA feedback from an end-of-Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting, Kura plans to initiate a Phase 2 registration-directed trial of tipifarnib in patients with relapsed or refractory AITL and related lymphomas in 2020. The multi-center, single-arm trial will target enrollment of 128 patients with AITL and AITL-like histologies who are relapsed or refractory to at least one prior systemic cytotoxic therapy.06:26PTLA Portola Pharma presents new interim results from ongoing Phase 2a study of cerdulatinib in patients with specific subtypes of T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (29.21 )As of the November 12, 2019 cut-off date, 64 PTCL patients and 40 CTCL patients treated with cerdulatinib as a single agent were evaluable for response. The overall response rate (ORR) was 34% in the PTCL cohort and 43% in the CTCL cohort. Among the subset of patients in the PTCL cohort with AITL, the ORR was 52% and the complete response rate (CR) was 37%.Among the 64 patients in the PTCL cohort, 14 patients (22%) achieved a CR and eight patients (12%) achieved a partial response (PR). In the subgroup of 27 patients with AITL, 10 patients (37%) achieved a CR, and four patients (15%) achieved a PR. The median duration of response is eight months for all PTCL patients and is greater than nine months in AITL patients. Follow-up is ongoing. Among the 40 patients in the CTCL cohort, three patients (8%) achieved a CR and 14 patients (35%) achieved a PR. Importantly, rapid improvements in pruritus, or severe itching -- a common and often serious condition associated with CTCL -- have been observed, as measured by the Likert scale.Cerdulatinib demonstrated good tolerability in both PTCL and CTCL. The most common Grade 3 or greater adverse events across the PTCL and CTCL cohorts with a frequency > 5% were lipase increase (25%), amylase increase (19%), neutropenia (12%), anemia (10%), diarrhea (8%), sepsis/bacteremia (6%), and febrile neutropenia (4%). The lipase and amylase changes were generally asymptomatic and not associated with pancreatitis.06:25XENE Xenon Pharmaceuticals provides updates on partnered neurology pipeline programs (13.95 )Xenon Pharmaceuticals announced that it will provide updates on its partnered epilepsy programs at the American Epilepsy Society Annual Meeting.Overview of clinical stage XEN901 and Related Patient Survey to be Presented in the "Genetic Epilepsies -- Updates in the Science and Diagnosis" on December 8thPre-clinical work suggests selective sodium channel inhibitors that reduce action potential firing in excitatory neurons, while sparing inhibitory interneurons, may provide promising drug profile06:25IMV IMV presents updated results from SPiReL at ASH (2.83 )The poster, which included additional data collected between the abstract submission and the presentation, continued to demonstrate a favorable therapeutic profile and treatment-associated clinical benefit in r/r DLBCL patients who received the DPX-Survivac combination regimen.06:24QURE uniQure presents updated clinical data on three patients treated in ongoing Phase IIb study of etranacogene dezaparvovec; additionally presents up to 4 years of follow-up data on the 10 patients in the Phase I/II trial of AMT-060 (66.05 )At Least One Year of Stable, Therapeutic Levels of FIX Activity in Patients Treated with Etranacogene Dezaparvovec: Featured in a poster presentation at ASH, the 52 weeks of follow-up data show that all three patients have stabilized and sustained FIX activity at therapeutic levels after the one-time administration of etranacogene dezaparvovec. Mean FIX activity for the three patients at 52 weeks after administration was 41% of normal, with the first patient achieving FIX activity of 50% of normal, the second patient achieving FIX activity of 31% of normal and the third patient achieving FIX activity of 41% of normal. The second and third patients had previously screen-failed and were excluded from another gene therapy study due to pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to a different AAV vector. Reported FIX activity was measured using an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay performed at a central laboratory.At one year after dosing, no patient in the study has reported any bleeding events. All patients have remained free of prophylaxis after receiving etranacogene dezaparvovec. One patient, who had earlier in the study undergone hip surgery due to a pre-existing condition, experienced back pain and treated himself with a single infusion of factor replacement, which was later determined by the patient and the investigator to be unrelated to a bleed. No other FIX infusions were reported by any patient.Stable FIX Expression and Durable Reductions in Bleeding and FIX Consumption for up to 4 Years Following AMT-060 Gene Therapy:In the ongoing Phase I/II study of AMT-060, all 10 patients continue to show long-term clinical benefit, including sustained increases in FIX activity, reduced usage of FIX replacement therapy, and decreased bleeding frequency. At up to 4 years of follow-up, AMT-060 continues to be well-tolerated, with no new serious adverse events and no development of inhibitors since the last reported data.All five patients in the second dose cohort of 2x1013 gc/kg (the dose being studied in the ongoing Phase III HOPE-B study of etranacogene dezaparvovec) continue to be free of routine FIX replacement therapy at 3.5 years after treatment. Based on the six months of data collected during the fourth year of follow-up, the mean annualized bleeding rate was zero compared to an average of 4 bleeds during the year prior to treatment, representing a 100% reduction. During this same period, the usage of FIX replacement therapy also declined 100% compared to the year prior to treatment. Mean FIX activity over 3.5 years was 7.5%.06:22FATE Fate Therapeutics reports clinical data from Landmark Phase 1 studies; no dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients (13.67 )Fate Therapeutics announced initial clinical data for its FT516 and FT500 off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived natural killer (NK) cell product candidates.No morphologic evidence of leukemia and complete neutrophil recovery observed in first patient treated with FT516 Monotherapy for AML following first dosing cycleNo dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients treated with FT500 for advanced solid tumorsFavorable FT500 Phase 1 Safety, Tolerability and Immunogenicity profile validates novel multi-dose treatment paradigm for off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived NK cell products.06:22BMY Bristol-Myers presents data from multiple studies evaluating lisocabtagene maraleucel at ASH (59.95 )These studies included an evaluation of liso-cel in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) (TRANSCEND CLL 004); a study in second-line patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients who were ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) (PILOT); and a separate analysis of patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma who received liso-cel in the outpatient setting across three studies."The results in relapsed or refractory CLL and SLL demonstrated a high rate of durable complete responses achieved in heavily pre-treated patients, including patients who have failed ibrutinib and venetoclax. We are encouraged by the potential of liso-cel to treat second-line relapsed or refractory large B-cell NHL patients who are not able to undergo a stem cell transplant. Finally, the analysis evaluating liso-cel administered in the outpatient setting demonstrates that not all patients require hospitalization and that the safety and efficacy profile across a variety of types of clinical sites is consistent."06:20LLY Eli Lilly presents interim clinical data from the LOXO-305 global Phase 1/2 BRUIN dose escalation trial (119.64 )At all doses studied, LOXO-305 delivered objective responses in patients who had received diverse prior therapies and had exhibited varied molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance.Of 16 CLL patients enrolled, there were 10 responders (8 partial responses, 2 partial response with ongoing lymphocytosis) among 13 patients eligible for response assessment, resulting in a 77% ORR. All patients with CLL have demonstrated tumor reduction, with evidence of deepening response over time. Responses were observed in patients with acquired resistance to prior BTK therapy (those with and without C481S mutations), in patients who were intolerant to prior BTK therapy, and in patients with acquired resistance to prior BCL2 therapy (including one with a known BCL G101V mutation). As expected, LOXO-305 treatment causes acute lymphocytosis, which resolves over time -- a well described pharmacodynamic response associated with effective BTK inhibition. Of the three CLL patients not yet eligible for response assessment (one with the BTK C481S mutation), all three have demonstrated lymphocytosis early in cycle 1. All CLL responding patients remain in response, and all CLL patients remain on study. Of eight MCL patients enrolled, there were three responses (1 complete response, 2 partial responses) among six patients eligible for response assessment, resulting in a 50% ORR. Two of the responders had progressed on prior BTK therapy (but without a documented C481x mutation). All MCL responding patients remain in response and on study. Three MCL patients discontinued therapy in cycle 1 due to progressive disease.Most treatment-emergent adverse events were Grade 1 in severity with the most commonly reported events, regardless of attribution, being fatigue (25% total: 21% Grade 1, 4% Grade 2) and diarrhea (18% total: 14% Grade 1, 4% Grade 2). Two adverse events > or =Grade 3 were attributed to LOXO-305 (Grade 3 leukocytosis and Grade 3 transient neutropenia). No dose limiting toxicities were reported and an MTD had not been reached.06:19AZN AstraZeneca reports full results from Phase III ELEVATE TN trial (47.68 )AstraZeneca presented results from the interim analysis of the Phase III ELEVATE TN trial, showing that CALQUENCE (acalabrutinib) combined with obinutuzumab or as monotherapy significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab, a standard chemo-immunotherapy treatment, in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemiaIn an exploratory analysis, CALQUENCE in combination or alone demonstrated consistent PFS improvements across most pre-specified subgroups of patients with high-risk disease characteristics, including the unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable gene (IGHV), del(11q) and complex karyotype. Overall, the safety and tolerability profile of CALQUENCE observed in the ELEVATE TN trial was consistent with its known profile.06:19BGNE BeiGene presents clinical data from three trials of its BTK inhibitor BRUKINSA at ASH (186.92 )In two oral presentations of BRUKINSA in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), the drug candidate demonstrated consistent safety and a high overall response rate (ORR); in the poster presentation of BRUKINSA combined with BeiGene's investigational anti-PD-1 antibody tislelizumab in patients with previously treated B-cell malignancies, the combination treatment showed preliminary efficacy and was generally well tolerated."The results presented today on BRUKINSA, a BTK inhibitor designed to maximize target occupancy and minimize off-target binding, demonstrated robust clinical activity and a safety profile consistent with what we've observed to date in our clinical trials, including safety data that supported the recent U.S. FDA accelerated approval in patients with previously treated mantle cell lymphoma," said Jane Huang, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, hematology at BeiGene. "CLL or SLL is the most common type of leukemia in adults, and despite the advancements of BTK inhibitor therapy for these cancers, there remains a need for highly selective BTK inhibitors capable of promoting long-term responses, and with a safety profile that is tolerable over time. The results presented here today further demonstrate the potential for BRUKINSA to help people living with these persistent, life-threatening cancers."06:18RCKT Rocket Pharmaceuticals presents "encouraging" preliminary results from its Phase 1 trial of commercial-grade RP-L102 'Process B' for Fanconi Anemia (22.37 )Results presented in the poster highlight preliminary Phase 1 data from two pediatric patients (age 5 and 6 years) who were treated with "Process B" RP-L102 prior to the development of severe bone marrow failure and are in ongoing follow-up. Drug product was successfully manufactured using "Process B" optimization, including transduction enhancers, commercial-grade vector, and modified cell processing. "Process B" drug product is manufactured to commercial grade standards, allowing for consistent drug product across patients and a vector copy number (VCN) two to three fold higher than that administered to optimally-treated "Process A" patients.Once transduced, drug product was infused fresh into patients without any prior conditioning regimen. To evaluate transduction efficiency, an analysis of the proportion of the MMC-resistant colony forming cells was conducted. Both patients exhibited early signs of engraftment based on peripheral blood, VCN and/or MMC-resistance. Preliminary phenotypic correction was also apparent in both patients, as evidenced by stabilization or increases in blood cell lineages. No safety or tolerability issues have been reported.06:18ABBV AbbVie reports new results from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE clinical trial showing the potential of this fixed-duration combination therapy (86.98 )AbbVie announced new data from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE (PCYC-1142) clinical trial, evaluating IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) in combination with VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO (venetoclax) in previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Results showed that patients who received up to 12 cycles of the combination regimen achieved high rates of undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD) in both peripheral blood (PB; 75% of patients) and in bone marrow (BM; 72% of patients). Safety data were consistent with the known safety profiles of IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO used as individual therapies.Results showed uMRD -- defined as less than 1 CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes (MRD<0.01%) by flow cytometry of PB or BM samples -- was achieved at any time after baseline in PB for 75% of patients (122 of 163 patients) and in BM for 72% (111 of 155 patients). The proportion of patients who had uMRD in PB increased over time from 57% after 6 cycles, 68% after 9 cycles, and 73% after 12 cycles of IMBRUVICA plus VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO. The high rates of uMRD in BM were consistent across high-risk subgroups, including in patients with del(17p), del(17p) or TP53 mutation, del(11q), complex karyotype, and unmutated IGHV status. In patients with uMRD in PB with matched BM samples, 93% of patients had uMRD in both PB and BM. With median follow-up of 14.7 months, 3 patients (2%) experienced disease progression.06:17OBSV ObsEva reports positive Phase 3 trial results from PRIMROSE 2 trial of linzagolix for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids (4.57 )The responder rate was 93.9% (p <0.001) for women receiving 200 mg with ABT and 56.7% for women receiving 100 mg without ABT (p <0.001), compared to 29.4% in the placebo group. Both doses achieved significant rates of amenorrhea (p <0.001), reduction in pain (p <0.001), and improvement in quality of life (p <0.001). Additionally, significant improvement (p <0.001) in hemoglobin levels, a reduction in number of days of bleeding and reduction in uterine volume were observed. Furthermore, a significant reduction in fibroid volume was also observed for the 200 mg dose with ABT (p <0.008).The overall safety profile was in line with expectations and confirmed that linzagolix was well-tolerated. The most frequently observed adverse events (occurring in > 5% of patients) were headache, hot flushes, and anemia. Mean percentage change from baseline in BMD was consistent with previous clinical data."We look forward to the results from our second pivotal study, PRIMROSE 1 conducted in the US, in Q2 2020. Assuming positive results, we expect that it would lead to a Marketing Authorization Application submission with the European Medicines Agency by year-end 2020 and a New Drug Application submission with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by Q1 2021."06:16THOR Synthorx to be acquired by Sanofi (SNY) for $68/share in cash (25.03 )Under the terms of the merger agreement, Sanofi will commence a cash tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Synthorx common stock for $68 per share in cash for a total enterprise value of approximately $2.35 billion.

While the DOJ and SEC conduct separate investigations, the same facts have been shared by Ericsson with both authorities. The resolution relates to historical FCPA breaches ending Q1 2017. While the Company had a compliance program and a supporting control framework, they were not adequately implemented. Specifically, certain employees in some markets, some of whom were executives in those markets, acted in bad faith and knowingly failed to implement sufficient controls. They were able to enter into transactions for illegitimate purposes and, together with people under their influence, used sophisticated schemes in order to hide their wrongdoing.Separately, Ericsson agreed to resolve civil charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) relating to allegations of violations of the bribery and accounting provisions of the FCPA.

This may just be the calm before the storm considering all the macro-related events set to take place as the week unfolds. S&P Futures saw a relative quiet beginning with only a nine point overnight range. The market is currently trading around the 3144 area, with a high of 3148.50 and a low of 3139.50. In Asia, both China and Japan finished the day marginally higher. The Shanghai struggled to gain much following lighter than expected export data that saw a 1.1% fall in November, compared to a forecast of +0.8%.The Nikkei traded around in a narrow range that culminated with a gain of 0.3%. Heavyweights such as Softbank and Sony both gained more than 1% by day's end. European markets slightly under water. The weaker than expected Export data out of China has likely kept the EU markets in check. Energy names are seeing modest weakness with Crude Oil giving back about 1% in early action.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: -2.010 yr Note: 1.82%USD/JPY: 108.49 -0.07EUR/USD: 1.1067 +0.0007Europe: FTSE -0.2% DAX 0.0% CAC -0.2%Asia: Hang Seng 0.0% Shanghai +0.1% Nikkei +0.3%Gold (1467.40 +2.30) Silver (16.65 +0.05) Crude (58.63 -0.57)17:34WRAPX This week's biggest % gainers/losersThe following are this week's top percentage gainers and losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).This week's top % gainers Healthcare: BOLD (59.25 +104.1%), AUPH (15.44 +94.46%), THOR (25.03 +39.83%), LXRX (4.87 +37.96%), RUBY (10.62 +37.92%), RCKT (22.37 +27.15%), ALLK (117.36 +23.54%), PDCO (23.51 +20.81%)Consumer Discretionary: EXPR (5.49 +39.69%), GCO (48.82 +31.45%), LE (15.05 +27.76%), BIG (25.21 +20.62%)Information Technology: SCWX (15.11 +33.25%), GTT (11.3 +27.4%), DOMO (23.39 +24.41%), DQ (45.71 +20.04%)Financials: EZPW (6.19 +20.9%)Utilities: PCG (9.65 +29.36%)This week's top % losers Healthcare: SAGE (64.46 -58.35%), CLVS (9.61 -35.63%), CARA (16.76 -35.51%), PBYI (7.88 -16.97%), TGTX (7.12 -13.06%), FATE (13.67 -12.48%)Industrials: BE (5.28 -19.02%), EAF (12.29 -12.78%)Consumer Discretionary: HOME (5.67 -33.92%), MIK (6.69 -18.22%), CHS (4.03 -15.51%)Information Technology: ESTC (63.84 -19.61%), PAGS (28.82 -15.09%), MDB (131.17 -11.79%)Utilities: JE (2.1 -22.79%)16:37ALEC Alector presents Phase 1 data on AL002 (19.76 +0.37)Alector today reported safety and biomarker data from the single ascending dose (SAD) phase of the INVOKE Phase 1 study of its product candidate, AL002, in healthy volunteers. AL002 is a monoclonal antibody intended to enhance the activity of TREM2 and is being developed by Alector for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in collaboration with its partner AbbVie (ABBV). The data were presented today at the 12th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) meeting. The AL002 presentation at CTAD showcases the first data in humans showing that a TREM2 activating antibody engages its target and demonstrates downstream activity in the CNS. The data reported today are from the study's SAD phase in 56 healthy adults, who were enrolled into nine escalating dose cohorts. AL002 was found to be generally safe and well-tolerated. AL002 reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) soluble TREM2 in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating proof-of-target engagement in the brain. AL002 elevated a biomarker for microglia activity in the CSF, indicating proof-of-mechanism. The Phase 1b portion of the study in Alzheimer's disease patients is on-going.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD16:19WTRE Watford Holdings agrees to purchase Axeria IARD; terms not disclosed (26.47 +0.25)Axeria IARD is a property and casualty insurance company based in France.

China imposes gaming curfew to minorsStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeNovember 7, 2019 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MARKETS; Pg. 1Length: 441 wordsByline: Jean GarciaBodyIt looks like young gamers inChina are facing a shut down as a new law limits under 18 game time to 90 minutes.Tencent - the world's largest gaming company - addressed criticism by limiting game time to one hour per day for users under 12 and to two hours per day for users between 12 and 18. Among them is a ban on online video games for minors between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. Minors will also be restricted to 90 minutes of game time everyday except national holidays, when they are allowed a maximum of three hours.The guidelines were drafted in response to what the Chinese government has suggested is a problem in youth with "video game addiction", and is part of a sweeping campaign regulate gaming and the games industry withinChina.Last year Beijing announced new controls on the number of games that can be played online, limited new releases, and imposed rules on underage players to reduce their screen time.The guidelines of the new curfew were posted on November 6, 2019, published byChina's General Administration of Press and Publication. The state-run media has likened some games to "poison", and the government has blocked sales of some titles on the grounds that they are too violent.Tesla's 'Blade Runner' pickup truck will be revealed November 21In last month's quarterly conference call, Musk called the truck, which he terms the Tesla Cybertruck, "our best product ever". The reveal would happen a day before the Los Angeles Auto Show opens to the public, according to its website .China is one of the world's biggest mobile gaming markets, according to the state-owned Xinhua news agency.The new regulations also place restrictions on the amount of money minors can spend on micro-transactions or in-app purchases like weapons and clothes depending on their age.What's more: these young gamers are also being told how much they're allowed to spend on microtransactions. "Publishers and developers need to be very aware of the content of the games they are developing for the market". And each transaction can not exceed 50 RMB (about $7).Australian families have also looked at ways to tackle addiction to video games, while Melbourne-based Game Aware, a course teaching "intelligent gaming", tries to help gamers make sure it remains a hobby. It is stipulated that game companies shall not provide pay services for users under 8. And if you think there's a bit of dissonance between the Chinese government's stance on video games - it doesn't like them - and the country's investment in gaming, you are not wrong. "Our minds should be focused on building more stadiums, football courts and basketball courts".Load-Date: November 8, 2019End of Document

Dow Jones Futures: China Trade Deal News Cools Apple, AMD, Tesla; A New Hope For Stock Market RallyInvestor's Business DailyNovember 21, 2019Copyright 2019 Investor's Business Daily, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: STOCK MARKET TODAYLength: 1136 wordsByline: ED CARSONBodyhttps://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Stock-Worldpics-ChinaStorys2-adobe.jpgDow Jones futures were volatile overnight, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, amid a slew of China news. Congress passed pro-Hong Kong legislation. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump and China's top trade official commented on the China trade deal.The stock market rally took a hit Wednesday on reports that a China trade deal may not happen until 2020, though the major indexes pared losses. Apple stock, AMD stock, Tesla stock and other China-exposed names fell, but not by much. Apple and Advanced Micro Devices lost about 1%. Tesla stock fell a little more but pulled back into a buy zone. On Thursday night, Tesla is due to unveil its so-called cybertruck.Meanwhile, software continued to revive. Paycom Software raced to clear a buy point. Paylocity and ServiceNow moved higher in buy zones.Apple stock, AMD stock and ServiceNow stock are on .Join IBD experts as they analyze winning stocks on  every morning. Take a free trial!Hong Kong StandoffThe House passed a pro-Hong Kong rights bill late Wednesday, after the Senate did so late Tuesday. Several Chinese government agencies threatened some unspecified retaliation, though that rile up U.S. lawmakers and public opinion. President Trump hasn't said if he'll sign the legislation.The measure raises the stakes over Hong Kong protests and how it'll impact China trade deal talks.Trump, Liu On China Trade DealDuring a tour of an Apple plant in Austin, Texas, Trump said after the market close that Beijing is not "stepping up" in trade talks, though he insisted China wants a deal more. Trump also said that he's looking at exempting the Apple iPhone from the China tariffs set for Dec. 15.Wednesday night, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, China's top trade negotiator, said he's "cautiously optimistic" about a China trade deal. He also said he was "confused" about U.S. trade demands.Dow Jones Futures TodayDow Jones futures fell on the Trump's trade talk, the Hong Kong legislation and China's responses, but pared losses on Liu's comments.Dow Jones futures fell less than 0.1% vs. fair value, along with S&P 500 futures. Nasdaq 100 futures sank 0.1%. Remember that overnight action in  doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular  session.Current Stock Market RallyThe current stock market rally suffered a setback Wednesday on a report that the phase-one  until next year. But the major indexes pared losses significantly. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 index fell 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite lost 0.5%. The S&P 500 index had fallen as much as 0.9% intraday.Arguably the stock market rally was due for a pullback of some sort, after trending steadily higher on China trade optimism. The S&P 500 still hasn't fallen more than 0.4% since Oct. 8 and continues to close above its 10-day line. The CBOE Volatility Index actually dipped and is close to last Friday's nearly two-year low.  signal excessive bullishness or complacency and often foreshadow at least short-term market retreats.Apple StockA Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq component, Apple stock fell 1.2% to 263.19, closing just below its 10-day line for the first time since Oct. 2. AAPL stock recently hit the 20% profit-taking zone, often a good place to take at least partial gains. That can depend on your conviction in a company and its stock. In the case of Apple stock, do you think it has room to run with services growth picking up and 5G iPhones on the horizon?Apple stock had been running up in recent weeks in large part due to optimism for a China trade deal, leaving it vulnerable to negative trade news.An escalating China trade war could fuel a Chinese nationalist backlash against the Apple iPhone and other U.S. brands. Trump tariffs set for Dec. 15 would hit China-made Apple iPhones for the first time, unless Trump offers an exemption.Apple stock edged higher before Thursday's open.AMD StockAMD stock fell 0.75% Wednesday, but well off session lows. That followed nine straight gains as AMD stock has run up since early October. Shares are still comfortably above their 10-day line.AMD stock edged higher in extended trade after Intel disclosed continued supply challenges, including shipment delays to PC customers. Intel stock fell modestly late.AMD stock and other semiconductors have been racing higher on China trade deal optimism. This week, the Commerce Department extended a Huawei reprieve for an additional 90 days, letting chipmakers and others continue to supply the China telecom giant.The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF closed down 1%, extending losses on Intel and Trump's China trade comments.Stock Market Rally DiversifiesIn recent weeks, the Apple and chip-led stock market rally has broadened out somewhat, with a number of medical firms and IPOs breaking out. Software firms are moving into position. Paylocity stock already broke out with ServiceNow stock clearing an early entry. Paycom stock soared 9% to 260.93 Wednesday, clearing a 259.81 buy point from a . Many other former software leaders are coming off injured reserve, building the right side of bases.If trade war news weighs on Apple stock and AMD stock for a time, medicals and software that don't have much China exposure could help prop up the market rally.The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF rose 0.4%, within 1% of all-time highs. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF — which has a mix of chip, software, medical and elite stocks — dipped 0.4%, ending a nine-day winning streak.Tesla CybertruckElon Musk will unveil the Tesla cybertruck at a late night media event Thursday. Not much is known about the electric pickup, from what it looks like to battery range and price tag. When will production start, and were will it be made? The Tesla Model Y crossover, which looks a lot like the Model 3 sedan, is due out in mid-2020.China is a big part of the bull base for Tesla stock. The automaker is starting to make Model 3 vehicles from its new Shanghai plant, with China electric-vehicle demand set to soar in the coming years.Tesla stock fell 2% to 352.22 on Wednesday. But shares are back in buy range and still above their 10-day line. Tesla stock earlier this month cleared a 340.94 handle buy point on a long, deep consolidation. The buy range runs to 357.99.Buying the stock just ahead of the Tesla cybertruck unveiling is a little like buying ahead of earnings. Investors could use an  to play Tesla stock now, or wait for the post-news reaction.Ultimately, Tesla's cybertruck is likely a few years from coming off the production line. For the near to midterm, Tesla stock will rise and fall on whether the company can consistently deliver profits.Please follow Ed Carson on Twitter at  for stock market updates and more.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE: Load-Date: November 24, 2019End of Document

It used to be that it was just on the weekends.Your reaction?PHILLIPS: Yes, it's interesting to see how the protestors anger and the average people in Hong Kong's anger has shifted from just being against the Chinese to also against the authorities within Hong Kong. Early in the summer there was a poll of people in Hong Kong. Six percent of people there said they had zero trust in the Hong Kong police. This weekend it was up to 52 percent of people in Hong Kong saying they have zero faith in the Hong Kong police. This is now bleeding out into the authorities within Hong Kong and their anger being directed towards them, not just the Chinese. It will be interesting to see how the markets respond and if these latest rounds of violence have an impact.BARTIROMO: Because "The Journal" is writing it this morning as Hong Kong police forces become a driver of the protest movement increasingly marked by this violent confrontations, John.JOHN LONSKI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S CAPITAL MARKETS: Gee, you don't like to see the violence, but as an aside, I'd like to add that this perhaps puts a little bit more pressure on the Chinese government to come up with a trade deal. And the last thing in the world they need, given the disturbances they have in Hong Kong to have this lingering loss of economic activity to uncertainty surrounding trade.BARTIROMO: Does it, though? Does it put pressure on Xi Jinping, you think? I mean, you know, last week the Chinese floated this idea and it was all the Chinese that the two sides were considering, you know, taking off any tariff increases that were planned on the table. That wasn't true. We had to have Donald Trump and Peter Navarro come out and squash that idea.Is it, in fact, putting pressure on Xi Jinping, do you think, Nancy?TENGLER: I'm not sure. I mean I think the economy for sure is -- the Chinese economy is slowing.BARTIROMO: Yes.TENGLER: Inflation's soaring due to the pork prices. So I do think that they are incented to move forward. The president understands that as well. You can see that in his comments.But I also think that Carrie Lam is going to have a hard time surviving this. I -- the leadership -- the lack of leadership she's demonstrated has been profound and opened up a real opportunity for the protests. We've been talking about it on your set for months.BARTIROMO: Yes.TENGLER: And it just keeps getting worse.BARTIROMO: It is six months now.TENGLER: Yes.BARTIROMO: And yesterday Carrie Lam basically threw it back on the protesters, saying it's your fault --TENGLER: Astonishing.BARTIROMO: You're the one who is disrupting thing, rather than looking at the actual underlying issue, and that is China's authoritarian rule.TENGLER: Yes. Yes. In a place that didn't -- is not accustomed to it, who has generations of independence.BARTIROMO: So if they're breaking their promises to Hong Kong in the agreement that they made when, you know, when the first handover happened with the British, if they're breaking their promises now, why should we believe them in a trade deal, John?TENGLER: Yes.LONSKI: Well, I think, you know, it's an interesting point. We're going to have to closely monitor whatever type of trade deal we come up with and make sure that it's being adhered to.BARTIROMO: Yes. All right. Look at market this morning. It's a fractional move, but we are looking at a firmer tone for the broader averages.We've got the National Federation of Independent Business Report out with the October report on American small businesses. We've got the latest here and it shows that an increase in capital spending, labor compensation and job creation, is happening this -- in the last month. This is a positive because we've been focused on CapEx, John, in terms of a slowdown here, but these numbers show it's back up.LONSKI: CapEx is not shrinking in the same manner that it did. Profits recession of 2015, 2016. It's hanging in there despite the adverse impact of trade uncertainty.I think what's interesting with small business is, it's the great difficulty they're having trying to find qualified workers. And that tells you the labor market is still firm.However, despite this difficulty in getting the type of people they want, we're not seeing a great deal of upward pressure being placed on wages, not so much upward pressure on wage that inflation is become a worry.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's the key, actually, because you're seeing wages up 3.1 percent year over year but not enough to cause the expense side of the business to really see a significance.LONSKI: So the important takeaway may be that we can take this now very low unemployment rate, 3.6 percent, and perhaps move it down towards 3 percent over time without having to pay the price of an unwanted increase by price inflation.BARTIROMO: These are extraordinary numbers no matter how you look at it, Nancy.TENGLER: I mean super good news. Super good news, Maria. I've been talking about CapEx for a long time, worried about it. We saw weakness of productivity in the last report. So we needed to see this happen because the consumers been carrying global GDP as well as U.S. GDP. So I'm pretty excited to see these numbers.BARTIROMO: You know it's interesting to see these numbers back up on CapEx, even as we don't really have a resolution in terms of the trade situation.TENGLER: Right.BARTIROMO: It feels like business managers are getting more comfortable with the fact that President Trump is going to deal with these countries in terms of trade the way he wants to.TENGLER: And they're moving their supply chains out, which is what we're seeing happening increasingly.BARTIROMO: That too.TENGLER: I think that's the marginal effect of this, because we won't be able to monitor -- I mean I won't say we won't be able to, we'll have to monitor and I don't think the Chinese will live up to the agreement.LONSKI: I think the important thing with small businesses is that sales are still growing. As long as sales grow, they have every reason to increase their production capacity, add capital (INAUDIBLE), equipment and workers.I think it's also worth noting that some businesses complained about the fact that they are unwilling to purchase new capital (INAUDIBLE) equipment because they cannot find the workers to operate such equipment.TENGLER: Right.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean that's how tight a labor market it is.LONSKI: Training is going to become a big deal and education, I think, going forward.TENGLER: And yet manufacturing is hooking up, which is also good news.LONSKI: Yes.TENGLER: So I think this is maybe a mid-cycle adjustment from the Fed that allows the market to really continue to perform.BARTIROMO: Big story on the European autos. The fact that the president is not going to put an additional tariff on autos coming from Europe. There was a lot of concern about that.TENGLER: Yes.BARTIROMO: And that would have been an issue, I think, for the economy going into the holidays.LONSKI: Yes. Yes, that's very much a positive. After all, you know, the auto industry worldwide is stagnant to a (ph) lower. It's suffering a little bit. And this is one of the major reasons why you have weakness in manufacturing.BARTIROMO: Yes.And European markets this morning are up, as you can see there.I want to talk about the streaming wars real quick. On fire this morning as Disney launches its Disney Plus service today for $6.99 a month for Disney or $69.99 for the year. This is basically one-stop shopping for Disney fans. Everything from the classic to Star War films, even "The Simpsons" are available.And, of course, this field is getting more crowded, Nancy. But they're undercutting what Netflix charges. Netflix is $12.99 a month. Disney, $6.99 a month.TENGLER: Yes. And, listen, broader appeal, I think, for families.So, we own the stock. Full disclosure. We bought it last December on -- during market weakness. And the test runs that they ran in the Netherlands have been extraordinarily positive. So I think this marginally is going to be a problem for Netflix. And we've seen it in Netflix's stock price. We'll see what happens as we move forward with Apple and Disney both in the -- in the mix.BARTIROMO: I think I -- I think I agree with you.PHILLIPS: Yes.BARTIROMO: Cabot, they're going to spend $15 billion a year trying to catch up here with original content. Reed Hastings, the CEO of Netflix, said it the other day, yes, we'll spend more next year than we did this year.PHILLIPS: And I think when Disney comes out with their streaming platform's original content, there's already a trust there in (INAUDIBLE) coming out.BARTIROMO: Yes.TENGLER: Yes.PHILLIPS: Netflix does it, people are saying, well, we'll wait and see. There's not really a studio background there.TENGLER: Season to season.PHILLIPS: People already trust Disney. They know the content they've made in the past.BARTIROMO: Yes.PHILLIPS: And they -- there's already more of a faith there.I think it's difficult to understate the brand confidence that young people especially have in it. They grew up on it and now they're starting to see original content that still appeal to them. And also the average person under the age of 30, which is a huge portion of what they're looking at --BARTIROMO: Yes.PHILLIPS: Says they'll have up to four streaming services. They were OK paying for all four. $50 is the average that people spend on streaming.BARTIROMO: How do you have the time to watch all that streaming?PHILLIPS: Yes.BARTIROMO: I don't know.PHILLIPS: That's the question.BARTIROMO: I mean it. I mean I'm having a hard time just watching Netflix on my -- on my down time.The president is in New York today for a speech at the New York Economic Club. The president weighed in on the economy, speaking today at the New York Economic Club, investors will be closely watching any comments that the president makes on trade talks with China. His remarks happening a day before the impeachment hearings go public. Those, you know, public hearings will begin in Washington tomorrow. What are you going to be listening to from the president today in New York. I will be there at the speech this afternoon.What do you think?TENGLER: I'm going to be listening to his plans for tax cuts. And a recap of his view of how things -- I mean I think he needs to start stating what he's done because it's been powerful for the economy and for the markets. So I think we'll start to see that.BARTIROMO: Especially in a world where you've got tax increases on the horizon on the other side, on the Democratic side.TENGLER: Right. Right.BARTIROMO: Real quick, John.LONSKI: Well, I think you're right, this is all going to be about what the president has to say about trade talks with China, how they're going along. And I would think right now both the president and the Chinese government have strong, political incentives to get a deal done ASAP.BARTIROMO: All right, a quick break. We are just getting started this morning.Also on deck this morning, we have Fox News senior strategic analyst, retired four star general, Jack Keane coming up this morning on the Gaza rocket attack in Israel.Lifewire.com editor-in-chief Lance Ulanoff is here on the Disney Plus launch.Former Immigrations and Customs Enforcement Director, Fox News contributor, Tom Homan joining us on the DACA decision.And Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff is here, Marc Short, on the Hong Kong violence and the president's speech this morning.The CEO of Dakota Micro joining us, Charissa Rubey, on the company's made in America surveillance cameras.

All the highlights when we come back.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.The nation's longest living ex-president, 95-year-old Jimmy Carter, hospitalized this morning in Atlanta.Cheryl Casone on headlines now.Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Maria, good morning.So Carter was admitted to Emory University Hospital where he is scheduled to have surgery to relief pressure on his brain. His spokesman says the pressure was caused by bleeding that was due to several recent falls that he's taken. Now, Carter has fallen at least three times this year, the latest was just last month when he fractured his pelvis.Well, PG&E reportedly is offering $13.5 billion in compensation to victims of the California wildfires. The devastating flames were sparked by the utility's power lines. The proposed payout, part of a restructuring plan of PG&E which filed for bankruptcy back in January.Now, the utility could be taken over by the state of California if it fails to properly reorganize.Well, it was an overtime thriller in San Francisco. The Seattle Seahawks handed the 49ers their first loss of the season. The 9ers tied the game with a field goal with just one second left, but in overtime Seattle kicked the game-winning play just over a minute for the game, and that was for the win. We're already in November football.BARTIROMO: Yes, we are.CASONE: That's going quick.BARTIROMO: It really is.CASONE: Man.BARTIROMO: Well, Thanksgiving's in two weeks, Cheryl.CASONE: I know. What's happening?BARTIROMO: Oh, my goodness.All right, Cheryl, thank you. What is happening?A quick break, and then the tensions in the Middle East.

Dow Futures up 24, S&P up 3 and the Nasdaq futures up 14 after the Dow Industrials announced another record high yesterday. It was the Dow's ninth record high this year.Meanwhile, there are reports this morning that President Trump is expected to once again delay European auto tariffs. He could announce those plans during a speech at the New York Economic Club later today. He will be in New York making those remarks.Joining us right now is the co-founder of the Hodges Capital Management Company, Craig Hodges is here.And, Craig, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks for being here.CRAIG HODGES, CO-FOUNDER, HODGES CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Thank you, Maria. I appreciate it.BARTIROMO: Are you focused on what the president might say today? How important are the tariffs that they're not going to go on European autos, we believe? And what about that China story in terms of how you're allocating capital?HODGES: Not really on a day to day basis. We're a fund -- Hodges funds are very fundamentally driven. We're really focusing now on the smaller parts of the market. The market has been really interested because it's performance has been totally based on size. Large caps, mega caps are less 15 (INAUDIBLE) 15 percent. Large caps are up 11 percent. Small caps down 5 and micro caps down 15.So this divergence between small and large caps has never been this great. It's only happened three times in history, I believe '85, '91 and '98. And every time the small caps have caught back up within 12 months.BARTIROMO: So you think that there's a runway (ph). I mean why? Why are small caps not participating in this rally then?HODGES: There's a lot of factors. A lot of it has to do with market-making. There's not really much just (ph) sponsorship. Most of the market now is ETF driven. And, of course, indexes go to the larger companies. And so that tells you why the large -- the mega caps have done so well. But we, like I said, at Hodges Funds, we believe the real opportunities are in the small, forgotten parts of the market. That's where we're focusing.BARTIROMO: Wow.TENGLER: Yes.So, Craig, you know, the small cap spaces, we would have expected it to have done better after tax cuts, right?HODGES: Sure. Yes. Exactly.TENGLER: So a lot of us were moving into the space --HODGES: Yes.TENGLER: And then we're sorely disappointed.HODGES: Right.TENGLER: But the growth area has been sort of held up by cheap money, right?HODGES: Yes.TENGLER: We've got half the companies in the small cap index --HODGES: Don't make money.TENGLER: Right.HODGES: Yes.TENGLER: But -- so tell us about the value trade and why you think it's not a head fake this time.HODGES: Well, you know, you don't know for sure if it's not a head fake, but there's such a disparity -- there's so many companies that have just been left for dead. And the fact that there's not market making like there used to, there's these big air pockets under a lot of these smaller companies. There's basically small cap research has gone away and that's another part that they just don't get the sponsorship you do.But eventually all stocks trade according to their earnings and their free cash flow. And a lot of these companies are doing tremendous. And like you said earlier, a lot of the Russell 2000, you know, doesn't even make money.BARTIROMO: Right.HODGES: I saw one interesting statistic the other -- about -- well, I lost my train of thought, but -- but we really do believe that the place to go now is to small caps. Oh, I know what I was going to say. Listen, Microsoft and Apple make up 2 point -- the value of those companies make up 2.2 trillion. The whole Russell 2000 is 2.2 trillion.BARTIROMO: Wow.HODGES: That's never --BARTIROMO: Oh, my God.HODGES: That's never happened. Usually the largest two companies are 57 percent of that market -- of the Russell 2000. Right now it's 100 percent. So --TENGLER: Wow.BARTIROMO: Microsoft and Apple. Wow, that's incredible.TENGLER: Yes.HODGES: Make up the entire Russell 2000.BARTIROMO: But how are the earnings power in the small cap area? I mean earnings season is really winding down now. Are there certain sectors within small cap that are growing faster than other that you want to be focused on?HODGES: Yes, the -- but we're focusing on the parts that have been left for dead, things like energy, housing. We believe housing has a really, really long runway here. A lot of --TENGLER: So cyclically focused?HODGES: Yes. And the cyclical stocks, the industrials and such.TENGLER: Yes.LONSKI: So you're not seeing any recession in 2020?HODGES: You know, it's hard to say. You know, that's the other thing, a lot of these stocks are already pricing in a recession. You know there's a lot of -- you look at the steel and the cement stocks and a lot of things like that. They trade like we've already gone through or are in the middle of a recession. So will we have a recession in 2020, it's possible, but you don't have a lot of downside in these -- in these -- a lot of cyclical stocks that are already way, way down.PHILLIPS: We saw volatility coming early on when the trade war was just starting of any announcement there was, the markets seemed to react pretty quickly to that.As the trade war continues on, as maybe impeachment conversations continue starting tomorrow, are we going the see more reactions there should the volatility continue or should the market start to get used to those things?HODGES: It appears that the market is not reacting to the day-to-day headline news like it once was. You know, those things do matter long term, especially the tariffs and the trade. But we believe we'll eventually get through this period of the daily day headline risk and the fundamentals are strong, the economy's good and -- and still the sentiment amongst stock is terrible. People don't -- you know, it -- rarely are you ever at all-time highs and have this negative of a sentiment.TENGLER: Right.HODGES: So that's a very, very bullish thing in my mind.BARTIROMO: Do you worry about the USMCA not going through, the China deal? What about some of these big, macro headlines that people are waiting on?HODGES: Yes.BARTIROMO: USMCA is supposed to come to the floor this -- before the end of the year. You think it happens?HODGES: I don't know if it does, but the market is not pricing those things in. That's what I see. And I don't even think the market's even pricing in a, you know, a -- the tariffs going away and that we'll get a deal with China. So I don't think there's a lot of -- there's a lot of big headline right. I think the market's somewhat not pricing in those things on a positive side.BARTIROMO: That's -- it's interesting that it's not and it's important anymore to investors.TENGLER: I know. Thank goodness.BARTIROMO: Yes.TENGLER: It was exhausting. But I think Craig makes a great point, which is, valuation tends to be one of the best leading indicators. And the cyclicals have started to outperform.HODGES: Yes.TENGLER: And I think that would say that the market's not expecting a recession, although the market has been wrong occasionally.HODGES: Yes. That would be healthy to start seeing some of the value stocks start to do better because value has underperformed for 10 years.TENGLER: Yes.HODGES: I mean it's been terrible. A lot of the reasons why we have these big, big -- all the volatility in these big drops in that parts of the market is the incremental value buyer has gone.TENGLER: Yes.HODGES: There used to be that buyer that would step in when a stock would go down 10, 15 percent and buy. They're gone now and so you just have these big air pockets in their stocks.PHILLIPS: You know, with the lowest unemployment rate of 50 years, are you seeing more problems with labor costs?HODGES: Yes, that is an issue. You are seeing companies talk about that and how it is harder to find good people. A lot of people can't pass drug tests. You hear a lot of that. That sort of talk out there with the executives.But those are not overwhelming issues for them. It's just part of kind of the cost of doing business, if you will, but you do hear that, you're right.BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there.Craig, it's great to get your insight.HODGES: Thank you so much.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for being here.HODGES: My pleasure.BARTIROMO: Craig Hodges joining us. We'll take a break.When we come back, Disney now part of your streaming world. Disney Plus now available. Why the company is balking the trend of sharing ratings for original content.

This morning, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu says that that leader was planning a new attack.Trey Yingst is live this morning in Gaza City with more on the cross border attacks.Trey, good morning to you.TREY YINGST, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning.Tensions are escalating here in Gaza after an assassination overnight by Israeli forces of an Islamic jihad commander they say was responsible for firing a number of rockets into southern Israel. That commander's name, Baha Abu al-Ata. That commander was killed, along with his wife overnight in an air strike.We attended the funeral this morning and emotions were high in the Gaza Strip as militants here started responding into Israel, firing a dozen rockets, oftentimes every ten minutes or so. In total, more than 150 rockets already fired into southern Israel.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announcing that his forces are now responding with air strikes inside the Gaza Strip. Many of these rockets, though, have misfired, hitting buildings inside Gaza. One building very close to where we are standing. The building we're actually standing in right now did take some shrapnel. Take a look at the scene.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)YINGST: As dozens of rockets are fired into southern Israel, the Israelis are now responding, striking targets inside the Gaza Strip just moments ago. This building was hit. There were multiple people inside. We've seen a number of injured people come out and they are looking to see whether or not anyone is injured or killed inside the building.(END VIDEO CLIP)YINGST: Israel's missile defense system, the Iron Dome, has intercepted many of the rockets that were fired over the border into Israel. Some of those, though, impacting roads. We saw some CCTV video where a rocket almost hit a car.Additionally, there were a number of times where you saw rockets hitting small buildings or factories in the towns along the border. It is important to note, though, that the factions here say they will continue a response. We've spoken with both Hamas and Islamic jihad over the weekend. They said they were ready to fight. What we have heard today is that they are prepared for an escalation.Maria.BARTIROMO: All right, Trey, thank you.Trey Yingst live in Gaza this morning.Joining me right now is retired four star general, Fox News senior strategic analyst, General Jack Keane.General, good to see you this morning.Your reaction to these actions of Gaza militants?GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: Well, what's happened here is the Israelis clearly are after one of their operational commanders. This Palestinian Islamic jihad organization, which is an Iranian backed organization. They provide the funding, at times actually provide some of the direction. And this operational commander has been conducting a number of attacks on Israel, has been planning subsequent attacks as well. They've been after him for some time and obviously they got him. Israel knows full well that retaliation will come as a result of it.This -- another undercurrent here, Maria, is, the Israelis have been negotiating with Hamas secretly about being able to establish some level of stability. And the Palestinian Islamic jihad organization, backed by Iran, refuses to participate in that. So I think maybe some of the pressure that Israel is putting on their leadership is to pull them into those negotiations if possible. But the next few days we're going to see continued escalation and exchange and then likely it will drop off.BARTIROMO: So, I mean, where is this going overall? You know, the Arabs are blaming the Israelis. The Israelis are blaming the Arabs. And where do you go from here? Is there going to be more retaliation and does this get to a point where the U.S. gets involved?KEANE: No, the U.S. will not get involved. The Israelis have never asked us for military assistance other than one time to give them some military weapons. So we will not get involved. The only thing that would ever bring the United States involved here is if the Iranians attacked the -- Israel without being provoked. Other than that, it will not take place. I mean we have a major impasse here with the political terrorist organizations Hamas, which is the number one organization. The one we're dealing with today is number two. And that organization refuses to not only recognize the state of Israel, but wants to destroy the state of Israel. It's very difficult to have any kind of peace negotiations lasting -- to move into lasting stability when you that as your basic foundation.BARTIROMO: And then there's the negotiations with the Taliban. The breaking news overnight, Afghanistan's president says that a deal with the Taliban has been reached to release two American university professors in exchange for three Taliban members. U.S. citizens Kevin King and Australian citizen Timothy Weeks were both kidnapped at gunpoint back in 2016. The three Taliban members are being released conditionally as part of this exchange.What you think about this?KEANE: Well, first of all, thankfully we're going to get our American home and our Australian back, who outrageously have nothing to do with the war whatsoever, were at a university doing their work there and certainly had no reason to be taken as hostages. The Taliban do that for the very reasons we see here because it gets them some payoff.What this exchange is about is one of the Taliban that's being exchanged, his name is Anas Haqqani. He is the brother of leader of the Haqqani network and the number two in the overall Taliban organization. The Afghans have had him in captivity since 2014, some five years. So his release is what this is all about, make no mistake about it.Whether we see this as a steppingstone to negotiations between the Afghans and the Taliban remains to be seen. The Afghan government wants to negotiate with the Taliban. The Taliban does not want to negotiate with the Afghan government. They only want to negotiate with the United States, which I think is an absolute absurdity. How do you ever have any peaceful stability in Afghanistan if you're not going to negotiate with the government that runs Afghanistan?BARTIROMO: Right. Right.Where does Iran fit into this, general? You know you had the United Nations watchdog finding that Iran is still breaching terms of the 2015 nuclear deal struck with major international powers. The country enriching uranium at an underground site, accelerating enrichment across the board. So, first, does Iran have -- is that part of the story in terms of this Taliban exchange and what about this uranium enrichment?KEANE: Yes, what the Iranians are really trying to do is get economic relief from Germany, France and the United Kingdom, who are also participants in a nuclear deal with the United States, Russia and China. The United States, obviously, pulled out of that deal. So they've been steadily breaking the nuclear deal restrictions on storage of uranium, on making of centrifuges, and numbers of them, of enriching uranium and now they're doing it at a secret site that they're not supposed to be doing it at. All this is designed to get those three country's attention.What do they want? They want economic relief from the sanctions that President Trump has imposed on that country. That's what this is about. It's blackmail in every sense of the word. The Europeans have not given into it so far and I hope they keep their spine here and -- and refuse to give into it. As such, the Iranians will likely continue down this path a little further, but also go into their kit bag and probably pull out another military operation to destroy some capacity that hurts the oil flow out of the Persian Gulf, whether it's tankers, whether it's oil fields or some distribution system to get the world's attention for the same reason to put pressure on President Trump to ease up on the sanctions.BARTIROMO: And I assume that the U.S. is not going to be deterred by this. The sanctions are the sanctions.KEANE: Yes, the U.S. knows full well that in almost 40 years now no president has ever gotten Iran's attention to the degree that President Trump has got it. And he's not going to give up on that by throttling back on that --BARTIROMO: Yes.KEANE: Without something that's reciprocal and real. And we don't have anything that's real from the Iranians so far.BARTIROMO: Let me end on the budget, a little more than a week of funding left for the federal government. Lawmakers are working to solve the budgetary questions, including funding for the military. Senate Democrats voted against a motion to consider legislation on the matter.General, I know we've got the budget, $738 billion for the military, but they're living from continuing resolution to continuing resolution, as you've said in the past. Is this politics? Is this because the Democrats do not like what the president is doing with the wall, using money for the wall and so they just won't agree to a budget? What's your take on all of this?KEANE: Yes, I mean both Republicans and Democrats have already agreed to the Defense Department buildup to 738 billion, as you declared. Now we're trying to actually get the formal legislation done. And they're pushing back on, I think, two things that are impacting on it, one is the amount of money for the border wall that is in the budget, a small amount of money compared to the 738 billion, a single digit amount of money in terms of billions, and the second thing, I think it's the overall impasse that we're dealing with the Congress because of the impeachment cloud that's just affecting everybody to go to their own corners.And the continuing resolution, so our viewers understand, flattens the Trump defense budget. That's exactly what it does because it keeps us at last year money levels. And here's what's happening, the Army wants to start 29 new procurement programs to catch up to Russia and China. The Army's got 31 research programs that it needs to start to include hypersonic missile weapons and also cyber defense. The Air Force has got 2,000 pilots that it's got incentive programs that have -- that's new money in this budget to get those 2,000 pilots. The Navy's got major ship, 14 plus ships, that is needs to put into maintenance and also it has to buy smart weapons, cruise missiles and the like, which we have shortages off that are almost at emergency levels. That's what this new money -- This is a portion of what the new money -- none of that will get done.BARTIROMO: Wow.KEANE: So that -- and that's outrageous if this thing doesn't go through.BARTIROMO: One more thing -- one more thing not getting done because of the impeachment inquiry taking the oxygen out of the room, I guess.General, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much.KEANE: Yes, good talking to you, Maria.BARTIROMO: General Jack Keane joining us there.Coming up, the deep freeze. Scary moment as a plane skids off a snowy runway in Chicago, as millions of Americans brace for an arctic blast this week. We've got your forecast.Then, "Jeopardy" taking a pause. A contestant nearly bringing host Alex Trebek to tears. Wait till you see what happened last night.Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Get ready for an arctic blast delivering bitter cold and snow to several parts of the country.Cheryl Casone with the details now in headlines.Cheryl.Whoo.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: I know. Here we go. Bundle up, right, Maria. We could see records being shattered today as freezing temperatures are blanketing much of the country. Nearly six inches of snow has fallen in Chicago. By the way, a plane there also slid off the icy runway in O'Hare.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're sliding. We're sliding! We're sliding!UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, no, no, no, no.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think we landed.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: I think we landed. OK, the landing gear snapped on this American Airlines flight. Nobody was hurt, but the incident and the weather caused more than 1,200 flight cancellations in the city alone yesterday.The snow is falling as far south as Arkansas, believe it or not. The cold weather pushing east right now. Get your hats out, everybody, here in New York.All right, more bad news for Nissan. Earnings for the latest quarter plunging 70 percent from a year ago and the company lowered its sales guidance for the full year. Nissan also slashed its dividend by 65 percent. They are still struggling to get their financial backs on track following the arrest of former chairman Carlos Ghosn last year. Shares of Nissan are down 18 percent so far this year.Well, SpaceX launched 60 more satellites into space yesterday as part of their Starlink mission to bring high speed Internet to remote parts of the world. SpaceX says it hopes to have near global coverage of the populated areas of the world by 2021.Then there is this. Check this out. A "Jeopardy" contestant nearly bringing host Alex Trebek to tears by answering a question.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ALEX TREBEK, HOST, "JEOPARDY": Let's take a look at your response. Did you come up with the right one? No. What is, we love you, Alex. That's very kind of you. Thank you.It cost you $1,995. You're left with $5.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Oh, well, the contestant says he decided to write that message after Trebek revealed he was restarting his treatment, Maria, for pancreatic cancer. By the way, that contestant lost all of his money by putting that question out there. Yes.BARTIROMO: Oh.CASONE: Yes, I know. I know. Our best wishes to Alex Trebek.BARTIROMO: Absolutely. And he's been so forthcoming with his diagnosis and the way he's treating it.CABOT PHILLIPS, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, CAMPUSREFORM.ORG: Yes. I think we should start a GoFundMe for that contestant there. Give him some of that money back.BARTIROMO: He's been in our homes for so many years, you know, you feel like it's a personal friend.We do love you, Alex Trebek. Thinking -- thinking good thought.Cheryl, thank you.Coming up, big tech weaves itself into American health care. Google reportedly attempting to get access to your personal health info next. The top story in "The Journal" this morning, Google amassing personal medical records. Wait until you hear this.Then, a whole new world of streaming. We are taking a look at the launch of Disney Plus this morning. Stay with us. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.President Trump just tweeted on the economy. Here's what the president just wrote. The economy is booming. Seems set to have yet another record day, writes the president. The president, of course, will be in New York today, making remarks to the New York Economic Club. He will likely touch on the economy.We are watching Disney Plus this morning. The company going live overnight. It is offering nearly 500 films, more than 7,000 television episodes of original and classic programming. But the service is differing itself from the competition, not publicly sharing viewership numbers for the original content.Joining us right now is Lifewire.com editor in chief Lance Ulanoff.And, Lance, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks for being here.LANCE ULANOFF, EDITOR IN CHIEF, LIFEWIRE.COM: Good to have (INAUDIBLE).BARTIROMO: Why doesn't Disney want us to see the ratings?ULANOFF: Well, did Netflix offer up their ratings early on? I mean there's still, to this point, only sort of doing dribs and drabs and they're starting to do more reveals on how many people are watching stuff, especially as they move into sort of theatrical releases on movies. But it's early days for Disney. I mean, look, I honestly think Disney Plus is going to be a huge hit. They have --BARTIROMO: I agree with you.ULANOFF: They have something that a lot of the competitors don't have, which is all of this IP, all of these franchises. I mean just lined up. I signed up this -- actually overnight because it went live and through Verizon I got a year free. And, believe me, a lot of people are going to do that. But they undercut people on prices, $6.99, you know, so I know Apple's $4.99, but Apple only has basically a handful of shows.BARTIROMO: Yes.ULANOFF: I mean Disney has a library. I --BARTIROMO: But look at the acquisitions they've made, Marvel, Lucas Films, Pixar, all those animations.ULANOFF: And not even just that. I was thinking about because there's a --BARTIROMO: Star Wars.ULANOFF: There's a box of VHS tapes in my house. Know what they are? They're all Disney films. Because when my kids were young, that's all we did and they watched them over and over again.BARTIROMO: That's right.ULANOFF: Think of what's going to happen in houses across America with parents who are like, I'm just going to plug them in because they've got one show after another and the library is vast and it's growing. I mean there's -- they're going to grow really fast and they're -- they're honestly the 800-pound gorilla in the room here.BARTIROMO: And they just bought the Fox entertainment assets. There's that as well.Meanwhile, Netflix has to spend $15 billion a year, or $13 billion a year, something --ULANOFF: I know and that won't -- and one won't stop. And Apple has to spend a ton of money too and they're probably not spending enough yet. They just did a little shake-up of the top of their entertainment group to try and make sure they get it right because they'd have great reviews and maybe not coming out of the box as strong as they wanted.BARTIROMO: We want to ask you about this health care story in "The Journal" this morning.ULANOFF: Yes.BARTIROMO: This is a top story. Google amass personal medical records. Apparently the initiative code named Project Nightingale appears to be the biggest effort yet to gain a toe hold in the health care industry through the handling of patient's medical data, writes "The Journal" this morning.Lance, what do you think about this, because the data involved is encompassing lab results, doctor diagnosis, hospital records. Neither parents nor doctors have been notified that their data is being used.ULANOFF: Yes. Well, it wasn't handled very well at all. This comes out of a deal from July of this year between Ascension and Google and basically moving their data to the cloud, which, by the way, is what everybody's doing with all sorts of data. And health care data, it's actually really useful to have it all sort of centralized in the cloud instead of stove pipes of data for your most type of information. The problem is that Google and Ascension didn't seem to notify the doctors and the patients that this was happening.Google has assured everyone they -- you know, finally came out with a press release and they assured everyone they're not revealing this or releasing it to any third party companies. They're not going to sell advertising against it (ph). I actually buy that because this is big -- health care is big business. You don't want to undermine your business because they're going to try and get other health care providers to do the exact same thing, to put their data in the cloud, to organize it so they have a central portal to see the full picture of somebody's health plan. If they tried selling ads against it, no one would do it because no patient would buy it.BARTIROMO: Yes.ULANOFF: They'd be like, no, don't put my data in the hands of somebody who's going to sell ads against it. So Google won't do that.But health care is a super big business. Everybody -- everybody in the tech space is going into it. You know, when you wear your Apple Watch --BARTIROMO: Yes.ULANOFF: What does Apple talk about all the time, the health care aspects, right? This has an EKG in it, right?BARTIROMO: Right.ULANOFF: It can check, do I have sinus rhythm. Probably at this morning, maybe not, I'm too excited. But, you know, this is the idea that everybody's getting into this.BARTIROMO: Yes. No, I know, absolutely. And we've reported that many times, health care is the leading growth story within tech.But, I mean, what about privacy, Nancy.NANCY TENGLER, CIO, LAFFER TENGLER INVESTMENTS: Yes.BARTIROMO: I mean there's the law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, that's called HIPAA.TENGLER: Yes. I know. This is astonish to me that they didn't let the doctors or the patients know. I mean I do think like Apple has a much better track record on privacy. And the fact that Google had to come out is indicative of the fact that people don't trust that company.ULANOFF: Well, that's true. Yes.TENGLER: And I'm a reluctant shareholder.BARTIROMO: "The Journal" reported it and then after "The Journal" reported it then they come out with a press release. Really?ULANOFF: Now, Google says -- I don't know anything about how HIPAA works but Google has said, this is actually HIPPA compliant, which means that probably they read the fine print and said, we actually -- if we do it this way and don't say anything to anybody, we're OK. I don't know how that works. But that is their claim on it.But you're absolutely right, I talk to people all the time who won't have Google or Nest devices in their home because they don't trust Google.TENGLER: Right.BARTIROMO: Right.ULANOFF: And, yes, Google makes their money through advertising. So, you know, they should have done it differently.BARTIROMO: We're not going to see an ad to buy a blood pressure machine or something like that?Lance, thank you.ULANOFF: I sure hope not.BARTIROMO: Great to see you. Lance Ulanoff.We'll be right back. Stay with us.Load-Date: November 12, 2019End of Document

SENATORS RICK SCOTT AND JOSH HAWLEY TO NBC: STAND UP FOR HUMAN RIGHTS; REFUSE TO AIR OLYMPICS HOSTED IN COMMUNIST CHINAStates News ServiceDecember 19, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 647 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by Florida Senator Rick Scott:Today, Senators Rick Scott and Josh Hawley wrote a letter to the Chief Executive Officer of NBC Universal and the President of NBC Olympics urging them to put human rights over profits by requesting that the International Olympic Committee re-bid the 2022 Olympics, which is being hosted in Communist China, or refuse to air the 2022 games.Read the letter HERE or below.December 19, 2019Mr. Stephen BurkeChief Executive OfficerNBC Universal30 Rockefeller PlazaNew York, NY 10112Mr. Gary ZenkelPresidentNBC OlympicsOne Blachey RoadStamford, CT 06902Dear Mr. Burke and Mr. Zenkel:As the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing approach, we write to you with grave concern about the decision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to allow a Communist regime with an abysmal record on human rights to host a global sporting event that attracts athletes and spectators from all across the world. By doing so, you are placing profits over principles, and ensuring that China can be accepted into the international system even as it violates its basic rules and tenets.Communist China is one of the great human rights abusers in the world, and it presents a threat to the safety and security of every athlete and tourist who will travel to Beijing. General Secretary Xi has set up a surveillance infrastructure in Beijing that tracks every person's location and internet activity. Communist China uses millions of cameras, powered by facial recognition technology, to spy on and persecute those who criticize the regime. The 2022 Olympic Games in Beijing will provide the Chinese government access to a global array of dignitaries, athletes, corporations, and government entities, a risk that should be avoided at all costs.On top of the concerns about Chinese surveillance, in November, documents obtained by the New York Times revealed the lengths to which Communist China uses this technology to track and oppress Uyghurs, a Muslim ethnic group in the province in Xianjing. The documents showed how the Communist regime weaponizes military surveillance to spy on civilians and treat them as military threats, instead of human beings endowed with personal dignity. And they confirmed, as had previously been reported, that more than a million Uyghurs are in prison and "re-education camps," simply because of their religion.Many of us have shared similar concerns directly with the IOC. Unfortunately, in one response the IOC claimed that it must remain "strictly politically neutral" with regard to Communist China and would take no action. We find that response to be woefully lacking.We hope you, unlike the IOC, understand that this is not about politics, but about human rights and the security of athletes and international visitors. We also hope you know Communist China did not abide by the Host City Contract in the 2008 Beijing Winter Olympics, and its long history of breaking promises shows that it is not a country that can be trusted.NBC Universal is faced with an important decision. As a media organization, it also has a moral responsibility to inform the public. By overlooking China's human rights record, you betray your viewers in misleading them about the most important threat facing our values and our way of life. Please pick human rights over profits. If Communist China continues to persecute religious minorities, forcibly harvest organs of innocent civilians, oppress the people of Hong Kong, spy on civilians, and imprison political dissidents, they should forfeit their rights to host an event that is supposed to bring the world together. We urge NBC to stand with us and request that the IOC re-bid the 2022 Olympics or refuse to air the 2022 games.We look forward to hearing your decision on this important matter.Sincerely,Rick ScottUnited States SenatorJosh HawleyUnited States SenatorLoad-Date: December 20, 2019End of Document

All rights reserved.This content is provided to LexisNexis by Comtex News Network, Inc.Length: 20743 wordsBodyHourly In Play (R)Updated: 18-Nov-19 16:01 ET15:51SCANX Large cap notable movers of interest -- Yandex (YNDX) gains on proposed amendments to corporate governance structure, repurchase authorization -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable large cap movers of interest ($10 bln - $200 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Large Cap GainersYNDX (40.12 +12.1%): Authorized a $300 mln Class A share repurchase program. Furthermore, co's Board approved targeted amendments to co's corporate governance structure geared toward allowing co to "respond to an evolving regulatory environment" while supporting stakeholder and business interests. The amendments, among other terms, include the creation of a Public Interest Foundation with limited governance rights; co's Priority Share, currently held by Sberbank, will be transferred to the Public Interest Foundation, and its terms will be amended in such a way that will give the Public Interest Foundation the right to block the accumulation by a single entity of shares representing 10% or more of economic or voting interests in co (vs current 25% threshold). Co is also proposing an amendment to the automatic conversion feature Class B shares and proposing to provide additional rights to Class A shareholders. The stock advances to three-month highs. SNAP (14.63 +4.91%): In recent events, co's CEO, Evan Spiegel, appeared on CNBC this morning; topics addressed during his interview included expectations for acceleration in yr/yr revenue growth in Q4 and co's practice of subjecting all advertising on the platform to review, including through fact-checking political advertising. LYFT (44.97 +4.47%): Today, corporate on-demand transportation company Gett announced the closure of its New York rideshare business, Juno, effective today, and announced a strategic partnership with co to offer ride access to corporate clients in the US beginning next year. Juno's closure is "a result of both Gett's increased focus on the corporate transportation sector and the enactment of misguided regulations in New York City earlier this year," per Gett's press release; all Juno riders will be invited to join the Lyft platform.Large Cap LosersSPOT (140.4 -4.82%): In recent competition-oriented press, headlines have today indicated that Amazon (AMZN) is updating its Music app for iOS and Android and expanding its music offering to introduce a free version of the service, and other reports have suggested that the company behind social media video app TikTok may launch its own music streaming service. We noted activity in co's Weekly Nov22 143 puts earlier today (see 11/18 10:31 OPTNX). The stock drops to its lowest levels for the month of November. NBL (19.91 -4.65%): Lags alongside various energy sector peers as the sector underperforms the broader market on lower pricing for energy commodities. (Related: CLR, COP, EOG...) CRWD (57.64 -3.53%): Continued volatility; the stock pulls back after advancing circa +27% through the prior three sessions.15:42MJ ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (-4%) hits new lows as cannabis companies continue to struggle with scaling operations in the legal Canadian market (16.06 -0.74)MMNFF -21.85% ACB -15.57% SPRWF -12.08% KERN -12.45% TGODF -10.59% HEXO -10.34% APHA -10.12% OGI -8.73% WLDFF -8.24% SNDL -7.99% NETE -7.93% CTST -7.26% CGC -6.81% KSHB -4.84% MJ -4.24% VFF -4.11% IIPR -3.36% GGBXF -3.08% STZ -2.58% CRON -2.07%15:15SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Qudian (QD) declines following third quarter earnings press -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersGSX (16.76 +12.41%): Spikes to two-week highs on higher than average volume, moderating month-to-date losses; the stock had traded near record highs at the end of October. MDCO (57.36 +10.34%): Presented data from its ORION-9 and ORION-10 programs for inclisiran, which evaluated it as treatment to lower LDL-C in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, respectively; in both studies, the inclisiran therapy met all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, was well-tolerated, and demonstrated an "excellent" safety profile, including no treatment-related liver or renal abnormalities. Co expects to file regulatory submissions in the US in Q4 of 2019 and in Europe in Q1 of 2020.PTON (29.52 +8.42%): The September IPO sees continued volatility, now having gained circa +14% through the most recent two sessions; it today establishes new record highs on above average volume. We noted activity in co's options trading earlier today, including interest in co's Jan20 35 calls this afternoon (see 14:00 OPTNX).Mid Cap LosersQD (5.95 -20.67%): Missed consensus for Q3 EPS while topping revenue estimates (+34.3% yr/yr to RMB 2.59 bln). Lowered total FY19 non-GAAP net income guidance to RMB4.0 bln (prior RMB4.5 bln), citing a strategic effort to reduce risk-taking loan balance and focus on higher quality borrowers via open-platform. Co noted that it implemented a conservative strategy of reducing credit volumes in its risk undertaking business and paused its credit trial program to manage macro-driven risk and stabilize delinquency rates; co believes that "the recent exit of many smaller players may create further credit liquidity pressure for the Chinese consumption credit sector," prompting co's conservative approach for its risk-taking book in the final quarter of the year and its guidance revision. At seven-month lows. ABMD (184.06 -17.55%): Presentations by research teams at the American Heart Association's annual meeting this weekend called into question the safety of co's Impella device, suggesting that the device is associated with a higher risk of adverse events and higher costs relative to lower-tech offerings that came before. Drops to multi-week lows. ACB (2.32 -15.1%): Continued weakness on heavy volume following last week's first quarter results. The stock has now declined by circa 36% over the last week. It trades at two-year lows. The broader cannabis sector also lags notably today.15:12HD Home Depot: Earnings Preview; HD recently said the US consumer is exceptionally healthy (238.29 +0.98)Home Depot (HD) is set to report Q3 (Oct) earnings results tomorrow before the open (last quarter it released at 6:00 ET) with a conference call to follow at 9am ET.The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for Q3 EPS is $2.53. The revenue consensus estimate is $27.52 bln. Note: HD typically guides for revenue, EPS and comps in the press release for the full year. Same store comps are always a key metric for Home Depot. In Q2 (Jul), comps came in at +3.0% (+3.1% US comps), up a bit from Q1 (Apr) comps of +2.5% (+3.0% US comps). HD said it overcame a tough May and continued lumber price deflation (lower lumber prices hurts comps) to deliver accelerating comp performance throughout JulQ: Comps were +0.6% in May, +4.1% in June, and +4.7% in July. Last quarter, Home Depot, lowered its full year comp guidance to approx. +4%, mostly to reflect the impact of lumber price deflation as well as some conservatism to account for tariffs. Home Depot was pretty bullish at a recent Goldman Investor Conference, saying that the US consumer right now is exceptionally healthy thanks to record low unemployment and making up almost the whole of GDP growth at this point. Also, homeowners have seen some home price appreciation in recent years. We'll see if management maintains this view as we near the end of the year. Because Home Depot is such a large retailer, its results should provide some early clues on how robustly the consumer is spending. Last week, Wal-Mart (WMT) kicked off the retail earnings parade with a good result. We'll see if HD can match that. However, tariffs, hurricane sales and lumber price deflation could impact comps this quarter. In particular, HD's results will set expectations for Lowe's (LOW) which reports on Wednesday before the open. Other key reporting dates: HD, KSS & TJX (Nov 19, before open), TGT & LOW (Nov 20, before open), M (Nov 21, before open), GPS (Nov 21, after the close), PVH (Nov 25, after the close), BBY & BURL (Nov 26, before open), KR (late Nov/early Dec), DG (Dec 5, before open), COST (Dec 12, after the close).15:07BONDX Treasury Market SummaryTreasuries Maintain Bullish BiasU.S. Treasuries began the new week with gains across the curve. The cash session started with modest losses that followed a subdued overnight affair, which saw more, albeit slight, easing from the People's Bank of China. However, Treasuries reclaimed their starting losses immediately after the cash open, as the market responded to a tweet from a CNBC anchor in Beijing, who reported that Chinese officials have a pessimistic view of the ongoing negotiations with the U.S. due to President Trump's reluctance to roll back import tariffs. The report prompted a spike into the green, which was followed by a rally past Friday's intraday highs. Treasuries marked their best levels of the day around 10:30 ET, spending the remainder of the session near those highs. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.2% to 97.78. Yield Check: 2-yr: -2 bps to 1.59% 3-yr: -2 bps to 1.59% 5-yr: -3 bps to 1.63% 10-yr: -3 bps to 1.81% 30-yr: -2 bps to 2.29%News: President Trump met with Fed Chairman, Jay Powell, and Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, today. The Department of Commerce extended a temporary license that allows U.S. companies to continue selling components to Huawei. The People's Bank of China lowered its reverse repurchase rate by five basis points to 2.50%. British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, said that every Conservative candidate for a parliamentary seat pledged to vote in favor of the Brexit deal if Conservatives win majority in the upcoming election. Singapore's October trade surplus totaled SGD3.78 bln (last surplus of SGD3.83 bln). Non-Oil exports fell 2.9% m/m (expected 1.4%; last -3.3%), contracting 12.3% yr/yr (expected -10.4%; last -8.1%). Hong Kong's October Unemployment Rate rose to 3.1% from 2.9%. Today's Data: The NAHB Housing Market Index dipped to 70 in November (Briefing.com consensus 71) from 71 in October.

There's a nervous-sounding headline about the state of trade negotiations between the U.S. and China, the market dips on that headline, and then it bounces back.In turn, the gains are not material. They are modest, but nonetheless, they have kept the major indices on a record-setting course.Currently, the S&P 500 is up just 0.1%, which is just about its high for the session. The move there has seen a subsidence of the outperformance of defensive-oriented areas, like utilities (+0.4%) and consumer stales (+0.6%), and the ascendance of the growth-oriented sectors, like communication services (+0.5%) and information technology (+0.4%).There hasn't been a news catalyst for this performance shift; rather, it is indicative of a market that is playing with a bullish bias and riding a trading trend until it no longer proves to be a friend.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.2%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 are up 0.1%; and the Russell 2000 is down 0.3%.14:00OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:PTON Jan20 35 calls (volume: 11300, open int: 760, implied vol: ~62%, prev day implied vol: 51%). We noted action in co's Apr20 35 calls early in today's session (see 10:31 OPTNX). The underlying stock now traders higher by more than 7%. Co's next earnings report is expected in early February.LK Dec 30 calls (volume: 7010, open int: 1580, implied vol: ~82%, prev day implied vol: 73%). One transaction traded 1,000 contracts.

The Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%, and the Russell 2000 is down 0.3%.Some hesitation may be attributed to a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, Eunice Yoon, saying a government source told her that the trade mood in Beijing has turned pessimistic due to President Trump not backing any tariff rollbacks. The tweet has contended with Chinese state media indicating that Phase One talks were constructive over the weekend.From an equity-index level, the strong resistance to any sort of pullback remains indicative of an expectation for some sort of an agreement. Investors remain inclined toward stocks, but money is flowing into the more defensive-oriented sectors like the S&P 500 consumer staples (+0.8%), utilities (+0.8%), and real estate (+0.8%) sectors.The energy sector (-1.4%) is today's outright laggard amid a decline in oil prices ($56.78/bbl, -$0.94, -1.6%). The industrials sector (-0.5%) is under broad-based selling pressure, too.Separately, Apple (AAPL 266.47, +0.70, +0.3%) continues to grind out new all-time highs.In corporate news, Netflix (NFLX 304.18, +9.15, +3.1%) shares are seeing increased demand on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman have taken a large stake in the company. HP Inc. (HPQ 19.92, -0.26, -1.3%) rejected the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 38.94, unch), although it remains open to a deal.U.S. Treasuries are benefiting from a conservative mindset today. The uptick in demand has the benchmark 10-yr yield down two basis points to 1.81%.

This partnership will allow Gett to expand its reach across the United States, seamlessly serving its business clients on the Lyft network, all through Gett's SaaS platform for business travelers.Juno is shutting down in New York today as a result of both Gett's increased focus on the corporate transportation sector and the enactment of misguided regulations in New York City earlier this year. All Juno riders will be invited to join Lyft.11:16TALKX Market Briefing: Market checks up on tweet checkThus far, there hasn't been any follow-through on Friday's record-setting advance for the major indices, which are sporting modest losses.There is a bit of a hesitation/defensive trade mindset at work today after China-based CNBC anchor Eunice Yoon tweeted earlier this morning that a government source has told her that the mood in Beijing about a trade deal is pessimistic because President Trump hasn't endorsed any tariff rollbacks.This tweet conflicted with some of Friday's optimism, which was based on NEC Director Kudlow's indication that the two sides were getting close to an agreement and were down to the "short strokes."The fact that today's losses are far more modest that Friday's gains underscores an otherwise sticky belief that a deal of some kind will be reached; however, history on these matters dictates allowing some room for disappointment. Buyers, therefore, aren't rushing back into today's action, but knowing this market has refused to buckle on any negative-sounding news, is keeping the selling efforts in check as well.Currently, the defensive-oriented consumer staples (+1.0%), utilities (+0.8%), and real estate (+0.7%) sectors are winning standouts, while the energy (-1.4%), industrials (-0.5%), and financial (-0.3%) sectors bring up the rear.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is flat; the S&P 500 is down 0.1%; the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is down 0.5%.10:58XLP Sector Briefing: Bond Proxies (61.89 +0.56)The early portion of today's session has seen losses in most sectors, but there are some pockets of relative strength, as rate-sensitive consumer staples (+0.9%), utilities (+0.9%), and real estate (+0.7%) trade with solid gains.The three sectors account for just 14.0% of the entire S&P 500, so they have a limited impact on the overall performance of the market, but today's outperformance is largely due to one common factor: falling interest rates.Treasury yields backed down from three-month highs during the past week and they have already dipped beneath last week's lows today. Today's pressure on yields comes after a CNBC reporter in Beijing tweeted that the Chinese government has a pessimistic view of trade negotiations with the U.S., according to government sources.The continued pressure on Treasury yields means that high-yielding sectors like utilities, real estate, and consumer staples are becoming more attractive to investors.Notable movers:Consumer staples: Coty (COTY 12.18, +0.27, +2.3%), Kimberly-Clark (KMB 133.91, +2.28, +1.7%), Colgate-Palmolive (CL 67.50, +1.13, +1.7%), Walmart (WMT 120.52, +1.65, +1.4%), and Procter & Gamble (PG 122.00, +1.46, +1.2%)Utilities: Eversource Energy (ES 82.58, +1.31, +1.6%), NextEra Energy (NEE 234.20, +2.78, +1.2%), American Electric Power (AEP 90.79, +1.23, +1.4%), CMS Energy (CMS 61.63, +0.73, +1.2%), and Evergy (EVRG 65.53, +0.78, +1.2%)Real estate: Realty Income (O 78.68, +1.22, +1.6%), Equinix (EQIX 558.00, +7.59, +1.4%), Crown Castle International (CCI 136.38, +1.70, +1.3%), Welltower (WELL 85.13, +1.14, +1.4%), Healthpeak Properties (PEAK 34.97, +0.52, +1.5%)10:54ECONX President Trump tweets confirmation of 'cordial' meeting with Fed Chair Powell (311.75 -0.04)Tweet10:37ECONX Fed Chair Powell met with with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and President Trump this morning; he reiterated his monetary policy outlook, which will depend entirely on incoming information that bears on the outlook for the economyAt the President's invitation, Chair Powell met with the President and the Treasury Secretary Monday morning at the White House to discuss the economy, growth, employment and inflation.Chair Powell's comments were consistent with his remarks at his congressional hearings last week. He did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy, except to stress that the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming information that bears on the outlook for the economy.Finally, Chair Powell said that he and his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee will set monetary policy, as required by law, to support maximum employment and stable prices and will make those decisions based solely on careful, objective and non-political analysis.10:31OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:LOW Weekly Nov22 120 calls are seeing interest with 1300 contracts trading vs. open int of 110, pushing implied vol up around 18 points to ~79%.

In ORION-9, twice-yearly dosing (following initial and three-month doses) with inclisiran sodium 300 mg met all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, was well-tolerated and demonstrated an excellent safety profile. Full study results were presented during a late-breaking science session at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions in Philadelphia.For the primary endpoints of ORION-9, inclisiran delivered placebo-adjusted LDL-C reductions of 50% (71 mg/dL, p<0.0001) at day 510 in HeFH patients and demonstrated time-averaged placebo-adjusted LDL-C reductions of 45% (63 mg/dL, p<0.0001) from days 90 through 540. The overall adverse event profiles of the placebo- and inclisiran-treated groups in ORION-9 were similar. At least one serious treatment emergent adverse event was experienced by 13.8% of patients in the placebo-treated group and 7.5% of patients in the inclisiran-treated group. The incidences of deaths (0.4% vs. 0.4%) and malignancies (1.3% vs. 0.8%) were similar between the placebo and inclisiran groups, respectively. Low incidences of clinically significant elevations in liver function tests (ALT 0.4% vs. 1.2%, AST 0.4% vs. 0.8%) and serum creatinine increases (0.4% vs. 0.4%) were observed in the placebo and inclisiran groups, respectively, and none were considered related to study drug. Clinically relevant adverse events at the injection site, predominantly mild and always transient, were reported in 0.4% of placebo-treated patients vs. 13.7% of inclisiran-treated patients.09:02SSTK Shutterstock appoints Jarrod Yahes as CFO, effective December 9 (42.19 )Since October 2016, Mr. Yahes has served as the Chief Financial Officer at Zeta Global, a marketing technology company.09:01CYTK Cytokinetics and Amgen (AMGN) present results from COSMIC-HF (8.18 )Amgen, Cytokinetics, and Servier announced that new results from COSMIC-HF (Chronic Oral Study of Myosin Activation to Increase Contractility in Heart Failure), a Phase 2 trial evaluating omecamtiv mecarbil in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), will be presented today at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2019. In patients with HFrEF treated with omecamtiv mecarbil, in addition to previously reported improvements in cardiac contractility measures (including systolic function, or pumping action of the heart), measures of diastolic function were not different from placebo and, for some measures, trended towards improvement. In COSMIC-HF, 448 patients with stable, symptomatic heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <40% were randomly assigned to omecamtiv mecarbil or placebo in a double-blind fashion for 20 weeks. This post-hoc analysis assessed the effect of chronic therapy with omecamtiv mecarbil by treatment group on echocardiographic measures of diastolic function, including early (E-wave) and late (A-wave) peak mitral inflow velocities, early peak myocardial relaxation velocity (e'), isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT), tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV), and diastolic filling time.

In reaching this determination, the Board also considered the highly conditional and uncertain nature of the proposal, including the potential impact of outsized debt levels on the combined company's stock. We have great confidence in our strategy and our ability to execute to continue driving sustainable long-term value at HP. In addition, the Board and management team continue to take actions to enhance shareholder value including the deployment of our strong balance sheet for increased repurchases of our significantly undervalued stock and for value-creating M&A. We recognize the potential benefits of consolidation, and we are open to exploring whether there is value to be created for HP shareholders through a potential combination with Xerox. However, as we have previously shared in connection with our prior requests for diligence, we have fundamental questions that need to be addressed in our diligence of Xerox. We note the decline of Xerox's revenue from $10.2 billion to $9.2 billion (on a trailing 12-month basis) since June 2018, which raises significant questions for us regarding the trajectory of your business and future prospects. In addition, we believe it is critical to engage in a rigorous analysis of the achievable synergies from a potential combination. With substantive engagement from Xerox management and access to diligence information on Xerox, we believe that we can quickly evaluate the merits of a potential transaction."06:03DRNA Dicerna Pharmaceuticals and Novo Nordisk (NVO) announce agreement to discover and develop novel therapies for the treatment of liver-related cardio-metabolic diseases using Dicerna's proprietary GalXC RNAi platform technology.

China had a lot to do with the strength after state media reports suggested Phase One talks have been constructive over the weekend. Also, the PBOC announced a key interest rate cut. This has supported markets and put US futures into all-time high territory. The S&P is just off the high of 3127.75, trading around 3124. This is well off the overnight low of 3113.75.In Asia, China took the spotlight with the news out of the region. The PBOC's rate cut of its seven-day repurchase rate, took it down to 2.50% from 2.55%. The move was unexpected. This helped the Shanghai gain 0.6% on Monday and essentially get all of Friday's losses back. Hong Kong managed to bounce over 1% after suffering heavy losses last week. Japan quietly rose 0.5%. European markets saw a small pop early but have settled back in since. Although most of the trading has been lackluster, mining stocks are among the weakest groups with Gold, Silver and Platinum down in the range of 0.7-1.3%. Copper has not followed metals lower, likely due to the rate cut in China.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: +4.010 yr Note: 1.84%USD/JPY: 109.05 +0.30EUR/USD: 1.1064 +0.0015Europe: FTSE +0.1% DAX -0.1% CAC -0.2%Asia: Hang Seng +1.4% Shanghai +0.6% Nikkei +0.5%Gold (1458.50 -10.00) Silver (16.75 -0.20) Crude (57.77 +0.05)17:05WRAPX This week's biggest % gainers/losersThe following are this week's top percentage gainers and losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).This week's top % gainers Healthcare: CLVS (6.38 +77.96%), AMRN (24.02 +43.23%), COLL (18.12 +40.97%), SGRY (11.77 +35.6%), QGEN (40.56 +32.59%), DXCM (208.37 +32.47%), EPZM (15.36 +29.62%)Industrials: BE (6.53 +95.51%), TGI (28.49 +29.79%), MAXR (11.5 +28.49%)Information Technology: LASR (20.62 +46.24%), SYNA (60.37 +34.04%), COMM (14.95 +32.18%), DXC (37.23 +31.23%), CARB (22.95 +28.86%)Financials: TRUP (32.35 +36.21%), LTS (3.48 +32.82%)This week's top % losers Healthcare: ANAB (11.1 -71.29%)Industrials: AFI (3.73 -41.26%), NSP (72.9 -32.29%)Consumer Discretionary: PRTY (1.89 -66.61%), MOD (7.54 -34.94%), EXPE (95.67 -30.57%)Information Technology: RBBN (2.75 -38.82%), PLT (26.22 -35.39%)Energy: EXTN (7.56 -41.89%), GLOG (9.64 -31.58%)17:01MGI Moneygram provides restructuring update (2.68 +0.06)On November 11, 2019, the co committed to an operational plan to reduce overall operating expenses - expects to complete the workforce reduction by the end of the first quarter of 2020.

Excluding autos, retail sales jumped 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.4%) after declining an unrevised 0.1% decline in September.The key takeaway from the report, other than it shows continued growth in discretionary spending, is that it will be a positive input for Q4 GDP.

The capacity utilization rate fell to 76.7% (Briefing.com consensus 77.1%) from 77.5% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that, while the GM strike had a big impact on industrial production, things were still weak excluding that impact. To wit, the Federal Reserve reports industrial production declined 0.5% excluding motor vehicles and parts.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%) after a downwardly revised 0.1% decline (from 0.0%) in August. Total business sales were down 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.1% increase (from 0.2%) in August.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+3.7%) and sales growth (+0.5%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.Looking ahead, investors will receive Net Long-Term TIC Flows for September on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +28.7% YTDS&P 500 +24.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTDRussell 2000 +18.4% YTD16:02PJC Piper Jaffray authorizes $150 mln common stock repurchase program (76.25 +0.61)Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: November 18, 2019End of Document

Natur International Corp. and China-based Share International Sign Definitive Agreement for a Share ExchangeThomson Reuters ONENovember 11, 2019 Monday 8:00 AM ESTCopyright 2019 Comtex News Network, Inc.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 GLOBE NEWSWIRE. All rights reserved.This content is provided to LexisNexis by Comtex News Network, Inc.Length: 1285 wordsBodyEuropean Functional Product Company Acquiring Chinese-based Share International and all Chinese Operations; will be wholly Integrated into Natur International Corp.AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands, Nov. 11, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Natur International Corp., (OTCQB: NTRU), a "farm-to-functional" producer of natural and organic plant-based foods and beverages including full and broad spectrum CBD (cannabinoid) and terpene-blended consumer products, today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement for a share exchange with Share International. The combined company will be renamed "Share Natur International Corporation".The merger will put Natur International in the unique position of being able to collaborate directly with the Chinese government, and more importantly, via their executive board member, Li Zeng, who is also Chairman and CEO of Hualong (Chongqing) Ltd., a part of CQ News. Share Natur will become strategic partners with CQ News, the second largest media company in China. CQ News and the Share Natur offices are both located in the city of ChongQing, which has a population of 32 million people and is located within the ChongQing Province in Southwest China, which has over 280 million inhabitants.The combination of Natur, a leading Amsterdam-based company in the emerging functional and consumer goods marketplace, and Share International, a global import/export powerhouse and a leader in direct-to-consumer digital distribution in China with disruptive propriety software, will together form a groundbreaking vertically integrated global company. The new Share Natur International is positioned to become the professional direct-to-consumer market leader in "seed-to-sale" for both hemp-derived and health and wellness-based, functional solutions catering to both the food and non-food FMCG segments across both Europe and Asia.Share Natur is committed to the global revolution in functional foods and supplements. With the explosion of CBD and cannabinoid health and wellness products, Share Natur is capturing the momentum of this revolution, ignited in North America, and poised to sweep across Europe and China.Michael Jones, Chief Strategy Officer of Natur International, stated, "Our goal in China is simple, to bring the highest quality CBD and other functional products to the world's largest population. We have an unparalleled international executive management team and are deploying scalable smart vending machines and our proprietary mobile technology commerce platform (SHARE), which is valued over US$6 million and has been developed over 4 years, to achieve our business goals in the Chinese marketplace."With world-class non-executive board members such as Nina Storms, Boaz Wachtel, and rt. Hon. Mark Simmonds, supporting an accomplished management team, the mission of the combined companies is to disrupt traditional retail and marketplace distribution models by connecting functional products and lean distribution channels into the world's growing allegiance of demanding consumers.Spencer Chesman, Co-CEO of Natur International, commented, "This acquisition is highly strategic and instrumental for Natur as it provides us with a leading distribution platform for our growing portfolio of unique 'farm-to-functional' products. Following North American trends, consumers have been migrating towards functional health and wellness products, with validated supply chains and direct-to-consumer business models. However, there is currently no professional group leading the 'breed to brand' supply chain, and traditional retail and marketplace models do not meet the demands of today's audience. Share Natur aims to seize that leadership position with a unique vertically integrated framework securing up- and downstream proficiency and world-class collaborations that feature best in class capabilities in product, process, breeding, extraction and production in fruit, vegetable, floral and hemp science, hemp derived product, terpenes and medical cannabis."Li Zeng, CEO of Share Natur China and executive board member of Share Natur International, added, "The worldwide reach of Share International, which includes Europe and China, will make us a Eurasian market leader with cutting-edge operations offering a disruptive business model and route to market enabling huge global opportunities. By bringing together these two dynamic companies, we will focus on captivating the consumer with unique technologies and functional products."Natur International's heritage has been to offer functional and CBD-infused brands of juices, shots, smoothies and snacks. The company's unique technologies and genetics offer farm-to-functional CBD and nutrigenomic solutions in the cosmetics and beauty, health and wellness, and food and beverage categories. Their leading-edge affiliate marketing driven direct-to-consumer sales platform ensures authentic products reach a diversity of consumers at the fairest prices.About Natur International Corp.Natur, founded in 2015 to market "farm-to-functional" natural and organic plant-based foods and beverages, expanded its product portfolio this past year to include full and broad spectrum CBD (cannabinoid) and terpene-blended consumer products. With the portfolio expansion, Natur is moving swiftly to place relevant consumer goods in multiple health and wellness categories including food and beverage, snacks, health and beauty, supplements, sports and animal care. Natur personalizes nutrition and strives to enhance one's quality of life by utilizing the forces of nature, driven by science.Natur applies the most advanced and emerging hi-tech health methodologies as it markets nutritious, delicious and fresh-tasting products. By applying innovative technologies to the breeding of its plant sources, the extraction of its ingredients, and delicate shelf life extension, Natur ensures the peak of freshness, and supplies nutrient- dense products that are superior to competitors' offerings. The company remains astute to relevant "snackification" trends and goes to market through Europe's leading retailers, foodservice partners and online eCommerce subscription models.

TikTok's chief is heading to Washington to defend the video-sharing platform against censorship and privacy concerns as lawsuits and investigations pile upBusiness Insider USDecember 6, 2019 Friday 03:15 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc.

However, TikTok has repeatedly denied there's any connection or that China has any influence over the app.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.The head of TikTok is reportedly planning a trip to Washington, D.C., next week to meet with a slew of lawmakers who have harshly criticized the app over its purported ties to the Chinese government that have led to concerns over censorship and privacy.This appears to be the first visit that the TikTok chief, Alex Zhu, has made to Capitol Hill on behalf of the viral video-sharing platform, the Washington Post reported Thursday. TikTok has become an oft-discussed target among those in the US government, who recently            opened a national security investigation and have questioned how close the relationship is between the platform and its China-based parent company, ByteDance.The Post reports that Zhu will meet with Republican Sens. Josh Hawley, Tom Cotton, and Marco Rubio, all of whom have been outspoken advocates for an investigation into the platform. James Arnold, a spokesman for Cotton, told Business Insider that Zhu and the Arkansas senator wouldn't be meeting next week, but said that they "did meet on a staff level this week."Just last month, TikTok was asked to testify at a Congressional hearing on tech companies' relationship with China, but the company declined to send anyone. Hawley, who organized the hearing,            was quick to voice his disapproval at            the "empty seat treatment."Sen. Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, is notably absent from the list of lawmakers scheduled to meet with the TikTok head. Schumer helped spearhead calls by officials to investigate the platform. Schumer's office did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment by time of publication.Increasing scrutiny over ties to ChinaTikTok has been downloaded more than 1.5 billion times globally, an indicator of its rapid rise as a platform - especially loved by teens - for creating and sharing short videos and launching the latest viral memes across the internet.But since the app came to the United States in August 2018, TikTok has faced increasing scrutiny over ties to its parent company, a $75 billion company based out of China called ByteDance.            TikTok has consistently defended itself by asserting that none of its moderators are based in China, and that no "foreign government" asks the platform to censor content.TikTok has faced allegations it censors "culturally problematic" and political content that could be seen as offensive to the Chinese government, according to former employees' reports to the Washington Post and documents            obtained by The Guardian and            the German blog Netzpolitik. When pro-democracy protests broke out in Hong Kong earlier this year, TikTok was            curiously devoid of any hints of unrest, and videos instead documented a prettier picture.More recently, an American teen named Feroza Aziz had her account suspended after she went viral for using her videos, disguised as makeup tutorials, to speak about            China's treatment of Muslims. TikTok has since issued an apology, but blamed the removal of her anti-China videos from TikTok on "a human moderation error."Additionally, others have raised concerns that the ties between China and TikTok puts the privacy of users' data at risk. A class-action lawsuit was recently filed in California by a college student who alleges that her private information and unpublished content was accessed by TikTok without her permission and stored on servers in China.TikTok is also expected to meet with Sen. Marsha Blackburn next week over concerns about children's data and privacy on the app, as Axios reported earlier this week. TikTok            settled another lawsuit this week related to children's privacy, paying out $1.1 million related to allegations that the app collected the information of children under 13 without their parents' consent.NOW WATCH: Inside the US government's top-secret bioweapons labSee Also:• Bernie Sanders is proposing a $150 billion plan to provide 'high-speed internet for all'• Police officers are testing a Batman-like device that binds a suspect without using force - here's how it works• An ex-Googler who's now an exec at drone-maker Skydio said he went from the phone to the drone industry because 'phones have gotten kind of boring'SEE ALSO: The life of TikTok head Alex Zhu, the Musical.ly cofounder in charge of Gen Z's beloved video-sharing appLoad-Date: December 6, 2019End of Document

Co now anticipates that Section 301 tariffs will increase its cost of goods sold by approx. $19 mln in Q4 if tariffs are fully implemented. Pressure on merchandise margin based on growth in lower-margin consumables, payroll cost pressure in distribution centers, and increased run rates for repairs and maintenance, utilities, and depreciation may also weigh on Q4 results.

Veeva is the customer relationship management (CRM) leader for the sector, and its content management platform and suite of applications in the Veeva Vault are adding services for customers and boosting growth for shareholders.Veeva guided for third quarter non-GAAP EPS up 21% to $0.54-0.55 with revenue up 22% to $274-275 mln. Veeva has never missed on the top or bottom line since its IPO six years ago. The SaaS business model results in highly visible revenue streams.Analysts expect fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS up 18% to $0.53 with revenue up 20% to $278.6 mln.The company has guided for fiscal 2020 non-GAAP EPS up 30% to $2.11-2.13 with revenue up 23% to $1.062-1.065 bln. The company tends to raise guidance as the year progresses.Veeva's stock is not cheap on any metric. With a $22 bln enterprise value, the stock trades at ~19x forward sales, ~70x adjusted earnings and 55x free cash flow estimates.Veeva shares are up 78% year-to-date and over 220% since breaking out above its IPO range in early 2017. The stock pulled back when growth stocks were out of favor in September but has reclaimed its 50-day moving average this month.15:15BONDX Treasury Market SummaryU.S. Treasuries turned in a surprisingly solid performance in the face of some otherwise encouraging new home sales data, the arrival of new supply, and a stock market that continued to push further into record territory on trade deal hope. Buying efforts were targeted on longer-dated maturities, which maintained lower yields throughout the cash session. Treasuries finished off their best levels, fading a bit after today's 5-year note auction that saw the high yield (1.587%) tail the when-issued yield (1.584%) by a small amount.Yield Check: 2-yr: -3 bps to 1.58% 3-yr: -2 bps to 1.58% 5-yr: -3 bps to 1.59% 10-yr: -2 bps to 1.74% 30-yr: -3 bps to 2.18%News: China and US spoke by phone regarding trade: China says two sides "reached consensus on how to resolve related issues and agreed to maintain communication on the remaining issues"; US side acknowledges phone call took place but declines to comment on what was discussedFed Chair Powell says in speech, "Monetary policy is now well positioned to support a strong labor market and return inflation decisively to our symmetric 2 percent objective. If the outlook changes materially, policy will change as well. At this point in the long expansion, I see the glass as much more than half full."Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan (voting FOMC member in 2020) said in CNBC interview that Q4 will be weak because of inventory adjustments but expects economy to grow at 2% next year.Fed Governor Brainard suggests Fed should explore using interest rate caps in future downturns if effective funds rate falls to lower bound.European Central Bank policymaker Francois Villeroy de Galhau said that low rates will continue supporting the economy and that countries like Germany and Netherlands should increase their fiscal spending.$41 bln 5-yr note auction sees high yield of 1.5875% on 2.50 bid-to-cover ratio, which exceeded the prior 12-auction average of 2.37.Today's data:New home sales in October decreased 0.7% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) from an upwardly revised 738,000 (from 701,000) in September. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 31.6%.The key takeaway from the report is that the October showing was better than what meets the eye at first blush given the large, upward revision to the prior month's number.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November eased to 125.5 (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from 126.1 in October, marking the fourth straight monthly retreat.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers continue to remain relatively upbeat about the short-term outlook based in part on income prospects, which should be a support for holiday spending activity.Advance October Intl.

There is a conference call scheduled for 10:00 ET. Q4 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.14 (-7% yr/yr) on revenue (equipment sales) of $8.41 bln (roughly unchanged yr/yr). FY19 guidance calls for net income of $3.2 bln and revenue growth of +4% in equipment sales and +5% in net sales. FY20 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $11.13 (versus $9.92 estimate in FY19 or +5.6% yr/yr) on revenue of $35.5 bln (vs $34.6 bln estimate in 2019 or +3.8% yr/yr). Looking back, the company missed on EPS four out the last four quarters and missed on revenues two out of the last four quarters. DE shares rose 4% following its Q3 report despite a miss on EPS and lowered FY19 guidance. The Q3 report was consistent with DE's recent history, as it came into this quarter having missed EPS for five consecutive quarters. The Agriculture & Turf segment was the weak link this quarter, as segment sales declined 6% yr/yr to $5.95 bln due to lower shipment volumes and unfavorable FX. Segment operating margin declined quite a bit to 10.3% from 12.8% last year due to inefficiencies from lower shipments coupled with higher production costs.It is clear that the tariffs are hurting Deere on two fronts: It's not just that sales of equipment into those regions that are getting impacted (especially China), but it's also that US farmers getting hurt by China are not buying soybeans and other crops. It's understandable that US farmers are holding off on buying new ag equipment, as nobody knows how long this dispute is going to last.DE has a $55.5 bln valuation and trades at 16 2021 EPS vs CAT which trades at 13 times 2021 EPS.Based on the DE Weekly Nov29 $176 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~4% in either direction by weekly expiration (Friday).On a positive report, look for resistance near the $180-181 area, while support sits near the $165-166 vicinity.14:34SUMRX Earnings Out This Afternoon/Tomorrow MorningThis Afternoon: ADSK BOX CENT DELL GES HPQ KEYS QADA VEEV VMWTomorrow Morning: DAKT DE DOYU FRO UXIN14:32COMDX Energy Settlement PricesJan Crude Oil futures rose $0.23 (0.4%) to $58.3/barrel Jan Natural Gas $0.06 lower (-2.28%) at $2.529/MMBtu Jan RBOB Gasoline settled $0.02 higher (1.34%) at $1.6932/gallon Jan Heating oil futures settled $0.01 higher (0.54%) at $1.954/gallon14:25VMW VMware: Earnings Preview -- Has been on recent M&A shopping spree (166.07 -2.81)VMware (VMW), which specializes in cloud computing and virtualization software, is set to report Q3 (Oct) results today after the close (last time they reported at 16:15 ET, 15 minutes after the close) with a call to follow at 4:30pm ET.The CapitalIQ consensus for Q3 (Oct) non-GAAP EPS is $1.43 and for revenue it's $2.41 bln. Note: VMW typically guides on the call for EPS and revs for the next quarter and full year. It also guides for license revenue and non-GAAP operating margin. Last time, it guided for Q3 (Oct) non-GAAP EPS of approx $1.42 and revenue of approx $2.40 bln. It also guided to Q3 license revenue of approx $950 mln and non-GAAP operating margin of 30.3%. Of course, the highlight last quarter was VMware announcing it will acquire Pivotal Software (PVTL) and Carbon Black (CBLK). (PVTL should close by Jan 31 while CBLK closed on Oct 8.) In addition, VMW reported earnings, including a $0.05 beat and revenue upside. However, its Q3 (Oct) guidance was below consensus. So it was sort of a mixed result overall. But clearly the focus was on these two purchases. PVTL provides software development tools so that developers can create new cloud-native applications more quickly and easily. VMW already owned a stake in PVTL, so a combination made a lot of sense. Carbon Black was sort of a different animal as it focuses on cybersecurity but VMW sees it as complementary to existing VMW cybersecurity platforms. We will be looking for any updates there. The big picture here is that VMW is really pushing into the cloud. The company started out with server virtualization. However, over the last 5-10 years, VMW has expanded to a number of adjacent areas: management, software-defined networking, storage and end-user computing. Each of these businesses now are in the $1 bln range. These deals continue VMW's transformation. Finally, VMW typically reports EPS upside in the $0.04-0.10 range over the past five quarters. It also generally reports revenue upside, but the top line beat is usually more modest. The stock sold off following its JulQ report in late August, but it has recovered nicely since then, up more than 25%. Much of this move is probably from overall strength in tech stocks, but it also tells us investors are pretty optimistic about its OctQ report.14:17SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) gains following upbeat third quarter press -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersDKS (46.73 +18.51%): Posts its highest levels in more than two years after posting upside Q3 results; co topped consensus for both EPS and revs (+5.6% yr/yr to $1.96 bln). Consolidated same store sales surpassed estimates, increasing +6.0%, co's strongest comp gain since 2013, while eCommerce sales increased +13%, forming approx. 13% of total net sales. Co reported that it saw increases in both average ticket and transactions and that it recorded growth across its three primary product categories. Guided FY20 EPS above consensus. Forecasts a +2.5-3% comp sales increase for the full year. ARWR (66.82 +17.25%): Again advances to fresh multi-year highs after reporting FY19 financial results and other company updates; revs jumped +946% yr/yr to $168.8 mln. Co noted in its prepared remarks, among other updates, that there are now five TRiM-enabled candidates in the clinic; co plans to submit regulatory filings for two additional clinical candidates over the next month and intends to have 10 TRiM-enabled candidates in clinical studies targeting four different cell types and to be in three pivotal studies by the end of 2020. NTNX (33.15 +15.29%): Reported upside Q1 EPS and revenue. Billings declined yr/yr to $380.0 mln from $383.6 mln in the prior year quarter, reflecting billings compression from co's ongoing transition to a subscription model and a significant reduction in hardware billings yr/yr. Software and Support TCV revs increased +9% yr/yr to $305.0 mln on a +5% Software and Support TCV billings increase to $370.3 mln. Issued in-line Q2 EPS and FY20 revs guidance while guiding Q2 revs below consensus. Co sees Software and Support TCV billings between $1.65-1.75 bln for FY20. Price target raised at various firms, including Maxim Group (to $52 from $48). At six-month highs.Mid Cap LosersBECN (29.3 -12.2%): Missed consensus for Q4 EPS and revs (+4.9% yr/yr to $2.03 bln). Sales increased yr/yr for consolidated residential roofing (+12.7%) and non-residential roofing (+2.4%) products but decreased for consolidated complementary products (fell 3.2%). Results were negatively impacted by lower gross margins and higher acquisition-related costs relative to 2018; meanwhile, existing market sales growth in residential roofing had a positive impact. Co management commented that co is "now pivoting from a growth run via acquisitions" to focus on organic growth, margin expansion, and operating expense discipline. Also announced that CFO Joseph Nowicki will depart co later this year in order to focus on his family, charitable work, and Board service; he will remain during co's search for his successor. At three-month lows. KRTX (74.79 -8.99%): Continued volatility. In recent press, co announced that it will present and host investor meetings at the Piper Jaffray 31st Annual Healthcare Conference on Thursday of next week, December 5. AZUL (35.7 -6.72%): Brazilian stocks lag relatively amid volatility in the Brazilian real, Reuters reports that weakness in the currency followed comments made in the U.S. on Monday by the country's Economy Minister, Paulo Guedes, which included his indication that he is not worried about the currency's exchange rate fluctuations or the country's deficit; the country's central bank reportedly intervened in the foreign exchange market today to ease pressure on the real.

There are two primary catalysts:The October New Home Sales report was better than expected, with sales checking in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units. That was up 31.6% from a year-ago. October also marked the third straight month that new home sales exceeded 700,000, which is something that hasn't happened since 2007.Interest rates continue to creep lower, which bodes well for mortgage rates and prospective buyer demand. The 10-yr note yield is down two basis points to 1.74% today and down 20 basis points from where it stood on November 11.Using the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB 45.76, +0.48, +1.0%) as a proxy, the homebuilding industry has been a relative strength leader all year. Including today's gain the ITB is up 40.7% in 2019 versus a 25.2% gain for the S&P 500. The group, then, is also benefiting from performance chasing in a market that has otherwise been resilient to selling pressure.The ITB is comprised of other housing-related stocks, like Sherwin-Williams (SHW 583.09, +3.08, +0.5%) and Home Depot (HD 220.08, +1.68, +0.8%); nevertheless, there is no denying the standout performances registered by the homebuilding stocks specifically, which have rallied on the drop in mortgage rates and favorable demand dynamics, including low unemployment and pent-up buying interest.Notable movers: D.R. Horton (DHI 55.26, +0.62, +1.1%), PulteGroup (PHM 39.78, +0.34, +0.9%); Lennar (LEN 60.10, +0.67, +1.1%), NVR, Inc. (NVR 3795.69, +74.81, +2.0%), KB Home (KBH 34.98, +0.33, +0.9%), and Beazer Homes (BZH 15.46, +0.34, +2.3%)14:07CCXI ChemoCentryx off the sessions best levels, but still higher by 270% as investors and analysts alike cheer positive Phase 3 topline data (30.17 +22.11)As covered last night, the company and Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma announced positive topline data from the pivotal Phase III ADVOCATE trial of avacopan, an orally-administered selective complement 5a receptor inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (ANCA-associated vasculitis or ANCA vasculitis). In response to the outcome, ChemoCentryx plans to make regulatory submissions for full marketing approval to both the European Medicines Agency and the Food and Drug Administration in 2020.Surging higher on the positive result, shares traded north of $38 early this morning, good for gains of as much as 376%.

Last quarter, ADSK reported at 16:01, or one minute after the close, so it may be right after the close.The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for Q3 (Oct) non-GAAP EPS is $0.72. The revenue consensus estimate is $824 mln. On August 27, ADSK guided to non-GAAP EPS of $0.70-0.74 and revenue of $820-830 mln. Full year guidance was: non-GAAP EPS of $2.69-2.81 and revenue growth pf +26-27%, which we compute as $3.24-3.15 bln. Note: ADSK typically guides for revenue and EPS in the press release for the next quarter and full year.It's important to note that the company views ARR (annualized recurring revenue) as the best proxy for measuring its progress and the overall health of the business. So that will be a metric to watch. Its current FY20 guidance is for ARR of $3.425-3.385 bln. ADSK does not guide for ARR on a quarterly basis. However, last quarter, it reported ARR of $3.07 bln. Non-GAAP operating margin is another metric to watch, Q2 came in at 23%.Of note, ADSK has been transitioning its business away from maintenance revenue and toward recurring revenue for its core design platforms. With less than 20% of revenue coming from maintenance, ADSK says it's effectively finished with its business model transition. Another big push ADSK has been making is to boost its construction offerings as it has made a number of recent acquisitions in this area.The headline last quarter was that ADSK rebounded from its first EPS miss in five years in AprQ to report nice upside in JulQ. However, ADSK also lowered full-year guidance for both EPS and revenue despite reporting upside in JulQ. ADSK said it does not expect to be materially impacted by current trade tensions and macro uncertainty, but it wanted to take a prudent stance to its second half FY20 guidance.ADSK has had a halo effect on its stock in recent years, but its last two earnings reports have tarnished that image to some degree. Nevertheless, investors seem to be brushing off concerns about the guidance as they have bid the stock up more than 20% since mid-October. This makes us a bit nervous heading into this report as investors may be too optimistic.13:49COMDX Metals Settlement PricesDec gold settled today's session up $4.40 (0.3%) at $1461.4/oz Dec silver settled today's session $0.16 higher (0.98%) at $17.05/oz Dec copper settled $0.03 higher (1.13%) at $2.675/lb13:19OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:AAOI Dec 10.5 calls are seeing interest with the underlying stock up 4% (volume: 4670, open int: 10, implied vol: ~76%, prev day implied vol: 58%).

The S&P 500 (+0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.2%), and Nasdaq Composite (+0.3%) edge above their flat lines.Chief among today's news is a report that top trade negotiators from the U.S. and China reportedly reached a consensus on how to properly resolve core issues. Tucked behind the trade news are Treasury yields that remain persistently low, a CBOE Volatility Index (11.66, -0.21, -1.8%) that is trading at its lowest level since April, and a speech from Fed Chair Powell last evening that maintained the market's positive view on monetary policy.A flat start for the stock market has transitioned into marginal gains across the indices. From a sector standpoint, nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are up, with the real estate sector (+1.1%) rising above the rest amid another decline in Treasury yields. The benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.74%.The financials (-0.3%) and energy (-0.6%) sectors are the lone holdouts.Retailers remain in focus after Best Buy (BBY 82.74, +8.45, +11.4%), Burlington Stores (BURL 226.83, +18.55, +8.9%), and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 47.11, +7.68, +19.4%) impressed investors with their results and/or guidance. Fellow retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR 94.07, -18.32, -16.3%), however, has disappointed investors with its results.Separately, shares of Walt Disney (DIS 153.29, +3.60, +2.4%) have climbed to a new all-time high after Consumer Edge Research initiated coverage on the stock with an Overweight rating. The firm has a $175 price target for the stock.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.3%) may be struggling after Analog Devices (ADI 114.71, +1.78, +1.6%) missed earnings estimates and provided downside Q1 guidance. Shares of Analog Devices, however, have erased early losses and now trade firmly higher. The broader semiconductor space could be taking a much-needed breather.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured the New Home Sales report for October:New home sales in October decreased 0.7% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) from an upwardly revised 738,000 (from 701,000) in September. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 31.6%.The key takeaway from the report is that the October showing was better than what meets the eye at first blush given the large, upward revision to the prior month's number.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November eased to 125.5 (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from 125.9 in October, marking the fourth straight monthly retreat.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers continue to remain relatively upbeat about the short-term outlook based in part on income prospects, which should be a support for holiday spending activity.The Advance International Trade in Goods report for October showed a narrowing in the deficit to $66.5 billion from $70.5 billion in September. Advance Retail Inventories were up 0.3% on top of a 0.2% increase in September and Advance Wholesale Inventories increased 0.2% after declining 0.7% in September.The FHFA Housing Price Index for September increased 0.6% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in August. The S&P Case-Shiller Housing Price Index for September increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) following an unrevised 2.0% increase in August.12:54SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (27.74 mln -2.98%), CCXI (22.28 mln +266.25%), PFE (13.84 mln -0.48%), MDCO (12.32 mln +0.1%)Materials: VALE (14 mln -0.25%), FCX (12.4 mln +0.13%)Industrials: GE (29.8 mln -0.65%)Consumer Discretionary: NIO (31.14 mln +7.07%), DLTR (14.6 mln -16.36%), DKS (12.46 mln +19.2%)Information Technology: FIT (41.95 mln +3.61%), AMD (26.78 mln -1.91%), NOK (14.95 mln -1.3%), HPE (14.07 mln -8.68%), NTNX (12.69 mln +16.73%)Financials: BAC (20.07 mln -0.67%), ITUB (18.37 mln -3.84%)Energy: CHK (60.44 mln +2.69%), SWN (18 mln -4.36%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: CCXI (39.14x +266.25%), GBT (5.85x +4.8%), CBAY (5.48x +10.53%), MDCO (3.26x +0.1%), EDIT (2.48x +3.9%)Industrials: BECN (3.47x -10.46%)Consumer Discretionary: DLTR (9.98x -16.36%), DKS (6.98x +19.2%), MOV (5.43x -21.59%), BBY (3.85x +11.52%), CHS (2.59x +15.19%), ANF (2.56x -3%), BURL (2.53x +9.09%)Information Technology: NTNX (4.94x +16.73%), PANW (4.8x -12.03%), AMBA (2.75x -4.86%)Financials: MUFG (7.69x -0.65%), WBK (2.63x -1.32%)12:52SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: CCXI (29.52 +266.25%), ARWR (66.89 +17.37%), AUPH (7 +13%), CLVS (11.4 +10.98%), CBAY (1.47 +10.53%), ABEO (3.15 +9.76%), YMAB (32.12 +8.66%), SENS (1.04 +7.37%)Industrials: DY (54.58 +9.27%)Consumer Discretionary: DKS (47 +19.2%), CHS (4.82 +15.19%), BBY (82.8 +11.52%), BURL (227.19 +9.09%), EXPR (3.95 +7.63%), NIO (2.2 +7.07%), DESP (12.5 +6.38%), WTRH (0.4 +6.33%)Information Technology: NTNX (33.56 +16.73%), GTT (5.96 +8.8%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: CYH (3.12 -7.57%), XON (5.67 -6.28%), ACOR (1.79 -6.05%)Industrials: BECN (29.88 -10.46%), AZUL (35.4 -7.5%), GOL (15.36 -6.28%)Consumer Discretionary: MOV (19.76 -21.59%), DLTR (94.01 -16.36%)Information Technology: PANW (220.16 -12.03%), HPE (15.94 -8.68%), PAGS (30.88 -8.26%)Energy: MDR (0.72 -10.59%), RRC (3.51 -9.66%), WLL (4.99 -8.1%), EXTN (5.79 -7.95%), TGS (5.74 -6.29%), SDRL (1.1 -5.98%)Consumer Staples: DF (0.1 -7.3%), XXII (0.95 -7.03%)12:40DIS Walt Disney advances 2.5% to new all-time highs after Consumer Edge Research initiates coverage on shares with an Overweight rating and the NY Post reports that the company is adding roughly 1 mln new subscribers to Disney+ each day (153.25 +3.56)12:37XLRE Sector Briefing: Real Estate (38.54 +0.39)The New Home Sales report for October was better than expected and reflected the impressive rebound in new home sales that has been unfolding this year. To wit, new home sales were up 31.6% yr/yr with double-digit percentage increases across all regions.Hearing this, it likely won't be a surprise to hear that the S&P 500 real estate sector (+1.1%) is today's best-performing sector. The only thing is, new home sales have nothing to do directly with this sector, which is populated with office REITs, retail REITs, storage REITs, specialty REITs, and residential REITs focused on rental apartment properties.Why, then, is this sector outperforming? Key factors include:The continued drop in interest rates, which increase the appeal of a sector that provides handsome dividend yields. The 10-yr note yield is 1.73% while the sector's dividend yield is 3.31%.Sector rotation into an area of the market that has trailed the broader market's breakout to a record high. This sector has declined 1.2% over the last three months versus a 9.1% gain for the S&P 500. Some see added "catch-up potential" here in a possible year-end rally effort for the broader market.With improving economic sentiment and the persistence of low interest rates, stocks in this sector are standing out for total return potential at a time when forecasts for 2020 are primarily calling for a modest gain for the S&P 500 in 2020.Notable movers:Iron Mountain (IRM 32.54, -1.51, -4.4%): one of the few losers in the group today after the storage and information management services company announced its CFO, Stuart Brown, will be leaving Dec. 31 to pursue other interests. Barry A.

Over the next month we plan to submit regulatory filings for 2 additional clinical candidates, and by the end of 2020, we intend to have 10 TRiM -enabled candidates in clinical studies targeting four different cell types. Further, we expect to be in 3 pivotal studies by the end of 2020.""We feel confident about our ability to achieve these aggressive targets, and we have good reason to believe in the ultimate success of these clinical programs for a number of reasons.""The RNAi field is just beginning what we believe to be a golden age. This modality is increasingly accepted as a reliable and powerful way to treat a variety of diseases after two decades of intensive study and development. While the potential and value of direct conjugation delivery in unlocking the potential of RNAi was clear to us by 2016, broader confidence took longer. Interestingly, the increasing validation of RNAi is growing amid a backdrop of scarcity related to companies capable of leveraging it therapeutically and near absolute scarcity of bringing RNAi outside the liver: we think we are probably years ahead of anyone else in this regard."Shares were also up 16% yesterday after Robert W. Baird upgraded the stock to Outperform in response to Novartis's (NVS) $9.7 bln buyout of Arrowhead RNAi peer Medicines Company (MDCO).11:31HPQ HP Q4 Earnings Preview (19.92 -0.23)HP is scheduled to report Q4 results tonight after the bell with a conference call at 4:30 p.m. ET.As it stands, the Capital IQ Consensus Estimate calls for Q4 EPS of $0.58 (vs $0.54 a year ago) on essentially flat revenues of $15.29 bln.Q4 EPS guidance stands at $0.55-0.59.On October 3, HP provided details on its strategy and opportunities for long-term growth, along with its financial outlook for fiscal 2020. The company's plans followed weak results out of its printing segment in Q3 as well as an attempt to become a more digital-focused company.For fiscal 2020, HP estimates non-GAAP diluted net EPS to be in the range of $2.22-2.32. Also, HP anticipates generating FCF of at least $3.0 billion for fiscal 2020. The company announced a fiscal year 2020 restructuring plan wherein it would reduce its gross global headcount by ~7-9K employees through a combination of employee exits and voluntary early retirement. The company estimates that it will incur total labor and non-labor costs of approximately $1.0 billion in connection with the restructuring and other charges, with approximately $100 million in fiscal Q4 of 2019, $500 million in fiscal 2020 and the rest split between fiscal 2021 and 2022. These actions are expected to be completed in fiscal 2022. The company estimates that these actions will result in annualized gross run rate savings of about $1.0 billion by the end of fiscal 2022.Board also authorized an additional $5.0 billion for future repurchases of its outstanding shares of common stock.Also increased quarterly dividend 10% to $0.1762 from $0.16/share.In August the company announced Enrique Lores will succeed Dion Weisler as CEO, effective November 1.Recent rhetoric in HPQ has surrounded a takeover attempt by Xerox (XRX). In what has become a back-and-forth battle of "we're right" -- "no, we're right," the latest rumblings are that XRX sent a letter to HPQ management basically saying that to not engage in talks would defy logic. Given the lack of communication between the two parties, XRX has expressed interest in rallying shareholder support for a deal with HPQ in lieu of agreeing on a deal with HPQ management directly. At last check HPQ has rejected a proposal from XRX for a reported $22/share.The aforementioned "talks" with XRX have pushed the stock to three-month highs into the print as the stock has recently reclaimed the 200-day SMA (19.55).We'd also point out that XRX counts activist giant Carl Icahn as a large investor. As of his latest 13F filing (Nov. 14) Icahn held nearly 23.5 million shares of XRX.All indications are, though, that HPQ will likely not comment on these latest developments in the XRX battle during this quarter's conference call. The likely outcome of these -- what have become hostile -- takeover talks is that HPQ will reiterate its stance that it prefers to be an independent company.Ahead of tonight's print HPQ garners a $29.5 billion market capitalization and trades at about 9.1x forward earnings expectations vs peers Dell's (DELL) 7.8x, and Xerox's (XRX) 9.8x multiples.11:24TALKX Market Briefing: More of the sameThe major indices are sporting modest gains in another resilient showing that has kept broader selling efforts in check. The underlying sources of support remain much the same:Enduring hope the U.S. and China will reach a Phase One trade deal after China's Ministry of Commerce said senior officials from both sides had a phone call today and agreed on how to properly resolve relevant issues.A fear of missing out on further gains.Low interest rates.

The pre-specified primary endpoints were remission of acute vasculitis activity at week 26 and sustained remission at week 52, where avacopan therapy was at least statistically non-inferior to the currently used glucocorticoid-containing standard of care. BVAS remission at week 26 was achieved in 72.3% of avacopan subjects vs 70.1% of control group subjects. Sustained remission at 52 weeks was observed in 65.7% of avacopan subjects vs 54.9% in the control group, achieving both non-inferiority and superiority to glucocorticoid standard of care. Acavopan subjects also reportedly experienced further additional benefits vs control, including reduction in glucocorticoid-related toxicity and improvement in kidney function and health-related quality of life metrics.

Co commented that while its strategic increase of marketing investment expenditures across its watch brands portfolio led to market share gains, co fell short of its sales plans due to category underperformance "as challenges intensified within the watch category and retail landscape." Lowered FY20 guidance below estimates, now seeing EPS of $1.55-1.70 (prior $2.25-2.35) and revs of $690-700 mln (prior $725-740 mln). Drops to circa three-month lows. TITN (14.95 -17.08%): Reported downside Q3 earnings and revs (flat yr/yr at $360.9 mln). Among category results, equipment sales declined yr/yr to $246.0 mln vs $253.8 mln in the prior year quarter; parts sales increased yr/yr to $70.8 mln vs $64.6 mln. Citing a higher effective consolidated tax rate and continued market driven challenges within the International segment, co lowered guidance for FY20 EPS at the mid-point, below consensus, and decreased its International segment revenue growth forecast.

The company's loss estimate is consistent with industry insured losses of approx. $11 bln and its expected market share of less than 1% for this catastrophe event.Due to the nature of this event, including the complexity of loss assessment and factors contributing to the losses, and the preliminary nature of the information available to prepare this estimate, the actual net ultimate loss for this event may differ materially from this current estimate. The additional complexity caused by the multiple catastrophic events that have occurred in Japan in recent months, together with the expectation of a relatively high proportion of flood related losses attributable to Typhoon Hagibis, are also likely to lead to increased uncertainty surrounding the estimated net ultimate loss for this event.16:28BDX Becton Dickinson increases quarterly cash dividend to $0.79/share from $0.77/share (253.86 +3.97)16:25PANW Palo Alto Networks beats by $0.02, reports revs in-line with billings above guidance; guides Q2 revs in-line; reaffirms FY20 revs guidance; increases billings slightly, guides down EPS, impacted by announced acquisition of Aporeto for $150 mln (250.28 +3.41)Reports Q1 (Oct) earnings of $1.05 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.03; revenues rose 17.7% year/year to $772 mln vs the $769.34 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Billings increase 18% $897.4 mln vs. $870-890 mln guidanceCo issues guidance for Q2, sees EPS of $1.11-1.13, including Aporeto acquisition cost, may not be comparable to $1.30 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q2 revs of $838-848 mln vs. $844.65 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; billings $985-1.0 bln.Co issues guidance for FY20, lowers EPS to $4.90-5.00 from $5.00-5.10, including Aporeto, may not be comparable to $5.07 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; reaffirms FY20 revs of $3.44-3.48 bln vs. $3.47 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; raises billings to $4.105-4.165 bln from $4.095-4.155 blnCo is acquiring Aporeto Inc., a machine identity-based microsegmentation company for $150 million in cash Aporeto identifies workloads and applies microsegmentation across all infrastructures, helping customers secure their applications at scale.

Given the strong backlog position of MTS at the end of fiscal 2019, the solid backlog position of R&D, and the expected incremental Adjusted EBITDA generation, MTS expects rapid strengthening of its balance sheet following the closing of this acquisition, with a forecasted year-over-year net reduction in leverage by the end of fiscal 2020.16:14MTSC MTS Systems misses by $0.02, beats on revs; guides FY20 EPS below two analyst estimate, revs above two analyst estimate (60.56 +2.39)Reports Q4 (Sep) earnings of $0.37 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 worse than the two analyst estimate of $0.39; revenues rose 13.2% year/year to $224.08 mln vs the $218.07 mln two analyst estimate."As we enter our new fiscal year, we are excited about the resilience of our markets, our record year-end backlog, which topped $420 million, and the customer reception to our new product offerings.

Remission was defined as a BVAS score of zero and being off glucocorticoid treatment for ANCA vasculitis for at least the preceding four weeks. The pre-specified primary endpoints were remission of acute vasculitis activity at week 26 and sustained remission at week 52, where avacopan therapy was at least statistically non-inferior to the currently used glucocorticoid-containing standard of care (glucocorticoid SOC). The two primary endpoints were tested sequentially using a gatekeeping procedure to preserve the Type I error.BVAS remission at week 26 was achieved in 72.3% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 70.1% of subjects in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (p<0.0001 for non-inferiority). Sustained remission at 52 weeks was observed in 65.7% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 54.9% in the glucocorticoid SOC control group, achieving both non-inferiority and superiority to glucocorticoid standard of care (p=0.0066 for superiority of avacopan). Importantly, subjects who received avacopan experienced additional benefits compared to those in the glucocorticoid SOC control group.The topline safety results revealed an acceptable safety profile in this serious and life-threatening disease, with fewer subjects having serious adverse events (SAEs) in the avacopan group than in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (42% vs. 45%, respectively). Most reported SAEs were related to underlying ANCA vasculitis disease and commensurate with rates in previously published ANCA vasculitis trials. There were fewer subjects with serious infections in the avacopan group than the glucocorticoid SOC control group. A full analysis of the data is underway and expanded results are expected to be announced in the coming weeks.16:08HPE Hewlett Packard Enterprise beats by $0.03, misses on revs; guides Q1 EPS in-line; reaffirms FY20 guidance (17.45 +0.33)Reports Q4 (Oct) earnings of $0.49 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.46; revenues fell 9.2% year/year to $7.21 bln vs the $7.41 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.GAAP gross margins of 33.2%, up 250 basis points from the prior-year period and Non-GAAP of 33.3%, up 260 basis points from the prior-year period.

The energy (-1.0%), financials (-0.1%), and health care (-0.1%) sectors were the lone holdouts.Evidently, buying conviction was less pronounced than yesterday, but the same factors that have contributed to the market's record run -- trade progress, low rates, low volatility, and supportive monetary policy expectations -- remained intact. As for trade, China's Commerce Ministry said top negotiators held a phone call in which both sides agreed on how to properly resolve outstanding issues for a Phase One deal.Other outperformers in the stock market included the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.84, +0.27, +0.6%), which benefited from upbeat earnings forecasts, and the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB 45.89, +0.61, +1.4%), which benefited from new home sales in October coming in better than expected at 733,000 units (Briefing.com consensus 710,000).Best Buy (BBY 81.57, +7.32, +9.9%), Burlington Stores (BURL 225.97, +17.71, +8.5%), and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 46.77, +7.34, +18.6%) impressed investors with their results and guidance, the latter of which is especially important for the retailers with the holiday-shopping season nearly in full swing.

The Company currently believes diluted EPS for fiscal 2020 will be at or modestly above its fiscal 2019 results. The company reported diluted EPS of $1.62 for FY19 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.60. Increased demand creation spending and continuing challenges in its animal health businesses will be headwinds to earnings growth for the year.Updated guidance for the fiscal year is expected to be provided in early February, after the initial assessment and proposed actions of the new CEO can be factored into the Company's expectations.15:41SCANX Large cap notable movers of interest -- Dollar Tree (DLTR) falls following third quarter results -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable large cap movers of interest ($10 bln - $200 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Large Cap GainersBBY (81.66 +9.98%): Moves to its highest levels in more than a year following co's release of Q3 results; co topped consensus for EPS on in-line revs, which rose +2.1% yr/yr to $9.76 bln, with enterprise comps rising +1.7% and domestic comps growing +2.0%. Co reported that it saw strength in appliances, headphones, tablets, and computing, which was offset by declines in gaming and home theater products. Issued in-line Q4 EPS and revs guidance while raising various full-year guidance metrics, including its enterprise comp sales growth outlook (now sees +1.0-2.0% vs prior +0.7-1.7%). BURL (227.72 +9.34%): Posts new all-time highs beating consensus for Q3 EPS; co's revs rose +8.6 yr/yr to $1.78 bln, slightly short of consensus. Comparable store inventory decreased 4%. Adj. EBIT margin increased by 90 basis points yr/yr. Guided Q4 EPS below consensus while raising its FY20 EPS guidance above consensus; sees FY20 total sales growth of +8.8-9.1% (on top of FY18's +10.7% increase), assuming +2-3% comp sales growth for Q4. ALNY (118.02 +4.98%): Continued strength on higher than average volume. Co today announced that it will present company overviews next week at the Evercore ISI 2nd Annual HealthCONx Conference and the Piper Jaffray 31st Annual Healthcare Conference. At 52-week highs.Large Cap LosersDLTR (94.14 -16.24%): Missed consensus for Q3 EPS on in-line revs (+3.7% yr/yr to $5.75 bln). Enterprise comp store sales increased +2.5%, with Dollar Tree comps increasing +2.8% and Family Dollar segment comps rising +2.3%. Guided Q4 and FY20 revs in-line. Co now anticipates that Section 301 tariffs will increase its cost of goods sold by approx. $19 mln in Q4 if tariffs are fully implemented. Pressure on merchandise margin based on growth in lower-margin consumables, payroll cost pressure in distribution centers, and increased run rates for repairs and maintenance, utilities, and depreciation may also weigh on Q4 results. Downgraded to Accumulate at Gordon Haskett. At three-month lows. PANW (221.22 -11.61%): Reported Q1 results, topping consensus for EPS on in-line revs (+17.7% yr/yr to $772 mln). Billings increased +18% yr/yr, surpassing co's guidance. Co commented that its product category did not meet co's expectations in the quarter, weighing on Firewall as a Platform; product revs declined 4% yr/yr to $231.2 mln. Announced that it will acquire machine identity-based microsegmentation company Aporeto for $150 mln in cash. Lowered FY20 EPS guidance; raised FY20 billings guidance. Drops from recent multi-month highs. TEVA (9.71 -9.42%): Declines alongside various pharmaceutical company peers following reports that federal prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into certain opioid manufacturers, probing whether those companies intentionally allowed opioid painkillers to enter communities.

Buying efforts were targeted on longer-dated maturities, which maintained lower yields throughout the cash session. Treasuries finished off their best levels, fading a bit after today's 5-year note auction that saw the high yield (1.587%) tail the when-issued yield (1.584%) by a small amount.Yield Check: 2-yr: -3 bps to 1.58% 3-yr: -2 bps to 1.58% 5-yr: -3 bps to 1.59% 10-yr: -2 bps to 1.74% 30-yr: -3 bps to 2.18%News: China and US spoke by phone regarding trade: China says two sides "reached consensus on how to resolve related issues and agreed to maintain communication on the remaining issues"; US side acknowledges phone call took place but declines to comment on what was discussedFed Chair Powell says in speech, "Monetary policy is now well positioned to support a strong labor market and return inflation decisively to our symmetric 2 percent objective. If the outlook changes materially, policy will change as well. At this point in the long expansion, I see the glass as much more than half full."Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan (voting FOMC member in 2020) said in CNBC interview that Q4 will be weak because of inventory adjustments but expects economy to grow at 2% next year.Fed Governor Brainard suggests Fed should explore using interest rate caps in future downturns if effective funds rate falls to lower bound.European Central Bank policymaker Francois Villeroy de Galhau said that low rates will continue supporting the economy and that countries like Germany and Netherlands should increase their fiscal spending.$41 bln 5-yr note auction sees high yield of 1.5875% on 2.50 bid-to-cover ratio, which exceeded the prior 12-auction average of 2.37.Today's data:New home sales in October decreased 0.7% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) from an upwardly revised 738,000 (from 701,000) in September. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 31.6%.The key takeaway from the report is that the October showing was better than what meets the eye at first blush given the large, upward revision to the prior month's number.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November eased to 125.5 (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from 126.1 in October, marking the fourth straight monthly retreat.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers continue to remain relatively upbeat about the short-term outlook based in part on income prospects, which should be a support for holiday spending activity.Advance October Intl.

There is a conference call scheduled for 10:00 ET. Q4 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.14 (-7% yr/yr) on revenue (equipment sales) of $8.41 bln (roughly unchanged yr/yr). FY19 guidance calls for net income of $3.2 bln and revenue growth of +4% in equipment sales and +5% in net sales. FY20 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $11.13 (versus $9.92 estimate in FY19 or +5.6% yr/yr) on revenue of $35.5 bln (vs $34.6 bln estimate in 2019 or +3.8% yr/yr). Looking back, the company missed on EPS four out the last four quarters and missed on revenues two out of the last four quarters. DE shares rose 4% following its Q3 report despite a miss on EPS and lowered FY19 guidance. The Q3 report was consistent with DE's recent history, as it came into this quarter having missed EPS for five consecutive quarters. The Agriculture & Turf segment was the weak link this quarter, as segment sales declined 6% yr/yr to $5.95 bln due to lower shipment volumes and unfavorable FX. Segment operating margin declined quite a bit to 10.3% from 12.8% last year due to inefficiencies from lower shipments coupled with higher production costs.It is clear that the tariffs are hurting Deere on two fronts: It's not just that sales of equipment into those regions that are getting impacted (especially China), but it's also that US farmers getting hurt by China are not buying soybeans and other crops. It's understandable that US farmers are holding off on buying new ag equipment, as nobody knows how long this dispute is going to last.DE has a $55.5 bln valuation and trades at 16 2021 EPS vs CAT which trades at 13 times 2021 EPS.Based on the DE Weekly Nov29 $176 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~4% in either direction by weekly expiration (Friday).On a positive report, look for resistance near the $180-181 area, while support sits near the $165-166 vicinity.14:34SUMRX Earnings Out This Afternoon/Tomorrow MorningThis Afternoon: ADSK BOX CENT DELL GES HPQ KEYS QADA VEEV VMWTomorrow Morning: DAKT DE DOYU FRO UXIN14:32COMDX Energy Settlement PricesJan Crude Oil futures rose $0.23 (0.4%) to $58.3/barrel Jan Natural Gas $0.06 lower (-2.28%) at $2.529/MMBtu Jan RBOB Gasoline settled $0.02 higher (1.34%) at $1.6932/gallon Jan Heating oil futures settled $0.01 higher (0.54%) at $1.954/gallon14:25VMW VMware: Earnings Preview -- Has been on recent M&A shopping spree (166.07 -2.81)VMware (VMW), which specializes in cloud computing and virtualization software, is set to report Q3 (Oct) results today after the close (last time they reported at 16:15 ET, 15 minutes after the close) with a call to follow at 4:30pm ET.The CapitalIQ consensus for Q3 (Oct) non-GAAP EPS is $1.43 and for revenue it's $2.41 bln. Note: VMW typically guides on the call for EPS and revs for the next quarter and full year. It also guides for license revenue and non-GAAP operating margin. Last time, it guided for Q3 (Oct) non-GAAP EPS of approx $1.42 and revenue of approx $2.40 bln. It also guided to Q3 license revenue of approx $950 mln and non-GAAP operating margin of 30.3%. Of course, the highlight last quarter was VMware announcing it will acquire Pivotal Software (PVTL) and Carbon Black (CBLK). (PVTL should close by Jan 31 while CBLK closed on Oct 8.) In addition, VMW reported earnings, including a $0.05 beat and revenue upside. However, its Q3 (Oct) guidance was below consensus. So it was sort of a mixed result overall. But clearly the focus was on these two purchases. PVTL provides software development tools so that developers can create new cloud-native applications more quickly and easily. VMW already owned a stake in PVTL, so a combination made a lot of sense. Carbon Black was sort of a different animal as it focuses on cybersecurity but VMW sees it as complementary to existing VMW cybersecurity platforms. We will be looking for any updates there. The big picture here is that VMW is really pushing into the cloud. The company started out with server virtualization. However, over the last 5-10 years, VMW has expanded to a number of adjacent areas: management, software-defined networking, storage and end-user computing. Each of these businesses now are in the $1 bln range. These deals continue VMW's transformation. Finally, VMW typically reports EPS upside in the $0.04-0.10 range over the past five quarters. It also generally reports revenue upside, but the top line beat is usually more modest. The stock sold off following its JulQ report in late August, but it has recovered nicely since then, up more than 25%. Much of this move is probably from overall strength in tech stocks, but it also tells us investors are pretty optimistic about its OctQ report.14:17SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) gains following upbeat third quarter press -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersDKS (46.73 +18.51%): Posts its highest levels in more than two years after posting upside Q3 results; co topped consensus for both EPS and revs (+5.6% yr/yr to $1.96 bln). Consolidated same store sales surpassed estimates, increasing +6.0%, co's strongest comp gain since 2013, while eCommerce sales increased +13%, forming approx. 13% of total net sales. Co reported that it saw increases in both average ticket and transactions and that it recorded growth across its three primary product categories. Guided FY20 EPS above consensus. Forecasts a +2.5-3% comp sales increase for the full year. ARWR (66.82 +17.25%): Again advances to fresh multi-year highs after reporting FY19 financial results and other company updates; revs jumped +946% yr/yr to $168.8 mln. Co noted in its prepared remarks, among other updates, that there are now five TRiM-enabled candidates in the clinic; co plans to submit regulatory filings for two additional clinical candidates over the next month and intends to have 10 TRiM-enabled candidates in clinical studies targeting four different cell types and to be in three pivotal studies by the end of 2020. NTNX (33.15 +15.29%): Reported upside Q1 EPS and revenue. Billings declined yr/yr to $380.0 mln from $383.6 mln in the prior year quarter, reflecting billings compression from co's ongoing transition to a subscription model and a significant reduction in hardware billings yr/yr. Software and Support TCV revs increased +9% yr/yr to $305.0 mln on a +5% Software and Support TCV billings increase to $370.3 mln. Issued in-line Q2 EPS and FY20 revs guidance while guiding Q2 revs below consensus. Co sees Software and Support TCV billings between $1.65-1.75 bln for FY20. Price target raised at various firms, including Maxim Group (to $52 from $48). At six-month highs.Mid Cap LosersBECN (29.3 -12.2%): Missed consensus for Q4 EPS and revs (+4.9% yr/yr to $2.03 bln). Sales increased yr/yr for consolidated residential roofing (+12.7%) and non-residential roofing (+2.4%) products but decreased for consolidated complementary products (fell 3.2%). Results were negatively impacted by lower gross margins and higher acquisition-related costs relative to 2018; meanwhile, existing market sales growth in residential roofing had a positive impact. Co management commented that co is "now pivoting from a growth run via acquisitions" to focus on organic growth, margin expansion, and operating expense discipline. Also announced that CFO Joseph Nowicki will depart co later this year in order to focus on his family, charitable work, and Board service; he will remain during co's search for his successor. At three-month lows. KRTX (74.79 -8.99%): Continued volatility. In recent press, co announced that it will present and host investor meetings at the Piper Jaffray 31st Annual Healthcare Conference on Thursday of next week, December 5. AZUL (35.7 -6.72%): Brazilian stocks lag relatively amid volatility in the Brazilian real, Reuters reports that weakness in the currency followed comments made in the U.S. on Monday by the country's Economy Minister, Paulo Guedes, which included his indication that he is not worried about the currency's exchange rate fluctuations or the country's deficit; the country's central bank reportedly intervened in the foreign exchange market today to ease pressure on the real.

There are two primary catalysts:The October New Home Sales report was better than expected, with sales checking in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units. That was up 31.6% from a year-ago. October also marked the third straight month that new home sales exceeded 700,000, which is something that hasn't happened since 2007.Interest rates continue to creep lower, which bodes well for mortgage rates and prospective buyer demand. The 10-yr note yield is down two basis points to 1.74% today and down 20 basis points from where it stood on November 11.Using the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB 45.76, +0.48, +1.0%) as a proxy, the homebuilding industry has been a relative strength leader all year. Including today's gain the ITB is up 40.7% in 2019 versus a 25.2% gain for the S&P 500. The group, then, is also benefiting from performance chasing in a market that has otherwise been resilient to selling pressure.The ITB is comprised of other housing-related stocks, like Sherwin-Williams (SHW 583.09, +3.08, +0.5%) and Home Depot (HD 220.08, +1.68, +0.8%); nevertheless, there is no denying the standout performances registered by the homebuilding stocks specifically, which have rallied on the drop in mortgage rates and favorable demand dynamics, including low unemployment and pent-up buying interest.Notable movers: D.R. Horton (DHI 55.26, +0.62, +1.1%), PulteGroup (PHM 39.78, +0.34, +0.9%); Lennar (LEN 60.10, +0.67, +1.1%), NVR, Inc. (NVR 3795.69, +74.81, +2.0%), KB Home (KBH 34.98, +0.33, +0.9%), and Beazer Homes (BZH 15.46, +0.34, +2.3%)14:07CCXI ChemoCentryx off the sessions best levels, but still higher by 270% as investors and analysts alike cheer positive Phase 3 topline data (30.17 +22.11)As covered last night, the company and Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma announced positive topline data from the pivotal Phase III ADVOCATE trial of avacopan, an orally-administered selective complement 5a receptor inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (ANCA-associated vasculitis or ANCA vasculitis). In response to the outcome, ChemoCentryx plans to make regulatory submissions for full marketing approval to both the European Medicines Agency and the Food and Drug Administration in 2020.Surging higher on the positive result, shares traded north of $38 early this morning, good for gains of as much as 376%. See MarketWatch for additional color on the positive trial data.Analyst reactions:PT raised at Canaccord Genuity to $48 (from $16)PT raised at H.C.

Last quarter, ADSK reported at 16:01, or one minute after the close, so it may be right after the close.The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for Q3 (Oct) non-GAAP EPS is $0.72. The revenue consensus estimate is $824 mln. On August 27, ADSK guided to non-GAAP EPS of $0.70-0.74 and revenue of $820-830 mln. Full year guidance was: non-GAAP EPS of $2.69-2.81 and revenue growth pf +26-27%, which we compute as $3.24-3.15 bln. Note: ADSK typically guides for revenue and EPS in the press release for the next quarter and full year.It's important to note that the company views ARR (annualized recurring revenue) as the best proxy for measuring its progress and the overall health of the business. So that will be a metric to watch. Its current FY20 guidance is for ARR of $3.425-3.385 bln. ADSK does not guide for ARR on a quarterly basis. However, last quarter, it reported ARR of $3.07 bln. Non-GAAP operating margin is another metric to watch, Q2 came in at 23%.Of note, ADSK has been transitioning its business away from maintenance revenue and toward recurring revenue for its core design platforms. With less than 20% of revenue coming from maintenance, ADSK says it's effectively finished with its business model transition. Another big push ADSK has been making is to boost its construction offerings as it has made a number of recent acquisitions in this area.The headline last quarter was that ADSK rebounded from its first EPS miss in five years in AprQ to report nice upside in JulQ. However, ADSK also lowered full-year guidance for both EPS and revenue despite reporting upside in JulQ. ADSK said it does not expect to be materially impacted by current trade tensions and macro uncertainty, but it wanted to take a prudent stance to its second half FY20 guidance.ADSK has had a halo effect on its stock in recent years, but its last two earnings reports have tarnished that image to some degree. Nevertheless, investors seem to be brushing off concerns about the guidance as they have bid the stock up more than 20% since mid-October. This makes us a bit nervous heading into this report as investors may be too optimistic.13:49COMDX Metals Settlement PricesDec gold settled today's session up $4.40 (0.3%) at $1461.4/oz Dec silver settled today's session $0.16 higher (0.98%) at $17.05/oz Dec copper settled $0.03 higher (1.13%) at $2.675/lb13:19OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:AAOI Dec 10.5 calls are seeing interest with the underlying stock up 4% (volume: 4670, open int: 10, implied vol: ~76%, prev day implied vol: 58%).

The S&P 500 (+0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.2%), and Nasdaq Composite (+0.3%) edge above their flat lines.Chief among today's news is a report that top trade negotiators from the U.S. and China reportedly reached a consensus on how to properly resolve core issues. Tucked behind the trade news are Treasury yields that remain persistently low, a CBOE Volatility Index (11.66, -0.21, -1.8%) that is trading at its lowest level since April, and a speech from Fed Chair Powell last evening that maintained the market's positive view on monetary policy.A flat start for the stock market has transitioned into marginal gains across the indices. From a sector standpoint, nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are up, with the real estate sector (+1.1%) rising above the rest amid another decline in Treasury yields. The benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.74%.The financials (-0.3%) and energy (-0.6%) sectors are the lone holdouts.Retailers remain in focus after Best Buy (BBY 82.74, +8.45, +11.4%), Burlington Stores (BURL 226.83, +18.55, +8.9%), and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 47.11, +7.68, +19.4%) impressed investors with their results and/or guidance. Fellow retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR 94.07, -18.32, -16.3%), however, has disappointed investors with its results.Separately, shares of Walt Disney (DIS 153.29, +3.60, +2.4%) have climbed to a new all-time high after Consumer Edge Research initiated coverage on the stock with an Overweight rating. The firm has a $175 price target for the stock.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.3%) may be struggling after Analog Devices (ADI 114.71, +1.78, +1.6%) missed earnings estimates and provided downside Q1 guidance. Shares of Analog Devices, however, have erased early losses and now trade firmly higher. The broader semiconductor space could be taking a much-needed breather.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured the New Home Sales report for October:New home sales in October decreased 0.7% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) from an upwardly revised 738,000 (from 701,000) in September. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 31.6%.The key takeaway from the report is that the October showing was better than what meets the eye at first blush given the large, upward revision to the prior month's number.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November eased to 125.5 (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from 125.9 in October, marking the fourth straight monthly retreat.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers continue to remain relatively upbeat about the short-term outlook based in part on income prospects, which should be a support for holiday spending activity.The Advance International Trade in Goods report for October showed a narrowing in the deficit to $66.5 billion from $70.5 billion in September. Advance Retail Inventories were up 0.3% on top of a 0.2% increase in September and Advance Wholesale Inventories increased 0.2% after declining 0.7% in September.The FHFA Housing Price Index for September increased 0.6% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in August. The S&P Case-Shiller Housing Price Index for September increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) following an unrevised 2.0% increase in August.12:54SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (27.74 mln -2.98%), CCXI (22.28 mln +266.25%), PFE (13.84 mln -0.48%), MDCO (12.32 mln +0.1%)Materials: VALE (14 mln -0.25%), FCX (12.4 mln +0.13%)Industrials: GE (29.8 mln -0.65%)Consumer Discretionary: NIO (31.14 mln +7.07%), DLTR (14.6 mln -16.36%), DKS (12.46 mln +19.2%)Information Technology: FIT (41.95 mln +3.61%), AMD (26.78 mln -1.91%), NOK (14.95 mln -1.3%), HPE (14.07 mln -8.68%), NTNX (12.69 mln +16.73%)Financials: BAC (20.07 mln -0.67%), ITUB (18.37 mln -3.84%)Energy: CHK (60.44 mln +2.69%), SWN (18 mln -4.36%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: CCXI (39.14x +266.25%), GBT (5.85x +4.8%), CBAY (5.48x +10.53%), MDCO (3.26x +0.1%), EDIT (2.48x +3.9%)Industrials: BECN (3.47x -10.46%)Consumer Discretionary: DLTR (9.98x -16.36%), DKS (6.98x +19.2%), MOV (5.43x -21.59%), BBY (3.85x +11.52%), CHS (2.59x +15.19%), ANF (2.56x -3%), BURL (2.53x +9.09%)Information Technology: NTNX (4.94x +16.73%), PANW (4.8x -12.03%), AMBA (2.75x -4.86%)Financials: MUFG (7.69x -0.65%), WBK (2.63x -1.32%)12:52SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: CCXI (29.52 +266.25%), ARWR (66.89 +17.37%), AUPH (7 +13%), CLVS (11.4 +10.98%), CBAY (1.47 +10.53%), ABEO (3.15 +9.76%), YMAB (32.12 +8.66%), SENS (1.04 +7.37%)Industrials: DY (54.58 +9.27%)Consumer Discretionary: DKS (47 +19.2%), CHS (4.82 +15.19%), BBY (82.8 +11.52%), BURL (227.19 +9.09%), EXPR (3.95 +7.63%), NIO (2.2 +7.07%), DESP (12.5 +6.38%), WTRH (0.4 +6.33%)Information Technology: NTNX (33.56 +16.73%), GTT (5.96 +8.8%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: CYH (3.12 -7.57%), XON (5.67 -6.28%), ACOR (1.79 -6.05%)Industrials: BECN (29.88 -10.46%), AZUL (35.4 -7.5%), GOL (15.36 -6.28%)Consumer Discretionary: MOV (19.76 -21.59%), DLTR (94.01 -16.36%)Information Technology: PANW (220.16 -12.03%), HPE (15.94 -8.68%), PAGS (30.88 -8.26%)Energy: MDR (0.72 -10.59%), RRC (3.51 -9.66%), WLL (4.99 -8.1%), EXTN (5.79 -7.95%), TGS (5.74 -6.29%), SDRL (1.1 -5.98%)Consumer Staples: DF (0.1 -7.3%), XXII (0.95 -7.03%)12:40DIS Walt Disney advances 2.5% to new all-time highs after Consumer Edge Research initiates coverage on shares with an Overweight rating and the NY Post reports that the company is adding roughly 1 mln new subscribers to Disney+ each day (153.25 +3.56)12:37XLRE Sector Briefing: Real Estate (38.54 +0.39)The New Home Sales report for October was better than expected and reflected the impressive rebound in new home sales that has been unfolding this year. To wit, new home sales were up 31.6% yr/yr with double-digit percentage increases across all regions.Hearing this, it likely won't be a surprise to hear that the S&P 500 real estate sector (+1.1%) is today's best-performing sector. The only thing is, new home sales have nothing to do directly with this sector, which is populated with office REITs, retail REITs, storage REITs, specialty REITs, and residential REITs focused on rental apartment properties.Why, then, is this sector outperforming? Key factors include:The continued drop in interest rates, which increase the appeal of a sector that provides handsome dividend yields. The 10-yr note yield is 1.73% while the sector's dividend yield is 3.31%.Sector rotation into an area of the market that has trailed the broader market's breakout to a record high. This sector has declined 1.2% over the last three months versus a 9.1% gain for the S&P 500. Some see added "catch-up potential" here in a possible year-end rally effort for the broader market.With improving economic sentiment and the persistence of low interest rates, stocks in this sector are standing out for total return potential at a time when forecasts for 2020 are primarily calling for a modest gain for the S&P 500 in 2020.Notable movers:Iron Mountain (IRM 32.54, -1.51, -4.4%): one of the few losers in the group today after the storage and information management services company announced its CFO, Stuart Brown, will be leaving Dec. 31 to pursue other interests. Barry A. Hytinen, current EVP and CFO at HanesBrands (HBI), has been named as his successor; IRM reaffirmed its FY19 guidance.CBRE Group (CBRE 57.71, +1.59, +2.8%): no news, but stock has broken out to a new all-time high today, albeit on light volumeSBA Communications (SBAC 236.78, +5.24, +2.3%): no news as stock rises to challenge its 50-day moving average (239.54)American Tower (AMT 213.46, +3.74, +1.8%): no news, but drawing support after flirting with test of 200-day moving average (207.03) on Monday12:05ARWR Arrowhead sees extension of recent run to multi-year highs as shares jump 16% today in response to last night's full year financial results; shares now up 432% YTD (66.02 +9.03)As covered last night, the company reported FY19 EPS of $0.69 vs $0.73 S&P Capital IQ Consensus Estimate; revs were +946% to $168.8 mln vs $166.91 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Highlights from last night's conference call (Prepared remarks):"There are now 5 TRiMTM-enabled candidates in the clinic, 3 of which are whollyowned and 2 are partnered. Over the next month we plan to submit regulatory filings for 2 additional clinical candidates, and by the end of 2020, we intend to have 10 TRiM -enabled candidates in clinical studies targeting four different cell types. Further, we expect to be in 3 pivotal studies by the end of 2020.""We feel confident about our ability to achieve these aggressive targets, and we have good reason to believe in the ultimate success of these clinical programs for a number of reasons.""The RNAi field is just beginning what we believe to be a golden age. This modality is increasingly accepted as a reliable and powerful way to treat a variety of diseases after two decades of intensive study and development. While the potential and value of direct conjugation delivery in unlocking the potential of RNAi was clear to us by 2016, broader confidence took longer. Interestingly, the increasing validation of RNAi is growing amid a backdrop of scarcity related to companies capable of leveraging it therapeutically and near absolute scarcity of bringing RNAi outside the liver: we think we are probably years ahead of anyone else in this regard."Shares were also up 16% yesterday after Robert W. Baird upgraded the stock to Outperform in response to Novartis's (NVS) $9.7 bln buyout of Arrowhead RNAi peer Medicines Company (MDCO).11:31HPQ HP Q4 Earnings Preview (19.92 -0.23)HP is scheduled to report Q4 results tonight after the bell with a conference call at 4:30 p.m. ET.As it stands, the Capital IQ Consensus Estimate calls for Q4 EPS of $0.58 (vs $0.54 a year ago) on essentially flat revenues of $15.29 bln.Q4 EPS guidance stands at $0.55-0.59.On October 3, HP provided details on its strategy and opportunities for long-term growth, along with its financial outlook for fiscal 2020. The company's plans followed weak results out of its printing segment in Q3 as well as an attempt to become a more digital-focused company.For fiscal 2020, HP estimates non-GAAP diluted net EPS to be in the range of $2.22-2.32. Also, HP anticipates generating FCF of at least $3.0 billion for fiscal 2020. The company announced a fiscal year 2020 restructuring plan wherein it would reduce its gross global headcount by ~7-9K employees through a combination of employee exits and voluntary early retirement. The company estimates that it will incur total labor and non-labor costs of approximately $1.0 billion in connection with the restructuring and other charges, with approximately $100 million in fiscal Q4 of 2019, $500 million in fiscal 2020 and the rest split between fiscal 2021 and 2022. These actions are expected to be completed in fiscal 2022. The company estimates that these actions will result in annualized gross run rate savings of about $1.0 billion by the end of fiscal 2022.Board also authorized an additional $5.0 billion for future repurchases of its outstanding shares of common stock.Also increased quarterly dividend 10% to $0.1762 from $0.16/share.In August the company announced Enrique Lores will succeed Dion Weisler as CEO, effective November 1.Recent rhetoric in HPQ has surrounded a takeover attempt by Xerox (XRX). In what has become a back-and-forth battle of "we're right" -- "no, we're right," the latest rumblings are that XRX sent a letter to HPQ management basically saying that to not engage in talks would defy logic. Given the lack of communication between the two parties, XRX has expressed interest in rallying shareholder support for a deal with HPQ in lieu of agreeing on a deal with HPQ management directly. At last check HPQ has rejected a proposal from XRX for a reported $22/share.The aforementioned "talks" with XRX have pushed the stock to three-month highs into the print as the stock has recently reclaimed the 200-day SMA (19.55).We'd also point out that XRX counts activist giant Carl Icahn as a large investor. As of his latest 13F filing (Nov. 14) Icahn held nearly 23.5 million shares of XRX.All indications are, though, that HPQ will likely not comment on these latest developments in the XRX battle during this quarter's conference call. The likely outcome of these -- what have become hostile -- takeover talks is that HPQ will reiterate its stance that it prefers to be an independent company.Ahead of tonight's print HPQ garners a $29.5 billion market capitalization and trades at about 9.1x forward earnings expectations vs peers Dell's (DELL) 7.8x, and Xerox's (XRX) 9.8x multiples.11:24TALKX Market Briefing: More of the sameThe major indices are sporting modest gains in another resilient showing that has kept broader selling efforts in check. The underlying sources of support remain much the same:Enduring hope the U.S. and China will reach a Phase One trade deal after China's Ministry of Commerce said senior officials from both sides had a phone call today and agreed on how to properly resolve relevant issues.A fear of missing out on further gains.Low interest rates. The 10-yr yield is down three basis points today to 1.73% (it hit 1.94% on Nov. 11).Low volatility. The CBOE Volatility index is down 0.9% to 11.75, which is its lowest level since April.Continued strength (and leadership) from the information technology sector (+0.3%).The financial sector (-0.4%) is a notable laggard today, pulling back along with interest rates and a yield curve that has been compressing. Overall, though, there isn't a ton of movement within the 11 sectors.Outsized moves have been reserved mostly for individual stocks. Several retailers, which reported their earnings results, jump out in that regard: Best Buy (BBY 80.79, +6.54, +8.8%), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 47.51, +8.08, +20.5%), Dollar Tree Stores (DLTR 95.92, -16.47, -14.7%), Movado (MOV 19.51, -5.69, -22.6%), and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF 15.90, -0.43, -2.6%).The Russell 2000 is up 0.3%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.2%; the S&P 500 is up 0.2%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%.11:15SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- ChemoCentryx (CCXI) soars following avacopan results -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersCCXI (30.9 +283.33%): Announced top-line data from the pivotal, global Phase III ADVOCATE trial of avacopan in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis; the study met both of its primary endpoints. The pre-specified primary endpoints were remission of acute vasculitis activity at week 26 and sustained remission at week 52, where avacopan therapy was at least statistically non-inferior to the currently used glucocorticoid-containing standard of care. BVAS remission at week 26 was achieved in 72.3% of avacopan subjects vs 70.1% of control group subjects. Sustained remission at 52 weeks was observed in 65.7% of avacopan subjects vs 54.9% in the control group, achieving both non-inferiority and superiority to glucocorticoid standard of care. Acavopan subjects also reportedly experienced further additional benefits vs control, including reduction in glucocorticoid-related toxicity and improvement in kidney function and health-related quality of life metrics. Safety results revealed an "acceptable" safety profile. Together with its partner, VFMCRP, co intends to make regulatory submissions for full marketing approval to the EMA and the FDA in 2020. Target raised at firms including H.C. Wainwright (to $40) and Piper Jaffray (to $54). At all-time highs.AUPH (6.91 +11.63%): The stock spikes to its highest levels since March on above average volume. We noted unusual action in co's Dec 9 calls yesterday (see 11/25 13:16 OPTNX). In upcoming events for co, co announced in October that efficacy and safety results from its AURORA Phase 3 study with voclosporin for the treatment of lupus nephritus were on-track to be reported by the end of the fourth quarter 2019.CHS (4.60 +10.05%): Rises to eight-month highs after topping consensus for Q3 EPS and revs. Comps fell 2.2% yr/yr vs guidance for a low to mid-single-digit decline, improving sequentially for all brands, including by 10.4 percentage points at White House Black Market and by 2 points at co's largest brand, Chico's. The comp sales decline was driven by lower average dollar sale, partially offset by an increase in transaction count. Updated its FY guidance to "reflect improvements in the business and tariff impact."Small Cap LosersMOV (19.35 -23.21%): Missed estimates for Q3 EPS and revs (fell 1.6% yr/yr to $205.62 mln). Co commented that while its strategic increase of marketing investment expenditures across its watch brands portfolio led to market share gains, co fell short of its sales plans due to category underperformance "as challenges intensified within the watch category and retail landscape." Lowered FY20 guidance below estimates, now seeing EPS of $1.55-1.70 (prior $2.25-2.35) and revs of $690-700 mln (prior $725-740 mln). Drops to circa three-month lows. TITN (14.95 -17.08%): Reported downside Q3 earnings and revs (flat yr/yr at $360.9 mln). Among category results, equipment sales declined yr/yr to $246.0 mln vs $253.8 mln in the prior year quarter; parts sales increased yr/yr to $70.8 mln vs $64.6 mln. Citing a higher effective consolidated tax rate and continued market driven challenges within the International segment, co lowered guidance for FY20 EPS at the mid-point, below consensus, and decreased its International segment revenue growth forecast. Co is including expected contributions from the recently-acquired Northwood dealership in its modeling assumptions for the balance of the year. OSMT (5.88 -10.64%): Pulls back on elevated volume after running to circa eight-month highs in recent sessions; the stock, factoring in today's move, remains higher by circa +33% month-to-date.10:57PANW Palo Alto Networks testing support at the confluence of 50 and 200 day moving averages after strength in service billings was offset by a miss on product revenue (223.14 -27.14)10:55DELL Dell Q3 Earnings Preview (54.51 -0.55)Dell reports Q3 results tonight after the close with a conference call scheduled to begin at 5:30 p.m. ET.The current Capital IQ Consensus Estimate calls for Q3 EPS of $1.59 on revenues of $23.03 billion.Guidance:Sees non-GAAP revenue range for the current fiscal year of $93-94.5 billion.Due to strong profitability in the first half of the year, DELL upped non-GAAP operating income guidance range to $9.8-10.2 billion, and increased non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $6.95-7.40.Expects non-GAAP tax rate to be 16% plus or minus 100 basis points.

Said expected to remain soft through the balance DELL and the industry anticipated. Added enterprise infrastructure expected to remain soft through the balance of the year, particularly in China.In the supply chain, DELL expects the component cost environment to remain deflationary and aggregate through at least the end of the year. Expects the decline to significantly slowdown in the second half measured against the first half.As of the last available IDC data, Dell was the leader in Cloud IT Infrastructure sales and market share. The IDC also lowered its forecast for total spending on cloud IT infrastructure in 2019 to $63.6 billion, down 4.9% from last quarter's forecast and changing from expected growth to a year-over-year decline of 2.1%.What's more, Gartner said on October 10 that worldwide PC shipments grew 1.1% in the third quarter. According to Gartner, Dell is in third place in overall market share (16.6%) with just over 11K shipments in the quarter. Interestingly, Gartner said Dell turned in the second-best growth in the quarter in terms of PC shipments (+5.5%), second only to industry-leader Lenovo (LNVGY).DELL is trading at about 7.8x forward earnings vs peers HP Inc.'s (HPQ) 9.1x, Apple's (AAPL) 20.3x, and Lenovo's 11.7x multiples.10:24SUMRX Economic Summary: New Home Sales ahead of expectations in October; large amount of economic data out tomorrow ahead of Thanksgiving holidayEconomic Data Summary:October Advance International Trade in Goods -$66.5 bln (September was -$70.4 bln).October Advance Retail Inventories 0.3% (September was revised to 0.2% from 0.3%).October Advance Wholesale Inventories 0.2% (September was revised to -0.7% from -0.3%)September FHFA Housing Price Index 0.6% (August was 0.2%)September S&P Case-Schiller Home Price Index 2.1% vs Briefing.com consensus of 2.6%; August was 2,0% November Consumer Confidence 125.5 vs Briefing.com consensus of 126.9; October was 126.1The key takeaway from the report is that consumers continue to remain relatively upbeat about the short-term outlook based in part on income prospects, which should be a support for holiday spending activity.October New Home Sales 733K vs Briefing.com consensus of 710K; September was revised to 738K from 701KThe key takeaway from the report is that the October showing was better than what meets the eye at first blush given the large, upward revision to the prior month's number.Upcoming Economic Data:Weekly MBA Mortgage Applications due out Wednesday at 7:00 (Last Week was -2.2%) October Personal Income due out Wednesday at 8:30 (Briefing.com consensus of 0.3%; September was 0.3%) October Personal Spending due out Wednesday at 8:30 (Briefing.com consensus of 0.3%; September was 0.2%) October PCE Price Index due out Wednesday at 8:30 (Briefing.com consensus of 0.2%; September was 0.0%) October Core PCE Price Index due out Wednesday at 8:30 (Briefing.com consensus of 0.1%; September was 0.0%) Weekly Initial Claims due out Wednesday at 8:30 (Briefing.com consensus of 219K; Last Week was 227K) Weekly Continuing Claims due out Wednesday at 8:30 (Last Week was 1.695 mln) Q3 GDP -- Second Estimate due out Wednesday at 8:30 (Briefing.com consensus of 1.9%; Q3 - Prelim was 1.9%) Q3 GDP Deflator - Second Estimate due out Wednesday at 8:30 (Briefing.com consensus of 1.7%; Q3 - Prelim was 1.7%) October Durable Orders due out Wednesday at 8:30 (Briefing.com consensus of 0.2%; September was -1.1%) October Durable Orders Ex-Transportation due out Wednesday at 8:30 (Briefing.com consensus of 0.9%; September was -0.3%)October Pending Home Sales due out Wednesday at 10:00 ET (September was +1.5%)Upcoming Fed/Treasury Events:Fed's Brainard to speak today at 13:00 ETThe Treasury will auction off new debt this week.

The company's loss estimate is consistent with industry insured losses of approx. $11 bln and its expected market share of less than 1% for this catastrophe event.Due to the nature of this event, including the complexity of loss assessment and factors contributing to the losses, and the preliminary nature of the information available to prepare this estimate, the actual net ultimate loss for this event may differ materially from this current estimate. The additional complexity caused by the multiple catastrophic events that have occurred in Japan in recent months, together with the expectation of a relatively high proportion of flood related losses attributable to Typhoon Hagibis, are also likely to lead to increased uncertainty surrounding the estimated net ultimate loss for this event.16:28BDX Becton Dickinson increases quarterly cash dividend to $0.79/share from $0.77/share (253.86 +3.97)16:25PANW Palo Alto Networks beats by $0.02, reports revs in-line with billings above guidance; guides Q2 revs in-line; reaffirms FY20 revs guidance; increases billings slightly, guides down EPS, impacted by announced acquisition of Aporeto for $150 mln (250.28 +3.41)Reports Q1 (Oct) earnings of $1.05 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.03; revenues rose 17.7% year/year to $772 mln vs the $769.34 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Billings increase 18% $897.4 mln vs. $870-890 mln guidanceCo issues guidance for Q2, sees EPS of $1.11-1.13, including Aporeto acquisition cost, may not be comparable to $1.30 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q2 revs of $838-848 mln vs. $844.65 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; billings $985-1.0 bln.Co issues guidance for FY20, lowers EPS to $4.90-5.00 from $5.00-5.10, including Aporeto, may not be comparable to $5.07 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; reaffirms FY20 revs of $3.44-3.48 bln vs. $3.47 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; raises billings to $4.105-4.165 bln from $4.095-4.155 blnCo is acquiring Aporeto Inc., a machine identity-based microsegmentation company for $150 million in cash Aporeto identifies workloads and applies microsegmentation across all infrastructures, helping customers secure their applications at scale.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal. It should be noted that a separate report from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal before the 2020 election is unlikely to be reached did not have a noticeable effect on the market.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.4%), which typically outperforms when the prevailing view on trade is positive, led all sectors in gains amid strength in the semiconductor stocks.

The acquisition is structured with an upfront payment of approx. $55 mln, which will be funded primarily through MTS' existing revolving credit facility, with expected earnout payments of up to an additional $25 mln based on financial performance through June 2021. Given the strong backlog position of MTS at the end of fiscal 2019, the solid backlog position of R&D, and the expected incremental Adjusted EBITDA generation, MTS expects rapid strengthening of its balance sheet following the closing of this acquisition, with a forecasted year-over-year net reduction in leverage by the end of fiscal 2020.16:14MTSC MTS Systems misses by $0.02, beats on revs; guides FY20 EPS below two analyst estimate, revs above two analyst estimate (60.56 +2.39)Reports Q4 (Sep) earnings of $0.37 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 worse than the two analyst estimate of $0.39; revenues rose 13.2% year/year to $224.08 mln vs the $218.07 mln two analyst estimate."As we enter our new fiscal year, we are excited about the resilience of our markets, our record year-end backlog, which topped $420 million, and the customer reception to our new product offerings.

Remission was defined as a BVAS score of zero and being off glucocorticoid treatment for ANCA vasculitis for at least the preceding four weeks. The pre-specified primary endpoints were remission of acute vasculitis activity at week 26 and sustained remission at week 52, where avacopan therapy was at least statistically non-inferior to the currently used glucocorticoid-containing standard of care (glucocorticoid SOC). The two primary endpoints were tested sequentially using a gatekeeping procedure to preserve the Type I error.BVAS remission at week 26 was achieved in 72.3% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 70.1% of subjects in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (p<0.0001 for non-inferiority). Sustained remission at 52 weeks was observed in 65.7% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 54.9% in the glucocorticoid SOC control group, achieving both non-inferiority and superiority to glucocorticoid standard of care (p=0.0066 for superiority of avacopan). Importantly, subjects who received avacopan experienced additional benefits compared to those in the glucocorticoid SOC control group.The topline safety results revealed an acceptable safety profile in this serious and life-threatening disease, with fewer subjects having serious adverse events (SAEs) in the avacopan group than in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (42% vs. 45%, respectively). Most reported SAEs were related to underlying ANCA vasculitis disease and commensurate with rates in previously published ANCA vasculitis trials. There were fewer subjects with serious infections in the avacopan group than the glucocorticoid SOC control group. A full analysis of the data is underway and expanded results are expected to be announced in the coming weeks.16:08HPE Hewlett Packard Enterprise beats by $0.03, misses on revs; guides Q1 EPS in-line; reaffirms FY20 guidance (17.45 +0.33)Reports Q4 (Oct) earnings of $0.49 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.46; revenues fell 9.2% year/year to $7.21 bln vs the $7.41 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.GAAP gross margins of 33.2%, up 250 basis points from the prior-year period and Non-GAAP of 33.3%, up 260 basis points from the prior-year period.

There is a conference call scheduled for 10:00 ET. Q4 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.14 (-7% yr/yr) on revenue (equipment sales) of $8.41 bln (roughly unchanged yr/yr). FY19 guidance calls for net income of $3.2 bln and revenue growth of +4% in equipment sales and +5% in net sales. FY20 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $11.13 (versus $9.92 estimate in FY19 or +5.6% yr/yr) on revenue of $35.5 bln (vs $34.6 bln estimate in 2019 or +3.8% yr/yr). Looking back, the company missed on EPS four out the last four quarters and missed on revenues two out of the last four quarters. DE shares rose 4% following its Q3 report despite a miss on EPS and lowered FY19 guidance. The Q3 report was consistent with DE's recent history, as it came into this quarter having missed EPS for five consecutive quarters. The Agriculture & Turf segment was the weak link this quarter, as segment sales declined 6% yr/yr to $5.95 bln due to lower shipment volumes and unfavorable FX. Segment operating margin declined quite a bit to 10.3% from 12.8% last year due to inefficiencies from lower shipments coupled with higher production costs.It is clear that the tariffs are hurting Deere on two fronts: It's not just that sales of equipment into those regions that are getting impacted (especially China), but it's also that US farmers getting hurt by China are not buying soybeans and other crops. It's understandable that US farmers are holding off on buying new ag equipment, as nobody knows how long this dispute is going to last.DE has a $55.5 bln valuation and trades at 16 2021 EPS vs CAT which trades at 13 times 2021 EPS.Based on the DE Weekly Nov29 $176 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~4% in either direction by weekly expiration (Friday).On a positive report, look for resistance near the $180-181 area, while support sits near the $165-166 vicinity.14:34SUMRX Earnings Out This Afternoon/Tomorrow MorningThis Afternoon: ADSK BOX CENT DELL GES HPQ KEYS QADA VEEV VMWTomorrow Morning: DAKT DE DOYU FRO UXIN14:32COMDX Energy Settlement PricesJan Crude Oil futures rose $0.23 (0.4%) to $58.3/barrel Jan Natural Gas $0.06 lower (-2.28%) at $2.529/MMBtu Jan RBOB Gasoline settled $0.02 higher (1.34%) at $1.6932/gallon Jan Heating oil futures settled $0.01 higher (0.54%) at $1.954/gallon14:25VMW VMware: Earnings Preview -- Has been on recent M&A shopping spree (166.07 -2.81)VMware (VMW), which specializes in cloud computing and virtualization software, is set to report Q3 (Oct) results today after the close (last time they reported at 16:15 ET, 15 minutes after the close) with a call to follow at 4:30pm ET.The CapitalIQ consensus for Q3 (Oct) non-GAAP EPS is $1.43 and for revenue it's $2.41 bln. Note: VMW typically guides on the call for EPS and revs for the next quarter and full year. It also guides for license revenue and non-GAAP operating margin. Last time, it guided for Q3 (Oct) non-GAAP EPS of approx $1.42 and revenue of approx $2.40 bln. It also guided to Q3 license revenue of approx $950 mln and non-GAAP operating margin of 30.3%. Of course, the highlight last quarter was VMware announcing it will acquire Pivotal Software (PVTL) and Carbon Black (CBLK). (PVTL should close by Jan 31 while CBLK closed on Oct 8.) In addition, VMW reported earnings, including a $0.05 beat and revenue upside. However, its Q3 (Oct) guidance was below consensus. So it was sort of a mixed result overall. But clearly the focus was on these two purchases. PVTL provides software development tools so that developers can create new cloud-native applications more quickly and easily. VMW already owned a stake in PVTL, so a combination made a lot of sense. Carbon Black was sort of a different animal as it focuses on cybersecurity but VMW sees it as complementary to existing VMW cybersecurity platforms. We will be looking for any updates there. The big picture here is that VMW is really pushing into the cloud. The company started out with server virtualization. However, over the last 5-10 years, VMW has expanded to a number of adjacent areas: management, software-defined networking, storage and end-user computing. Each of these businesses now are in the $1 bln range. These deals continue VMW's transformation. Finally, VMW typically reports EPS upside in the $0.04-0.10 range over the past five quarters. It also generally reports revenue upside, but the top line beat is usually more modest. The stock sold off following its JulQ report in late August, but it has recovered nicely since then, up more than 25%. Much of this move is probably from overall strength in tech stocks, but it also tells us investors are pretty optimistic about its OctQ report.14:17SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) gains following upbeat third quarter press -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersDKS (46.73 +18.51%): Posts its highest levels in more than two years after posting upside Q3 results; co topped consensus for both EPS and revs (+5.6% yr/yr to $1.96 bln). Consolidated same store sales surpassed estimates, increasing +6.0%, co's strongest comp gain since 2013, while eCommerce sales increased +13%, forming approx. 13% of total net sales. Co reported that it saw increases in both average ticket and transactions and that it recorded growth across its three primary product categories. Guided FY20 EPS above consensus. Forecasts a +2.5-3% comp sales increase for the full year. ARWR (66.82 +17.25%): Again advances to fresh multi-year highs after reporting FY19 financial results and other company updates; revs jumped +946% yr/yr to $168.8 mln. Co noted in its prepared remarks, among other updates, that there are now five TRiM-enabled candidates in the clinic; co plans to submit regulatory filings for two additional clinical candidates over the next month and intends to have 10 TRiM-enabled candidates in clinical studies targeting four different cell types and to be in three pivotal studies by the end of 2020. NTNX (33.15 +15.29%): Reported upside Q1 EPS and revenue. Billings declined yr/yr to $380.0 mln from $383.6 mln in the prior year quarter, reflecting billings compression from co's ongoing transition to a subscription model and a significant reduction in hardware billings yr/yr. Software and Support TCV revs increased +9% yr/yr to $305.0 mln on a +5% Software and Support TCV billings increase to $370.3 mln. Issued in-line Q2 EPS and FY20 revs guidance while guiding Q2 revs below consensus. Co sees Software and Support TCV billings between $1.65-1.75 bln for FY20. Price target raised at various firms, including Maxim Group (to $52 from $48). At six-month highs.Mid Cap LosersBECN (29.3 -12.2%): Missed consensus for Q4 EPS and revs (+4.9% yr/yr to $2.03 bln). Sales increased yr/yr for consolidated residential roofing (+12.7%) and non-residential roofing (+2.4%) products but decreased for consolidated complementary products (fell 3.2%). Results were negatively impacted by lower gross margins and higher acquisition-related costs relative to 2018; meanwhile, existing market sales growth in residential roofing had a positive impact. Co management commented that co is "now pivoting from a growth run via acquisitions" to focus on organic growth, margin expansion, and operating expense discipline. Also announced that CFO Joseph Nowicki will depart co later this year in order to focus on his family, charitable work, and Board service; he will remain during co's search for his successor. At three-month lows. KRTX (74.79 -8.99%): Continued volatility. In recent press, co announced that it will present and host investor meetings at the Piper Jaffray 31st Annual Healthcare Conference on Thursday of next week, December 5. AZUL (35.7 -6.72%): Brazilian stocks lag relatively amid volatility in the Brazilian real, Reuters reports that weakness in the currency followed comments made in the U.S. on Monday by the country's Economy Minister, Paulo Guedes, which included his indication that he is not worried about the currency's exchange rate fluctuations or the country's deficit; the country's central bank reportedly intervened in the foreign exchange market today to ease pressure on the real.

There are two primary catalysts:The October New Home Sales report was better than expected, with sales checking in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units. That was up 31.6% from a year-ago. October also marked the third straight month that new home sales exceeded 700,000, which is something that hasn't happened since 2007.Interest rates continue to creep lower, which bodes well for mortgage rates and prospective buyer demand. The 10-yr note yield is down two basis points to 1.74% today and down 20 basis points from where it stood on November 11.Using the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB 45.76, +0.48, +1.0%) as a proxy, the homebuilding industry has been a relative strength leader all year. Including today's gain the ITB is up 40.7% in 2019 versus a 25.2% gain for the S&P 500. The group, then, is also benefiting from performance chasing in a market that has otherwise been resilient to selling pressure.The ITB is comprised of other housing-related stocks, like Sherwin-Williams (SHW 583.09, +3.08, +0.5%) and Home Depot (HD 220.08, +1.68, +0.8%); nevertheless, there is no denying the standout performances registered by the homebuilding stocks specifically, which have rallied on the drop in mortgage rates and favorable demand dynamics, including low unemployment and pent-up buying interest.Notable movers: D.R. Horton (DHI 55.26, +0.62, +1.1%), PulteGroup (PHM 39.78, +0.34, +0.9%); Lennar (LEN 60.10, +0.67, +1.1%), NVR, Inc. (NVR 3795.69, +74.81, +2.0%), KB Home (KBH 34.98, +0.33, +0.9%), and Beazer Homes (BZH 15.46, +0.34, +2.3%)14:07CCXI ChemoCentryx off the sessions best levels, but still higher by 270% as investors and analysts alike cheer positive Phase 3 topline data (30.17 +22.11)As covered last night, the company and Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma announced positive topline data from the pivotal Phase III ADVOCATE trial of avacopan, an orally-administered selective complement 5a receptor inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (ANCA-associated vasculitis or ANCA vasculitis). In response to the outcome, ChemoCentryx plans to make regulatory submissions for full marketing approval to both the European Medicines Agency and the Food and Drug Administration in 2020.Surging higher on the positive result, shares traded north of $38 early this morning, good for gains of as much as 376%.

Last quarter, ADSK reported at 16:01, or one minute after the close, so it may be right after the close.The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for Q3 (Oct) non-GAAP EPS is $0.72. The revenue consensus estimate is $824 mln. On August 27, ADSK guided to non-GAAP EPS of $0.70-0.74 and revenue of $820-830 mln. Full year guidance was: non-GAAP EPS of $2.69-2.81 and revenue growth pf +26-27%, which we compute as $3.24-3.15 bln. Note: ADSK typically guides for revenue and EPS in the press release for the next quarter and full year.It's important to note that the company views ARR (annualized recurring revenue) as the best proxy for measuring its progress and the overall health of the business. So that will be a metric to watch. Its current FY20 guidance is for ARR of $3.425-3.385 bln. ADSK does not guide for ARR on a quarterly basis. However, last quarter, it reported ARR of $3.07 bln. Non-GAAP operating margin is another metric to watch, Q2 came in at 23%.Of note, ADSK has been transitioning its business away from maintenance revenue and toward recurring revenue for its core design platforms. With less than 20% of revenue coming from maintenance, ADSK says it's effectively finished with its business model transition. Another big push ADSK has been making is to boost its construction offerings as it has made a number of recent acquisitions in this area.The headline last quarter was that ADSK rebounded from its first EPS miss in five years in AprQ to report nice upside in JulQ. However, ADSK also lowered full-year guidance for both EPS and revenue despite reporting upside in JulQ. ADSK said it does not expect to be materially impacted by current trade tensions and macro uncertainty, but it wanted to take a prudent stance to its second half FY20 guidance.ADSK has had a halo effect on its stock in recent years, but its last two earnings reports have tarnished that image to some degree. Nevertheless, investors seem to be brushing off concerns about the guidance as they have bid the stock up more than 20% since mid-October. This makes us a bit nervous heading into this report as investors may be too optimistic.13:49COMDX Metals Settlement PricesDec gold settled today's session up $4.40 (0.3%) at $1461.4/oz Dec silver settled today's session $0.16 higher (0.98%) at $17.05/oz Dec copper settled $0.03 higher (1.13%) at $2.675/lb13:19OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:AAOI Dec 10.5 calls are seeing interest with the underlying stock up 4% (volume: 4670, open int: 10, implied vol: ~76%, prev day implied vol: 58%).

The S&P 500 (+0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.2%), and Nasdaq Composite (+0.3%) edge above their flat lines.Chief among today's news is a report that top trade negotiators from the U.S. and China reportedly reached a consensus on how to properly resolve core issues. Tucked behind the trade news are Treasury yields that remain persistently low, a CBOE Volatility Index (11.66, -0.21, -1.8%) that is trading at its lowest level since April, and a speech from Fed Chair Powell last evening that maintained the market's positive view on monetary policy.A flat start for the stock market has transitioned into marginal gains across the indices. From a sector standpoint, nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are up, with the real estate sector (+1.1%) rising above the rest amid another decline in Treasury yields. The benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.74%.The financials (-0.3%) and energy (-0.6%) sectors are the lone holdouts.Retailers remain in focus after Best Buy (BBY 82.74, +8.45, +11.4%), Burlington Stores (BURL 226.83, +18.55, +8.9%), and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 47.11, +7.68, +19.4%) impressed investors with their results and/or guidance. Fellow retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR 94.07, -18.32, -16.3%), however, has disappointed investors with its results.Separately, shares of Walt Disney (DIS 153.29, +3.60, +2.4%) have climbed to a new all-time high after Consumer Edge Research initiated coverage on the stock with an Overweight rating. The firm has a $175 price target for the stock.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.3%) may be struggling after Analog Devices (ADI 114.71, +1.78, +1.6%) missed earnings estimates and provided downside Q1 guidance. Shares of Analog Devices, however, have erased early losses and now trade firmly higher. The broader semiconductor space could be taking a much-needed breather.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured the New Home Sales report for October:New home sales in October decreased 0.7% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) from an upwardly revised 738,000 (from 701,000) in September. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 31.6%.The key takeaway from the report is that the October showing was better than what meets the eye at first blush given the large, upward revision to the prior month's number.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November eased to 125.5 (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from 125.9 in October, marking the fourth straight monthly retreat.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers continue to remain relatively upbeat about the short-term outlook based in part on income prospects, which should be a support for holiday spending activity.The Advance International Trade in Goods report for October showed a narrowing in the deficit to $66.5 billion from $70.5 billion in September. Advance Retail Inventories were up 0.3% on top of a 0.2% increase in September and Advance Wholesale Inventories increased 0.2% after declining 0.7% in September.The FHFA Housing Price Index for September increased 0.6% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in August.

To wit, new home sales were up 31.6% yr/yr with double-digit percentage increases across all regions.Hearing this, it likely won't be a surprise to hear that the S&P 500 real estate sector (+1.1%) is today's best-performing sector. The only thing is, new home sales have nothing to do directly with this sector, which is populated with office REITs, retail REITs, storage REITs, specialty REITs, and residential REITs focused on rental apartment properties.Why, then, is this sector outperforming? Key factors include:The continued drop in interest rates, which increase the appeal of a sector that provides handsome dividend yields. The 10-yr note yield is 1.73% while the sector's dividend yield is 3.31%.Sector rotation into an area of the market that has trailed the broader market's breakout to a record high. This sector has declined 1.2% over the last three months versus a 9.1% gain for the S&P 500. Some see added "catch-up potential" here in a possible year-end rally effort for the broader market.With improving economic sentiment and the persistence of low interest rates, stocks in this sector are standing out for total return potential at a time when forecasts for 2020 are primarily calling for a modest gain for the S&P 500 in 2020.Notable movers:Iron Mountain (IRM 32.54, -1.51, -4.4%): one of the few losers in the group today after the storage and information management services company announced its CFO, Stuart Brown, will be leaving Dec. 31 to pursue other interests. Barry A.

Over the next month we plan to submit regulatory filings for 2 additional clinical candidates, and by the end of 2020, we intend to have 10 TRiM -enabled candidates in clinical studies targeting four different cell types. Further, we expect to be in 3 pivotal studies by the end of 2020.""We feel confident about our ability to achieve these aggressive targets, and we have good reason to believe in the ultimate success of these clinical programs for a number of reasons.""The RNAi field is just beginning what we believe to be a golden age. This modality is increasingly accepted as a reliable and powerful way to treat a variety of diseases after two decades of intensive study and development. While the potential and value of direct conjugation delivery in unlocking the potential of RNAi was clear to us by 2016, broader confidence took longer. Interestingly, the increasing validation of RNAi is growing amid a backdrop of scarcity related to companies capable of leveraging it therapeutically and near absolute scarcity of bringing RNAi outside the liver: we think we are probably years ahead of anyone else in this regard."Shares were also up 16% yesterday after Robert W. Baird upgraded the stock to Outperform in response to Novartis's (NVS) $9.7 bln buyout of Arrowhead RNAi peer Medicines Company (MDCO).11:31HPQ HP Q4 Earnings Preview (19.92 -0.23)HP is scheduled to report Q4 results tonight after the bell with a conference call at 4:30 p.m. ET.As it stands, the Capital IQ Consensus Estimate calls for Q4 EPS of $0.58 (vs $0.54 a year ago) on essentially flat revenues of $15.29 bln.Q4 EPS guidance stands at $0.55-0.59.On October 3, HP provided details on its strategy and opportunities for long-term growth, along with its financial outlook for fiscal 2020. The company's plans followed weak results out of its printing segment in Q3 as well as an attempt to become a more digital-focused company.For fiscal 2020, HP estimates non-GAAP diluted net EPS to be in the range of $2.22-2.32. Also, HP anticipates generating FCF of at least $3.0 billion for fiscal 2020. The company announced a fiscal year 2020 restructuring plan wherein it would reduce its gross global headcount by ~7-9K employees through a combination of employee exits and voluntary early retirement. The company estimates that it will incur total labor and non-labor costs of approximately $1.0 billion in connection with the restructuring and other charges, with approximately $100 million in fiscal Q4 of 2019, $500 million in fiscal 2020 and the rest split between fiscal 2021 and 2022. These actions are expected to be completed in fiscal 2022. The company estimates that these actions will result in annualized gross run rate savings of about $1.0 billion by the end of fiscal 2022.Board also authorized an additional $5.0 billion for future repurchases of its outstanding shares of common stock.Also increased quarterly dividend 10% to $0.1762 from $0.16/share.In August the company announced Enrique Lores will succeed Dion Weisler as CEO, effective November 1.Recent rhetoric in HPQ has surrounded a takeover attempt by Xerox (XRX). In what has become a back-and-forth battle of "we're right" -- "no, we're right," the latest rumblings are that XRX sent a letter to HPQ management basically saying that to not engage in talks would defy logic. Given the lack of communication between the two parties, XRX has expressed interest in rallying shareholder support for a deal with HPQ in lieu of agreeing on a deal with HPQ management directly. At last check HPQ has rejected a proposal from XRX for a reported $22/share.The aforementioned "talks" with XRX have pushed the stock to three-month highs into the print as the stock has recently reclaimed the 200-day SMA (19.55).We'd also point out that XRX counts activist giant Carl Icahn as a large investor. As of his latest 13F filing (Nov. 14) Icahn held nearly 23.5 million shares of XRX.All indications are, though, that HPQ will likely not comment on these latest developments in the XRX battle during this quarter's conference call. The likely outcome of these -- what have become hostile -- takeover talks is that HPQ will reiterate its stance that it prefers to be an independent company.Ahead of tonight's print HPQ garners a $29.5 billion market capitalization and trades at about 9.1x forward earnings expectations vs peers Dell's (DELL) 7.8x, and Xerox's (XRX) 9.8x multiples.11:24TALKX Market Briefing: More of the sameThe major indices are sporting modest gains in another resilient showing that has kept broader selling efforts in check.

The 10-yr yield is down three basis points today to 1.73% (it hit 1.94% on Nov. 11).Low volatility. The CBOE Volatility index is down 0.9% to 11.75, which is its lowest level since April.Continued strength (and leadership) from the information technology sector (+0.3%).The financial sector (-0.4%) is a notable laggard today, pulling back along with interest rates and a yield curve that has been compressing. Overall, though, there isn't a ton of movement within the 11 sectors.Outsized moves have been reserved mostly for individual stocks. Several retailers, which reported their earnings results, jump out in that regard: Best Buy (BBY 80.79, +6.54, +8.8%), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 47.51, +8.08, +20.5%), Dollar Tree Stores (DLTR 95.92, -16.47, -14.7%), Movado (MOV 19.51, -5.69, -22.6%), and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF 15.90, -0.43, -2.6%).The Russell 2000 is up 0.3%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.2%; the S&P 500 is up 0.2%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%.11:15SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- ChemoCentryx (CCXI) soars following avacopan results -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersCCXI (30.9 +283.33%): Announced top-line data from the pivotal, global Phase III ADVOCATE trial of avacopan in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis; the study met both of its primary endpoints. The pre-specified primary endpoints were remission of acute vasculitis activity at week 26 and sustained remission at week 52, where avacopan therapy was at least statistically non-inferior to the currently used glucocorticoid-containing standard of care. BVAS remission at week 26 was achieved in 72.3% of avacopan subjects vs 70.1% of control group subjects. Sustained remission at 52 weeks was observed in 65.7% of avacopan subjects vs 54.9% in the control group, achieving both non-inferiority and superiority to glucocorticoid standard of care. Acavopan subjects also reportedly experienced further additional benefits vs control, including reduction in glucocorticoid-related toxicity and improvement in kidney function and health-related quality of life metrics. Safety results revealed an "acceptable" safety profile. Together with its partner, VFMCRP, co intends to make regulatory submissions for full marketing approval to the EMA and the FDA in 2020.

The comp sales decline was driven by lower average dollar sale, partially offset by an increase in transaction count. Updated its FY guidance to "reflect improvements in the business and tariff impact."Small Cap LosersMOV (19.35 -23.21%): Missed estimates for Q3 EPS and revs (fell 1.6% yr/yr to $205.62 mln). Co commented that while its strategic increase of marketing investment expenditures across its watch brands portfolio led to market share gains, co fell short of its sales plans due to category underperformance "as challenges intensified within the watch category and retail landscape." Lowered FY20 guidance below estimates, now seeing EPS of $1.55-1.70 (prior $2.25-2.35) and revs of $690-700 mln (prior $725-740 mln). Drops to circa three-month lows. TITN (14.95 -17.08%): Reported downside Q3 earnings and revs (flat yr/yr at $360.9 mln). Among category results, equipment sales declined yr/yr to $246.0 mln vs $253.8 mln in the prior year quarter; parts sales increased yr/yr to $70.8 mln vs $64.6 mln. Citing a higher effective consolidated tax rate and continued market driven challenges within the International segment, co lowered guidance for FY20 EPS at the mid-point, below consensus, and decreased its International segment revenue growth forecast. Co is including expected contributions from the recently-acquired Northwood dealership in its modeling assumptions for the balance of the year.

The company's loss estimate is consistent with industry insured losses of approx. $11 bln and its expected market share of less than 1% for this catastrophe event.Due to the nature of this event, including the complexity of loss assessment and factors contributing to the losses, and the preliminary nature of the information available to prepare this estimate, the actual net ultimate loss for this event may differ materially from this current estimate. The additional complexity caused by the multiple catastrophic events that have occurred in Japan in recent months, together with the expectation of a relatively high proportion of flood related losses attributable to Typhoon Hagibis, are also likely to lead to increased uncertainty surrounding the estimated net ultimate loss for this event.16:28BDX Becton Dickinson increases quarterly cash dividend to $0.79/share from $0.77/share (253.86 +3.97)16:25PANW Palo Alto Networks beats by $0.02, reports revs in-line with billings above guidance; guides Q2 revs in-line; reaffirms FY20 revs guidance; increases billings slightly, guides down EPS, impacted by announced acquisition of Aporeto for $150 mln (250.28 +3.41)Reports Q1 (Oct) earnings of $1.05 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.03; revenues rose 17.7% year/year to $772 mln vs the $769.34 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Billings increase 18% $897.4 mln vs. $870-890 mln guidanceCo issues guidance for Q2, sees EPS of $1.11-1.13, including Aporeto acquisition cost, may not be comparable to $1.30 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q2 revs of $838-848 mln vs. $844.65 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; billings $985-1.0 bln.Co issues guidance for FY20, lowers EPS to $4.90-5.00 from $5.00-5.10, including Aporeto, may not be comparable to $5.07 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; reaffirms FY20 revs of $3.44-3.48 bln vs. $3.47 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; raises billings to $4.105-4.165 bln from $4.095-4.155 blnCo is acquiring Aporeto Inc., a machine identity-based microsegmentation company for $150 million in cash Aporeto identifies workloads and applies microsegmentation across all infrastructures, helping customers secure their applications at scale.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal. It should be noted that a separate report from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal before the 2020 election is unlikely to be reached did not have a noticeable effect on the market.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.4%), which typically outperforms when the prevailing view on trade is positive, led all sectors in gains amid strength in the semiconductor stocks. NVIDIA (NVDA 221.21, +10.32, +4.9%) was a notable gainer after the stock was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley.

R&D, a Danish company founded in 2005, is a recognized leader in the design and manufacture of test systems that accurately simulate the extreme operating environments often encountered by large, rotating structures, such as wind turbines, and aircraft engine propulsion systems. R&D significantly expands MTS Test & Simulation's technology base and market presence for wind energy and aerospace markets globally; it provides compelling financial profile to enhance MTS revenue growth, margins, earnings, and free cash generation. The acquisition is expected to close by December 31, 2019.R&D is expected to contribute over $40 mln in incremental revenues in fiscal 2020 and to be accretive to Adjusted EBITDA margins for the Test & Simulation segment. R&D is further expected to be neutral to earnings in year one, exclusive of transaction costs. The acquisition is structured with an upfront payment of approx. $55 mln, which will be funded primarily through MTS' existing revolving credit facility, with expected earnout payments of up to an additional $25 mln based on financial performance through June 2021. Given the strong backlog position of MTS at the end of fiscal 2019, the solid backlog position of R&D, and the expected incremental Adjusted EBITDA generation, MTS expects rapid strengthening of its balance sheet following the closing of this acquisition, with a forecasted year-over-year net reduction in leverage by the end of fiscal 2020.16:14MTSC MTS Systems misses by $0.02, beats on revs; guides FY20 EPS below two analyst estimate, revs above two analyst estimate (60.56 +2.39)Reports Q4 (Sep) earnings of $0.37 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 worse than the two analyst estimate of $0.39; revenues rose 13.2% year/year to $224.08 mln vs the $218.07 mln two analyst estimate."As we enter our new fiscal year, we are excited about the resilience of our markets, our record year-end backlog, which topped $420 million, and the customer reception to our new product offerings.

Remission was defined as a BVAS score of zero and being off glucocorticoid treatment for ANCA vasculitis for at least the preceding four weeks. The pre-specified primary endpoints were remission of acute vasculitis activity at week 26 and sustained remission at week 52, where avacopan therapy was at least statistically non-inferior to the currently used glucocorticoid-containing standard of care (glucocorticoid SOC). The two primary endpoints were tested sequentially using a gatekeeping procedure to preserve the Type I error.BVAS remission at week 26 was achieved in 72.3% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 70.1% of subjects in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (p<0.0001 for non-inferiority). Sustained remission at 52 weeks was observed in 65.7% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 54.9% in the glucocorticoid SOC control group, achieving both non-inferiority and superiority to glucocorticoid standard of care (p=0.0066 for superiority of avacopan). Importantly, subjects who received avacopan experienced additional benefits compared to those in the glucocorticoid SOC control group.The topline safety results revealed an acceptable safety profile in this serious and life-threatening disease, with fewer subjects having serious adverse events (SAEs) in the avacopan group than in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (42% vs. 45%, respectively). Most reported SAEs were related to underlying ANCA vasculitis disease and commensurate with rates in previously published ANCA vasculitis trials. There were fewer subjects with serious infections in the avacopan group than the glucocorticoid SOC control group. A full analysis of the data is underway and expanded results are expected to be announced in the coming weeks.16:08HPE Hewlett Packard Enterprise beats by $0.03, misses on revs; guides Q1 EPS in-line; reaffirms FY20 guidance (17.45 +0.33)Reports Q4 (Oct) earnings of $0.49 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.46; revenues fell 9.2% year/year to $7.21 bln vs the $7.41 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.GAAP gross margins of 33.2%, up 250 basis points from the prior-year period and Non-GAAP of 33.3%, up 260 basis points from the prior-year period.

California man tells court he served as agent for ChinaAssociated Press State & LocalNovember 26, 2019 Tuesday 1:12 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: STATE AND REGIONALLength: 533 wordsByline: By JANIE HAR, Associated PressDateline: OAKLAND, Calif. BodyOAKLAND, Calif. (AP) - A former San Francisco Bay Area tour operator agreed Monday to plead guilty to serving as an unregistered agent for China in exchange for a possible reduced prison sentence.Xuehua Edward Peng agreed in court to a four-year prison term and a fine of $30,000 in a plea deal negotiated with prosecutors after they charged him with being an illegal foreign agent who delivered U.S. national security information to officials in China.U.S. District Judge Haywood S. Gilliam Jr., however, declined to accept the plea deal until sentencing, which is scheduled in March.Peng, 57, is a naturalized U.S. citizen in federal custody since late September, when he was arrested at his Hayward residence to the surprise of neighbors, who knew him as a nice person with a taste for luxury cars.On Monday, he appeared in red inmate garb and spoke through a Mandarin interpreter. He told the judge that he understood the terms of the agreement and that he was guilty. It did not appear that he had family or other supporters in the room.Prosecutors said Peng, under orders from a handler in China, left cash in hotel rooms in exchange for classified national security information on small electronic storage devices.The U.S. was never at risk since the information left for Peng was provided by an FBI double agent who had also been approached for spy-work by the Chinese government but decided to inform the U.S. government instead, prosecutors have said.In the plea agreement, Peng said he was approached by a state security official with China during a business trip in 2015 and agreed to collect and deliver information. He made six trips between 2015 and 2018, leaving as much as $20,000 in envelopes at a time."I was never informed of the contents of these devices and at no time learned what information was stored on them," Peng said in the plea agreement.Peng was paid "at least $30,000 for the acts" he performed as a courier, according to the agreement. Communications were done by telephone at first and then by the encrypted chat platform WeChat.A seventh drop scheduled for August 2019 was delayed. Peng was arrested the next month.Daniel Olmos, one of Peng's attorneys, declined to comment after the hearing. "The plea speaks for itself," he said.If convicted at trial, Peng could face a maximum of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.Investigators described him as a sight-seeing operator in the San Francisco area for Chinese visitors and students. Public records list Peng as president of U.S. Tour and Travel in San Francisco, but no website for the company was found.Peng entered the country in 2001 on a temporary business visa.

(AP) - A former San Francisco Bay Area tour operator agreed Monday to plead guilty to serving as an unregistered agent for China in exchange for a possible reduced prison sentence.Xuehua Edward Peng agreed in court to a four-year prison term and a fine of $30,000 in a plea deal negotiated with prosecutors after they charged him with being an illegal foreign agent who delivered U.S. national security information to officials in China.U.S. District Judge Haywood S. Gilliam Jr., however, declined to accept the plea deal until sentencing, which is scheduled in March.Peng, 57, is a naturalized U.S. citizen in federal custody since late September, when he was arrested at his Hayward residence to the surprise of neighbors, who knew him as a nice person with a taste for luxury cars.On Monday, he appeared in red inmate garb and spoke through a Mandarin interpreter. He told the judge that he understood the terms of the agreement and that he was guilty. It did not appear that he had family or other supporters in the room.Prosecutors said Peng, under orders from a handler in China, left cash in hotel rooms in exchange for classified national security information on small electronic storage devices.The U.S. was never at risk since the information left for Peng was provided by an FBI double agent who had also been approached for spy-work by the Chinese government but decided to inform the U.S. government instead, prosecutors have said.In the plea agreement, Peng said he was approached by a state security official with China during a business trip in 2015 and agreed to collect and deliver information. He made six trips between 2015 and 2018, leaving as much as $20,000 in envelopes at a time."I was never informed of the contents of these devices and at no time learned what information was stored on them," Peng said in the plea agreement.Peng was paid "at least $30,000 for the acts" he performed as a courier, according to the agreement. Communications were done by telephone at first and then by the encrypted chat platform WeChat.A seventh drop scheduled for August 2019 was delayed. Peng was arrested the next month.Daniel Olmos, one of Peng's attorneys, declined to comment after the hearing. "The plea speaks for itself," he said.If convicted at trial, Peng could face a maximum of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.Investigators described him as a sight-seeing operator in the San Francisco area for Chinese visitors and students. Public records list Peng as president of U.S. Tour and Travel in San Francisco, but no website for the company was found.Peng entered the country in 2001 on a temporary business visa. He became a lawful permanent resident in 2006 following his marriage and was naturalized in September 2012.He has a background in mechanical engineering and is licensed in California as an acupuncturist.A magistrate judge denied his earlier request for a free federal lawyer, saying he had too many assets, and refused to let him out on bail given that he had an apartment and a mistress in China.FBI Director Christopher Wray has said China poses a more serious counterintelligence threat to the U.S. than any other country, including Russia.Load-Date: November 26, 2019End of Document

The Challenges of TikTok Go Beyond Teens Making Memes. The Company Now Has a U.S. National ProbeThe Daily Utah Chronicle: University of UtahDecember 22, 2019 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 831 wordsBodyKenzie Wilkinson, a freshman studying Multi-Disciplinary Design at the University of Utah, has a theory on why the mobile application TikTok appeals to a younger demographic. "They're adapted to online challenges and who can make the best videos," she said. Though TikTok has exploded in popularity, Wilkinson believes many her peers initially downloading the app as "a joke." "Mainly e-boys and e-girls are on it," she said, a descriptor for young people who employ a reconfigured emo aesthetic with a substantial presence online.The application has drawn a massive audience of teens and young users. Tiktok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that runs other social apps on mobile devices. Last month, the federal government's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States launched a national security probe into TikTok to evaluate risks for the country.Zachary Stickney, a PhD student in the U's political science department who is interested in the ethics of emerging technology, tech and activism, says this concern by the U.S. isn't new. "In 2012, under the Obama administration, bipartisan members of the House Intelligence Committee released a report expressing concerns over Chinese telecom giant Huawei," he said. The government worried "that the company might be used as an intelligence-gathering tool by the Chinese communist party." Critics of TikTok highlight the risks of censorship and propaganda. TikTok has been accused of taking videos down mentioning certain aspects of Chinese history, like Tiananmen Square, and the Islamic State has used the app to share recruiting videos that have since been taken down.So far, there have been 1.5 billion worldwide downloads of TikTok through Apple's App Store and Google Play, surpassing Facebook and Instagram. Since its launch last year in November, users in the U.S. have generated $62.4 million for the company."The questions the U.S. government has are what data is being gathered and how," said Stickney. "How is it being stored, and who has access? Does the company have any ties to the Chinese government which may be cause for concern?"Introducing legislation on Monday, Nov. 25 to combat big tech companies storing data within servers hosted in China, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri contended that TikTok's attempt to assuage users and officials that their company doesn't operate in China was insufficient. "All it takes is one knock on the door of their parent company based in China from a Communist Party official for that data to be transferred to the Chinese government's hands whenever they need it," he said.Hawley also criticized Apple for its ties with China. These concerns may be especially prominent in lawmakers' minds as many fear potential interference from foreign governments in the 2020 election.In 2017, China passed an intelligence law, and Stickney says the contents of Article Seven are unambiguous to interpretation. " The law states, "any organization or citizen shall support, assist, and cooperate with state intelligence work according to law," possibly leaving room for the country to require tech companies to comply with their intelligence efforts. However, Stickney says these attempts carried by the U.S. government and Hawley may not be enough to squelch the vulnerabilities affecting national security matters. In fact, many significant problems originate not in China or Russia, but in the U.S."We've already seen that U.S. law and regulation in this space probably isn't sufficient, even in regards to American companies," Stickney said. "Election interference [and] surveillance capitalism have shown us that protections around data and privacy in the U.S. are not sufficient, even for U.S. companies." These issues are associated consistently with Facebook, a giant tech company under fire with several scandals involving political firm Cambridge Analytica in 2018 for accessing over 50 million users' data to influence voters during the 2016 presidential election. The Federal Trade Commission fined the company $5 billion over privacy ordeals.A study group of other women familiar with the app nodded their heads in agreement with Wilkinson, not persuaded by the potential online culture shift mobilized by TikTok. "We all laugh at the memes but it's just a false portrayal of reality," she said. "At the end of the day, it's just an app."Stickney said that even if the U.S. ends up clearing TikTok of any wrongdoing, it's still valuable for the public to understand their participation in the limelight of data privacy. "I want to emphasize that these are absolutely the right questions to be asking - not only of companies with foreign ties, but domestically as well," he said. "The value of the data these organizations are able to gather, and the type of influence which can be exerted on a variety of levels, cannot be understated."[email protected] @MiacelSelkAbout the ContributorsMiacel Spotted Elk, News WriterMiacel Spotted Elk is a news writer.Load-Date: December 22, 2019End of Document

The app was introduced in recent months and has been downloaded millions of times from the Apple and Google play store, the report said. According to The Times, majority of the app's users are Emirati, though it was also downloaded throughout the Middle East, Europe, Asia, Africa and North America.Similar messaging apps, like WhatsApp and Skype, are banned in the UAE, making ToTok a popular choice for those looking to bypass the country's strict digital security rules. According to The Times, which compiled its investigation into the app using technical analysis and interviews with computer security experts, the firm that owns Totok, Breej Holding, is likely a cover for a company affiliated with Abu Dhabi-based hacking group DarkMatter. The Times added that DarkMatter is currently under FBI investigation for possible cybercrimes.Spokespersons for the CIA and the Emirati government declined to comment to The Times on its investigation.Recent advertisements put out by Huawei endorsed the app as "free, fast and secure." An editor's review on Huawei's app gallery calls the app "new, simple, fast and fun messenger with encrypted messaging and video calling."Huawei did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment. On Thursday, Google removed the app from its Play store, according to The Times, saying that ToTok violated unspecified policies, while Apple removed ToTok from its App Store on Friday. Huawei's endorsement of the app comes at a time when Huawei's security has been called into question.The US has heightened concerns in recent months that Huawei technology could pose a national security risk and may be used as a backdoor for Chinese government espionage.The US Department of Commerce added Huawei to a trade blacklist in May, which prevented the company from buying important parts and components from American companies without US government approval.The US extended its grace period for Huawei that would allow it to buy parts from US companies for an extra 90 days in November.NOW WATCH: Apple just released iOS 13.2 with 60 new emoji and emoji variations.

The company's plans followed weak results out of its printing segment in Q3 as well as an attempt to become a more digital-focused company.For fiscal 2020, HP estimates non-GAAP diluted net EPS to be in the range of $2.22-2.32. Also, HP anticipates generating FCF of at least $3.0 billion for fiscal 2020. The company announced a fiscal year 2020 restructuring plan wherein it would reduce its gross global headcount by ~7-9K employees through a combination of employee exits and voluntary early retirement. The company estimates that it will incur total labor and non-labor costs of approximately $1.0 billion in connection with the restructuring and other charges, with approximately $100 million in fiscal Q4 of 2019, $500 million in fiscal 2020 and the rest split between fiscal 2021 and 2022. These actions are expected to be completed in fiscal 2022. The company estimates that these actions will result in annualized gross run rate savings of about $1.0 billion by the end of fiscal 2022.Board also authorized an additional $5.0 billion for future repurchases of its outstanding shares of common stock.Also increased quarterly dividend 10% to $0.1762 from $0.16/share.In August the company announced Enrique Lores will succeed Dion Weisler as CEO, effective November 1.Recent rhetoric in HPQ has surrounded a takeover attempt by Xerox (XRX). In what has become a back-and-forth battle of "we're right" -- "no, we're right," the latest rumblings are that XRX sent a letter to HPQ management basically saying that to not engage in talks would defy logic. Given the lack of communication between the two parties, XRX has expressed interest in rallying shareholder support for a deal with HPQ in lieu of agreeing on a deal with HPQ management directly. At last check HPQ has rejected a proposal from XRX for a reported $22/share.The aforementioned "talks" with XRX have pushed the stock to three-month highs into the print as the stock has recently reclaimed the 200-day SMA (19.55).We'd also point out that XRX counts activist giant Carl Icahn as a large investor. As of his latest 13F filing (Nov. 14) Icahn held nearly 23.5 million shares of XRX.All indications are, though, that HPQ will likely not comment on these latest developments in the XRX battle during this quarter's conference call. The likely outcome of these -- what have become hostile -- takeover talks is that HPQ will reiterate its stance that it prefers to be an independent company.Ahead of tonight's print HPQ garners a $29.5 billion market capitalization and trades at about 9.1x forward earnings expectations vs peers Dell's (DELL) 7.8x, and Xerox's (XRX) 9.8x multiples.11:24TALKX Market Briefing: More of the sameThe major indices are sporting modest gains in another resilient showing that has kept broader selling efforts in check.

The 10-yr yield is down three basis points today to 1.73% (it hit 1.94% on Nov. 11).Low volatility. The CBOE Volatility index is down 0.9% to 11.75, which is its lowest level since April.Continued strength (and leadership) from the information technology sector (+0.3%).The financial sector (-0.4%) is a notable laggard today, pulling back along with interest rates and a yield curve that has been compressing. Overall, though, there isn't a ton of movement within the 11 sectors.Outsized moves have been reserved mostly for individual stocks. Several retailers, which reported their earnings results, jump out in that regard: Best Buy (BBY 80.79, +6.54, +8.8%), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 47.51, +8.08, +20.5%), Dollar Tree Stores (DLTR 95.92, -16.47, -14.7%), Movado (MOV 19.51, -5.69, -22.6%), and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF 15.90, -0.43, -2.6%).The Russell 2000 is up 0.3%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.2%; the S&P 500 is up 0.2%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%.11:15SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- ChemoCentryx (CCXI) soars following avacopan results -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersCCXI (30.9 +283.33%): Announced top-line data from the pivotal, global Phase III ADVOCATE trial of avacopan in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis; the study met both of its primary endpoints. The pre-specified primary endpoints were remission of acute vasculitis activity at week 26 and sustained remission at week 52, where avacopan therapy was at least statistically non-inferior to the currently used glucocorticoid-containing standard of care. BVAS remission at week 26 was achieved in 72.3% of avacopan subjects vs 70.1% of control group subjects. Sustained remission at 52 weeks was observed in 65.7% of avacopan subjects vs 54.9% in the control group, achieving both non-inferiority and superiority to glucocorticoid standard of care. Acavopan subjects also reportedly experienced further additional benefits vs control, including reduction in glucocorticoid-related toxicity and improvement in kidney function and health-related quality of life metrics. Safety results revealed an "acceptable" safety profile. Together with its partner, VFMCRP, co intends to make regulatory submissions for full marketing approval to the EMA and the FDA in 2020.

The comp sales decline was driven by lower average dollar sale, partially offset by an increase in transaction count. Updated its FY guidance to "reflect improvements in the business and tariff impact."Small Cap LosersMOV (19.35 -23.21%): Missed estimates for Q3 EPS and revs (fell 1.6% yr/yr to $205.62 mln). Co commented that while its strategic increase of marketing investment expenditures across its watch brands portfolio led to market share gains, co fell short of its sales plans due to category underperformance "as challenges intensified within the watch category and retail landscape." Lowered FY20 guidance below estimates, now seeing EPS of $1.55-1.70 (prior $2.25-2.35) and revs of $690-700 mln (prior $725-740 mln). Drops to circa three-month lows. TITN (14.95 -17.08%): Reported downside Q3 earnings and revs (flat yr/yr at $360.9 mln). Among category results, equipment sales declined yr/yr to $246.0 mln vs $253.8 mln in the prior year quarter; parts sales increased yr/yr to $70.8 mln vs $64.6 mln. Citing a higher effective consolidated tax rate and continued market driven challenges within the International segment, co lowered guidance for FY20 EPS at the mid-point, below consensus, and decreased its International segment revenue growth forecast. Co is including expected contributions from the recently-acquired Northwood dealership in its modeling assumptions for the balance of the year.

The company's loss estimate is consistent with industry insured losses of approx. $11 bln and its expected market share of less than 1% for this catastrophe event.Due to the nature of this event, including the complexity of loss assessment and factors contributing to the losses, and the preliminary nature of the information available to prepare this estimate, the actual net ultimate loss for this event may differ materially from this current estimate. The additional complexity caused by the multiple catastrophic events that have occurred in Japan in recent months, together with the expectation of a relatively high proportion of flood related losses attributable to Typhoon Hagibis, are also likely to lead to increased uncertainty surrounding the estimated net ultimate loss for this event.16:28BDX Becton Dickinson increases quarterly cash dividend to $0.79/share from $0.77/share (253.86 +3.97)16:25PANW Palo Alto Networks beats by $0.02, reports revs in-line with billings above guidance; guides Q2 revs in-line; reaffirms FY20 revs guidance; increases billings slightly, guides down EPS, impacted by announced acquisition of Aporeto for $150 mln (250.28 +3.41)Reports Q1 (Oct) earnings of $1.05 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.03; revenues rose 17.7% year/year to $772 mln vs the $769.34 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Billings increase 18% $897.4 mln vs. $870-890 mln guidanceCo issues guidance for Q2, sees EPS of $1.11-1.13, including Aporeto acquisition cost, may not be comparable to $1.30 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q2 revs of $838-848 mln vs. $844.65 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; billings $985-1.0 bln.Co issues guidance for FY20, lowers EPS to $4.90-5.00 from $5.00-5.10, including Aporeto, may not be comparable to $5.07 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; reaffirms FY20 revs of $3.44-3.48 bln vs. $3.47 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; raises billings to $4.105-4.165 bln from $4.095-4.155 blnCo is acquiring Aporeto Inc., a machine identity-based microsegmentation company for $150 million in cash Aporeto identifies workloads and applies microsegmentation across all infrastructures, helping customers secure their applications at scale.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal. It should be noted that a separate report from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal before the 2020 election is unlikely to be reached did not have a noticeable effect on the market.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.4%), which typically outperforms when the prevailing view on trade is positive, led all sectors in gains amid strength in the semiconductor stocks.

The acquisition is structured with an upfront payment of approx. $55 mln, which will be funded primarily through MTS' existing revolving credit facility, with expected earnout payments of up to an additional $25 mln based on financial performance through June 2021. Given the strong backlog position of MTS at the end of fiscal 2019, the solid backlog position of R&D, and the expected incremental Adjusted EBITDA generation, MTS expects rapid strengthening of its balance sheet following the closing of this acquisition, with a forecasted year-over-year net reduction in leverage by the end of fiscal 2020.16:14MTSC MTS Systems misses by $0.02, beats on revs; guides FY20 EPS below two analyst estimate, revs above two analyst estimate (60.56 +2.39)Reports Q4 (Sep) earnings of $0.37 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 worse than the two analyst estimate of $0.39; revenues rose 13.2% year/year to $224.08 mln vs the $218.07 mln two analyst estimate."As we enter our new fiscal year, we are excited about the resilience of our markets, our record year-end backlog, which topped $420 million, and the customer reception to our new product offerings.

Remission was defined as a BVAS score of zero and being off glucocorticoid treatment for ANCA vasculitis for at least the preceding four weeks. The pre-specified primary endpoints were remission of acute vasculitis activity at week 26 and sustained remission at week 52, where avacopan therapy was at least statistically non-inferior to the currently used glucocorticoid-containing standard of care (glucocorticoid SOC). The two primary endpoints were tested sequentially using a gatekeeping procedure to preserve the Type I error.BVAS remission at week 26 was achieved in 72.3% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 70.1% of subjects in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (p<0.0001 for non-inferiority). Sustained remission at 52 weeks was observed in 65.7% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 54.9% in the glucocorticoid SOC control group, achieving both non-inferiority and superiority to glucocorticoid standard of care (p=0.0066 for superiority of avacopan). Importantly, subjects who received avacopan experienced additional benefits compared to those in the glucocorticoid SOC control group.The topline safety results revealed an acceptable safety profile in this serious and life-threatening disease, with fewer subjects having serious adverse events (SAEs) in the avacopan group than in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (42% vs. 45%, respectively). Most reported SAEs were related to underlying ANCA vasculitis disease and commensurate with rates in previously published ANCA vasculitis trials. There were fewer subjects with serious infections in the avacopan group than the glucocorticoid SOC control group. A full analysis of the data is underway and expanded results are expected to be announced in the coming weeks.16:08HPE Hewlett Packard Enterprise beats by $0.03, misses on revs; guides Q1 EPS in-line; reaffirms FY20 guidance (17.45 +0.33)Reports Q4 (Oct) earnings of $0.49 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.46; revenues fell 9.2% year/year to $7.21 bln vs the $7.41 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.GAAP gross margins of 33.2%, up 250 basis points from the prior-year period and Non-GAAP of 33.3%, up 260 basis points from the prior-year period.

The S&P 500 (+0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.2%), and Nasdaq Composite (+0.3%) edge above their flat lines.Chief among today's news is a report that top trade negotiators from the U.S. and China reportedly reached a consensus on how to properly resolve core issues. Tucked behind the trade news are Treasury yields that remain persistently low, a CBOE Volatility Index (11.66, -0.21, -1.8%) that is trading at its lowest level since April, and a speech from Fed Chair Powell last evening that maintained the market's positive view on monetary policy.A flat start for the stock market has transitioned into marginal gains across the indices. From a sector standpoint, nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are up, with the real estate sector (+1.1%) rising above the rest amid another decline in Treasury yields. The benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.74%.The financials (-0.3%) and energy (-0.6%) sectors are the lone holdouts.Retailers remain in focus after Best Buy (BBY 82.74, +8.45, +11.4%), Burlington Stores (BURL 226.83, +18.55, +8.9%), and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 47.11, +7.68, +19.4%) impressed investors with their results and/or guidance. Fellow retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR 94.07, -18.32, -16.3%), however, has disappointed investors with its results.Separately, shares of Walt Disney (DIS 153.29, +3.60, +2.4%) have climbed to a new all-time high after Consumer Edge Research initiated coverage on the stock with an Overweight rating. The firm has a $175 price target for the stock.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.3%) may be struggling after Analog Devices (ADI 114.71, +1.78, +1.6%) missed earnings estimates and provided downside Q1 guidance. Shares of Analog Devices, however, have erased early losses and now trade firmly higher. The broader semiconductor space could be taking a much-needed breather.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which features the New Home Sales report for October:New home sales in October decreased 0.7% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) from an upwardly revised 738,000 (from 701,000) in September. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 31.6%.The key takeaway from the report is that the October showing was better than what meets the eye at first blush given the large, upward revision to the prior month's number.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November eased to 125.5 (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from 125.9 in October, marking the fourth straight monthly retreat.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers continue to remain relatively upbeat about the short-term outlook based in part on income prospects, which should be a support for holiday spending activity.The Advance International Trade in Goods report for October showed a narrowing in the deficit to $66.5 billion from $70.5 billion in September. Advance Retail Inventories were up 0.3% on top of a 0.2% increase in September and Advance Wholesale Inventories increased 0.2% after declining 0.7% in September.The FHFA Housing Price Index for September increased 0.6% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in August. The S&P Case-Shiller Housing Price Index for September increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) following an unrevised 2.0% increase in August.12:54SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (27.74 mln -2.98%), CCXI (22.28 mln +266.25%), PFE (13.84 mln -0.48%), MDCO (12.32 mln +0.1%)Materials: VALE (14 mln -0.25%), FCX (12.4 mln +0.13%)Industrials: GE (29.8 mln -0.65%)Consumer Discretionary: NIO (31.14 mln +7.07%), DLTR (14.6 mln -16.36%), DKS (12.46 mln +19.2%)Information Technology: FIT (41.95 mln +3.61%), AMD (26.78 mln -1.91%), NOK (14.95 mln -1.3%), HPE (14.07 mln -8.68%), NTNX (12.69 mln +16.73%)Financials: BAC (20.07 mln -0.67%), ITUB (18.37 mln -3.84%)Energy: CHK (60.44 mln +2.69%), SWN (18 mln -4.36%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: CCXI (39.14x +266.25%), GBT (5.85x +4.8%), CBAY (5.48x +10.53%), MDCO (3.26x +0.1%), EDIT (2.48x +3.9%)Industrials: BECN (3.47x -10.46%)Consumer Discretionary: DLTR (9.98x -16.36%), DKS (6.98x +19.2%), MOV (5.43x -21.59%), BBY (3.85x +11.52%), CHS (2.59x +15.19%), ANF (2.56x -3%), BURL (2.53x +9.09%)Information Technology: NTNX (4.94x +16.73%), PANW (4.8x -12.03%), AMBA (2.75x -4.86%)Financials: MUFG (7.69x -0.65%), WBK (2.63x -1.32%)12:52SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: CCXI (29.52 +266.25%), ARWR (66.89 +17.37%), AUPH (7 +13%), CLVS (11.4 +10.98%), CBAY (1.47 +10.53%), ABEO (3.15 +9.76%), YMAB (32.12 +8.66%), SENS (1.04 +7.37%)Industrials: DY (54.58 +9.27%)Consumer Discretionary: DKS (47 +19.2%), CHS (4.82 +15.19%), BBY (82.8 +11.52%), BURL (227.19 +9.09%), EXPR (3.95 +7.63%), NIO (2.2 +7.07%), DESP (12.5 +6.38%), WTRH (0.4 +6.33%)Information Technology: NTNX (33.56 +16.73%), GTT (5.96 +8.8%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: CYH (3.12 -7.57%), XON (5.67 -6.28%), ACOR (1.79 -6.05%)Industrials: BECN (29.88 -10.46%), AZUL (35.4 -7.5%), GOL (15.36 -6.28%)Consumer Discretionary: MOV (19.76 -21.59%), DLTR (94.01 -16.36%)Information Technology: PANW (220.16 -12.03%), HPE (15.94 -8.68%), PAGS (30.88 -8.26%)Energy: MDR (0.72 -10.59%), RRC (3.51 -9.66%), WLL (4.99 -8.1%), EXTN (5.79 -7.95%), TGS (5.74 -6.29%), SDRL (1.1 -5.98%)Consumer Staples: DF (0.1 -7.3%), XXII (0.95 -7.03%)12:40DIS Walt Disney advances 2.5% to new all-time highs after Consumer Edge Research initiates coverage on shares with an Overweight rating and the NY Post reports that the company is adding roughly 1 mln new subscribers to Disney+ each day (153.25 +3.56)12:37XLRE Sector Briefing: Real Estate (38.54 +0.39)The New Home Sales report for October was better than expected and reflected the impressive rebound in new home sales that has been unfolding this year. To wit, new home sales were up 31.6% yr/yr with double-digit percentage increases across all regions.Hearing this, it likely won't be a surprise to hear that the S&P 500 real estate sector (+1.1%) is today's best-performing sector. The only thing is, new home sales have nothing to do directly with this sector, which is populated with office REITs, retail REITs, storage REITs, specialty REITs, and residential REITs focused on rental apartment properties.Why, then, is this sector outperforming? Key factors include:The continued drop in interest rates, which increase the appeal of a sector that provides handsome dividend yields. The 10-yr note yield is 1.73% while the sector's dividend yield is 3.31%.Sector rotation into an area of the market that has trailed the broader market's breakout to a record high. This sector has declined 1.2% over the last three months versus a 9.1% gain for the S&P 500. Some see added "catch-up potential" here in a possible year-end rally effort for the broader market.With improving economic sentiment and the persistence of low interest rates, stocks in this sector are standing out for total return potential at a time when forecasts for 2020 are primarily calling for a modest gain for the S&P 500 in 2020.Notable movers:Iron Mountain (IRM 32.54, -1.51, -4.4%): one of the few losers in the group today after the storage and information management services company announced its CFO, Stuart Brown, will be leaving Dec. 31 to pursue other interests. Barry A. Hytinen, current EVP and CFO at HanesBrands (HBI), has been named as his successor; IRM reaffirmed its FY19 guidance.CBRE Group (CBRE 57.71, +1.59, +2.8%): no news, but stock has broken out to a new all-time high today, albeit on light volumeSBA Communications (SBAC 236.78, +5.24, +2.3%): no news as stock rises to challenge its 50-day moving average (239.54)American Tower (AMT 213.46, +3.74, +1.8%): no news, but drawing support after flirting with test of 200-day moving average (207.03) on Monday12:05ARWR Arrowhead sees extension of recent run to multi-year highs as shares jump 16% today in response to last night's full year financial results; shares now up 432% YTD (66.02 +9.03)As covered last night, the company reported FY19 EPS of $0.69 vs $0.73 S&P Capital IQ Consensus Estimate; revs were +946% to $168.8 mln vs $166.91 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Highlights from last night's conference call (Prepared remarks):"There are now 5 TRiMTM-enabled candidates in the clinic, 3 of which are whollyowned and 2 are partnered. Over the next month we plan to submit regulatory filings for 2 additional clinical candidates, and by the end of 2020, we intend to have 10 TRiM -enabled candidates in clinical studies targeting four different cell types. Further, we expect to be in 3 pivotal studies by the end of 2020.""We feel confident about our ability to achieve these aggressive targets, and we have good reason to believe in the ultimate success of these clinical programs for a number of reasons.""The RNAi field is just beginning what we believe to be a golden age. This modality is increasingly accepted as a reliable and powerful way to treat a variety of diseases after two decades of intensive study and development. While the potential and value of direct conjugation delivery in unlocking the potential of RNAi was clear to us by 2016, broader confidence took longer. Interestingly, the increasing validation of RNAi is growing amid a backdrop of scarcity related to companies capable of leveraging it therapeutically and near absolute scarcity of bringing RNAi outside the liver: we think we are probably years ahead of anyone else in this regard."Shares were also up 16% yesterday after Robert W. Baird upgraded the stock to Outperform in response to Novartis's (NVS) $9.7 bln buyout of Arrowhead RNAi peer Medicines Company (MDCO).11:31HPQ HP Q4 Earnings Preview (19.92 -0.23)HP is scheduled to report Q4 results tonight after the bell with a conference call at 4:30 p.m. ET.As it stands, the Capital IQ Consensus Estimate calls for Q4 EPS of $0.58 (vs $0.54 a year ago) on essentially flat revenues of $15.29 bln.Q4 EPS guidance stands at $0.55-0.59.On October 3, HP provided details on its strategy and opportunities for long-term growth, along with its financial outlook for fiscal 2020. The company's plans followed weak results out of its printing segment in Q3 as well as an attempt to become a more digital-focused company.For fiscal 2020, HP estimates non-GAAP diluted net EPS to be in the range of $2.22-2.32. Also, HP anticipates generating FCF of at least $3.0 billion for fiscal 2020. The company announced a fiscal year 2020 restructuring plan wherein it would reduce its gross global headcount by ~7-9K employees through a combination of employee exits and voluntary early retirement. The company estimates that it will incur total labor and non-labor costs of approximately $1.0 billion in connection with the restructuring and other charges, with approximately $100 million in fiscal Q4 of 2019, $500 million in fiscal 2020 and the rest split between fiscal 2021 and 2022. These actions are expected to be completed in fiscal 2022. The company estimates that these actions will result in annualized gross run rate savings of about $1.0 billion by the end of fiscal 2022.Board also authorized an additional $5.0 billion for future repurchases of its outstanding shares of common stock.Also increased quarterly dividend 10% to $0.1762 from $0.16/share.In August the company announced Enrique Lores will succeed Dion Weisler as CEO, effective November 1.Recent rhetoric in HPQ has surrounded a takeover attempt by Xerox (XRX). In what has become a back-and-forth battle of "we're right" -- "no, we're right," the latest rumblings are that XRX sent a letter to HPQ management basically saying that to not engage in talks would defy logic. Given the lack of communication between the two parties, XRX has expressed interest in rallying shareholder support for a deal with HPQ in lieu of agreeing on a deal with HPQ management directly. At last check HPQ has rejected a proposal from XRX for a reported $22/share.The aforementioned "talks" with XRX have pushed the stock to three-month highs into the print as the stock has recently reclaimed the 200-day SMA (19.55).We'd also point out that XRX counts activist giant Carl Icahn as a large investor. As of his latest 13F filing (Nov. 14) Icahn held nearly 23.5 million shares of XRX.All indications are, though, that HPQ will likely not comment on these latest developments in the XRX battle during this quarter's conference call. The likely outcome of these -- what have become hostile -- takeover talks is that HPQ will reiterate its stance that it prefers to be an independent company.Ahead of tonight's print HPQ garners a $29.5 billion market capitalization and trades at about 9.1x forward earnings expectations vs peers Dell's (DELL) 7.8x, and Xerox's (XRX) 9.8x multiples.11:24TALKX Market Briefing: More of the sameThe major indices are sporting modest gains in another resilient showing that has kept broader selling efforts in check. The underlying sources of support remain much the same:Enduring hope the U.S. and China will reach a Phase One trade deal after China's Ministry of Commerce said senior officials from both sides had a phone call today and agreed on how to properly resolve relevant issues.A fear of missing out on further gains.Low interest rates. The 10-yr yield is down three basis points today to 1.73% (it hit 1.94% on Nov. 11).Low volatility. The CBOE Volatility index is down 0.9% to 11.75, which is its lowest level since April.Continued strength (and leadership) from the information technology sector (+0.3%).The financial sector (-0.4%) is a notable laggard today, pulling back along with interest rates and a yield curve that has been compressing. Overall, though, there isn't a ton of movement within the 11 sectors.Outsized moves have been reserved mostly for individual stocks. Several retailers, which reported their earnings results, jump out in that regard: Best Buy (BBY 80.79, +6.54, +8.8%), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 47.51, +8.08, +20.5%), Dollar Tree Stores (DLTR 95.92, -16.47, -14.7%), Movado (MOV 19.51, -5.69, -22.6%), and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF 15.90, -0.43, -2.6%).The Russell 2000 is up 0.3%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.2%; the S&P 500 is up 0.2%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%.11:15SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- ChemoCentryx (CCXI) soars following avacopan results -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersCCXI (30.9 +283.33%): Announced top-line data from the pivotal, global Phase III ADVOCATE trial of avacopan in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis; the study met both of its primary endpoints. The pre-specified primary endpoints were remission of acute vasculitis activity at week 26 and sustained remission at week 52, where avacopan therapy was at least statistically non-inferior to the currently used glucocorticoid-containing standard of care. BVAS remission at week 26 was achieved in 72.3% of avacopan subjects vs 70.1% of control group subjects. Sustained remission at 52 weeks was observed in 65.7% of avacopan subjects vs 54.9% in the control group, achieving both non-inferiority and superiority to glucocorticoid standard of care. Acavopan subjects also reportedly experienced further additional benefits vs control, including reduction in glucocorticoid-related toxicity and improvement in kidney function and health-related quality of life metrics. Safety results revealed an "acceptable" safety profile. Together with its partner, VFMCRP, co intends to make regulatory submissions for full marketing approval to the EMA and the FDA in 2020. Target raised at firms including H.C. Wainwright (to $40) and Piper Jaffray (to $54). At all-time highs.AUPH (6.91 +11.63%): The stock spikes to its highest levels since March on above average volume. We noted unusual action in co's Dec 9 calls yesterday (see 11/25 13:16 OPTNX). In upcoming events for co, co announced in October that efficacy and safety results from its AURORA Phase 3 study with voclosporin for the treatment of lupus nephritus were on-track to be reported by the end of the fourth quarter 2019.CHS (4.60 +10.05%): Rises to eight-month highs after topping consensus for Q3 EPS and revs. Comps fell 2.2% yr/yr vs guidance for a low to mid-single-digit decline, improving sequentially for all brands, including by 10.4 percentage points at White House Black Market and by 2 points at co's largest brand, Chico's. The comp sales decline was driven by lower average dollar sale, partially offset by an increase in transaction count. Updated its FY guidance to "reflect improvements in the business and tariff impact."Small Cap LosersMOV (19.35 -23.21%): Missed estimates for Q3 EPS and revs (fell 1.6% yr/yr to $205.62 mln). Co commented that while its strategic increase of marketing investment expenditures across its watch brands portfolio led to market share gains, co fell short of its sales plans due to category underperformance "as challenges intensified within the watch category and retail landscape." Lowered FY20 guidance below estimates, now seeing EPS of $1.55-1.70 (prior $2.25-2.35) and revs of $690-700 mln (prior $725-740 mln). Drops to circa three-month lows. TITN (14.95 -17.08%): Reported downside Q3 earnings and revs (flat yr/yr at $360.9 mln). Among category results, equipment sales declined yr/yr to $246.0 mln vs $253.8 mln in the prior year quarter; parts sales increased yr/yr to $70.8 mln vs $64.6 mln. Citing a higher effective consolidated tax rate and continued market driven challenges within the International segment, co lowered guidance for FY20 EPS at the mid-point, below consensus, and decreased its International segment revenue growth forecast. Co is including expected contributions from the recently-acquired Northwood dealership in its modeling assumptions for the balance of the year. OSMT (5.88 -10.64%): Pulls back on elevated volume after running to circa eight-month highs in recent sessions; the stock, factoring in today's move, remains higher by circa +33% month-to-date.10:57PANW Palo Alto Networks testing support at the confluence of 50 and 200 day moving averages after strength in service billings was offset by a miss on product revenue (223.14 -27.14)10:55DELL Dell Q3 Earnings Preview (54.51 -0.55)Dell reports Q3 results tonight after the close with a conference call scheduled to begin at 5:30 p.m. ET.The current Capital IQ Consensus Estimate calls for Q3 EPS of $1.59 on revenues of $23.03 billion.Guidance:Sees non-GAAP revenue range for the current fiscal year of $93-94.5 billion.Due to strong profitability in the first half of the year, DELL upped non-GAAP operating income guidance range to $9.8-10.2 billion, and increased non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $6.95-7.40.Expects non-GAAP tax rate to be 16% plus or minus 100 basis points.

The company's loss estimate is consistent with industry insured losses of approx. $11 bln and its expected market share of less than 1% for this catastrophe event.Due to the nature of this event, including the complexity of loss assessment and factors contributing to the losses, and the preliminary nature of the information available to prepare this estimate, the actual net ultimate loss for this event may differ materially from this current estimate. The additional complexity caused by the multiple catastrophic events that have occurred in Japan in recent months, together with the expectation of a relatively high proportion of flood related losses attributable to Typhoon Hagibis, are also likely to lead to increased uncertainty surrounding the estimated net ultimate loss for this event.16:28BDX Becton Dickinson increases quarterly cash dividend to $0.79/share from $0.77/share (253.86 +3.97)16:25PANW Palo Alto Networks beats by $0.02, reports revs in-line with billings above guidance; guides Q2 revs in-line; reaffirms FY20 revs guidance; increases billings slightly, guides down EPS, impacted by announced acquisition of Aporeto for $150 mln (250.28 +3.41)Reports Q1 (Oct) earnings of $1.05 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.03; revenues rose 17.7% year/year to $772 mln vs the $769.34 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Billings increase 18% $897.4 mln vs. $870-890 mln guidanceCo issues guidance for Q2, sees EPS of $1.11-1.13, including Aporeto acquisition cost, may not be comparable to $1.30 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q2 revs of $838-848 mln vs. $844.65 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; billings $985-1.0 bln.Co issues guidance for FY20, lowers EPS to $4.90-5.00 from $5.00-5.10, including Aporeto, may not be comparable to $5.07 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; reaffirms FY20 revs of $3.44-3.48 bln vs. $3.47 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; raises billings to $4.105-4.165 bln from $4.095-4.155 blnCo is acquiring Aporeto Inc., a machine identity-based microsegmentation company for $150 million in cash Aporeto identifies workloads and applies microsegmentation across all infrastructures, helping customers secure their applications at scale.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal. It should be noted that a separate report from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal before the 2020 election is unlikely to be reached did not have a noticeable effect on the market.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.4%), which typically outperforms when the prevailing view on trade is positive, led all sectors in gains amid strength in the semiconductor stocks.

The acquisition is structured with an upfront payment of approx. $55 mln, which will be funded primarily through MTS' existing revolving credit facility, with expected earnout payments of up to an additional $25 mln based on financial performance through June 2021. Given the strong backlog position of MTS at the end of fiscal 2019, the solid backlog position of R&D, and the expected incremental Adjusted EBITDA generation, MTS expects rapid strengthening of its balance sheet following the closing of this acquisition, with a forecasted year-over-year net reduction in leverage by the end of fiscal 2020.16:14MTSC MTS Systems misses by $0.02, beats on revs; guides FY20 EPS below two analyst estimate, revs above two analyst estimate (60.56 +2.39)Reports Q4 (Sep) earnings of $0.37 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 worse than the two analyst estimate of $0.39; revenues rose 13.2% year/year to $224.08 mln vs the $218.07 mln two analyst estimate."As we enter our new fiscal year, we are excited about the resilience of our markets, our record year-end backlog, which topped $420 million, and the customer reception to our new product offerings.

Remission was defined as a BVAS score of zero and being off glucocorticoid treatment for ANCA vasculitis for at least the preceding four weeks. The pre-specified primary endpoints were remission of acute vasculitis activity at week 26 and sustained remission at week 52, where avacopan therapy was at least statistically non-inferior to the currently used glucocorticoid-containing standard of care (glucocorticoid SOC). The two primary endpoints were tested sequentially using a gatekeeping procedure to preserve the Type I error.BVAS remission at week 26 was achieved in 72.3% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 70.1% of subjects in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (p<0.0001 for non-inferiority). Sustained remission at 52 weeks was observed in 65.7% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 54.9% in the glucocorticoid SOC control group, achieving both non-inferiority and superiority to glucocorticoid standard of care (p=0.0066 for superiority of avacopan). Importantly, subjects who received avacopan experienced additional benefits compared to those in the glucocorticoid SOC control group.The topline safety results revealed an acceptable safety profile in this serious and life-threatening disease, with fewer subjects having serious adverse events (SAEs) in the avacopan group than in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (42% vs. 45%, respectively). Most reported SAEs were related to underlying ANCA vasculitis disease and commensurate with rates in previously published ANCA vasculitis trials. There were fewer subjects with serious infections in the avacopan group than the glucocorticoid SOC control group. A full analysis of the data is underway and expanded results are expected to be announced in the coming weeks.16:08HPE Hewlett Packard Enterprise beats by $0.03, misses on revs; guides Q1 EPS in-line; reaffirms FY20 guidance (17.45 +0.33)Reports Q4 (Oct) earnings of $0.49 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.46; revenues fell 9.2% year/year to $7.21 bln vs the $7.41 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.GAAP gross margins of 33.2%, up 250 basis points from the prior-year period and Non-GAAP of 33.3%, up 260 basis points from the prior-year period.
