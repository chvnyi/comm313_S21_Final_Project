The energy sector (-0.4%) is today's early laggard despite the higher oil prices ($58.41, +0.40, +0.7%), while the real estate sector (+0.4%) outperforms.U.S. Treasuries have edged higher, pushing yields lower across the curve.

The market has received trade news, earnings reports, and economic data, but none of it is having a meaningful impact on trading this morning.There was a modest advance in the futures trade last evening after a report from China indicated that top trade negotiators held a phone call, but the initial enthusiasm waned upon realization that nothing substantial was included in that report.Notable pre-market moves include earnings-driven gains in Best Buy (BBY 77.35, +3.10, +4.2%) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 43.89, +4.46, +11.3%), while Dollar Tree (DLTR 97.48, -14.91, -13.3%) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW 230.40, -19.40, -7.9%) are on the retreat following their reports.Separately, investors received some housing data earlier. The FHFA Housing Price Index for September increased 0.6% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in August.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +2.10.The S&P 500 futures trade roughly in-line with fair value after another record-setting day on Wall Street yesterday. Futures were up as much as 0.4% above fair value after China's Xinhua News Agency reported that top trade negotiators held a phone call last evening.Both the U.S. and China reportedly reached an agreement in that call to continue to work toward resolving key issues for a Phase One trade agreement. The market, which already expects both sides to talk until a deal is reached, has justifiably tempered its initial enthusiasm but will likely continue to react to trade headlines moving forward.On the data front, investors will receive the Advance reports for International Trade in Goods, Retail Inventories, and Wholesale Inventories at 8:30 a.m. ET, followed by the FHFA Housing Price Index for September and the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for September (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) at 9:00 a.m. ET.After the open, investors will receive the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) and the New Home Sales report for October (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) at 10:00 a.m. ET.U.S. Treasuries have extended yesterday's modest advance, pushing yields slightly lower again this morning.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal. It should be noted that a separate report from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal before the 2020 election is unlikely to be reached did not have a noticeable effect on the market.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.4%), which typically outperforms when the prevailing view on trade is positive, led all sectors in gains amid strength in the semiconductor stocks. NVIDIA (NVDA 221.21, +10.32, +4.9%) was a notable gainer after the stock was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.4%.The health care (+1.1%) and consumer discretionary (+0.9%) sectors also rose more than the S&P 500, while the utilities sector (-0.4%) was today's lone sector to finish in negative territory.Two of today's M&A deals were ones that were already on the market's radar: Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.31, +1.11, +2.3%) agreed to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.78, +3.65, +7.6%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction, and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreed to acquire Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.25, +7.74, +6.2%) for $16.2 billion in cash.New deals included Novartis (NVS 91.30, +0.82, +0.9%) agreeing to acquire The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.80, +15.25, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash and eBay (EBAY 35.85, +0.73, +2.1%) agreeing to sell StubHub to Viagogo for $4.05 billion in cash.Strikingly, U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note despite the risk sentiment displayed in the stock market. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.32. WTI crude increased 0.2%, or $0.10, to $57.98/bbl.Investors did not receive any notable economic data on Monday. On Tuesday, investors will receive New Home Sales for October, the FHFA Housing Price Index for September, the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for September, and the Advance reports for International Trade in Goods, Retail Inventories, and Wholesale Inventories.Nasdaq Composite +30.1% YTDS&P 500 +25.0% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.3% YTDRussell 2000 +20.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 20884/784. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2402/720.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: November 26, 2019End of Document

Huawei has already signed 60 contracts to install 5G networks worldwideCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 11, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 443 wordsBodyChinese tech giant Huawei has already signed 60 contracts for the installation of 5G networks worldwide, 30 of them in European countries and seven in Latin American countries, the company reported today.At a meeting at the company's headquarters in Shenzhen with a small group of Ibero-American media outlets, including Efe, the Chinese company's 5G market director Eric Zhao, said Huawei is finalizing another 25 contracts with telephony operators mobile from all over the world to place their networks.Some of the contracts contain a confidentiality clause so Huawei cannot at the moment make them public, although the company has announced that in Europe it has reached agreements with operators in Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy and Switzerland.It has also agreed to provide its 5G technology to ten Asian countries, including South Korea or the Philippines, and as many in the Middle East as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait.Zhao acknowledged that countries like Australia have vetoed Huawei's technology after the Chinese company's inclusion on the "blacklist" of companies posing a threat to US security, but assured that with others like Canada they are still negotiating to collaborate for the infrastructure of the next generation of mobile internet.It also rejected Japan's officially vetoed Huawei's entry into its 5G networks.The head of the Chinese firm said that until May 16, when the US announced its inclusion on the "blacklist", the company had 30 contracts worldwide for the installation of 5G networks and has since signed another 30.Huawei has so far installed 400,000 5G stations worldwide, 300,000 of them since May 16, he said.Zhao estimated that by the end of 2020 there will be about 200 million 5G users in China, which will also lower the price of phones equipped to use this technology, which by then will cost between 150 and 200 dollars (between 135 and 180 euros).For her part, Huawei's deputy director of Cybersecurity and Privacy, Lucia Zhong, said the company "has no backdoor, not only on 5G networks but on any product."We have no reason because we always prioritize security over economic interests. The rear door implementation would be a suicide," Zhong said.In addition, he stressed that it is "impossible" for the Chinese government to sue them for action in that regard because, he said, "there is no law in China that allows the government to install back doors or anything else."This directive recalled that "backdoors are not synonymous with deficiencies, which are normal in any sector" and noted that 30,000 deficiencies were found in large global technology companies between 2016 and 2017.Load-Date: January 27, 2020End of Document

Senate Armed Services Subcommittee Issues Testimony From In-Q-TelTargeted News ServiceNovember 20, 2019 Wednesday 3:17 PM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2227 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Armed Services subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities issued the following testimony by Tara J. O'Toole,senior fellow and executive vice president of the In-Q-Tel, at a hearing on biological threats to U.S. national security:"Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss how the Department of Defense can help counter the potential biological threats facing Americans."I have worked as a practicing physician, but much of my career has been spent in academia and government. I was a program manager at the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, served as Assistant Secretary of Energy, and founded and led the Johns Hopkins and University of Pittsburgh biodefense centers from 1999-2009. I served five years as Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Science and Technology, where I oversaw the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center and supported the creation of a new National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility. In 2014, I became executive vice president and senior fellow at In-Q-Tel (IQT), a non-profit investor for nine United States national security agencies, accelerating and shaping commercial startup technologies to advance the national interest."I appreciate the opportunity to come before you today and commend the Subcommittee for addressing this vital and neglected aspect of national security. I would like to emphasize four points."First, rapid advances in the life sciences, biotechnology, and artificial intelligence, plus what we know about our adversaries' programs, require a fundamental shift in United States biodefense strategy. New and evolving technologies have enabled a more dangerous and dynamic biothreat landscape than is contemplated in current biodefense policy and programs."The past decades of biological science have brought us an array of powerful technologies such as DNA sequencing, gene editing, and synthetic biology. These and other advances have caused a revolution in our understanding of, and ability to alter, living organisms. We have learned that biology is essentially programmable: life runs on code. The knowledge and technologies needed to read, write, and edit this code are improving exponentially - faster than Moore's Law. In other words, the code of life, which consists of four different base pairs instead of ones and zeros, is being digitized, and this information is being stored in huge genomic data banks."These capabilities have and will continue to generate great benefits across a range of industries, such as new approaches to cancer treatment, and extremely efficient ways to produce complex chemicals and new materials. But these capabilities can also be exploited for evil purposes."All powerful technologies can be dual-use, and this is particularly true of modern biotechnologies. The same methods that enable the repair of genes which cause disease, allow us to genetically engineer bacteria to produce insulin, or alter a virus to create a vaccine, can be employed to create pathogens not seen in nature. Such pathogens, which could affect humans, animals, or plants, could be constructed to be particularly virulent, evade conventional diagnostic tests, or to resist available drugs and vaccines."As bioengineering methods advance, and especially as artificial intelligence methods are applied to DNA sequencing, synthesis, and editing, the deliberate creation of new pathogens will be within reach of many more actors. In addition, because techniques such as genomics and gene engineering are so useful in so many industries, and will be so central to the blossoming bioeconomy, more and more people around the world will have access to these technologies and know how to use them."The United States had a powerful, secret offensive biological weapons program during the Cold War, which lasted until 1969. Most people today, even in the military, do not understand how effective and advanced these programs were. The bioweapons we built then were intended to be strategic weapons, like nuclear weapons. The country tested these bioweapons in all conditions short of actual conflict and demonstrated them to have the large area coverage and lethality of nuclear weapons. And this was accomplished using 1960s technologies."Given the unavoidable expansion of these dual-use biotechnologies; the absence of any enforceable national treaties controlling bioweapons production and use; and the rise of competitive peer state adversaries; the United States must urgently consider how it will defend itself against what could be an existential threat to civilian populations, our agricultural assets, and warfighters."In addition to these man-made biological threats, we live in an age of epidemics. Naturallyoccurring outbreaks of infectious disease have increased in frequency and impact over the past two decades. They are the consequence of modern trade and travel patterns, human intrusion into once remote ecosystems, and global urbanization with its attendant problems of poverty and poor sanitation. As has been seen with human outbreaks of SARS, MERS, Ebola, and Zika, and the ongoing epidemic of African Swine Fever in Asia which has resulted in the deaths of over 300 million pigs, these outbreaks impose tragic costs in terms of death, suffering, economic losses, and social upheaval."Second, the United States should aggressively develop and apply new and emerging technologies to create new capabilities needed for a robust biodefense against natural and man-made biothreats. Such a strategy would have the additional benefit of strengthening United States competitiveness in the global economy."The 2018 National Biodefense Strategy (NBS), many years in the making, is a detailed and coherent declaration of the broad capabilities needed to prevent, detect, contain, and recover from naturally-occurring epidemic disease. The NBS does not, however, recognize the urgency or potential challenges of protecting the nation from deliberate and covert bioweapons attacks, which could be far more devastating than even the most serious natural outbreak. The NBS also lacks a mechanism for continuous monitoring of the capabilities inherent in rapidly evolving biotechnologies. Nor does the document assign priorities, confer authorities commensurate with stated responsibilities, or provide new resources. Critically, in my view, it lacks a viable, appropriately ambitious, strategic plan for biodefense technology development."The biothreats posed by new biotechnologies, the potential for large-scale outbreaks in this age of epidemics, the rise of powerful nation state adversaries, and the feasibility of non-state actors wielding bioweapons, requires that the United States immediately commit to significant investments in developing and deploying the technologies needed for biodefense."To start, the national security community needs to develop a more realistic understanding of biothreats and their underlying dynamics. This will require competence in genomics, proteomics, computer science, and artificial intelligence - skills in short supply across the government. Also needed is a much more ambitious, strategic approach to the technologies needed for biodefense - that is, for detecting, managing, and quenching epidemics, including epidemics caused by pathogens not previously seen in nature, and possibly designed by humans."Relying on traditional, slow, and costly methods of drug and vaccine development and hoping that what we need will be available in expensive (and inevitably inadequate) stockpiles of medical countermeasures will not suffice. What is needed is a national commitment to the develop technologies that, for example, would enable rapid design and manufacture of medical countermeasures (diagnostic tests, vaccines, and therapeutics) at scales and in timeframes that could impact management of a large, lethal, and fast-moving epidemic. Also needed - and in use commercially today- are technologies that provide situational awareness during outbreaks."This requires the collection, wrangling, and analysis of essential data needed to make informed decisions about epidemic management. Such technologies, if deployed, should provide a defense against both engineered bioweapons and newly emergent natural diseases."Third, Department of Defense (DoD) leadership is critical to United States biodefense, but talent and resources are currently quite limited."DoD has historically played a critical role in response to disease outbreaks overseas. The key diagnostic test, vaccine, and therapy that were deployed to contain the 2014 West African outbreak of Ebola virus would not have been available but for DoD investments in R&#38;D. DoD's long experience with technological development could make significant contributions to protecting warfighters and civilians against natural and man-made biothreats. The Department is not, at present, optimally organized nor stocked with the sufficient trained staff to execute this mission."For several years, DoD's Defense Advanced Resarch Projects Agency (DARPA) has executed important projects in biotechnology, including in projects designed to better understand biothreats, and has recently expanded its Biological Technologies Office (BTO) staff and budget."The quality of DARPA's work is excellent, and their staff is highly expert. But BTO is less than 50 people. The Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JPEO-CBRND) also has a number of excellent people working on important aspects of biotechnology, focused on providing warfighters protection from CBRN threats. But JPEOCBRND's mission and budget could benefit from being considered a higher priority within DoD."The Committee might consider a review of current DoD biodefense programs with the aims of increasing coordination, encouraging risk-taking, and placing an emphasis on capabilities for rapid medical countermeasure development, while providing sufficient resources to allow DOD officials to make meaningful contributions. Contract and budget mechanisms to effectively partner with innovative small companies, which populate most of the biotech landscape, will be essential, as will programs to recruit and retain talented scientists and engineers."Fourth, China has urgent and compelling reasons to aggressively pursue advancements in biomedicine and biotechnology. But China's geopolitical strategy to dominate the bioeconomy - and indeed to "own the biorevolution" - represents as great a threat to United States national security as their bid to assert dominance in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and space."China is planning, organizing, and financing efforts to become the world leader in biotechnology. The Chinese government rightly seeks ways to feed billions in the face of a changing climate, to bring medicines to a population with the world's highest cancer incidence and 100 million diabetics, and to help its aging population stay healthy. Many nations share these goals, and we should find ways to cooperate to advance biology's humanitarian contributions."Yet it is also true that China sees biology as a route to expand its global power. China is using all the means available to an authoritarian state to reach its 5-year R&#38;D plan to make the biotechnology sector 5% of its GDP by 2020. China is investing heavily in research, building new facilities, recruiting talent from abroad, reforming its regulations for drug approvals, establishing financial rules that favor Chinese companies, and linking its giant internet firms like Tencent and Alibaba to biotech development. Having watched the UK lead the industrial revolution and the United States lead the information revolution, China aims to capture the revolution in biotechnology."The United States should not cede this ground. The United States and its international partners must plan, organize, and invest to advance key aspects of biotechnology and then harness the vitality of our entrepreneurs to turn discovery into product. The first step is a national biotechnology strategy, one that can incorporate the vital contributions of the biodefense strategy but also transcend it, recognizing that biology will reshape world leadership as much as our quality of life on this planet."Conclusion The challenge of preparing for bioattacks and epidemics, natural or engineered, is integrally linked to broader imperative of maintaining America's leadership in biotechnology. Within the national security community there has been much focus on artificial intelligence, which clearly has enormous implications for our economy and our defense establishment, and already shapes our shopping habits, provides big data analyses, and operates robots. Biology will prove equally transformative - Americans just do not see it yet. This is a problem because biotechnology is both a humanitarian and geopolitical necessity."Biotechnology will dramatically and literally reshape our lives and our world. It will also become a significant source of national power - economic, and in all likelihood military - as it creates entirely new possibilities, materials, and products. The question is whether our government can best position the United States to capitalize on this promise."Thank you."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6934611 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 21, 2019End of Document

How Far Can Equities Go? Price Is Fact, Trading Splunk: Market ReconRealMoneyDecember 23, 2019 Monday 8:32 AM EDTCopyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1588 wordsByline: Stephen GuilfoyleHighlight: There is no doubt that price is indeed fact. Whether or not price is truth or not depends on a much higher standard for qualification.BodyEver been waiting at a secondary subway platform as an express train barrels through on the local track? The deafening roar. Reminds one of this stock market. You are either on, or off. This train seems to only keep moving. On Friday night, the S&P 500 closed at 3221 after having traded as low as 3070 on December 3rd. That's less than three weeks ago. That's a 4.9% move off of that early month low. A sizable portion of this move has come only in the past week, the S&P 500 increasing by 1.6%, the Nasdaq Composite a whopping 2.1%. In one week. Despite the fact that both of these major indices opened higher last Monday, then moved sideways to slightly higher for nearly four days, then once again moved robustly to the upside on Friday.Of course the trading volumes were mammoth on Friday, a "quadruple witching" expiration. That however, does not explain that for both of these broad averages, the fact that trading volume has landed above it's own 50 day SMA for seven consecutive days. Remember, we have been writing and speaking about a chase for performance ahead of a "Santa Claus" rally? We were certainly right about that. What we (read that as I) were not so correct about was my expectation that there would be a bout of profit taking going into our annual meeting with the jolly fellow, that comes hand in hand with the "January effect" which would probably be more accurately described as the "early January effect."Of course, there still could be this bout of profit taking. Amid the famous Fed induced late 2018 market meltdown, equity prices did not bottom until December 24th. Those with really good memories will recall that the S&P 500 closed at the low of the day/week/month/quarter/year on that half day session. Or at least they would have had not the market wiggled a bit early in the December 26th session prior to deciding to rally significantly from there.Price As FactThere is no doubt that price is indeed fact. Whether or not price is truth or not depends on a much higher standard for qualification. One "problem" though, that is clearly not the right word for investors, has been the avalanche of stocks hitting target prices. Though far more preferable than finding oneself deep in the hole, this has created for many of us larger cash positions than intended, as well as a lack of losers to take against winners for tax purposes. This has I believe actually had a withering impact on the supply side of the price discovery equation.Sure, equity prices have run, as the veil of uncertainty has been lifted to varying degrees concerning trade with China, the Federal budget, impeachment proceedings, Monetary policy, and Brexit. This has allowed traders to draw funds out of the long end of the curve, which is absolutely key, with the Federal Reserve nailing the short end of the same curve in place. This morning, the U.S. 10 year note yields more than 1.9%, and has given up more than 1.94% at several points last week.These expanded spreads within the yield curve signal two possibilities to the marketplace. For one there is a perception that the environment is now more conducive to economic growth. The other is now that the backdrop allows for more consumer level inflation that quite frankly I doubt any consumer will be comfortable with, or any young consumer has ever experienced. I know you have seen prices for WTI crude futures trade above $60 per barrel. That's directly resultant in headline level inflation, Sport.I also know that you saw the numbers for November Personal Spending released on Friday by the Bureau of Economic Analysis that directly clashed with the data for November Retail Sales provided by the Census Bureau. Forget that Cyber Monday fell in December this year. Whereas this is concerned, that's simply irrelevant. Somebody's data is faulty. Guess we'll know more when the revisions come in. Not to mention the facts that the Census Bureau tells readers up front that the data is seasonally adjusted, and then after that, there is still +/- 0.4% margin for error in the monthly numbers. Remember this for all time... economics is more art than science, and that may be the only thing truly factual that you'll read today.Is yellow green? No, yellow is yellow. But these numbers are for November. Oh, then yellow is blue. But yellow was green last year. Last year was different, yellow is usually red in November. Red? Are you sure? Listen, just do the math, we've got a deadline. Sure boss.ValuationEver more interesting becomes what appear to be stretched metrics for equity valuation. Now, do not get me wrong, although I thought that we would see some profit taking by now, I do run a decisively net-long equity book. Having to choose between being right about timing a selloff, and realizing better performance in my P/L, I choose the dollar bills, y'all.However, nothing surprises in 2019. That said, according to FactSet, the S&P 500 now trades at an even 18 times forward looking earnings, up from 17.8 times just one week back. This is now well above the five year average of 16.7 times for the index, and I won't even go into the 10 year average as that number lives in another area code. You may notice the Health Care sector near the bottom of a year to date standings board, but you will also find Health Care in the top three in the sector standings for one week, one month, quarterly, and six month performance. That sector is now priced at 16.1 times the next 12 months' earnings, above the sector specific five year average of 15.8 times. This leaves Energy as the only sector still trading at a discount to it's own historical averages. Very interestingly, still taking from FactSet, earnings projections are still moving in the opposite direction. Earnings projections in aggregate for the S&P 500 now stand at -1.4% year over year for the fourth quarter. Beyond that, the year 2020 is still expected to be one of positive growth, but Q1 has been ratcheted down from 5.4% to 5.0%, and Q2 has been knocked down to 6.6% from 6.9%... all in a week's time. With revenues growth expected to remain positive throughout, how far can equities go, with such pressure on profitability. Ahh, a more relaxed condition for trade with China. Perhaps, you're right. I mean, what could possibly go wrong?On That NoteOn Monday morning, which was Sunday night in New York, news broke out of Beijing. Big news. Xinhua (state run news agency) reported that in a plan approved by the State Council, the Chinese government will reduce tariffs of 850 types of imported products to rates below that of "most favored nation" status. These products will include frozen pork. medicines, and semiconductors beginning in 2020. In addition, China will implement negotiated tariffs with 23 different nations and regions.If that seems quite positive, it is and it gets better. About an hour later, the Chinese government also promised to open wider markets for oil, telecom, and power to private competition, and at least in words will provide private companies an environment for equal treatment with state-owned businesses. While this reads as significant, this news at least at this point remains very thin on detail regarding what restrictions might remain, or what kind of timeline any implementation of policy change might entail.Big Fun in Big DataDoing my weekly Sunday night cram/homework session, I noticed one of my favorite names attempting to take another shot at a technical breakout. You may recall, that I covered Splunk  in some detail back on November 22nd. The shares were trading around $126 at the time and were coming off of Q3 earnings where they really knocked the cover off of the ball. At time, I reiterated my price target of $143, and initiated a panic point of $119. Well, the stock has moved on, but has remained a core name among my software holdings. I think it now time for a new look at the charts. Splunk, by the way, does not report again until late February.I left the almost year long period of wide consolidation that I showed you back in November on this chart for context. Now, the shares have moved into a new basing that makes use of old resistance as support. This newer pattern is only about a month old, and now stands only about a buck away from testing what would be the new pivot at $152.Should we see such a move my opinion is that great potential upside could be unlocked. 64 times forward looking earnings? I know. The name does not pass the "Rule of 40" either with 30% sales growth that must contend with negative margin. Then again, price is fact, even if it is not necessarily truth. Value is the intersection of demand versus supply within the context of time. Micron's  Sanjay Mehrotra told you last week that he expects business investment in the cloud to rebound. Me? I'll be convinced when this new pivot is taken and held. In the mean time, as I move my target higher, I also move higher my panic, so even there, I win, and win big.

US prepares new extension of its moratorium on Huawei, press saysCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 16, 2019 SaturdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 449 wordsBodyThe U.S. government is preparing a new extension of its moratorium on US companies banning commercial ties with Chinese manufacturer Huawei, Politico newspaper released on Friday.The rotativo quoted two anonymous sources as "decision-makers" according to which on this occasion the new moratorium would be six months, that is, twice as long as that granted in August, and would therefore expire at the end of May 2020.In the event that The Politico information is not confirmed, the current extension of the moratorium announced on August 19 would expire at midnight on Monday, November 18, when technology providers such as Google, Intel, Xilinx or Broadcom should stop selling to Huawei.The administration that runs Donald Trump first announced a ban on U.S. companies from maintaining business ties with Huawei in May this year, but has since decreed two moratoriums that allow their country's firms to continue to make business with the Chinese manufacturer.The U.S. Executive is wary of the company's links with the Chinese government and claims to have suspicions that Huawei could use its mobile phones and other technology equipment to spy abroad and provide information to the country's leaders Asian.Although the market share of Huawei mobile phones in the United States is very small (less than 1% according to Statcounter's most recent data), the Chinese company does have a strong presence as a provider of telecommunications equipment in the areas rural areas of the country.Its products, substantially cheaper than those of the competition, have allowed the deployment of wireless networks in large, sparsely populated parts of the country where, had it not been for Huawei, these infrastructures would have been practically unviable from a financial point of view.Alongside its presence in rural areas, the other key aspect of understanding Huawei's impact on the U.S. economy is technology and software component providers such as chips manufacturers Intel, Xilinx and Broadcom, and internet giant Google , owner of the Android operating system, present on Huawei devices.Of all Huawei's US suppliers, Google has the highest profile, as the phones that the Chinese manufacturer sells worldwide (and which are especially popular in markets like Latin America and Europe) have pre-installed Android and services such as Chrome, Gmail, Google Maps, YouTube and the Google Play app store.The huawei veto is framed in a context of u.S.-China trade war, which has been open since almost the moment Trump came to the presidency in 2017, and which has been settled for the time being with tariffs on hundreds of millions of Chinese imports to the U.S. and similar retaliation by Beijing.Load-Date: February 24, 2020End of Document

Facial Recognition Deal in Kyrgyzstan Poses Risks to RightsTargeted News ServiceNovember 16, 2019 Saturday 8:33 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 540 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyHuman Rights Watch issued the following commentary:* * *- Use of Same Tech in Xinjiang Should Serve as Warning* * *On October 31, Kyrgyzstan President Sooronbay Jeenbekov inaugurated a new police command center in the capital city of Bishkek. But this local event had an international human rights dimension: the center will manage a network of cameras equipped with facial recognition technology and installed throughout the city. It is also provided by and paid for, at least in part, by a Chinese state company.In March, Kyrgyzstan's government signed an agreement with China National Electronic Import and Export Corporation (CEIEC) to install technology to improve "public and road safety." But there was little transparency around the deal and how facial images of Kyrgyz people and other personal data would be collected, stored, and transferred. It is also unclear whether there are legal safeguards that restrict CEIEC from accessing such data. Human Rights Watch wrote to CEIEC for more information but received no reply.The use of facial recognition technology in public spaces can allow governments to track and monitor people's habits and movements, creating potential chilling effects on freedoms of expression and assembly. It can also be used to single out individuals in discriminatory ways, including for their ethnicity or religion. In Kyrgyzstan, the rollout of facial recognition technology was approved without public consultation or necessary transparency, making it unclear how or if the government plans to mitigate the technology's potential impact on privacy.The situation in the Chinese region of Xinjiang should serve as a warning to Kyrgyz citizens. When deployed with few actionable privacy rights or protections, this technology can facilitate gross human rights violations. In Xinjiang, the Chinese government uses various technologies including facial recognition, surveillance cameras, and big data programs to monitor and track ethnic Uyghur and other citizens. Anyone flagged as "problematic" based on vague criteria may be sent to "political education camps" and subjected to political indoctrination.Kyrgyz laws establish some privacy protections. The Kyrgyz constitution enshrines the right to privacy, the Law on Biometric Registration requires that individuals consent to data collection, and the Law on Personal Information bans the collection of personal data without consent.But these laws also create broad exemptions for national security or law enforcement purposes, and there is no law regulating facial recognition technology specifically. The opaque terms of the CEIEC deal create the risk that the Kyrgyz government could use increased security as a blanket justification for mass surveillance of its citizens.Under international human rights law, Kyrgyzstan has obligations to ensure that government collection, retention, and use of biometrics is well-regulated, narrow in scope, and necessary and proportionate to meeting a legitimate security goal.

All Rights ReservedLength: 2462 wordsBodyEUR/USD 1.1064USD/JPY 108.6310-Year - 1.829 - +2/32Long Bond Leads Quiet Monday Advance• U.S. Treasuries of most tenors began the week with modest gains while the 5-yr note underperformed, finishing just above its flat line. The first session of the week was very quiet, and it followed an overnight affair that was just as subdued. Economic data received overnight painted a mixed picture, as China reported a smaller than expected trade surplus for November (actual $38.73 bln; expected $46.30 bln) while Japan's Q3 GDP growth was revised up to 0.4% from 0.1%. Treasuries started the cash session with modest gains, climbing toward their intraday highs from Friday shortly after the open. However, the rest of the session saw a slow return to today's opening levels. The U.S. Treasury sold $38 bln in 3-yr notes to solid demand, as the high yield stopped through the when issued yield by 0.2 bps while the bid-to-cover ratio and indirect takedown were above average.

EUR/USD:1.1064Long Bond Leads Quiet Monday AdvanceU.S. Treasuries of most tenors began the week with modest gains while the 5-yr note underperformed, finishing just above its flat line. The first session of the week was very quiet, and it followed an overnight affair that was just as subdued. Economic data received overnight painted a mixed picture, as China reported a smaller than expected trade surplus for November (actual $38.73 bln; expected $46.30 bln) while Japan's Q3 GDP growth was revised up to 0.4% from 0.1%. Treasuries started the cash session with modest gains, climbing toward their intraday highs from Friday shortly after the open. However, the rest of the session saw a slow return to today's opening levels. The U.S. Treasury sold $38 bln in 3-yr notes to solid demand, as the high yield stopped through the when issued yield by 0.2 bps while the bid-to-cover ratio and indirect takedown were above average. The U.S. Dollar Index faced some morning pressure but returned to little changed as the day went on, reclaiming its 200-day moving average (97.65) in the process. Yield Check: 2-yr: -1 bp to 1.62% 3-yr: -1 bp to 1.64% 5-yr: UNCH at 1.67% 10-yr: -1 bp to 1.83% 30-yr: -2 bps to 2.26%News: The House of Representatives could vote on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on December 18, according to CNBC. The Bank for International Settlements published its latest quarterly review, which noted that structural issues rather than temporary factors were responsible for the mid-September shortage in the funding market that prompted the Fed to begin conducting daily repurchases. The BIS added that liquidity demand from hedge funds exacerbated the funding stress. Financial Times reported that the Chinese government has ordered the removal of all foreign computer equipment and software from government offices. The Bank of Japan will reportedly lower its assessment of industrial production due to prolonged weakness. Former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker died on Sunday. China's November trade surplus totaled $38.73 bln (expected $46.30 bln; last $43.02 bln). Exports fell 1.1% yr/yr (expected 1.0%; last -0.8%) while imports rose 0.3% yr/yr (expected -1.8%; last -6.2%). Japan's Q3 GDP rose 0.4% qtr/qtr (expected 0.2%; last 0.1%), growing 1.8% yr/yr (expected 0.7%; last 0.2%). The latest set of election polls from the U.K. suggest that Conservatives will win majority on Thursday with a margin between 9 and 15 percentage points.

EUR/USD:1.1096Opening Gains SurrenderedShorter-dated U.S. Treasuries registered modest losses on Tuesday after backing down from their opening highs while longer tenors outperformed. Treasuries hit session highs during the first few minutes of action, rising amid a weak showing from equity markets in Europe. However, global risk tolerance received a quick boost from another set of headlines related to U.S.-China negotiations. The Wall Street Journal reported that negotiators are preparing for a delay of the tariffs that are scheduled to go into effect on December 15 while White House Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, said that the decision on tariffs will depend on the amount of progress made. South China Morning Post also chimed in, reporting that new tariffs will likely be postponed but a partial trade deal is unlikely to be reached this week. These reports sent Treasuries to lows in mid-morning trade, but there was no follow through selling, which allowed longer tenors to trim their losses. Today's $24 bln 10-yr Treasury note reopening was met with good demand. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.2% to 97.43, approaching last week's low. Yield Check: 2-yr: +3 bps to 1.65% 3-yr: +2 bps to 1.66% 5-yr: +1 bp to 1.68% 10-yr: UNCH at 1.83% 30-yr: -1 bp to 2.25%News: Credit Suisse believes that the Federal Reserve should launch the next round of quantitative easing before the end of the year due to insufficient relief from daily repurchase operations. The House of Representatives will vote on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement next week, according to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Taiwan's Foreign Minister, Joseph Wu, said that Taiwan will help those who are displaced by the violence in Hong Kong. Mr. Wu also said that Hong Kong police has used disproportionate force when dealing with protesters. China's November CPI increased 0.4% m/m (expected 0.1%; last 0.9%), rising 4.5% yr/yr, as expected (last 3.8%). November PPI decreased 1.4% yr/yr (expected -1.5%; last -1.6%). November New Loans totaled CNY1.39 trln (expected CNY1.20 trln; prior CNY661.30 bln), November Loan Growth increased 12.4% yr/yr (expected 12.3%; last 12.4%), and November Social Financing totaled CNY1.75 trln (expected CNY1.50 trln; prior CNY618.90 bln). Eurozone's December ZEW Economic Sentiment rose to 11.2 from -1.0 (expected -17.7). Germany's December ZEW Economic Sentiment rose to 10.7 from -2.1 (expected 1.1) while December Current Conditions improved to -19.9 from -24.7 (expected -22.3). U.K.'s October GDP was unchanged m/m (expected 0.1%; last -0.1%). Q3 GDP was unchanged qtr/qtr (expected -0.2%; last 0.3%) but increased 0.7% yr/yr, as expected (last 0.9%). France's Q3 Nonfarm Payrolls increased 0.2% qtr/qtr (last 0.3%) while October Industrial Production rose 0.4% m/m (expected 0.3%; last 0.4%). Italy's October Industrial Production decreased 0.3% m/m (expected -0.2%; last -0.4%), falling 2.4% yr/yr (expected -2.1%; last -2.2%). $24 bln 10-year Treasury note reopening results (prior 12-auction average): High yield: 1.842% (2.241%). Bid-to-cover: 2.43 (2.42). Indirect bid: 56.1% (61.5%). Direct bid: 19.3% (12.9%). Today's Data: The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index increased to 104.7 in November from 102.4 in October. Nonfarm business sector labor productivity decreased 0.2% in the third quarter (Briefing.com consensus -0.1%), according to the revised estimate, versus a previously reported 0.3% decrease. Unit labor costs increased 2.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.4%) versus a previously reported 3.6% increase. The key takeaway from the report remains the same as the preliminary estimate: the decline in productivity and the jump in unit labor costs points to profit margin pressures for businesses.

Treasuries rebounded from their morning lows in mid-morning trade, but the past couple hours saw a slow drip back to the day's lowest levels. The market showed almost no response to the recently completed $24 bln 10-yr Treasury note reopening. The reopening was met with good demand, as the high yield stopped through the when issued yield by 0.1 bps while the bid-to-cover ratio was a touch above average. Equities remain near their flat lines, though they currently trade slightly higher.

USD/JPY:108.64.. EUR/USD:1.1077Early Gains SurrenderedU.S. Treasuries have slipped to fresh lows in recent trade. The pullback from opening highs took place after The Wall Street Journal reported that trade negotiators from China and the U.S. are preparing for a delay of the next round of import tariffs, which is scheduled to go into effect on December 15. It is worth noting that the report was attributed to Chinese sources. Meanwhile, White House Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, said that the decision on tariffs will depend on the amount of progress made. In other trade news, House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said that the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement will be up for vote next week. Equity indices trade near their flat lines after recovering their opening losses. Yield Check: 2-yr: +1 bp to 1.63% 3-yr: +1 bp to 1.65% 5-yr: +2 bps to 1.68% 10-yr: +2 bps to 1.85% 30-yr: +1 bp to 2.27%09:20 ET10-Yr:+3/32..1.823%.. USD/JPY:108.62.. EUR/USD:1.1077Data ReconNonfarm business sector labor productivity decreased 0.2% in the third quarter (Briefing.com consensus -0.1%), according to the revised estimate, versus a previously reported 0.3% decrease. Unit labor costs increased 2.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.4%) versus a previously reported 3.6% increase. The key takeaway from the report remains the same as the preliminary estimate: the decline in productivity and the jump in unit labor costs points to profit margin pressures for businesses. The decline in productivity was the result of output increasing 2.3% and hours worked increasing 2.5%. The jump in unit labor costs flowed from a 2.3% increase in compensation per hour and the 0.2% decline in productivity. Unit labor costs are up 2.2% over the last four quarters; meanwhile, productivity increased just 1.5% from the third quarter of 2018 to the third quarter of 2019. Manufacturing sector labor productivity increased 0.1% in the third quarter, up from a previously reported 0.1% decline, and unit labor costs increased 3.0% versus the preliminary estimate of 3.6%.Yield Check:2-yr: +1 bp to 1.63%3-yr: UNCH at 1.64%5-yr: UNCH at 1.66%10-yr: -1 bp to 1.82%30-yr: -1 bp to 2.25%08:03 ET10-Yr:+6/32..1.806%.. USD/JPY:108.56.. EUR/USD:1.1076Bullish Bias MaintainedU.S. Treasuries are on track to revisit yesterday's session highs after an overnight advance in the Treasury futures market. Treasury futures began rising last evening, continuing their push in steady fashion throughout the night. The Asian session saw the release of hotter than expected inflation figures from China, largely due to a 110% yr/yr surge in pork prices. The disappointment was partially offset by news that China's credit creation exceeded expectations in November. Treasury futures hit pre-market highs not long ago amid a weak showing from European equity markets. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% at 97.53.

Sens. Scott, Hawley to NBC: Stand Up for Human RightsTargeted News ServiceDecember 20, 2019 Friday 8:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 672 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Rick Scott, R-Florida, issued the following news release:Senators Rick Scott and Josh Hawley wrote a letter to the Chief Executive Officer of NBC Universal and the President of NBC Olympics urging them to put human rights over profits by requesting that the International Olympic Committee re-bid the 2022 Olympics, which is being hosted in Communist China, or refuse to air the 2022 games.Read the letter HERE (https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2019-12/IOC%20Letter%2012.19.pdf) or below.December 19, 2019Mr. Stephen Burke, Chief Executive Officer, NBC Universal, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, NY 10112Mr. Gary Zenkel, President, NBC Olympics, One Blachey Road, Stamford, CT 06902Dear Mr. Burke and Mr. Zenkel:As the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing approach, we write to you with grave concern about the decision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to allow a Communist regime with an abysmal record on human rights to host a global sporting event that attracts athletes and spectators from all across the world. By doing so, you are placing profits over principles, and ensuring that China can be accepted into the international system even as it violates its basic rules and tenets.Communist China is one of the great human rights abusers in the world, and it presents a threat to the safety and security of every athlete and tourist who will travel to Beijing. General Secretary Xi has set up a surveillance infrastructure in Beijing that tracks every person's location and internet activity. Communist China uses millions of cameras, powered by facial recognition technology, to spy on and persecute those who criticize the regime. The 2022 Olympic Games in Beijing will provide the Chinese government access to a global array of dignitaries, athletes, corporations, and government entities, a risk that should be avoided at all costs.On top of the concerns about Chinese surveillance, in November, documents obtained by the New York Times revealed the lengths to which Communist China uses this technology to track and oppress Uyghurs, a Muslim ethnic group in the province in Xianjing. The documents showed how the Communist regime weaponizes military surveillance to spy on civilians and treat them as military threats, instead of human beings endowed with personal dignity. And they confirmed, as had previously been reported, that more than a million Uyghurs are in prison and "re-education camps," simply because of their religion.Many of us have shared similar concerns directly with the IOC. Unfortunately, in one response the IOC claimed that it must remain "strictly politically neutral" with regard to Communist China and would take no action. We find that response to be woefully lacking.We hope you, unlike the IOC, understand that this is not about politics, but about human rights and the security of athletes and international visitors. We also hope you know Communist China did not abide by the Host City Contract in the 2008 Beijing Winter Olympics, and its long history of breaking promises shows that it is not a country that can be trusted.NBC Universal is faced with an important decision. As a media organization, it also has a moral responsibility to inform the public. By overlooking China's human rights record, you betray your viewers in misleading them about the most important threat facing our values and our way of life. Please pick human rights over profits. If Communist China continues to persecute religious minorities, forcibly harvest organs of innocent civilians, oppress the people of Hong Kong, spy on civilians, and imprison political dissidents, they should forfeit their rights to host an event that is supposed to bring the world together. We urge NBC to stand with us and request that the IOC re-bid the 2022 Olympics or refuse to air the 2022 games.We look forward to hearing your decision on this important matter.Sincerely,Rick Scott, United States SenatorJosh Hawley, United States SenatorCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6969387 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 20, 2019End of Document

My 2020 Visionwaste360.comDecember 20, 2019Copyright 2019 Informa Business Media, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 978 wordsByline: Chaz MillerBody2020 will be another challenging year for recyclers . Markets remain daunting as we continue to deal with the fallout from China’s decision to ban mixed paper and mixed plastic imports .Paper markets will remain flat throughout 2020 with some glimmers of hope of rising prices toward   its end. This year’s October 1 opening of the Pratt Industries mill in Wapakoneta, Ohio, was the first sign of a comeback for mixed paper markets. That mill will purchase 160,000 tons of mixed paper in its first year, doubling its purchases within a decade. While one new mill is not enough to bring market relief, it is a vital first step.   Two new mills consuming mixed paper, Green Bay Packaging in Wisconsin and Cascades in Virginia, will open by early 2021. New Chinese-owned mills in Maine and Kentucky also will increase mixed paper capacity that year.Paper markets , however, face some potential downsides during 2020. The first is the future of corrugated packaging in the age of e-commerce. Will online retail continue to shift to lighter-weight plastic packaging, and, if so, to what extent? E-commerce has been a boon to the American box-making industry. Additional capacity to use old corrugated containers (OCC) is already in place or planned to open during 2020. The new capacity is relying on continued robust use by online retailers.The Chinese government will decide whether to ban all paper recyclables or to allow clean imported OCC to continue as a necessary raw material for Chinese paper mills. I suspect that practical limits to the amount of imported pulp and domestic recycling will lead the government to continue OCC imports, albeit at lower levels.Plastic markets are harder to predict. Twenty-six new facilities have been announced in the last two years and several opened. However, virtually all of them take specific resins instead of mixed plastics. This means mixed plastics collected at the curbside will still need to be processed before they go to these new facilities.Recycled resin prices are even more problematic. With the surge in new virgin resin capacity coming online, prices for those resins are likely to go down and depress recycled resin prices. Many consumer brands announced aggressive goals for the use of recycled plastic . 2020 will test their willingness to increase recycled content even if it means paying more for raw materials.The good news is that while China is banning imports of mixed recycled plastics, it is not banning imports of recycled plastic resin and pellets. Those imports are not near the level of previous mixed plastic imports, but they increased in 2019.Plastic recycling also faces a supply problem. The amount of recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) will need to triple to meet the brands’ goals . Where will the new supply come from? A national beverage container deposit law is the most effective way to increase the supply. Barring a change of heart by beverage companies, I don’t expect to see one pass Congress.This doesn’t mean Congress will do nothing. Voting in favor of recycling is an easy way for politicians to get green credentials. As a result, I expect Congress will act. Save Our Seas 2.0 expands last year’s marine debris law with recycling-specific provisions. Because its sponsors are on the committees in charge of this legislation, it is the bill most likely to pass.Congress may also pass either the RECOVER (Realizing the Economic Opportunities and Value of Expanding Recycling) or the RECYCLE (Recycling Enhancements to Collection and Yield through Consumer Learning and Education) Acts. Both provide financial support to local government recycling efforts. Their future   undoubtedly will be part of budget negotiations.At the state and local level, expect more plastic bag and plastic straw bans. Bag bans are fairly common now. Oddly, some more conservative state legislatures that are normally highly protective of local government powers have passed laws banning local bag bans . The same could happen with straw bans, although straws are a far more emotional issue than bags .Food waste recovery legislation aimed at restaurants,   groceries and other large food waste generators will be popular at the state and local level. Unfortunately, I do not see any of the new legislation correcting the mistakes of existing laws. As happened with recycling laws, legislators assume that somehow end markets will arise in response to their new collection and processing laws. They should concentrate first on developing market demand. Lawmakers also should remember that NIMBY [not in my backyard] opposition will plague siting of new composting and anaerobic digestion facilities.Extended producer responsibility (EPR) legislation will get attention. Expect new laws on sharps and other hard-to-recycle products. Advocates will press hard for the first statewide EPR package and printed paper law. As I’ve written in the past, I’m not a big fan of creating a statewide recycling monopoly. I expect the issue to be heavily debated in a number of states.All of these legislative proposals dance around the biggest issue facing waste and recycling. Most of the proposed laws aim at increased recycling without considering that impact on climate change. Recycling often leads to lowered greenhouse gas emissions, but not always. If we punish lightweight packages and products that are hard to recycle, even though they have a lower cradle to grave environmental footprint than their heavier, more easily recyclable competitors, we will not help the environment. Politics, though, is about emotion, not reason. I don’t expect that to change.So how will 2020 turn out? Ask me at the end of next year. But at the very least, 2020 will be interesting and challenging.Chaz Miller is a longtime veteran of the waste and recycling industry.

Companies will be able to continue doing business with Huawei until FebruaryCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 18, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 602 wordsBodySan Francisco, Nov 18. (EFEUSA).- Domestic companies will be able to continue to do business with Chinese manufacturer Huawei at least until February, after President Donald Trump's administration today extended the moratorium in May.The Trump Administration first announced a ban on U.S. companies from maintaining trade ties with Huawei in May this year, but had since already decreed two moratoriums on that decision, which was added to that of this Monday, when the decreed in August.Trump's executive is wary of the company's ties to the Chinese government and claims to have suspicions that Huawei could use its mobile phones and other technology equipment to spy abroad and provide information to the country's leaders Asian.Although the market share of Huawei mobile phones in the United States is very small (less than 1% according to Statcounter's most recent data), the Chinese company does have a strong presence as a provider of telecommunications equipment in the areas rural areas of the country.Its products, substantially cheaper than those of the competition, have allowed the deployment of wireless networks in large, sparsely populated parts of the country where, had it not been for Huawei, these infrastructures would have been practically unviable from a financial point of view."The temporary extension of the general license will allow teleoperators to continue serving customers in some of the most remote areas of the country who would otherwise have been disconnected," said Commerce Secretary Wilbur. Ross."The (Commerce) department will continue to closely monitor exports of technology considered strategic to ensure that those who want to threaten our national security do not take advantage of our innovations," he riveted.For its part, Huawei stated in a statement that the extension of the moratorium "will in no case have a substantial impact on its business," but nevertheless considered it to be receiving "unfair treatment" from the Trump administration."The U.S. Department of Commerce's decision to include Huawei in its List of Entities (with which its companies cannot maintain business relationships) has been more damaging to the U.S. than to Huawei. This decision has caused significant economic damage to the US companies that Huawei does business with," they argued from the Chinese manufacturer.Alongside its presence in rural areas, the other key aspect of understanding Huawei's impact on the country's economy are suppliers of technology and software components, such as chipmakers Intel, Xilinx and Broadcom, and internet giant Google , owner of the Android operating system, present on Huawei devices.Of all Huawei's US suppliers, Google has the highest profile, as the phones that the Chinese manufacturer sells worldwide (and which are especially popular in markets like Latin America and Europe) have pre-installed Android and services such as Chrome, Gmail, Google Maps, YouTube and the Google Play app store.The huawei veto is framed by a context of trade warfare with China, which has been open since practically the moment Trump came to the presidency in 2017, and which has been settled for the time being by tariffs on hundreds of millions of Chinese imports and similar retaliation on the part of Beijing.Trade tensions between the world's two largest economies have affected global activity, with particular impact on international supply chains.Specifically, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) lowered growth forecasts for both the U.S. and China for this year and next, as well as the outlook for global growth in the face of growing uncertainty.Load-Date: February 24, 2020End of Document

Khoury, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of KLX Energy Services commented, "Contemporaneously with the abrupt decline in activity, we took steps to align our business with current customer demand. Specifically, we implemented an approximate 17 percent reduction in force, as compared with the Company's July 31, 2019 staffing levels, consistent with the approximate 18 percent sequential quarterly decline in our third quarter revenues. We aggressively cut costs in every area of our business, and we warm stacked the vast majority of our Permian based wireline assets. As a result of these and other measures, we expect to take a third quarter charge of approximately $13 million. Notwithstanding the precipitous decline in industry conditions, we generated approximately $44 million in cash flow from operations and approximately $31 million in free cash flow, bringing our cash balance to approximately $121 million for the quarter ended October 31, 2019. In addition, our $100 million credit facility remains undrawn.""The abrupt deterioration in industry conditions, which accelerated through the end of our third quarter, was driven by a sharp sequential quarterly decline in U.S. land rig count and an unprecedented decline in active frac spreads from the second quarter to the third quarter. In fact, there was a significant sequential decline in hydraulic fracturing activity during each month of the third quarter. The decline in Exploration & Production activity resulted in lower demand levels and lower current and expected revenues for our business, which led the Company to accelerate its annual testing for asset impairment into the third quarter. While the Company has not yet completed this analysis, we expect to report a non-cash asset impairment charge in the range of approximately $45 million to $60 million. The Company is in the process of finalizing the actual amount of the impairment charge, which will be completed prior to reporting its third quarter financial results."06:00CEO CNOOC Ltd names President Xu Keqiang as CEO (152.50 )06:00TRP TC Energy to provide financial update and review strategic plans at Investor Day, reaffirms expectation to grow common share dividend at an annual rate of 8-10% through 2021 (51.44 )"Our $100 billion portfolio of high-quality, long-life energy infrastructure assets are expected to generate record financial results again in 2019 underpinned by strong market fundamentals," said Russ Girling, TC Energy's president and chief executive officer. "Looking forward, we continue to advance $30 billion of commercially secured projects that will expand and extend our asset footprint across North America."As those projects enter service, TC Energy expects comparable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to exceed $10 billion in 2022. This represents an increase of more than 16 per cent when compared to comparable EBITDA of $8.6 billion in 2018 despite significant asset sales that have accelerated the strengthening of the company's balance sheet. Notably, approximately 95 per cent of comparable EBITDA is expected to come from regulated assets or long-term contracts. At the same time, the company continues to methodically advance more than $20 billion of projects under development including Keystone XL and the Bruce Power life extension program. Success in advancing these and other organic growth opportunities that are expected to emanate from TC Energy's five operating businesses across North America would add to the company's growth outlook."Based on the confidence we have in our business plans, we are reaffirming that we expect to grow our common share dividend at an annual rate of eight to 10 per cent through 2021," added Girling. "Our dividend outlook is supported by expected growth in earnings and cash flow and in line with our historically strong dividend coverage ratios."06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets continue climb higher; US Futures in record territoryThe global equity markets are mostly higher once again with US Futures venturing into all-time high territory for a second straight night.

These utility operations have customers in eight states and expect customer growth to continue at a rate of 1-2% annually. The anticipated investment reflects opportunities to improve the safety and reliability of the company's systems. Also included in the utility's five-year program is the construction of an 88-megawatt simple-cycle, natural gas-fired combustion turbine near Mandan, North Dakota.The capital investment plan at the pipeline and midstream business reflects a focus on organic growth. This includes the Demicks Lake Expansion project under construction in North Dakota, which is expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2020 and as designed will increase capacity by 175 mln cubic feet per day. The North Bakken Expansion project is also included in the capital forecast. As designed, this project in the heart of the Bakken will increase capacity by an estimated 350 mln cubic feet per day and is expected to be in service in late 2021. This business is exploring additional organic growth projects that, if executed, would be incremental to the capital investment plan. Natural gas production continues at record levels in the Bakken, driving the need for additional infrastructure.At the company's construction materials and services businesses, the capital expenditures forecast is focused primarily on organic expansion opportunities, normal equipment and plant replacements and upgrades. Included in the outlined forecast is the development of Knife River's Honey Creek Quarry in Texas, which includes the construction of a rock-crushing plant and the purchase of aggregate railcars. The company expects public sector workload growth as new state and local infrastructure spending initiatives are introduced.16:44ZG Zillow announced that Greg Schwartz, president of media and marketplaces, is stepping down to take a professional break (39.74 +0.23)The businesses that currently report to Schwartz in the Mortgages and Internet, Media and Technology (IMT) segments are being transitioned to other senior executives.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 97.80.Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for November declined to 70 from 71 in October.

SPE now owns 100% of the multimedia entertainment company. Following the transaction, the Game Show Network channel will continue to be carried on DIRECTV.The sale is consistent with AT&T's strategy to monetize non-strategic assets as it de-levers its balance sheet and begins to retire shares. Prior to the transaction, SPE owned a 58% stake in Game Show Network, and AT&T owned the remaining 42%. In connection with the transaction, AT&T received approx. $500 mln, including proceeds for its equity stake valued at $380 mln (before transaction-related adjustments) and dividends of approx. $130 mln. Game Show Network will continue to be managed by Sony Pictures Television (SPT) with Mark Feldman continuing as President and CEO of the multimedia outlet.16:15EFC Ellington Financial commences public offering of 4.2 mln shares of common stock (18.81 +0.01)The company expects to use proceeds to acquire its targeted assets.

TWO TIBETANS DETAINED FOLLOWING INDEPENDENCE PROTEST IN SERSHULStates News ServiceNovember 21, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 479 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Chinese authorities Sichuan on Thursday detained two Tibetans after the pair scattered leaflets calling for Tibetan independence in the courtyard of a Chinese police station in Sershul county, according to Tibetan sources.The protest by the two men, Yonten and Choegyal, took place at about 2:30 p.m. in front of the police station in Sershul's Dza Wonpo village in the Kardze (Chinese, Ganzi) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, a Tibetan monk living in India told RFA, citing contacts in the region."The two men threw leaflets in the air and called out for Tibet's independence in a protest against the Chinese government," RFA's source, named Jampa Yonten, said, adding, "They were immediately taken into custody by the Chinese police."Before launching their protest, the two men prepared video clips showing exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, together with the words "Independence for Tibet" written out multiple times in black and red ink, and posted them on the popular social media platform WeChat, Jampa Yonten said.Also posted by the men were verses of support for four Dza Wonpo monks detained in a similar protest on Nov. 7.The monksidentified as Kunsal, 20, Tsultrim, 18, Tamey, 18, and Soeta, 18were seized by police in their rooms at Dza Wonpo Ganden Shedrub monastery and are now in custody, sources told RFA in an earlier report.Police also detained the monks' religious instructor, Shergyam Yang, a teacher at the monastery, but released him after holding him for 11 days.Another monk, named Nyime and identified as the brother of Choegyal, was taken into custody on Nov. 18 after posting online expressions of support for those still held."It is difficult now to assess the current situation in Dza Wonpo," Jampa Yonten told RFA on Thursday. "The word is going around that online communications and phone calls to and from Dza Wonpo are being closely monitored by the Chinese."No word has been received on Yonten and Choegyal's present whereabouts or condition, Jampa Yonten said."It is time for China's leaders to rethink their policies in Tibet," he added.Already tightly restricted following widespread protests in Tibetan regions in 2008, Dza Wonpo monastery drew increased police scrutiny in 2012 when monks refused to hoist Chinese national flags on the monastery's roofs, and an ensuing crackdown led to scores of arbitrary detentions, arrests, and searches of Tibetan homes, sources told RFA in earlier reports.Tibetans say Chinese authorities regularly restrict their political activities and peaceful expression of ethnic and religious identity in the Tibetan region, and subject them to persecution, torture, imprisonment, and extrajudicial killings.Reported by Guru Choegyi and Sonam Lhamo for RFA's Tibetan Service.

U.S. plans case-by-case approach to secure telecom network supply chainFierceWirelessNovember 26, 2019Copyright 2019 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 711 wordsByline: Bevin FletcherHighlight: Notably, the rule does not expressly single out any supplier or company, including Chinese vendor Huawei. BodyThe U.S. Commerce Department on Tuesday laid out plans to take a case-by-case approach in determining which business transactions must be barred in order to protect against related supply chain threats and national security risks to the country's telecommunications networks. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and federal officials will evaluate and have the authority to bar or unwind any deals for information and communications technology that is created or supplied by companies controlled or directed by “foreign adversaries” and that pose security risks.“These actions will safeguard the Information and Communications Technology Supply Chain,” Ross said in a statement. “These rules demonstrate our commitment to securing the digital economy, while also delivering on President Trump's commitment to our digital infrastructure.”The proposed rule implements President Trump's May 15 Executive Order. Trump issued the executive order over concerns of security threats to U.S. telecom networks and said:“foreign adversaries are increasingly creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in information and communications technology and services which store and communicate vast amounts of sensitive information, facilitate the digital economy, and support critical infrastructure and vital emergency services.”RELATED: FCC bans use of USF funds for Huawei, ZTE equipmentAs it relates to the Commerce Department rule, “foreign adversaries” are determined at the discretion of Secretary Ross, in consultation with heads of other federal executive departments and agencies. Notably, the rule does not expressly single out any supplier or company, including Chinese vendor Huawei, which has also been at the center of ongoing U.S.-China trade talks. That's unlike a Federal Communications Commission decision last week to adopt rules that specifically prohibit carriers from using federal Universal Service Fund (USF) dollars to purchase telecom equipment and services from Huawei and ZTE, over concerns they could be used by the Chinese government for malicious acts against the U.S.“While many talk of security issues surrounding ‘back doors,' I have said many times that the untrustworthy equipment from these companies could readily serve as a ‘front door' for Chinese intelligence gathering, at the expense of our privacy and national security,” said FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks in his prepared remarks last week.Huawei has continually denied allegations that it would engage in espionage or other activities for China's purposes.The Commerce Department said the selected case-by case approach would allow Ross to target and prohibit business deals “without unintentionally prohibiting other transactions involving similar ICTS that may not rise to the level of presenting an undue risk to critical infrastructure or the digital economy in the United States or an unacceptable risk to national security or the safety of U.S. persons. This approach would also ensure that the Department does not inadvertently preclude innovation or access to technology in the United States.”RELATED: Rural carriers get another 90-day extension to work with HuaweiThe Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) trade group praised the move, touting a public-private approach to managing supply chain risk.“TIA supports the Commerce Department's new rules implementing the President's May Executive Order to safeguard the nation's communications infrastructure from foreign adversaries,” said TIA CEO David Stehlin in a statement.“TIA has long maintained that supply chain risk management is best addressed by public-private partnerships and consensus-based, industry-driven standards, but there is a place for targeted and careful government intervention. Today's rules exemplify this approach and, through the invitation of comments from industry, represent a clear step forward towards a public-private effort for ensuring a secure communications supply chain.”In evaluating transactions, if Ross makes a preliminary determination to prohibit a certain deal, the parties will be notified and have an opportunity to submit their position, including proposals of how to mitigate the issue, before a final decision is made.The proposed rule is open to public comment for 30 days.Load-Date: November 27, 2019End of Document

FCC Commissioner Carr Issues Statement on Protecting Against National Security Threats to Communications Supply ChainTargeted News ServiceNovember 23, 2019 Saturday 9:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 749 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Federal Communications Commission issued the following statement by Commissioner Brendan Carr:Re: Protecting Against National Security Threats to the Communications Supply Chain Through FCC Program, WC Docket No. 18-89."Earlier this year, I had the privilege of visiting Malmstrom Air Force Base near Great Falls, Montana. I spent time there with Colonel Jennifer Reeves who is Commander of the 341st Missile Wing. Colonel Reeves and her team have one of the most significant and weighty missions in government. In their charge are150 intercontinental ballistic missiles loaded in underground silos spread across northern Montana. These are missiles that when launched can carry nuclear warheads almost 10,000 miles. Colonel Reeves told me that her job is to make sure they're always ready to go. Set against that destructive power is a completely serene and wide-open landscape--it's just wheat fields and Big Sky Country. Except as it turns out, there are cell towers all around the Montana missile fields running on Huawei equipment. I got a firsthand look at those when I was up there."This is not just a concern for the military. Everything we do in modern society now runs on interconnected networks, from banking, to transportation, and even our power grids. This will become only more so as carriers continue to build out 5G networks. If these networks are threatened, everything we have come to rely on is threatened. We have acknowledged the threat that Chinese telecom firms pose to our networks for some time. In 2012, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence issued a report recommending that companies avoid using Huawei and ZTE equipment, and that government agencies remain vigilant and focused on the threat. Last year's National Defense Authorization Act prohibited government agencies and contractors from using Chinese equipment. The Department of Commerce has clamped down on the Chinese firms' abilities to do business with U.S. firms. Last year, we launched this proceeding to do our part to ensure U.S. national security."And this month Attorney General William P. Barr wrote to the Commission that, "we should not signal that Huawei and ZTE are anything other than a threat to our collective security.""When combined with the ever increasing sophistication of cyber attacks and the fact that attacks from state actors are by far the most well-funded and advanced, it's not hard to see the threat that companies like Huawei and ZTE pose to our networks and to our national security. Indeed, China's National Intelligence Law requires that all "organizations...cooperate with the State intelligence work," and it provides them no right to refuse. It also gives the Chinese government the power to take over a company's communications equipment. And because the networks in the U.S--from rural America to big city--are interconnected, even a small amount of compromised equipment could be devastating to U.S. security."At the FCC, we are in a position to do something about this threat. And we are. Today, we are prohibiting carriers from using federal dollars to purchase any equipment or services from companies that pose a national security threat, including Huawei and ZTE."And we are not stopping there. In 2018, I called on the FCC to expand our proceeding and put even more options on the table, including the removal of covered equipment that carriers have already installed in their networks. That would include some of the equipment I saw out in Montana. After all, if equipment poses a threat, it's not enough to stop subsidizing it: it must come out of the network. I am glad that we are moving forward with that idea and proposing to take that action today."I also want to thank my colleagues for agreeing to expand the scope of today's Further Notice. We now go beyond the initial proposal, which focused on removing equipment if the carrier receives federal support, to asking whether we should mandate the removal of covered equipment regardless of whether the communications provider receives federal support. I appreciate that my colleagues not only supported that suggestion but called for similar edits."Today, the U.S. has the leading 5G networks in the world. And today's decision will help extend American leadership by ensuring the security of these vital networks."I want to thank the staff of the Wireline Competition Bureau for their work on this item. It has my full support."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6937069 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 23, 2019End of Document

Unit labor costs increased 2.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.4%) versus a previously reported 3.6% increase. The key takeaway from the report remains the same as the preliminary estimate: the decline in productivity and the jump in unit labor costs points to profit margin pressures for businesses. The decline in productivity was the result of output increasing 2.3% and hours worked increasing 2.5%. The jump in unit labor costs flowed from a 2.3% increase in compensation per hour and the 0.2% decline in productivity. Unit labor costs are up 2.2% over the last four quarters; meanwhile, productivity increased just 1.5% from the third quarter of 2018 to the third quarter of 2019. Manufacturing sector labor productivity increased 0.1% in the third quarter, up from a previously reported 0.1% decline, and unit labor costs increased 3.0% versus the preliminary estimate of 3.6%.Yield Check:2-yr: +1 bp to 1.63%3-yr: UNCH at 1.64%5-yr: UNCH at 1.66%10-yr: -1 bp to 1.82%30-yr: -1 bp to 2.25%08:03 ET10-Yr:+6/32..1.806%..

Treasury futures began rising last evening, continuing their push in steady fashion throughout the night. The Asian session saw the release of hotter than expected inflation figures from China, largely due to a 110% yr/yr surge in pork prices. The disappointment was partially offset by news that China's credit creation exceeded expectations in November. Treasury futures hit pre-market highs not long ago amid a weak showing from European equity markets. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% at 97.53.

The first session of the week was very quiet, and it followed an overnight affair that was just as subdued. Economic data received overnight painted a mixed picture, as China reported a smaller than expected trade surplus for November (actual $38.73 bln; expected $46.30 bln) while Japan's Q3 GDP growth was revised up to 0.4% from 0.1%. Treasuries started the cash session with modest gains, climbing toward their intraday highs from Friday shortly after the open. However, the rest of the session saw a slow return to today's opening levels. The U.S. Treasury sold $38 bln in 3-yr notes to solid demand, as the high yield stopped through the when issued yield by 0.2 bps while the bid-to-cover ratio and indirect takedown were above average. The U.S. Dollar Index faced some morning pressure but returned to little changed as the day went on, reclaiming its 200-day moving average (97.65) in the process. Yield Check: 2-yr: -1 bp to 1.62% 3-yr: -1 bp to 1.64% 5-yr: UNCH at 1.67% 10-yr: -1 bp to 1.83% 30-yr: -2 bps to 2.26%News: The House of Representatives could vote on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on December 18, according to CNBC. The Bank for International Settlements published its latest quarterly review, which noted that structural issues rather than temporary factors were responsible for the mid-September shortage in the funding market that prompted the Fed to begin conducting daily repurchases. The BIS added that liquidity demand from hedge funds exacerbated the funding stress. Financial Times reported that the Chinese government has ordered the removal of all foreign computer equipment and software from government offices. The Bank of Japan will reportedly lower its assessment of industrial production due to prolonged weakness. Former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker died on Sunday. China's November trade surplus totaled $38.73 bln (expected $46.30 bln; last $43.02 bln). Exports fell 1.1% yr/yr (expected 1.0%; last -0.8%) while imports rose 0.3% yr/yr (expected -1.8%; last -6.2%). Japan's Q3 GDP rose 0.4% qtr/qtr (expected 0.2%; last 0.1%), growing 1.8% yr/yr (expected 0.7%; last 0.2%). The latest set of election polls from the U.K. suggest that Conservatives will win majority on Thursday with a margin between 9 and 15 percentage points. Eurozone's December Sentix Investor Confidence rose to 0.7 from -4.5 (expected -4.9). Germany's October trade surplus totaled EUR20.60 bln (expected surplus of EUR19.00 bln; last surplus of EUR19.20 bln).

The Chinese government promoted Huawei's global rise with support of around $75 billion (€68 billion) in tax exemptions, direct financing and low-priced resources, according to Wednesday's edition of The Wall Street Journal.Beijing's support for Huawei Technologies, which began 25 years ago, is behind a number of issues relating to relations between China and the tech giant, at a time when it is responsible for building next-generation 5G telecommunications networks in everybody."Even if Huawei has commercial interests, these interests are strongly supported by the state," Michael Wessel, a member of a U.S. congressional panel, told WSJ in a when the trade war between the two countries goes through a period of some calm.The United States has expressed concern that Huawei's equipment will feed the Chinese government with network data from customers around the world, even though Huawei says it would never deliver that data to Beijing.Most of the support, around US$46 billion, was granted in loans, credit lines and other aid given by state entities.The company saved up to about $25 billion in taxes between 2008 and 2018 as a result of tax incentives granted to promote the technology sector.Among other aid, the technology also enjoyed 1.6 billion in grants and 2 billion in discounts on land acquisition.Huawei made it known through a statement sent to the WSJ that it received "small and non-material" support and that this is not uncommon, noting that much of the aid was granted through tax exemptions for the technology sector that are also available to other companies.       Load-Date: January 27, 2020End of Document

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +2.10.The S&P 500 futures trade roughly in-line with fair value after another record-setting day on Wall Street yesterday. Futures were up as much as 0.4% above fair value after China's Xinhua News Agency reported that top trade negotiators held a phone call last evening.Both the U.S. and China reportedly reached an agreement in that call to continue to work toward resolving key issues for a Phase One trade agreement. The market, which already expects both sides to talk until a deal is reached, has justifiably tempered its initial enthusiasm but will likely continue to react to trade headlines moving forward.On the data front, investors will receive the Advance reports for International Trade in Goods, Retail Inventories, and Wholesale Inventories at 8:30 a.m. ET, followed by the FHFA Housing Price Index for September and the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for September (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) at 9:00 a.m. ET.After the open, investors will receive the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) and the New Home Sales report for October (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) at 10:00 a.m. ET.U.S. Treasuries have extended yesterday's modest advance, pushing yields slightly lower again this morning.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +2.80.The S&P 500 futures continue to trade roughly in-line with fair value.Just in, the Advance report for International Trade in Goods for October showed a deficit of $66.5 billion versus $70.4 billion in September.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +2.10.The S&P 500 futures trade roughly in-line with fair value after another record-setting day on Wall Street yesterday. Futures were up as much as 0.4% above fair value after China's Xinhua News Agency reported that top trade negotiators held a phone call last evening.Both the U.S. and China reportedly reached an agreement in that call to continue to work toward resolving key issues for a Phase One trade agreement. The market, which already expects both sides to talk until a deal is reached, has justifiably tempered its initial enthusiasm but will likely continue to react to trade headlines moving forward.On the data front, investors will receive the Advance reports for International Trade in Goods, Retail Inventories, and Wholesale Inventories at 8:30 a.m. ET, followed by the FHFA Housing Price Index for September and the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for September (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) at 9:00 a.m. ET.After the open, investors will receive the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) and the New Home Sales report for October (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) at 10:00 a.m. ET.U.S. Treasuries have extended yesterday's modest advance, pushing yields slightly lower again this morning.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal. It should be noted that a separate report from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal before the 2020 election is unlikely to be reached did not have a noticeable effect on the market.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.4%), which typically outperforms when the prevailing view on trade is positive, led all sectors in gains amid strength in the semiconductor stocks. NVIDIA (NVDA 221.21, +10.32, +4.9%) was a notable gainer after the stock was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.4%.The health care (+1.1%) and consumer discretionary (+0.9%) sectors also rose more than the S&P 500, while the utilities sector (-0.4%) was today's lone sector to finish in negative territory.Two of today's M&A deals were ones that were already on the market's radar: Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.31, +1.11, +2.3%) agreed to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.78, +3.65, +7.6%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction, and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreed to acquire Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.25, +7.74, +6.2%) for $16.2 billion in cash.New deals included Novartis (NVS 91.30, +0.82, +0.9%) agreeing to acquire The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.80, +15.25, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash and eBay (EBAY 35.85, +0.73, +2.1%) agreeing to sell StubHub to Viagogo for $4.05 billion in cash.Strikingly, U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note despite the risk sentiment displayed in the stock market.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +2.80.The S&P 500 futures continue to trade roughly in-line with fair value.Just in, the Advance report for International Trade in Goods for October showed a deficit of $66.5 billion versus $70.4 billion in September. Meanwhile, the Advance report for Retail Inventories for October increased 0.6%, and the Advance report for Wholesale Inventories for October increased 0.2%.07:56 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -0.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +2.10.The S&P 500 futures trade roughly in-line with fair value after another record-setting day on Wall Street yesterday. Futures were up as much as 0.4% above fair value after China's Xinhua News Agency reported that top trade negotiators held a phone call last evening.Both the U.S. and China reportedly reached an agreement in that call to continue to work toward resolving key issues for a Phase One trade agreement. The market, which already expects both sides to talk until a deal is reached, has justifiably tempered its initial enthusiasm but will likely continue to react to trade headlines moving forward.On the data front, investors will receive the Advance reports for International Trade in Goods, Retail Inventories, and Wholesale Inventories at 8:30 a.m. ET, followed by the FHFA Housing Price Index for September and the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for September (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) at 9:00 a.m. ET.After the open, investors will receive the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) and the New Home Sales report for October (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) at 10:00 a.m. ET.U.S. Treasuries have extended yesterday's modest advance, pushing yields slightly lower again this morning.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal. It should be noted that a separate report from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal before the 2020 election is unlikely to be reached did not have a noticeable effect on the market.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.4%), which typically outperforms when the prevailing view on trade is positive, led all sectors in gains amid strength in the semiconductor stocks. NVIDIA (NVDA 221.21, +10.32, +4.9%) was a notable gainer after the stock was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.4%.The health care (+1.1%) and consumer discretionary (+0.9%) sectors also rose more than the S&P 500, while the utilities sector (-0.4%) was today's lone sector to finish in negative territory.Two of today's M&A deals were ones that were already on the market's radar: Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.31, +1.11, +2.3%) agreed to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.78, +3.65, +7.6%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction, and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreed to acquire Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.25, +7.74, +6.2%) for $16.2 billion in cash.New deals included Novartis (NVS 91.30, +0.82, +0.9%) agreeing to acquire The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.80, +15.25, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash and eBay (EBAY 35.85, +0.73, +2.1%) agreeing to sell StubHub to Viagogo for $4.05 billion in cash.Strikingly, U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note despite the risk sentiment displayed in the stock market. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.32. WTI crude increased 0.2%, or $0.10, to $57.98/bbl.Investors did not receive any notable economic data on Monday.

Huawei fights FCC USF restrictions with new lawsuit FierceWirelessDecember 5, 2019Copyright 2019 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 698 wordsByline: Bevin FletcherHighlight: The petition claims the FCC exceeded its authority in designating Huawei as a national security risk. BodyHuawei has stepped up its fight against U.S. restrictions and petitioned a federal appeals court to throw out a recent FCC ruling that bans service providers from using federal Universal Service Fund (USF) support to purchase the Chinese vendor's telecom gear and services.The lawsuit, filed Wednesday evening in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, asks the court to find the Nov. 22 FCC order unlawful, asserting that the FCC doesn't have the authority to designate Huawei as a national security threat. It argues federal laws were also violated because notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements weren't observed, and due process protections weren't afforded.Last month the FCC voted unanimously to prohibit USF recipients from using government subsidies to buy telecom equipment from companies deemed a national security risk, and specifically named Huawei and fellow Chinese vendor ZTE as entities subject to the rule.RELATED: FCC bans use of USF funds for Huawei, ZTE equipmentMichael Carvin, partner at Jones Day and legal spokesperson for Huawei, on Wednesday evening expressed confidence in the strength of the lawsuit, saying Huawei has “excellent arguments” both in terms of the FCC's involvement in designating entities as a national security risk and the agency's alleged failure to adhere to “basic principals of procedural fairness.” While the FCC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to restrict the use of USF funds was circulated more than a year prior, it wasn't clear that the order would directly name Huawei until it was adopted in November and the company feels it was not given the basic opportunity to convince the FCC otherwise.“Banning a company like Huawei, just because we started in China – this does not solve cyber security challenges,” said Huawei's Chief Legal Officer Song Liuping at a press conference in Shenzhen.The U.S. has campaigned for allies around the globe to keep Huawei out of next generation 5G networks, citing security concerns that the company could be used by the Chinese government to engage in activities like espionage. Huawei has continuously denied these claims.The vendor already sued the U.S. government earlier this year, challenging restrictions that banned federal agencies from using Huawei products.Huawei doesn't have a major presence in the U.S., but most of its customers are concentrated in rural and underserved parts the country, partly because of the vendor's lower-cost equipment and willingness to work with smaller operators.RELATED: Rural carriers get another 90-day extension to work with Huawei“Carriers across rural America, in small towns in Montana, Kentucky, and farms in Wyoming – they choose to work with Huawei because they respect the quality and integrity of our equipment,” Song added. “The FCC should not shut down joint efforts to connect rural communities in the U.S.”Huawei's lead counsel on the legal action, Glen Nager of Jones Day, said in statements that the FCC's decision to name Huawei as a security threat lacked legal or factual support.“Indeed, the Commission has no national security expertise or authority,” said Nager. “The designation is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of Chinese law and on unsound, unreliable, and inadmissible accusations and innuendo, not evidence.”RELATED: House bill asks for $1B to rip and replace Huawei equipmentIn making its decision on the USF restrictions, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai at the time said actions were taken “based on evidence in the record, as well as longstanding concerns from the executive and legislative branches about the national security threats posed by certain foreign communications equipment manufacturers, most particularly Huawei and ZTE.”The FCC also adopted a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to require carriers to “rip and replace” any unsecure telecom network equipment that is already in use and seeks comment on how to fund what could prove to be a costly undertaking.Just this week the agency proposed allocating $9 billion in USF subsidies over 10 years to support 5G deployments in rural areas.Under the new rules, carriers using those funds would not be able to spend them on Huawei equipment or services.Load-Date: December 5, 2019End of Document

David Berger, the US Marine Corps commandant, suggested the concerns surrounding a service members' use of questionable Chinese-owned apps like TikTok should be directed against the military's leadership, rather than the individual troops.Speaking at the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, California, on Saturday morning, Berger said the younger generation of troops had a "clearer view" of the technology "than most people give them credit for.""That said, I'd give us a 'C-minus' or a 'D' in educating the force on the threat of even technology," Berger said. "Because they view it as two pieces of gear, 'I don't see what the big deal is.'""That's not their fault. That's on us," Berger added. "Once they begin to understand the risks, what the impact to them is tactically ... then it becomes clear. I don't blame them for that. This is a training and education that we have to do."Foreign-owned apps like TikTok have prompted concern from lawmakers and the military in recent months. TikTok, the viral video-sharing app from China, was investigated by intelligence agencies and the military for concerns on the "operational security risks posed ... and other China-owned social media platforms that can access massive amounts of US users' personal data,"            according to a letter by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in November."National security experts have raised concerns about TikTok's collection and handling of user data, including user content and communications, IP addresses, location-related data, metadata, and other sensitive personal information," Schumer added in the letter.To "err on the side of caution," US Army cadets throughout high school and university were banned from using TikTok while in uniform to represent the military, a spokeswoman said in November. The act does not ban them from using it for personal use.The app, which was formerly Musical.ly, exploded in popularity and boasted 1 billion monthly active users earlier this year. TikTok and its owner, Beijing ByteDance Technology, claims that American user data is not stored in China, nor is it politically influenced by the country."Let us be very clear: TikTok does not remove content based on sensitivities related to China," the company said in a statement in October. "We have never been asked by the Chinese government to remove any content and we would not do so if asked. Period."NOW WATCH: We can thank the US military for the smelliest weapon in the worldSee Also:• NATO is finally talking about China, and there are 3 big problems it has to address• 13 Marines agree to be kicked out of the military after being accused of human smuggling and drug trafficking• China actually started blocking US Navy port calls to Hong Kong months before its latest retaliatory moveSEE ALSO: The convicted US Army war criminal Trump released early says he can't get a job 'even at Walmart or Target'Load-Date: December 7, 2019End of Document

The app is owned by Beijing-based firm ByteDance but has quickly built up a large U.S. user base, primarily of young people.The lawsuit claims that TikTok unfairly profits from "secret harvesting" of users' private data by using it to derive "vast targeted-advertising revenues and profits".No Time to Die poster shows Rami Malek as villian SafinThese included first looks at new additions Lashana Lynch , Ana de Armas and Rami Malek , as the mysterious new Bond villain. His peace is short-lived when his old friend Felix Leiter von der Central Intelligence Agency appears and asks for help.Information gleaned from the accounts include facial scans, birthdays, phone and social network contacts, browsing history and more, according to the suit.However, the platform is facing mounting pressure in North America over data collection and censorship concerns.Hong alleges that the app retrieved her data without permission - including videos that she had created but not shared online - and transferred them to servers run by companies that cooperate with the Chinese government.Hong claims in the suit that the transfer happened in between the time in which the user records a video and when it's uploaded.TikTok has said in recent weeks that it stores its U.S. user data within the country and does not censor political content in line with Beijing's instructions.Earlier this year, the U.S. government opened a national security investigation into ByteDance's acquisition of social media app Musical.ly, which has since been rebranded as TikTok.Load-Date: December 4, 2019End of Document

The year of economic slowdownCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 28, 2019 SaturdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1918 wordsBodyThe year 2019 says goodbye leaving more doubts than when it started. After years of brisk recovery, activity has begun to flounder because of external instability: the aftermath of the trade war, the turbulence of Brexit, the crisis in the German car industry, and geopolitical tensions in others regions of the world have been the co-tail of chronicles to explain the loss of fuel from the international economy. World trade experienced its worst year in 2019 in a decade.Despite this, Spain grew above the European average, with an enviable 2%, unemployment continues to fall and domestic consumption remains in force. What looked like a new storm in late summer seems to have passed in the winter, but the symptoms of cooling are still there and the lack of a stable government has hampered economic policy. The counterpoint to uncertainty has been the increase in workers' wages, pensions for retirees and the minimum wage, which have contributed to citizens regaining purchasing power. And for the great wound of the crisis, inequality, to begin to heal slowly. This is the chronicle of a year marked by the following events:Political palsy. The government of Pedro Sánchez presented budgets at the beginning of 2019, but failed to move them forward and opened a time of interinity that has been extended throughout the year. Behind are outstanding reforms such as pensions, labour or autonomous financing. No advertised taxes on high incomes, large companies, financial transactions, or the Google rate were also passed.Spain grows above the European average and wages riseWages are falling asleep. The recovery has reached wages in 2019. Employment has been growing strongly for almost six years. Wages, on the other hand, did not add to this euphoria. High levels of unemployment (still around 14%) and low productivity in Spain, linked to high precariousness and the lower power of workers in collective bargaining following the 2012 labour reform, resulted in anemic salaries. The situation has changed this year. At the end of 2019, the salaries agreed in the agreements grew by 2.3%, the remuneration of public workers by 2.5% and the minimum wage made its biggest leap during democracy: 22.3%, to 900 euros. This has led to an average wage increase in the first three quarters of the year of around 2% (1,876.95 euros). This advance, however, has been obscured by economic cooling. As of September, employment grew at an annual rate of 1.7% (346,300 additional jobs), up from 3.2% in the year (596,900).Pensions: the reform that does not come. Another year that ends and continues not to arrive the reform of Social Security that closes its deficit, perched around 18 billion since 2016. The increase in wages and contribution bases (maximum and minimum) has increased contribution income and the forward-looking institute will achieve more revenue than ever before. But spending has also grown. All contributory pensions rose by at least 1.6%, and much of the widow's pensions grew even more. Paternity leave increased to six weeks in January and two months in April, raising spending. And as the need for income rose (and goes up), there is no agreement on the recommendations of the Toledo Pact. On the verge of reaching in February, the April elections crossed their path. So the reform doesn't come, the resources to close the social security deficit either and the Smaller Reserve Fund: only just over 2 billion remain.Bankia: trial of the symbol of the crisis.Bankia needed 22,424 million to not fail in 2012; the state put this money in and prevented customers from losing their savings. After the scare, the managers must respond. The record bailout and politicization of the dome (commanded by Rodrigo Rato, former economic leader of the PP) have made Bankia the symbol of the crisis. After 10 months of trial and 74 sessions, the national hearing sentence is expected to judge 34 defendants, 31 natural and three legal persons: Bankia, BFA and Deloitte. They are credited with accounting misrepresentation and investor fraud for the entity's IPO. Rato calls for his acquittal on the grounds that the Bank of Spain oversaw all its decisions and never criticized them. The supervisor is not judged, but he is behind everything, with a shadow of responsibility. The Court will have to decide whether, in addition to fault, there are also culprits.The 'Villarejo case' assaults the Ibex. On 14 January, BBVA's new president, Carlos Torres Vila, ordered an extension of the internal open investigation into the bank's relations with the company Cenyt, of retired commissioner Villarejo. According to the information that appeared, the entity had hired her to spy on people involved in the sacyr construction company Sacyr's attempt to enter its capital. The case led Judge Manuel García-Castellón to impute the bank in July for alleged offences of bribery, discovery and disclosure of secrets and corruption in a separate piece of the Tandem case investigating Villarejo. The investigation directly splashes with former president Francisco González, who denied knowing the alleged plot, although it was unveiled that the bank maintained commercial relations with Cenyt between 2004 and 2018, when the commissioner had already entered the jail. Transcendence has risen in full since the ECB asked Spanish justice for information on these relations. In the meantime, complying with threats from Villarejo, information has emerged that compromise other Ibex companies, such as Iberdrola, which has acknowledged that there are invoices paid to Cenyt, and more recently Repsol and La Caixa.The real estate market is slowed down, but the rent reaches highs. Neither the sale, nor the construction nor the house prices are what they were. After two years of strong growth, 2019 has been a new inflection. Despite some shock, such as the entry into force of the new mortgage law that caused point falls in sales, the sector is witnessing a normalization: this year will possibly end with less sales than in 2018, new homes built will not exceed by a large exceed the 100,000 that were built last year and flats and houses are going to the lowest pace of recent times. However, prices continue to rise more than wages, and this affects the most vulnerable groups. Young people without family assistance or who can't save enough are given renting, which eats more and more of the income although in Madrid and Barcelona it has also started to show timid declines. A legislative change in March gave tenants greater guarantees by reclaiming the minimum duration of five-year contracts (seven if the landlord is a company) and limiting year-on-year price hikes to the CPI.Taxi drivers block Madrid and Barcelona. Taxi drivers' protest against Uber and Cabify marked the early days of the year. For a week, taxi drivers in Barcelona blocked Gran Via, one of the city's main arteries, and staged intense protests that replicated in Madrid at the heart of the International Tourism Fair (Fitur). They called for a regulation that would add to the activity of VTCs (concerted transport vehicles). The Generalitat passed a decree requiring the purchase of VTCs 15 minutes in advance, a margin that more thanlate the Barcelona Metropolitan Area, which encompasses the capital and 35 adjoining cities, expanded to one hour, although this regulation was suspended in court. The decree caused Uber's departure from Barcelona; Cabify suspended the operation for a few months and then adapted to the standard.Activity is beginning to flounder for international stabilityPulls and loosens in the trade war. The global economy ends the year just as it did: pending Donald Trump's slumps. The trade war that has been going on for almost two years has just given a break. The Us and China closed the first phase of the agreement they negotiate dearly in December, freezing mutual tariff escalation. Washington also agreed to a renewed trade treaty with Mexico and Canada. But that doesn't mean peace has come. The fronts of the conflict mutate: Trump is now showing signs of targeting Europe. Meanwhile, the economy suffers the consequences of aggression. The IMF announced that the world will grow this year to its lowest level in a decade and that the trade conflict will cost more than 600 billion euros by 2020. And the World Trade Organization (WTO) implosion over the U.S. blockade heralds a world where conflicts are not resolved through an independent body, but with the law of the strongest.The U.S. imposes tariffs on Spain. Spain is also not saved from Trump's protectionist vortex. The WTO verdict that declared Brussels' aid to Airbus illegal opened the slit for Washington to fire on EU exports to the US: since 18 October a slab worth more than 6.8 billion weighs on a list of 150 products. The impact for Spain is almost 1 billion and the most affected items are oil, wine and cheese, with a tariff of 25%. This levy is in addition to the 35% surcharge that the US had previously imposed on Spanish black olives.Lagarde replaces Draghi: the owl arrives at the ECB. The man who revolutionized the European Central Bank (ECB) is leaving. And there comes Christine Lagarde, the first woman and the first inexperienced politician as a central banker at the head of the body. The former head of the IMF has eight very difficult years as president of the ECB. First, because monetary policy shows that it has exhausted its ability to boost eurozone growth and inflation. And it does so at a time of maximum confrontation between the members of the Governing Council, divided between falcons and pigeons. In an attempt to sew the wounds, she wanted to move away from both sides: "My ambition is to be that owl that is often associated with wisdom." He doesn't want to get wet. But no one doubts that the era of outrageous interest rates will continue.The pulse to lead 5G. The 5G will allow remote governing systems as sensitive as communications or the defense of a country. Hence it has become the weapon of its choice of the new Cold War between the Us and China. Trump ordered the veto from Huawei, the world's largest provider of 5G networks, on the grounds that he could spy for the Chinese government. Companies like Google atowed the order and denied Huawei updates to the Android system, which governs 85% of the mobiles sold worldwide. Sales of terminals by Chinese firm, second global manufacturer after Samsung, plummeted. After several veto postponements, the war is in stand-by. And it can be re-escalating in 2020, when 5G commercial services are started around the world.Biggest IPO in history. Saudi Aramco's start of trading in early December has marked a milestone for both the oil sector — which at the heart of Madrid's COP25gave a sign that the dead are still very much alive—as for the Arab country. For only 1.5% of its capital, the world's second-largest producer of conventional crude oil earned a negligible sum of 23 billion euros to shore up its ambitious investment plan that will sever its path from fossil fuels. To achieve the success of the largest placement in history, the Saudi regime relied on its own citizens—to which it offered significant incentives—and other petrostates around it, such as the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait. However, despite the rises of the first sessions, its quote price has returned almost to its starting point.With information from M. V. Gómez,L. Doncel, J. L. Aranda, M. Noceda, . de Barrón, R.

Khoury, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of KLX Energy Services commented, "Contemporaneously with the abrupt decline in activity, we took steps to align our business with current customer demand. Specifically, we implemented an approximate 17 percent reduction in force, as compared with the Company's July 31, 2019 staffing levels, consistent with the approximate 18 percent sequential quarterly decline in our third quarter revenues. We aggressively cut costs in every area of our business, and we warm stacked the vast majority of our Permian based wireline assets. As a result of these and other measures, we expect to take a third quarter charge of approximately $13 million. Notwithstanding the precipitous decline in industry conditions, we generated approximately $44 million in cash flow from operations and approximately $31 million in free cash flow, bringing our cash balance to approximately $121 million for the quarter ended October 31, 2019. In addition, our $100 million credit facility remains undrawn.""The abrupt deterioration in industry conditions, which accelerated through the end of our third quarter, was driven by a sharp sequential quarterly decline in U.S. land rig count and an unprecedented decline in active frac spreads from the second quarter to the third quarter. In fact, there was a significant sequential decline in hydraulic fracturing activity during each month of the third quarter. The decline in Exploration & Production activity resulted in lower demand levels and lower current and expected revenues for our business, which led the Company to accelerate its annual testing for asset impairment into the third quarter. While the Company has not yet completed this analysis, we expect to report a non-cash asset impairment charge in the range of approximately $45 million to $60 million. The Company is in the process of finalizing the actual amount of the impairment charge, which will be completed prior to reporting its third quarter financial results."06:00CEO CNOOC Ltd names President Xu Keqiang as CEO (152.50 )06:00TRP TC Energy to provide financial update and review strategic plans at Investor Day, reaffirms expectation to grow common share dividend at an annual rate of 8-10% through 2021 (51.44 )"Our $100 billion portfolio of high-quality, long-life energy infrastructure assets are expected to generate record financial results again in 2019 underpinned by strong market fundamentals," said Russ Girling, TC Energy's president and chief executive officer. "Looking forward, we continue to advance $30 billion of commercially secured projects that will expand and extend our asset footprint across North America."As those projects enter service, TC Energy expects comparable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to exceed $10 billion in 2022. This represents an increase of more than 16 per cent when compared to comparable EBITDA of $8.6 billion in 2018 despite significant asset sales that have accelerated the strengthening of the company's balance sheet. Notably, approximately 95 per cent of comparable EBITDA is expected to come from regulated assets or long-term contracts. At the same time, the company continues to methodically advance more than $20 billion of projects under development including Keystone XL and the Bruce Power life extension program. Success in advancing these and other organic growth opportunities that are expected to emanate from TC Energy's five operating businesses across North America would add to the company's growth outlook."Based on the confidence we have in our business plans, we are reaffirming that we expect to grow our common share dividend at an annual rate of eight to 10 per cent through 2021," added Girling. "Our dividend outlook is supported by expected growth in earnings and cash flow and in line with our historically strong dividend coverage ratios."06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets continue climb higher; US Futures in record territoryThe global equity markets are mostly higher once again with US Futures venturing into all-time territory for a second straight night.

This business is exploring additional organic growth projects that, if executed, would be incremental to the capital investment plan. Natural gas production continues at record levels in the Bakken, driving the need for additional infrastructure.At the company's construction materials and services businesses, the capital expenditures forecast is focused primarily on organic expansion opportunities, normal equipment and plant replacements and upgrades.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 97.80.Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for November declined to 70 from 71 in October. Investors will receive Housing Starts and Building Permits for October on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +28.9% YTDS&P 500 +24.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.2% YTDRussell 2000 +18.1% YTD16:21T AT&T: Sony (SNE) subsidiary Sony Pictures Entertainment acquires AT&T's minority stake in Game Show Network (39.63 +0.13)Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) and AT&T announced that SPE has acquired AT&T's minority stake in Game Show Network. SPE now owns 100% of the multimedia entertainment company. Following the transaction, the Game Show Network channel will continue to be carried on DIRECTV.The sale is consistent with AT&T's strategy to monetize non-strategic assets as it de-levers its balance sheet and begins to retire shares. Prior to the transaction, SPE owned a 58% stake in Game Show Network, and AT&T owned the remaining 42%. In connection with the transaction, AT&T received approx. $500 mln, including proceeds for its equity stake valued at $380 mln (before transaction-related adjustments) and dividends of approx. $130 mln. Game Show Network will continue to be managed by Sony Pictures Television (SPT) with Mark Feldman continuing as President and CEO of the multimedia outlet.16:15EFC Ellington Financial commences public offering of 4.2 mln shares of common stock (18.81 +0.01)The company expects to use proceeds to acquire its targeted assets.

Sen. Peters Issues Statement at Hearing on Supply Chain Security, 5GTargeted News ServiceNovember 1, 2019 Friday 7:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 560 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee issued the following statement by Ranking Member Gary Peters, D-Michigan, at a hearing entitled "Supply Chain Security, Global Competitiveness, and 5G":"Our modern economy is truly global. Internet access is no longer a luxury. It is a necessity, and a vital tool that connects people with educational opportunities, creates jobs and drives economic development."The introduction of 4G technology brought us live-streaming, ridesharing, on-demand delivery, and other innovations. And now, the 5G era is at hand."This faster, stronger wireless connection will once again transform our digital world, enabling new technologies like precision agriculture, self-driving cars, and augmented reality."5G networks and the new technologies they spur will create countless new jobs in Michigan and generate billions of dollars in economic growth across our country."5G has the potential to unleash new productivity and help cement the United States as a global leader in innovation. But developing the infrastructure needed to support 5G networks across the country does not come without risks."Today, China, arguably our nation's greatest global competitor, is poised to lead the world in advancing this important technology."China's edge in the development of 5G equipment and standards poses a threat to both American economic dominance and to our national security. The U.S. is increasingly reliant on high-speed telecommunications services to support not only our broader economy, but also our entire defense industry."In the race to expand 5G access, we face serious supply chain security risks by purchasing and deploying Chinese-made equipment from companies like Huawei and ZTE, companies our Intelligence Community has said may be beholden to the Chinese government."The devices these companies provide potentially offer cost-effective solutions to help close the digital divide. But they also pose a serious national security risk and could open a backdoor into critical American security networks."Given these serious national security risks, we must navigate a delicate balance of ensuring that emerging 5G networks are both secure and widely available in rural and urban areas."China's advantage in 5G may be a reality for now. But it is also something that we have the power to change."The United States government, including this Committee, has an opportunity to play a key role in America's resurgence as a leader in the development of 5G networks. A challenge of this magnitude requires a strong, unified and collaborative approach - capitalizing on the full power of American ingenuity."But to date, our efforts have been piecemeal and disorganized. We do not have the dedicated leadership or the coordinated national strategy needed to accomplish this critical mission. I am encouraged by the bipartisan agreement this Committee has made to support this goal."Universal 5G connectivity would encourage renewed prosperity in both urban and rural communities, unlock tremendous economic growth, and reestablish America as a leader in global innovation."I hope that this hearing will serve as a driving force to help usher in a new era and build momentum towards recapturing our place as the world's leader in communications technology."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6912016 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 1, 2019End of Document

VIEWPOINT: Finding Hope in Hong KongThe Hoya: Georgetown UniversityDecember 5, 2019 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 743 wordsBodyA part of me feels unprepared to read the news every morning for fear of what my city has become. Hong Kong, the place where I lived all 18 years of my life before coming to Washington, D.C., has been the center of anti-government protests for the past six months. Recent stories have only just begun to reveal the extent of the damage incurred at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, which was caught in the crossfire between radical protesters and police last month.This is not the Hong Kong I know.It is difficult to imagine that the campus where I performed my first ballet recital was also the place where 3,989 petrol bombs, 1,339 pieces of explosives and 601 bottles of corrosives were found after a standoff between police and barricaded students. Pro-government and pro-democracy figures have been victims of a string of stabbings, the metro system still closes down early to minimize the risk of vandalism and many citizens do not feel safe enough to go outside. Something needs to change.The protests began July 9 in response to a bill that proposed the allowance of extradition to mainland China; hundreds of thousands of opponents took to the streets for fear that the bill, if passed, would undermine Hong Kong's judicial independence and endanger political dissidents.At the heart of the protests lies a deep-seated conflict between pro-establishment and pro-democratic forces with regards to the "one country, two systems" policy. Agreed to when Britain handed Hong Kong to China in 1997, the policy planned to keep Hong Kong a distinct political, socioeconomic and legal system under a unified China for 50 years. Yet Beijing does not want a democratic Hong Kong, and Hongkongers believe the Chinese government will never allow for genuine political freedom.As clashes between police and protesters become more frequent, violence has become the norm, and there have been no signs of compromise. Even after the bill was withdrawn, protesters claimed it was "too little, too late." Since then, an 18-year-old protester was shot in the chest with a live bullet as crowds fought police, the government has banned protesters from wearing face masks and a man has been set on fire by anti-government protesters. This level of violence is unprecedented.Furthermore, disinformation is quickly polarizing Hongkongers. As rumors circulate on Facebook, WhatsApp and Telegram, it is becoming harder for the general public to know what to believe. Both pro-democratic and pro-establishment camps are using disinformation to wage a psychological war; thus, the damage extends beyond the violence and vandalism. There is fear, confusion and distrust.As I tell my peers that I will be headed back to Hong Kong - a place that isn't the same as when I left - for Christmas, some respond with pity. But Hong Kong is still home. I am proud to be from a city where citizens respond to violence and destruction with peace, restoring the roads brick by brick. Home is where 71.2% of eligible voters turn up to vote in the district council elections - seen as a symbolic referendum on the protest movements - in which pro-democracy parties took nearly 90% of the seats. Home is where people stand in solidarity to defend their freedom.In this home, I find hope. We show up to defend our freedom, but also to defend our home by demanding an end to the violence.The district council election results show deep discontent with Hong Kong's current government. The government has every reason to reflect on its failures and urgently find ways to restore the trust of its people - even if that means starting difficult conversations on political reform. Furthermore, authorities should launch an independent investigation into the conduct of the police force to address grievances against police brutality.However, the protesters also ought to be realistic about their demands and be willing to compromise if they truly believe in a future for Hong Kong. For example, granting blanket amnesty to all those arrested would only serve to undermine the justice system that we Hongkongers so pride ourselves on. Therefore, it is clear that both sides must be willing to return to the negotiating table and make concessions to repair the damage.It has been said that Hongkongers have long had a reputation for resilience, adaptability and pragmatism. Let us live up to that reputation by defending peace when all seems lost.Bakhita Fung is a freshman in the School of Foreign Service.Load-Date: December 6, 2019End of Document

Wall Street opens directionless with Dow Jones setting new highCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 18, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 333 wordsBody       The Dow Jones has renewed historic highs, but the Nasdaq and S&P500; trade on negative ground.                                                U.S. stock markets kicked off the week with slight swings and no definite trend, at a time when investors are awaiting further developments ahead of negotiations for a partial trade agreement between the United States and China. The Dow Jones valued 0.04% to 28,014.79 points, setting a new historic high right at the start of the session. However, wall street's two other most relevant indexes trade slightly. The Nasdaq down 0.31% to 8,513.44 points and the S&P500; yields 0.19% to 3,114.92 points. Global indices, including Europe, have been on the rise of trade optimism. Investors now look forward to further details of negotiations between the U.S. and China. For now, the signs have been mixed and there is no news of concrete advances.According to Bloomberg, on Saturday, U.S. and Chinese negotiators held "constructive discussions" during a telephone conversation to address the main concerns of each side in the first phase of a possible trade agreement.Chinese Deputy Prime Minister and the country's chief negotiator, Liu He, spoke with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. The importance of these discussions increases as december 15 approaches, the date for which more U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods are scheduled. Today the feeling seems to be different. A Chinese government member told CNBC that Beijing was not optimistic about an understanding to seal the first phase of the trade agreement with Washington, as Donald Trump would be too reluctant to budge on fare withdrawal."We are just in a moment of inflection for markets," as the date is approaching so that a decision is made on a new fare round (December 15), said Robert Hormats, vice president of Kissinger Associates, looking at a "disruption" in the markets from mid-December if the partial trade agreement is not closed quickly."Load-Date: February 24, 2020End of Document

Continue reading Escalating sales of electric and premium segment vehicles with demand for advanced torque transmission driving automotive gears marketWithout gears it is nearly impossible to drive any machine or equipment. For rotary as well as linear movement it is necessary to use gears. The global automotive industry has prompted significant innovations in the area of transmission, eventually gears and driveline. The inventions are driven by the relentless quest towards greater fuel economy, lower emissions and improved driving experience. The markets forelectric vehicles,semi-autonomous and autonomous vehiclesandCNG and LPG vehiclesare gaining pace and the concepts are streaming towards scalability. As a consequence, modern powertrains are anticipated and expected to be compatible for each segment, noiseless, ecological, maintain vehicle dynamics, and support active safety as well. The evolution of transmission technology is positively influencing automotive gears market. The modern automotive has witnessed evolution in gearboxes from 3 speed   10 speed, also developments around 11-speed boxes triple clutch transmissions and reversible variable transmissions. Also, the quest towards  automatic driving' technology is also adding impetus to the market. For instance, in 2018, HARMAN International, a subsidiary of Samsung dedicated towards connected technologies for automotive, showcased HARMAN's and Samsung's accumulated approach for establishing a network of associates and solutions to further develop Samsung's DRIVELine, its novel open platform for automated driving solutions. Automotive gears plays a very significant role in order to make a vehicle function appropriately as it transmit force (torque) from one shaft to another. As the global automotive sector is foraying into various types of vehicles as mentioned above, the burgeoning sales of vehicles globally is assisting the globalautomotive gears marketdemand to progress tremendously. The most common types of gears and gear boxes delivered by OEMs in the market are spiral bevel gear, worm gear, and helical gear box. The global motor vehicle production in 2018 was 95.6 million units. The acceptance of novel automotive technologies by consumers is also a factor adding impetus to the market. For example, global electric car fleet surpassed 5.1 million in 2018 with sales almost doubling from the preceding year Similarly, opportunities in the global semi-autonomous and autonomous vehicles market is also estimated to be progressing at a global CAGR of 31.28% during the forecast period of 2019   2025.The global automotive gears market size was evaluated to be $ 31.45 billion in 2018. Since gears are the fundamental constituent of the automotive transmission system, eventually the vehicle, opportunities in the market is estimated to be progressing at a global CAGR of 5.89% during the forecast period of 2019   2025.An analysis of technological developments in modern automotive driveline and transmission systems positively influencing innovations in automotive gears market:Developments in the automotive sector such as transition from front-wheel drive (FWD) to all-wheel drive (AWD) and innovations like E-CVT E-axle (electronically-controlled continuously variable transmission) for enhanced fuel efficiency is adding substantial impetus to innovations in automotive gears market. Instructions and enforcement such as Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by United Nations for enhanced fuel efficiency amalgamated with strict emission regulations by governments across the globe have enforced automotive OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) to implement the hybrid and electric vehicle technology. As a consequence, technological developments in the spectrum of electric and hybrid drivelines, transmissions and gears that includes automatic start-stop, regenerative braking, E-CVT and E-axle are the major driving forces of modern automotive gears market demand. The arrangement of driveline equipment contrasts for a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV), Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV), or Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) as the prime source of power differ from internal combustion engine (fuel combustion) to batteries, hence the market is witnessing rampant developments in terms of variants as well.As  Lightweight' is a pivotal trend conquering automotive production, plastic gears are esteemed to be the future:In terms of vehicle type, electric vehicle is estimated to be the fastest growing segment in global automotive gears market share. This segment is estimated to be progressing at an application CAGR of 6.88% during the forecast period of 2019   2025. The growth in the fleet of electric cars evinces the lead of electric vehicles. The global electric car fleet in 2018 surpassed 5.1 million and sales were recorded to be almost double than 2017. As the entire concept of electric vehicles dwell on curtailing global automotive carbon footprints,  lightweight' is the resort sought by manufacturers to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets. To achieve the objective of reducing body weight, OEMs are replacing traditional metals with engineered plastics in manufacturing of automotive equipment including gears. There are several advantages of plastic gearing that includes, reduced inertia and light weight because of the lower density of plastics, tendency to captivate intense and abrupt vibration due to enhanced elasticity, and noise reduction. For example, Amrut Gear Industries, India, are manufacturing an extensive array of PVC (polyvinyl chloride) plastic gears   nylon gears, PVC and transmission pinion gear shaft. Similarly, Yeh Der Enterprise Co. Ltd., China, manufactures an extensive array of plastic gears and gear that includes spur gear, worm gears, plastic pinion gear, plastic helical gear, and plastic bevel gear. The company also list several advantages of these unconventional gears, such as it less intricate to mold the material into complex shapes, hence it has an enhanced range of configuration. Also, they are economical in terms of manufacturing. The fact that Chin and India, global leaders in automotive sector are dwelling into  plastic' for modern automotive gear equipment, it indicates the well-off application scope of plastic gears in automotive.APAC Dominates Global Automotive Gears Market Size with Powerful Array of Automotive OEMs and Burgeoning EVs Sales:The future of the automotive sector rightfully belongs to its electronic front and any region with substantial uptake of EVs is eventually a volatile market for any automotive equipment including gears. However, EVs are still at nascent stage in some developing economies such as India, where majority of automotive gears market size is dominated by demand from traditional automotive. After an acute analysis of the automotive gear regional markets, APAC is reckoned to be the most lucrative marketplace and had a share of 35.6 % in global market demand in 2018. There is a strong attendance of automotive OEMs in leading APAC countries such as India, China, and Japan. Moreover, the dominance of China is global electric vehicles market extending from cars and buses to heavy commercial vehicles is creating opportunities for automotive gears market demand in APAC.  Moreover, with 5 out of top 10 global car manufacturers are situated in APAC, automotive sector of countries such as India, Indonesia, and Malaysia are growing at an impeccable rate with 7.98%, 10.31%, and 12.18% respectively as of 2018. Similarly, China in 2018 sustained it apex spot in global electric car market with sales recorded to be approximately 1.1 million, and with 2.3 million units, it held the largest stock of electric cars. Electric two/three-wheelers on the road surpassed 300 million by the end of 2018.Government Initiatives in India and China for the adoption of EVs:• Unprecedented Government Funds Allocation-Indian Government in 2019 sanctioned to enact the scheme titled  Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles in India Phase II (FAME India Phase II)' to enhance the trend and trade of electric mobility. Followed by FAME India1 that was launched in 2015 and allocated with central investments worth $128 million, Phase II observed unprecedented funding worth $1.4 billion in 2019.• Tax Exemption on Electric Vehicles:Incentives and tax exemption policies are major catalyst in global EVs market, to promote sales. For instance, in 2016, Chinese government provided strong financial and non-financial incentives to EV adoption such as exemptions from acquisition and excise taxes ranged $ 5,000 to $ 8,500.Talk to one of our sales representative about the full report by providing your details in the link below:https://www.industryarc.com/support.php?id=500990Automotive Gears Market Companies:Some of the market players with majority of the automotive gears market share are Robert Bosch GmbH, GKN plc, Showa Corporation, Bharat Gears Ltd., TRW Automotive Holdings Corp., American Axle & Manufacturing, Inc., Jiangsu Pacific Precision Forging Co.

Squeezing the NetThe SentinelDecember 20, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Omega Printers & Publishers Pvt Ltd, distributed by Contify.com All Rights ReservedLength: 872 wordsBodyIndia may aspire to be 'Digital India' with most government services and welfare schemes available online, but frequent internet shutdowns threaten to defeat this grand objective. And this rising trend hurts business badly; a study by Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) published in August this year showed that the Indian economy took a whopping $3 billion hit due to total 16,315 hours internet shutdowns in the period 2012-17; another study by Brookings Institute put India on top of countries suffering economic losses due to internet shutdowns - as much as $968 million in the year 2016. While internet services remain suspended in the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir just prior to and following the abrogation of Article 370, similar steps were taken as precaution before and after the Ayodhya verdict by Supreme Court in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, and currently due to the amended citizenship law fallout in Assam and parts of other Northeast States, West Bengal and UP. We only need to look around to get an idea of the massive disruption and damage caused. Government documents can be accessed only by trudging to distant offices and queuing up for hours, students cannot register and pay fees online for courses or examinations, ordering goods with online retailers is blocked, stranded passengers cannot avail of online cab services, farmers cannot access mandi prices and other crucial agri-information online, startups and freelancers in small towns and cities are totally hobbled, exporters and transporters cannot generate bills, health and other emergency services are badly hit - the list can go on. The overriding reason for taking such pain is because the law enforcement agencies demand it to preempt security threats. Cyber crooks, hate mongers, child pornographers and murderous stalkers lurking in the dark recesses of the Net are bad enough, but law enforcement agencies primarily complain about the mayhem rabble rousers and terrorists can create online. The Arab Spring would not have broken out like a bushfire in 2011 had not protestors used the Net to coordinate their activities. On the other hand, riots and lynchings have been known to be easily organized over platforms like WhatsApp. Governments across the world, mostly in the Middle East, Africa and Asia, thus have a strong argument to clamp down on internet, which means mass dissent and protest could be put on the same footing as mob violence and threat to public order. However, democratic India became the dubious holder of a world record of sorts in 2018 - her government ordering the largest number of internet shutdowns. According to a study by #KeepItOn coalition and the non-profit Access Now, there were 196 reports of internet shutdowns collated from 25 countries, of which 134 incidents or 67% of the shutdowns were in India.It is ironic that communist-ruled China with its stranglehold over domestic internet, has now pointed to India's record to justify such clampdowns as 'normal practice for sovereign countries'. India may have the world's second largest internet market with 65 crore users, of which 3.2 crore are in Assam and Meghalaya, yet this did not deter the country from shutting down the Net in these two States 'to cope with significant threat to national security' - notes People's Daily, the Chinese government's mouthpiece. Defending the internet shutdown in Xinjiang with its restive Muslim population, the People's Daily commentary has held up India's example to counter adverse reporting in American and European media on China, arguing that the internet 'cannot be independent of national sovereignty' and that a government can legitimately regulate it when 'national interest' is at stake. The world has indeed come far from the early days of internet when tech idealists thought it would create a world without borders, a superhighway which no power can control to the detriment of users. Only last September, it was announced that the 'Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism' - created in 2017 by Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Microsoft under pressure from United States and European Union - will soon become an independent watchdog that will remove extremist content from the Net. India's information technology law is still too rudimentary to effectively deal with the vast range of cyber offences and terrorism, while Parliament is only now coming to grips with a proposed data protection legislation. There are already misgivings that the government is seeking to arm itself with excessive powers to intercept, access and process personal data of citizens without proper safeguards. Such authoritarian tendencies, along with blanket powers of internet clampdown, do not bode well for a democracy. The internet is now indispensable for citizens to access information, and therefore ensuring their freedom of expression; protecting citizens' data privacy is equally vital in terms of rights. This country through proper public debate must find ways and means to go after nasty characters in the Net and neutralize them. Shutting down the Net entirely to cripple businesses and the government's own services is hardly an intelligent response.Load-Date: December 21, 2019End of Document

CRU: Why Would Jingye Group Buy British SteelPR NewswireNovember 18, 2019 Monday 4:00 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 537 wordsDateline: LONDON, Nov. 18, 2019 BodyPR NewswireThe steelmaker Hebei Jingye Group, China's largest privately held rebar producer, has agreed to buy British Steel, subject to regulatory approval. How could a Chinese company benefit from the purchase of this UK steelmaker? We will consider and evaluate the key factors in this decision.Can Scunthorpe fill a production bottleneck?Jingye Group produces a variety of steel across both flat and long products, with a portfolio that spans rebar, plate, hot rolled coil and more. Their production facilities in Nandianzhen are top heavy, with greater finished steel rolling capacity than steelmaking capacity. It is not uncommon for steel mills to be organised in this way, as it allows for production to flex between product types depending on market demand.In theory, billet or slab from Scunthorpe could be shipped to China to then be rerolled into finished products - in practice this is unlikely to be profitable for several reasons. Semi-finished products can be sourced locally at cheaper prices and lower lead times from either the domestic market or South East Asia. Beyond this, Scunthorpe's existing hot end is relatively high cost, and when compounded with freight rates this will probably render this an uncompetitive option.... and what about higher carbon grades of semi-finished steel?Scunthorpe has the capability to produce high carbon grades of semis, potentially offering a product which cannot be sourced locally as easily. The Jingye Group's facilities are located around 300km inland, inflating freight costs but leaving them about as well placed as most of the large Chinese exporters. Moreover, the Chinese government has ordered several steelmakers including Jingye Group to relocate their facilities - potentially closer to the coast - making such a trade route more viable.Would high carbon semis be interesting for Jingye Group? We believe so, as this offers them an entry into a longer-term growth sector of higher value than construction steel.Read the full story:https://www.crugroup.com/knowledge-and-insights/insights/2019/why-would-jingye-group-buy-british-steel/Read more about CRU:http://bit.ly/About_CRUAbout CRUCRU offers unrivalled business intelligence on the global metals, mining and fertilizer industries through market analysis, price assessments, consultancy and events.Since our foundation by Robert Perlman in 1969, we have consistently invested in primary research and robust methodologies, and developed expert teams in key locations worldwide, including in hard-to-reach markets such as China.CRU employs over 280 experts and has more than 11 offices around the world, in Europe, the Americas, China, Asia and Australia - our office in Beijing opened in 2004 and Singapore in 2018.When facing critical business decisions, you can rely on our first-hand knowledge to give you a complete view of a commodity market.

Initiating Position in ActivisionJim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUSNovember 6, 2019 Wednesday 9:24 AM EDTCopyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1313 wordsByline: Jim Cramer and the AAP TeamHighlight: We have been watching this stock with intense focus and, with a lot of reasons to be positive, believe now is the time to buy.BodyAfter you receive this Alert, we will be initiating a position in Activision Blizzard  , purchasing 600 shares at a bid/ask of $55.45/55.86. Following the trade, ATVI (600 shares) will represent 1.15% of the portfolio.While we acknowledge that this is not a Bullpen name, we have been watching this stock with intense focus and believe that a timely buy Alert (as opposed to a Bullpen initiation Alert) is the right move for members. Long-time members will recall that we previously held a position in Activision, however, opted to close out the position for three primary reasons (as laid out in our exit Alert, .)First, the rise of free-to-play games such as PUBG and Fortnite (both of which feature 100-player battle royale mode) have proven more competitive than originally anticipated. Second, competition from larger companies had increased significantly. Third, at the time, we believed the company's next major catalyst, the then pending release of Black Ops 4, could be at risk.So why initiate the name now?To be clear, competition remains as strong as ever, it's simply the nature of being in a high-growth, large TAM industry. However, this industry is also hit-driven and as we enter the holiday season the question becomes, who has the hit? Last year, it was Take-Two  with Red Dead Redemption 2 -- this was the primary concern with our view on the success of Black Ops 4, which in addition to going head to head with what many may consider the most anticipated game in recent memory (Red Dead), also lacked a single-player story mode, leaving some gamers disappointed and further negatively impacting our conviction on the name.However, this time around, we think Activision not only pulled off developing a strong game in its own right (also including the single-player mode sorely missing from Black Ops 4) but also doesn't face the type of competition it did last year, ( i.e., we think Activision is the current leader as we head into the holiday season). That said, no game is perfect and there has been some criticism, notably in terms of map design and the lack of a battle royale mode (the gameplay mode that made Fortnite and PUBG so popular). Still, from what we're hearing, more maps (a whopping 38 according to a ) and a battle royale mode are on their way in the form of software updates and downloadable content. Additionally, while critics are paid to sniff out the bad, one thing that is undeniable is that at over $600 million in sales in the first three days (announcement ), Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is the most successful Call of Duty of the current console generation (it's also the "biggest Call of Duty PC launch ever"). Moreover, as the "biggest selling digital opening in Activision history," this is likely one of, if not the most profitable games in the company's history. Seeing as the launch occurred in the fourth quarter, we'll be looking for this to positively impact fourth-quarter guidance.OK, so the new Call of Duty appears to be a hit, so what? Free-to-play is still an incredibly competitive business model, who doesn't like free? Well, on this front, Activision also hit the nail on the head with Call of Duty Mobile, the company's free-to-play mobile game, equipped with the all-important battle royale modem (and of course in-game purchases). As this was also a fourth-quarter release, we expect the strong release to come through in the form of fourth-quarter guidance.So, let's take a look at why we're upbeat on this release. For starters, the ratings app store ratings are phenomenal, scoring a 4.9/5 on the Apple App store () on ~568,000 reviews and hitting number one on the "Action" category charts, while scoring a 4.6/5 on the Google Play store () off of ~4.7 million reviews. Reviews are one thing, actual total downloads are another, and on this front, the numbers may be even more impressive, with the game hitting 100 million downloads in its first week according to SensorTower () -- more than any other mobile game in history, and well above the initial downloads of Fortnite and PUBG (though in fairness, neither of those games had the brand recognition at launch that Call of Duty does).As for international uptake and reviews, members know that the real growth opportunities tend to come internationally. However, while many may suspect China of being the big opportunity, another key region to be aware of is India, with the Indian Express  that "Call of Duty Mobile has surpassed the PUBG Mobile in terms of popularity, as per ranker.com -- the U.S.-based digital media company," adding that "In the new listing, Call of Duty has been crowned as the most popular mobile game, followed by PUBG Mobile."OK, so all looks good in India, which has a population of over 1.3 billion and a rapidly growing middle class, but how about China? This is a bit less clear as the game isn't actually allowed in China (though we suspect this could change in the future as the game was developed with Chinese gaming juggernaut Tencent  -- via subsidiary TiMi Studios, especially when we consider that Screen Rant  that the game has over 13 million pre-registrations in China). That said, thanks to the power of VPNs, which allow users to bypass Chinese government restrictions, AbacusNews is reporting that those in the region that have gotten their hands on the game are giving it high praise, , "The best shooter on mobile. PUBG killer. Tencent's best. That's just some of the lavish praise Chinese gamers are heaping on Call of Duty Mobile."Bottom line, initial reviews both at home and abroad appear to be very positive putting Activision in a strong position to monetize the free-to-play success.Other news? Let's take a look at Blizzcon. In an effort to get this Alert our before the opening bell, we will keep this part short and circle back as we learn more. So, while there was little in terms of unexpected surprises, we believe the official announcements of Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2 (plus additions to the World of Warcraft and Hearthstone franchises) to be key updates providing for a reinvigoration of strong franchises with loyal player bases, especially as we gear up for the second season the Overwatch League which kicks off February 8, 2020.Speaking of the Overwatch league (which added more teams for the upcoming season), as was the case the last time we owned this name, we continue to believe that Activision's investments in eSports has put it at the forefront in terms of league structure. Moreover, we believe this lead can be extended thanks to management's decision to launch a Call of Duty league (January 24, 2020), a smart move, especially when we consider the current strength of the franchise. While eSports may not be in the news to the same extent it was in past quarters, don't let that fool you, the industry continues to grow and, in our view, appears to be as strong as ever.All in all, we have a lot of reasons to be positive -- reasons that, in our view, have not been reflected in the stock as it has largely treaded water in the mid-$50s as all of this news came, sitting at just under $53 when Call of Duty, the event marking the beginning of the positive news outlined above, officially launched --- and believe that we are looking at a crucial inflection point.However, discipline, no matter how strong our conviction, must be maintained. As we are initiating this name ahead of tomorrow's earnings, an event that can be volatile for any name, we will keep our buy relatively small at just over 1% of our total portfolio. Additionally, we are putting in place a price target of $62 per share, representing just under 25x 2020 earnings estimates of $2.51 per share -- a figure we believe will be revised higher, making our target conservative, should we be correct in our view on the success of the Call of Duty franchise and upcoming releases of Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2.Load-Date: November 7, 2019End of Document

That's why even media masters like Tom Rogers are getting involved.  He was the CEO of TiVo before creating CNBC and then bringing both Netflix and Amazon to our screens...Now, he believes the future of the media industry is in gaming.That's why he's bringing his company, WinView Games, together with Frankly Media andTorque Esports (GAME,MLLLD)in a mega-merger that could send ripples throughout the industry. And he's not alone. Over 400 of the smartest angel investors, venture capital firms and accelerators have already joined the race.  Here are three trends everyone needs to know about the esports race:#1 - The Streaming Wars Are Heating UpJust last year, viewers spent over6.6 billion hourswatching their favorite players online. That's whyAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)paid nearly $1 billion to acquire streaming giant Twitch.Amazon's Twitch.tv, as the de facto leader in the space, with over 15 million unique visitors per day, has become so engrained in the industry that new video game consoles even have the platform's streaming functionality built in. It's so popular that it accounts for 1.8 percent of peak internet traffic.EvenMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT)is looking to get into the game with its acquisition of Mixer, another streaming service.  In fact, eager to get new subscribers, Microsoft paid arumored $100 millionto get Fortnite superstar Tyler "Ninja" Blevins on its platform.While Amazon and Microsoft face off, however, another company is quietly operating in the shadows of the streaming boom and positioning itself to fill a key role in the industry.Torque (GAME,MLLLD)has already made a name for itself in the esports world with its involvement in events, development and hardware production, but thanks to its acquisition of Stream Hatchet, it's now a major player in the data analytics game. A necessity to any business looking to take advantage of the streaming trend.Gathering viewer data from platforms like Twitch, YouTube and more, Torque is able to create in-depth reports that help companies improve engagement, and in turn, profits. The best way to make serious inroads in this burgeoning new industry is to know exactly what viewers are doing and why they are doing it, andTorque(GAME,MLLLD)knows exactly how to take advantage of this information.Understanding how players interact with the games helped developers create hits likeTake-Two's (NASDAQ: TTWO) Grand Theft Auto V, which clocks as the third highest selling video game of all time, generating over$6 billion in revenue.Thanks to the data they've collected, they have been able to create entire universes for their player bases, packed with compelling stories and interfaces that truly transport gamers into the world's they've created.#2 -Big In AsiaCurrently South Korea is the place to be for esports in Asia, butChina is quickly gaining momentum.  The Chinese government made headlines earlier this year when they officially recognized the roles of "esports professionals" and "esports operators" as official job titles in the country.Not only that, esports-related majors have been added to many of the country's national colleges. Even entire cities are competing to reel in esports professionals.Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang Province in east China, created a US$280 million, 39.4 million-square-foot, officially designated "esports town" which it hopes will draw in hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue every year. And one Chinese streaming company,Huya (NYSE: HUYA),is on track to propel this new craze into hyperdrive.  As a part of its ambitious and aggressive plan to capture its share of the Asian markets, Huya is looking to partner with some of the top teams in the business, and it's got a massive war chest to help its cause.The streaming giant is already a force to be reckoned with, but it's only going to grow from here. Another major player in the Asian market isTencent Holdings (OTCPK: TCEHY). The Chinese tech giant responsible for WeChat and QQ has not ignored the video game boom.Not only is itssubsidiary Riot Gamesresponsible for one of the world's most played esports, League of Legends, boasting over 89 million players, it has also taken significant stakes in other game developers. Tencent's portfolio includes shares in Activision, Ubisoft, and even a 40 percent stake in Epic Games, producer of Fortnite.#3 - Wheelin' and Dealin'The growth of the esports craze has led to a number of massive deals in the sector. From Amazon's billion-dollar Twitch splurge to Tencent's string of strategic acquisitions, staying ahead of the pack is an expensive - but lucrative - business.  Though Amazon and Tencent might get the most attention in this field, smaller companies likeTorque Esports (GAME,MLLLD)are making major moves, as well.Torque, for its part, has made headlines with itsacquisitionsof Eden Games, a developer whose hit mobile game Gear Club has over 6 million downloads to date, and it's nearly completed deal which will also give it a major stake in Allinsports, a motorsport simulator manufacturer, founded by ex-Formula 1 engineer Anton Stipinovich.Torque's focus on the motorsports niche in esports allowed it to create one of the sector's most popular  racing events: The World's Fastest Gamer. In just the first season of the competitive racing league, with a prize worth $1 million, World's Fastest Gamer became a global hit.It was broadcast in 48 countries through 86 global broadcasters, including ESPN, CNBC and Fox Sports. The show, sponsored by McLaren F1, reached an estimated 400 million households. And it's wheeling and dealing doesn't end there. It's also secured major partnerships with Nintendo and Porsche through its acquisitions.As an industry, video games have surpassed nearly every other form of entertainment. Revenue has tripled since 2000-rising from less than $50 billion tomore than $120 billion per year.Estimates have the industry doubling again,to $300 billion by 2025.By.

Apple is the best Dow stock this year. Will there be an encore in 2020?CNN WireDecember 9, 2019 Monday 6:19 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 692 wordsDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  Apple CEO Tim Cook shocked investors on January 2 by warning of slowing iPhone sales in China. Apple's stock plunged 10% the next day, dragging down the entire market along with it. But it's been all good news for the company ever since. Shares of Apple hit their lowest point of the year -- $142 -- on January 3. The stock now trades at about $270. Apple is up about 70% in 2019, making it the best performing Dow component by a fairly wide margin. Apple rival Microsoft, with a 50% gain, is in second place. (Both companies are now worth well over $1 trillion.)Although iPhone sales have slowed lately, there is growing excitement about the possibility that new models will reignite growth. There have been reports in recent weeks about a 5G iPhone planned for 2020. Analysts have also been discussing the likelihood that premium versions of new iPhones will drop the lightning charging cable and port by 2021. But even if the iPhone 12 (assuming that's what Apple calls it) fails to lead to a massive upgrade cycle, Wall Street is excited about the fact that the company has been able to get existing users to pay for more subscription services, like Apple Music, iCloud, the App Store, Apple TV+ and Apple Pay.Services revenue grew 18% in Apple's most recent quarter, while product sales fell slightly. Revenue from services now account for just under 20% of Apple's total sales.Of course, it would be nice if Apple started to sell more devices again. But some analysts still think the company can continue doing well even if that doesn't happen."Apple will continue to focus their efforts on services and installed base growth," said Citi analyst Jim Suva in a recent report. "Simply put, investor expectations for iPhone segment growth are not high." Last week, Suva boosted his price target to $300 a share, nearly 15% above current levels.Trade war may not hurt AppleStill, what about trade tension between the US and China? After all, Apple's stock plunged in early 2019 because of worries about increased competition from Chinese smartphone rivals such as Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi. Fears of more tariffs have further dimmed the outlook for Apple in China.But Tom Forte, an analyst with D.A. Davidson who likewise has a $300 price target on Apple, isn't concerned. Forte points out that Apple is such an important company to Chinese component manufacturers that it has lots of leverage in trade talks. "Apple has done an amazing job, to date, minimizing the impact of tariffs on its business, which we believe is due to the fact, among others, that it is the only company with the muscle to effectively lobby both the U.S. and Chinese governments because of its influence in both countries," Forte said in a report last week.Not everyone is convinced that Apple's best days are ahead of it. In fact, the stock is a polarizing one for Wall Street analysts. While 26 analysts currently have Apple shares rated as a buy, according to Refinitiv, another 13 are recommending it as a hold while four analysts are calling for investors to sell it. The consensus Wall Street price target on Apple is $261 -- 2% lower than current levels--even though analysts predict that Apple's earnings will grow 10% in 2020 and continue to rise at a 10% clip, on average, for the next five years.More iPhone users switching to Android?One of the biggest Apple bears, Maxim Group analyst Nehal Chokshi, is not convinced that Apple will continue to generate more revenue from services. His fear? Consumers may be ditching iPhones for Androids. Nine percent of iPhone users surveyed this year by Maxim Group said they plan to switch from iPhones to another mobile device. That's up from 5% in a similar survey in 2017.That may not sound like a lot, but Chokshi said it's enough to deflate the bulls' argument that "an iPhone user will continue to be an iPhone user for the foreseeable future, and thus the growing services portfolio...makes for a growing annuity."Chokshi has a sell rating and $190 price target on Apple. That's one of the lowest on Wall Street.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company. All rights reserved.Load-Date: December 10, 2019End of Document

CTA Encouraged by Phase One Deal and Tariff Rollback, Welcomes Further Progress to End TariffsBusiness WireDecember 13, 2019 Friday 6:54 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 395 wordsDateline: ARLINGTON, Va. BodyThe following statement is attributed to Gary Shapiro, president and CEO, Consumer Technology Association (CTA), on the announcement of a "Phase One" trade deal with China and administration's decision to reduce existing tariffs and postpone List 4B tariffs on Chinese imports:"We applaud President Trump for making an initial deal with China that enforces fair trade practices and addresses critical tech priorities including intellectual property (IP) protections and forced technology transfer. It is a significant step toward ending this costly trade war. The partial tariff rollback is also welcome news."We look forward to learning more detail on the tariff removal and urge the White House to make those rollbacks quickly and permanently. Achieving IP and tech transfer concessions is important, and we also encourage the Chinese government to make needed their necessary changes transparently and swiftly."Tariffs are taxes on Americans - not the Chinese. The postponement of the next round of tariffs may temporarily protect American consumers from price increases on today's essential tech devices - including smartphones, laptops and tablets. But it doesn't resolve market uncertainty or return the billions of dollars our nation is already paying in tariffs. Businesses and markets crave certainty and a relief from the volatility caused by the ups and downs of our trade negotiations."Today's news is progress, and we urge Presidents Trump and Xi to continue these negotiations and reach full tariff removal as soon as possible-and that both sides will stop using tariffs as a weapon."According to new data from CTA, compiled and analyzed by The Trade Partnership, the U.S.-China trade war has cost consumer tech companies a total of $17.5 billion, including $1.6 billion in taxes for products critical to 5G deployment.Consumer Technology Association:As North America's largest technology trade association, CTA® is the tech sector.

Chinese 'dumping' cuts mattress prices but hurts US industry; Flood of products came amid an already struggling businessUSA TODAYDecember 12, 2019 ThursdayFIRST EDITIONCopyright 2019 Gannett Company, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: MONEY; Pg. 1BLength: 1284 wordsByline: Nathan Bomey, USA TODAYBodyBought a crazy-cheap mattress in the last few years?You might have purchased one that a bipartisan agency of U.S. trade officials says was "dumped" here by Chinese manufacturers accused of cheating international trade conventions to gain a foothold in American bedrooms.Dozens of Chinese companies flooded the American market with super-low-priced mattresses in recent years, selling them to retailers for as low as $18 in a bid to grab market share quickly, according to trade officials and mattress makers.Consumers purchased the mattresses under such brands as MLily and Linenspa at household national chains, online businesses, local retailers and mattress stores.The dumping has further roiled an industry that has been bedeviled by disruption in recent years, including thousands of job losses, multiple bankruptcies and hundreds of store closures. While overexpansion and American bed-in-a-box companies have been widely blamed for the industry's upheaval, the dumping case suggests that ultra-cheap Chinese mattresses also have played a significant role in undermining American businesses and jobs.In 2018, about 5 million mattresses were shipped to the U.S. by Chinese manufacturers that are now accused of having built their businesses on aggressive price cuts, according to the results of a United States International Trade Commission (USITC) investigation. That number is equivalent to about one-third of total mattress production capacity in the United States.Bed-in-box opens Pandora's boxThe surge by Chinese manufacturers was made possible in part by the mattress industry's shift toward bed-in-a-box-style foam mattresses that can be easily shipped overseas.Many consumers scored amazing deals because of this development. At least 12 importers reported average mattress values of less than $100 from 2016 through 2018, according to the USITC. Experts agree that the quality of the typically entry-level mattresses was fine.Now, the USITC is cracking down, imposing  tariffs on Chinese mattresses of  up to more than 1,700%. That means the price of importing a Chinese mattress that had cost a wholesaler $18 to bring into the U.S. would rise to more than $300, potentially pricing them out of the American market.It also means deals on Chinese mattresses could dry up if the anti-dumping duties have their intended effect."That (tariff figure) gives you some incredible insight into how severe the dumping situation" has been, said Jerry Epperson, a mattress industry veteran and managing director of investment banking and corporate advisory firm Mann, Armistead & Epperson.The average Chinese mattress imported to the U.S. in the first half of 2019 was priced at $153, according to the results of a USITC investigation. That compares to an average of $280 for similar U.S.-made mattresses.The Chinese manufacturers are being unfairly treated, said Eric Emerson, an attorney at Steptoe who represented many of the Chinese mattress companies in the anti-dumping case.The costs of mattress production as "calculated by the U.S. Department of Commerce do not fairly represent the Chinese producers' actual cost of production or their profitability," he said.While the lower cost of manufacturing products in China can account for some of the price difference, the USITC and mattress companies alleged that the Chinese manufacturers should be subject to anti-dumping duties under the Tariff Act of 1930.'Absurdly low' pricesThe "absurdly low" prices enabled the Chinese manufacturers to boost their market share from virtually nothing to double digits within a few years, said Yohai Baisburd, an attorney for Cassidy Levy Kent who filed an international trade petition against the Chinese makers on behalf of several U.S. mattress companies, including Tempur Sealy and Serta Simmons."The Chinese were dumping from the beginning," Baisburd said. "They had a rocket ship of growth fueled by the low prices."During that same time period, U.S. mattress makers suffered as the industry dealt with multiple challenges, including the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of the nation's largest mattress retailer, Mattress Firm, hundreds of store closures and surging competition from upstart bed-in-a-box makers such as Casper.The dumped mattresses were available at a variety of brick-and-mortar retailers, including Walmart, and online sellers such as Amazon and Wayfair, placing them in direct competition with American-made beds, according to industry experts and people familiar with the case.Walmart referred questions to Emerson, and Wayfair did not respond to a request seeking comment. Amazon had no comment by press time.The deals from Chinese mattresses may soon evaporate, and that's bad for consumers, said Emerson, the attorney who represented Chinese companies."As a result of this action, it's going to become increasingly more expensive for U.S. consumers," he said.Not related to Trump's trade warThough the dumping accusations have arisen during the Trump administration's trade war with China, the mattress case is unrelated to that clash. The USITC, which is made up of Republicans and Democrats, voted 4-0 on Nov. 19 to impose the anti-dumping duties on the Chinese manufacturers after determining that U.S. mattress makers were "materially injured by reason of imports of mattresses from China."USITC officials who investigated the mattress market referred a USA TODAY inquiry to the group's public affairs division. Spokesperson Peg O'Laughlin declined to comment for this story or provide panelists for interviews, saying it's the commission's policy not to discuss its investigations publicly.In a publicly released report with heavy redactions, the commission's staff identified several dozen manufacturers as violating international dumping laws in the USITC probe, including companies with variations on the names Zinus, Healthcare, Foshan, Jiashan, Jiaxing and Ningbo.The companies that cooperated with the USITC investigation are now subject to duties from about 57% to 192%, while other manufacturers could be subject to duties of up to 1,731%.As the Chinese manufacturers were allegedly dumping mattresses onto the U.S. market, American manufacturers buckled. U.S. mattress production capacity fell by 7% from 2016 to 2018, while Chinese production capacity soared by 60%, according to the USITC.Of 28 American mattress companies surveyed by the USITC, 16 said cheap Chinese imports undermined their investment plans.Five years of dutiesThe duties imposed on Chinese mattress manufacturers will last for at least five years, which could blunt the flow of cheap mattresses into the U.S.Tempur Sealy CEO Scott Thompson said he believes they'll be "productive" in stemming the tide.If Chinese companies try to get around the duties by shifting production to foreign countries, that could trigger an "anti-circumvention" case involving additional penalties from the USITC, Baisburd said.Officials with two of the market-leading Chinese manufacturers, Healthcare and Zinus, could not be reached for comment.Despite the federal government's crackdown, the Chinese mattress companies may have achieved their mission of securing a permanent place in American bedrooms.In December 2018, Healthcare US Co., a venture of the China-based Healthcare company that makes the MLily mattress brand, announced plans for a $45 million plant in Winnsboro, South Carolina.Fairfield County, where Winnsboro is located, landed a $300,000 Rural Infrastructure Fund grant from the state to "assist with the costs of building renovations.""This is a milestone for our company, and we are excited to support the community we will soon be calling home," Healthcare Co. President James Ni said  at the time. Load-Date: December 12, 2019End of Document

Alibaba and OneConnect take the top two positions in Blockchain Patents list and file IPO prospectuses on the same dayPR NewswireNovember 25, 2019 Monday 10:58 PM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 471 wordsDateline: SHENZHEN, China, Nov. 25, 2019 BodyPR NewswireOn the afternoon of November 18, BlockData released China Blockchain Patents Report 2019 and the Comprehensive Strength list of China's Blockchain Patents 2019. Alibaba ranked first in the list, while OneConnect and China Unicom took second and third place, respectively. In an accompanying ranking by strength of blockchain patents specifically in the fintech field, OneConnect topped the list, followed by Ping An Technology, Hangzhou Fuzamei Technology, Launch Tech, Baidu, Tencent Technology and WeBank. In order to comprehensively demonstrate the strength of all companies having obtained blockchain patents, the list is based on an analysis that takes into consideration five factors: the number of patent applications, the number of patents granted, the scope of patent protection, the location in the patent family and the application for the patent.Just prior to the launch of the list, the top two performers, Alibaba and OneConnect, had issued IPO prospectuses in Hong Kong and the United States and were receiving substantial attention from capital markets.On the evening of November 13, Alibaba submitted a preliminary prospectus that appeared on the website of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK), announcing a plan to issue 500 million new ordinary shares worldwide and list on the main board of the exchange. If Alibaba successfully launches an IPO in Hong Kong, it will be the largest-eversuch transaction in the Hong Kong market. Alibaba will also be the first Chinese Internet company to be listed in both Hong Kong and New York. Based on Alibaba's prospectus, as of June 30, 2019, the company held 6,175 authorized patents and 13,336 publicly filed patent applications in China. Elsewhere, the company held 3,112 authorized patents and 9,742 publicly filed patent applications.On November 13, OneConnect formally applied for an IPO with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to the prospectus, as of the end of September 2019, the company has applied for 2,850 domestic patents and 542 foreign patents. OneConnect topped the list in the accompanying ranking by strength of blockchain patents specifically in the fintech field released by BlockData.

The additional complexity caused by the multiple catastrophic events that have occurred in Japan in recent months, together with the expectation of a relatively high proportion of flood related losses attributable to Typhoon Hagibis, are also likely to lead to increased uncertainty surrounding the estimated net ultimate loss for this event.16:28BDX Becton Dickinson increases quarterly cash dividend to $0.79/share from $0.77/share (253.86 +3.97)16:25PANW Palo Alto Networks beats by $0.02, reports revs in-line with billings above guidance; guides Q2 revs in-line; reaffirms FY20 revs guidance; increases billings slightly, guides down EPS, impacted by announced acquisition of Aporeto for $150 mln (250.28 +3.41)Reports Q1 (Oct) earnings of $1.05 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.03; revenues rose 17.7% year/year to $772 mln vs the $769.34 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Billings increase 18% $897.4 mln vs. $870-890 mln guidanceCo issues guidance for Q2, sees EPS of $1.11-1.13, including Aporeto acquisition cost, may not be comparable to $1.30 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q2 revs of $838-848 mln vs. $844.65 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; billings $985-1.0 bln.Co issues guidance for FY20, lowers EPS to $4.90-5.00 from $5.00-5.10, including Aporeto, may not be comparable to $5.07 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; reaffirms FY20 revs of $3.44-3.48 bln vs. $3.47 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; raises billings to $4.105-4.165 bln from $4.095-4.155 blnCo is acquiring Aporeto Inc., a machine identity-based microsegmentation company for $150 million in cash Aporeto identifies workloads and applies microsegmentation across all infrastructures, helping customers secure their applications at scale.

Remission was defined as a BVAS score of zero and being off glucocorticoid treatment for ANCA vasculitis for at least the preceding four weeks. The pre-specified primary endpoints were remission of acute vasculitis activity at week 26 and sustained remission at week 52, where avacopan therapy was at least statistically non-inferior to the currently used glucocorticoid-containing standard of care (glucocorticoid SOC). The two primary endpoints were tested sequentially using a gatekeeping procedure to preserve the Type I error.BVAS remission at week 26 was achieved in 72.3% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 70.1% of subjects in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (p<0.0001 for non-inferiority). Sustained remission at 52 weeks was observed in 65.7% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 54.9% in the glucocorticoid SOC control group, achieving both non-inferiority and superiority to glucocorticoid standard of care (p=0.0066 for superiority of avacopan). Importantly, subjects who received avacopan experienced additional benefits compared to those in the glucocorticoid SOC control group.The topline safety results revealed an acceptable safety profile in this serious and life-threatening disease, with fewer subjects having serious adverse events (SAEs) in the avacopan group than in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (42% vs. 45%, respectively). Most reported SAEs were related to underlying ANCA vasculitis disease and commensurate with rates in previously published ANCA vasculitis trials. There were fewer subjects with serious infections in the avacopan group than the glucocorticoid SOC control group. A full analysis of the data is underway and expanded results are expected to be announced in the coming weeks.16:08HPE Hewlett Packard Enterprise beats by $0.03, misses on revs; guides Q1 EPS in-line; reaffirms FY20 guidance (17.45 +0.33)Reports Q4 (Oct) earnings of $0.49 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.46; revenues fell 9.2% year/year to $7.21 bln vs the $7.41 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.GAAP gross margins of 33.2%, up 250 basis points from the prior-year period and Non-GAAP of 33.3%, up 260 basis points from the prior-year period.

This most recent DSMB recommendation supports that elafibranor is generally safe and well tolerated in completed and ongoing clinical studies, which is critical for drug candidates that are aimed to treat chronic diseases such as NASH or PBC. Top-line interim results from the Phase 3, RESOLVE-IT trial, based on the primary endpoint of NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis, are expected to be announced in Q1 2020. If positive, GENFIT aims to file a new drug application (NDA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) by the end of 2020. Elafibranor has received fast track designation from the FDA for the treatment of NASH. If approved, elafibranor could be the first approved therapy for resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis.06:09MOMO Momo beats by $0.08, beats on revs; guides Q4 revs above consensus (38.48 )Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $0.69 per share, $0.08 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.61; revenues rose 16.2% year/year to $622.8 mln vs the $604.37 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The company's loss estimate is consistent with industry insured losses of approx. $11 bln and its expected market share of less than 1% for this catastrophe event.Due to the nature of this event, including the complexity of loss assessment and factors contributing to the losses, and the preliminary nature of the information available to prepare this estimate, the actual net ultimate loss for this event may differ materially from this current estimate. The additional complexity caused by the multiple catastrophic events that have occurred in Japan in recent months, together with the expectation of a relatively high proportion of flood related losses attributable to Typhoon Hagibis, are also likely to lead to increased uncertainty surrounding the estimated net ultimate loss for this event.16:28BDX Becton Dickinson increases quarterly cash dividend to $0.79/share from $0.77/share (253.86 +3.97)16:25PANW Palo Alto Networks beats by $0.02, reports revs in-line with billings above guidance; guides Q2 revs in-line; reaffirms FY20 revs guidance; increases billings slightly, guides down EPS, impacted by announced acquisition of Aporeto for $150 mln (250.28 +3.41)Reports Q1 (Oct) earnings of $1.05 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.03; revenues rose 17.7% year/year to $772 mln vs the $769.34 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Billings increase 18% $897.4 mln vs. $870-890 mln guidanceCo issues guidance for Q2, sees EPS of $1.11-1.13, including Aporeto acquisition cost, may not be comparable to $1.30 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q2 revs of $838-848 mln vs. $844.65 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; billings $985-1.0 bln.Co issues guidance for FY20, lowers EPS to $4.90-5.00 from $5.00-5.10, including Aporeto, may not be comparable to $5.07 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; reaffirms FY20 revs of $3.44-3.48 bln vs. $3.47 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; raises billings to $4.105-4.165 bln from $4.095-4.155 blnCo is acquiring Aporeto Inc., a machine identity-based microsegmentation company for $150 million in cash Aporeto identifies workloads and applies microsegmentation across all infrastructures, helping customers secure their applications at scale.

The pre-specified primary endpoints were remission of acute vasculitis activity at week 26 and sustained remission at week 52, where avacopan therapy was at least statistically non-inferior to the currently used glucocorticoid-containing standard of care (glucocorticoid SOC). The two primary endpoints were tested sequentially using a gatekeeping procedure to preserve the Type I error.BVAS remission at week 26 was achieved in 72.3% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 70.1% of subjects in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (p<0.0001 for non-inferiority). Sustained remission at 52 weeks was observed in 65.7% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 54.9% in the glucocorticoid SOC control group, achieving both non-inferiority and superiority to glucocorticoid standard of care (p=0.0066 for superiority of avacopan). Importantly, subjects who received avacopan experienced additional benefits compared to those in the glucocorticoid SOC control group.The topline safety results revealed an acceptable safety profile in this serious and life-threatening disease, with fewer subjects having serious adverse events (SAEs) in the avacopan group than in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (42% vs. 45%, respectively). Most reported SAEs were related to underlying ANCA vasculitis disease and commensurate with rates in previously published ANCA vasculitis trials. There were fewer subjects with serious infections in the avacopan group than the glucocorticoid SOC control group. A full analysis of the data is underway and expanded results are expected to be announced in the coming weeks.16:08HPE Hewlett Packard Enterprise beats by $0.03, misses on revs; guides Q1 EPS in-line; reaffirms FY20 guidance (17.45 +0.33)Reports Q4 (Oct) earnings of $0.49 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.46; revenues fell 9.2% year/year to $7.21 bln vs the $7.41 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.GAAP gross margins of 33.2%, up 250 basis points from the prior-year period and Non-GAAP of 33.3%, up 260 basis points from the prior-year period.

Hong Kong: The cyclical nature of violence and why it must stopDaily Princetonian: Princeton UniversityDecember 8, 2019 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 644 wordsBodyPhoto Credit: Studio Incendo/Wikimedia CommonsLast month in Hong Kong, a policeman fired a close-range shot into a protestor's gut. That same day, protestors set a 57-year-old man on fire after an altercation. Another police officer was suspended from the force after driving a motorbike through a crowd of protestors. In early October, Apple CEO Tim Cook pulled HKmap.live from the App Store after it was reported by mostly state-run media in China that the app was being used by protestors to target individual police.The protests that captured the world began in September 2019 in response to a controversial extradition bill that would have allowed those arrested in Hong Kong to be sent to other countries that did not have formal extradition agreements with Hong Kong. The bill, which would have included China on the list of countries, exacerbated fears that the Chinese government would be able to exercise greater control over the semi-autonomous region, which is supposed to remain largely independent from their rule until 2047 under the "one country, two systems" policy.After three months of protests, that bill was withdrawn in September.Yet the protests continue, arguably putting Hong Kong in an even greater state of unrest than ever before. Protestors are demanding further reforms, largely as a result of actions taken against them. By responding to the initial protests with suppression and violence, the government has only fueled further chaos that has all but obscured the original issue.Since their inception, the Hong Kong protests have only escalated in violence and intensity as the region becomes a focal point of global conversation that has not left Princeton untouched. A pro-China post on the hugely popular Facebook page Tiger Confessions (now defunct) garnered a long comment thread of conflicting views in which students debated the merits of the protests and the government's involvement. Support for the Hong Kong protestors can be found in posters at Frist Student Center, and at least one large sign saying FREE HONG KONG can be seen in a dorm room window.Regardless of one's personal views on the ongoing crisis in Hong Kong, it is imperative that the situation in Hong Kong serves as a warning for future conflict. Violence and vengeance are cyclical. They muddy the central issues at hand and prevent progress from being made. The Hong Kong government should never have responded to initially peaceful protests with police violence, as it only prompted a backlash from the protestors that included similarly unacceptable violence.Hong Kong is far from the only example in which peaceful resolution seems no longer possible. From the Middle East to America, dissatisfaction often boils over into a violence that seems far too sustainable. Many of the issues at hand have decades if not centuries of incredibly complex historical context, a context that is often used as just reason for violent action, both physical and verbal. But we must come to realize that belligerence, no matter how much it is perceived to be justified, cannot be allowed to continue - if it does, the only path for all parties involved is an accumulation of animosity and destruction.Here at Princeton, protests have taken place on subjects such as the University's investment portfolio and the new Woodrow Wilson statue. Protestors and administration alike have and must continue to be civil and open to productive conversation.In an increasingly polarized world, state governments have often been a negative symbol of infighting and suppression. Our leaders must learn to adopt a more moderate and reasonable approach to civil unrest and other issues of the day, and citizens must also follow suit in order for true progress to be made.Richard Ma is a sophomore from Kirksville, Miss.

U.S. may not need to put tariffs on European carsStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeNovember 4, 2019 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 388 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyAssuming that Huawei will be used as a bargaining chip by the U.S.to get more favorable terms from the Chinese in such a deal, a trade agreement could lead to the removal of Huawei from the Entity List."Recall as well, with Entity Lists, you will find a presumption of denial"."We are in good shape, we are making good progress, and there is no natural reason why it could not be", Bloomberg quoted Ross as saying. "For China, removing all the additional tariffs is a core concern that has not changed and will never change; even if there is a first phase deal, this core concern should be reflected", wrote Taoran Notes, a blog affiliated with the state-run Economic Daily.Trump sent his national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, as his special envoy to the summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.One of the industry's main arguments for allowing shipments of non-national security sensitive items is that Huawei can buy some of those components from competitors around the world, including South Korea, Japan and Taiwan.Although Ross did not hint which companies applied for the license, but we expect most of the companies have little to do with smartphone brands.McDonald's Replaces CEO Easterbrook Over 'Violating Corporate Ethics'SAN FRANCISCO - FEBRUARY 09: A sign stands outside of a McDonald's restaurant February 9, 2009 in San Francisco, California. McDonald's policy doesn't allow the CEO to have a relationship with anyone in the company.The US has now granted temporary licences to US companies to trade with Huawei where it is for the objective of "maintain [ing] and support [ing] existing and now fully operational networks and equipment, including software updates and patches"."Right now, there is not a Chinese competitor in the PC operating system space".The value of the affected products accounts for 30% of Thai exports under GSP to the United States and around a "trivial" 0.38% of total Thai exports, Ross said.Huawei fiercely denies that is poses any threat to the United States or that it has any connection to the Chinese government. The company has also held that it does not want to be part of a larger US-China trade deal and would prefer to work out a resolution with US officials directly.Huawei and the Department of Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Load-Date: November 4, 2019End of Document

Do You Guys Not Have Social Credit Score? Blizzard, Blitzchung, and BoycottsTechNews: Illinois Institute of TechnologyNovember 18, 2019 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: LATEST-NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1215 wordsBodyOn Monday, October 7th games publisher Activision-Blizzard banned pro player Blitzchung from the company's "Hearthstone" Esports league for an entire year and fined him the prize money he won from the "Hearthstone" Grandmasters regular-season tournament, roughly $10,000, after he made comments in support of the Hong Kong protests. During a postgame interview after a "Hearthstone" Grandmasters match the day prior, Blitzchung appeared on stream wearing goggles and facemask imitating those worn by many protesters in Hong Kong and said "Liberate Hong Kong! Revolution of our time!"The decision appeared to have come as a result of the company's desire to keep in good faith with the authoritarian Chinese government, who have been wary of any talk in support of the Hong Kong protests both in China and amongst its business partners abroad. Beijing has a stranglehold on access to a market of 1.3 billion people, one which they may restrict access to at any time and which Blizzard is currently seeing billions of dollars of revenue from. When the company saw one of their "Hearthstone" Grandmasters speaking in support of the protests, the company panicked and made a snap decision in order to appease Beijing and keep their business interests in the region in check.The decision was widely unpopular, and sparked an immediate response from not only the "Hearthstone" scene but from much of the gaming scene as a whole once games media began reporting on the situation. The sentence Blitzchung received was notably far harsher than the sentence received by pro "Overwatch" player xQc after he made a series of homophobic slurs and remarks to openly gay player Muma following xQc's defeat during one match. xQc received a one month suspension and $2000 fine. Blizzard also forced "Overwatch" league team Dallas Fuel's coach Jayne to delete a tweet criticizing the harsh punishment onto Blitzchung, further adding fuel to the fire the company now found itself over. Following the criticism, Blizzard President J. Allen Brack issued a statement on the matter. The suspension on Blitzchung was reduced to six months and his prize money would no longer be taken, and the two casters that were on stream with Blitzchung during the interview, who had been fired, would instead also be suspended for six months. "I want to be clear: our relationships in China had no influence on our decision," stated Brack, "If this had been the opposing viewpoint delivered in the same divisive and deliberate way, we would have felt and acted the same." Many were not satisfied by the statement and criticized Blizzard for what they felt was a lackluster response, and following this Blizzard would also go on to ban three college "Hearthstone" players for holding up a Hong Kong protest sign on stream.   On social media, Blizzard would face a firestorm as angry fans and customers would rail against the company. Atop critical remarks, a boycott was organized on social media. Fans would post pictures of themselves uninstalling Blizzard games or cancelling subscriptions to Blizzards "World of Warcraft" online roleplaying game. Many took to Photoshop to try and turn Chinese "Overwatch" hero Mei into a symbol of the protests, drawing her wearing masks, goggles, and outfits representing the Hong Kong protesters. Often she would appear alongside messages or signs supporting the protests. This was done in an effort to try and get the game censored in China. All of this led up to Blizzard's annual convention, "Blizzcon" on November 1st. All eyes were on the company to address the ongoing controversy and the continued suspension of Blitzchung. On the morning of November 1st, the event kicked off with a wave of protests outside the convention center, leading tension to build until Brack finally addressed the crowd during the convention. Unfortunately, the address was not what many had hoped it would be."You know, Blizzard had the opportunity to bring the world together in a tough Hearthstone Esports moment, about a month ago, and we did not," Brack opened, "we moved too quickly in our decision making and then, to make matters worse, we were too slow to talk with all of you. When I think about what I'm most unhappy about is really two things; the first one is we didn't live up to the high standards that we really set for ourselves, and the second is we failed in our purpose; and for that I am sorry, and I accept accountability." Brack went on to say how "we aspire to bring the world together in epic entertainment," saying "I truly believe in the positive power of video games." He finished by saying "we will do better going forward, but our actions are going to matter more than any of these words," and ended with "I hope it's clear how committed we are to everyone's right to express themselves in all kinds of ways and all kinds of places."Despite what was said, the company took no further action to address Blitzchung's sentence or any other controversy. During the course of the address Brack made no mention of Blitzchung, China, Hong Kong, or any other specifics in that regard. In effect it was a hollow, generalized apology intended to take some heat off of themselves. Brack did not address anything directly, keeping the speech deliberately vague. The touted "high standards" he talked of meant nothing, hollow rhetoric to give a verisimilitude to his stated intent. Although the consensus seemed to be that Blizzard had acted too quickly and rashly in Blitzchung's punishment there was little corrective action taken to actually show the company's supposed commitment to free speech. The disparity between Blizzard's actions and Brack's words in this speech reveal that the company has no real desire to stand by its stated values. Instead, it will continue to pledge itself to Beijing's interests in the name of profit.During Blizzcon the company would tease two new games, "Overwatch 2" and "Diablo 4," both massive announcements that generated a lot buzz among fans and news outlets alike. What was revealed for each was minimal. No more than a teaser for games planned for release years from now, barely in the infancy of their development cycle. What rings clear is that the intention of these announcements was not to generate buzz surrounding the games, buzz that clearly would have served better much closer to the release dates. Rather, these announcements were intended to clog media space that would be otherwise spent criticizing Blizzard in its hollow response to the ongoing controversy. And for the most part, their plan worked. There were plenty of articles and clamor on social media about the two games' announcements, as many fans would rather forget the drama of these incidents in favor of becoming hyped for the upcoming releases of their favorite developer. Blizzard has long been one of the most beloved video game developers, second perhaps only to Valve in that regard. Although of recent both have been seeing increased criticism for their actions, and Blizzard is far from the only company to make unfavorable actions on Beijing's behalf.

Based on the closing price of GSBD shares on December 6, 2019, the total consideration paid for MMLC is approximately $1.0 billion, representing an 11% premium to MMLC's September 30, 2019 net asset value.1 The transaction will also result in approximately 5.5% accretion to GSBD's net asset value per share, based on GSBD's and MMLC's net asset values as of September 30, 2019.2 The combined company will continue to trade under the ticker symbol "GSBD" on the New York Stock Exchange.06:52SGEN Seattle Genetics presents updated and long-term follow-up analyses from two clinical trials evaluating ADCETRIS and OPDIVO in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma patients aged 60 years and older and in relapsed or refractory classical HL (117.50 )Phase 2 Study of Frontline Brentuximab Vedotin Plus Nivolumab in Patients with Hodgkin Lymphoma Aged = 60 Years (Abstract #237, oral presentation at 2:30 p.m. ET on Saturday, December 7, 2019) Of 19 response-evaluable patients, 18 patients (95 percent) had an objective response, including 13 patients (68 percent) with a complete response and five patients (26 percent) with a partial response. All response-evaluable patients experienced tumor reduction (complete response + partial response + stable disease) following treatment with ADCETRIS in combination with OPDIVO. Median duration of response was not yet reached and the maximum duration of response was 22 months and ongoing (95% CI: 7.06, -). The most common treatment-related adverse events of any grade occurring in at least 20 percent of patients were fatigue, diarrhea, pyrexia, infusion related reaction, peripheral motor neuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy and increase in lipase. One treatment-related serious adverse event was pyrexia. Fifty-seven percent of patients (12/21) had at least one treatment-related adverse event greater than or equal to Grade 3, most commonly increase in lipase (24 percent, 5/21), peripheral motor neuropathy and peripheral sensory neuropathy (each 14 percent, 3/21), and fatigue and hyponatremia (each 10 percent, 2/21). Two-Year Follow-up Results from the Phase 1-2 Study of Brentuximab Vedotin in Combination with Nivolumab in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (Abstract #238, oral presentation at 2:45 p.m. ET on Saturday, December 7, 2019) Of the 91 treated patients, 85 percent (77/91) had an objective response, including 67 percent (61/91) with a complete response, 16 patients with a partial response and six patients had stable disease. Of the 91 treated patients, 67 patients received an ASCT per trial protocol with no additional salvage therapy. For all treated patients, the two-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 79 percent (95% CI: 68%, 87%). For the 67 patients who received an ASCT per trial protocol, the two-year PFS was 92 percent (95% CI: 80%, 97%). Median follow-up for all treated patients was 24.2 months (range 1.8-41.7) and the median PFS was not reached. Estimated overall survival at two years was 94 percent (95% CI: 85%, 97%) and median overall survival was not yet reached. Peripheral immune signatures were consistent with an activated T-cell response. Prior to ASCT, the most common adverse events of any grade occurring in more than 20 percent of patients were nausea, infusion related reaction, fatigue, diarrhea, pruritus, headache, vomiting and pyrexia. Other adverse events included peripheral neuropathy in 16 patients (18 percent) and neutropenia in six patients (7 percent). Two patients (2 percent) discontinued treatment due to adverse events, Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy and increased gamma-glutamyltransferase. Serious adverse events occurred in 14 patients (15 percent), including pneumonia, pneumonitis and pyrexia (two patients each); and Grade 3 Guillain-Barre syndrome (one patient).06:52GILD Gilead Sciences reports Long-term data from ZUMA-1 demonstrating about half of refractory large b-cell lymphoma patients were alive three years after Yescarta treatment (67.08 )Co announced new data from the ZUMA-1 trial of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) in adult patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma. These results included updated overall survival data from the pivotal phase 2 study after three years following a single infusion of Yescarta, as well as an analysis from a separate safety management cohort of patients receiving early steroid intervention for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events. Updated results from a separate ZUMA-1 safety management study (Cohort 4) were also presented at the meeting (Abstract #243). In this analysis, patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma treated with Yescarta received earlier steroid intervention, beginning when patients experienced Grade 1 neurologic events or experienced Grade 1 CRS with no improvement after three days of supportive care. Patients could receive optional bridging chemotherapy prior to Yescarta infusion. In the analysis, 41 patients had received Yescarta, with a median follow-up of 8.7 months; 73 percent of patients received corticosteroids and 76 percent received tocilizumab. Earlier steroid use appeared to decrease the percentage of patients with Grade =3 CRS (2 percent) and neurologic events (17 percent), each of which were numerically lower than rates in the registrational cohorts of ZUMA-1 (13 percent CRS, 31 percent neurologic events). There were no Grade 4 or 5 CRS or neurologic events and no Grade 5 AEs related to Yescarta in Cohort 4. Objective response rate per investigator assessment was 73 percent in Cohort 4, with 51 percent of patients achieving a complete response. The median duration of response was 8.9 months. Fifty-four percent of patients in this cohort remained in an ongoing response with at least six months of follow-up after Yescarta infusion. Median OS in Cohort 4 has not been reached.06:51CRTX Cortexyme reports new data revealing link between bacterial pathogen and genetic risk for Alzheimer's Disease (28.31 )Co announced the presentation of new data supporting the on-target activity of COR388, its lead investigational medicine, and linking the "gingipain hypothesis" for Alzheimer's disease (AD) to the significance of the APOE gene as a major risk factor for the disease.Gingipains from P. gingivalis cleave ApoE proteins and have a preference for cleaving ApoE4; and COR388, a gingipain inhibitor, prevents this. In in vitro experiments, cells infected with P. gingivalis exhibited gingipain-dependent ApoE cleavage activity that generated ApoE fragments similar to what was seen in the brains and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, uninfected cells had no significant ApoE protein-cleaving activity. Furthermore, P. gingivalis gingipains cleaved ApoE4 more readily than ApoE3. Finally, in the infected cells, COR388 alone was sufficient to block ApoE fragmentation. In a Phase 1b trial, COR388 reduced ApoE fragments in CSF. Cortexyme's Phase 1 clinical development program for COR388 included cohorts of healthy volunteers and subjects with Alzheimer's disease. In addition to assessing safety and initial clinical activity, investigators also assessed the level of ApoE fragmentation in the CSF of nine subjects with Alzheimer's disease. Six subjects received 50mg of COR388 twice daily while three subjects received placebo. After 28 days, a statistically significant decrease in ApoE fragments (both ApoE4 and ApoE3) was observed in subjects treated with COR388 versus those treated with placebo.06:51EGRX Eagle Pharma commences dosing in pilot study for novel estrogen receptor antagonist product candidate (56.43 )Co announces that the Company has commenced dosing in a pilot clinical study to assess the unique characteristics of its fulvestrant product candidate, which has the potential to enhance estrogen receptor ("ER") inhibition and improve patient outcomes. The results of the pilot study will inform the design of the Company's pivotal trial, which Eagle expects to commence in 2020.06:51BLUE Bluebirdbio presents new data from ongoing Phase 1/2 HGB-206 study of investigational LentiGlobin gene therapy for sickle cell disease (79.42 )HGB-206 is an ongoing, Phase 1/2 open-label study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LentiGlobin gene therapy for SCD that includes three treatment cohorts: Groups A, B and C. All results are as of the data cutoff date of August 26, 2019.Groups A and B:As of the data cutoff date, seven out of nine total patients in Groups A and B (five out of seven in Group A and two out of two in Group B) did not require regular RBC transfusions post-treatment. Overall, patients in Groups A and B experienced a reduction, but not complete elimination of VOC and ACS events at two years post-treatment, suggesting that the levels of gene therapy-derived hemoglobin may have been sufficient to reduce but not eliminate continued sickle-related disease manifestations. Group C As of the data cutoff date, 17 patients were treated with LentiGlobin for SCD in Group C, with the longest follow-up at 21 months; none required regular RBC transfusions post-treatment. In patients with six or more months of follow-up (n=12), median levels of gene therapy-derived anti-sickling hemoglobin, HbAT87Q, were at least 40% of total hemoglobin. Total hemoglobin and HbAT87Q levels ranged from 9.3 -- 15.2 g/dL and 2.7 -- 9.0 g/dL, respectively, at last visit. Treatment with LentiGlobin for SCD reduced key markers of hemolysis, including reticulocyte counts, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and total bilirubin concentration, which suggests that treatment is improving biological markers of the disease. Among the nine patients with at least six months of follow-up who had four or more VOC or ACS events in the two years prior to treatment, there was a 99% reduction in annualized rate of VOC and ACS. There were no reports of ACS or serious VOC at up to 21 months post-treatment in these patients. As previously reported, there was one non-serious Grade 2 VOC was observed in a patient approximately 3.5 months post-LentiGlobin for SCD treatment.HGB-206 Exploratory Assays bluebird bio presented results from exploratory assays in samples from a subset of patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD from Groups A, B and C, to assess the relationship between drug product characteristics and RBC physiology. To demonstrate the pancellular expression of the gene therapy derived anti-sickling Hb, HbAT87Q, bluebird bio developed an assay that enables detection of HbAT87Q and HbS protein in individual RBCs. In 12 patients who had at least six months of follow-up, the proportion of RBCs positive for HbAT87Q at the last study visit was more than 70% in all cases; with more than 90% of RBCs positive for HbAT87Q in four patients.On average, HbAT87Q present in RBCs of patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD was within the range of non-sickling adult Hb, HbA, present in the RBCs from people with sickle cell trait. The RBCs also resembled sickle cell trait RBCs with regard to propensity to sickle under low oxygen conditions. Sickling of RBCs from patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD was significantly less than that seen in untreated patients with SCD.06:49MNK Mallinckrodt plc presents data on a novel predictive model to identify infants at risk for infantile spasms (3.41 )Co announced findings on the use of a novel predictive model designed to more quickly identify infants with infantile spasms (IS), a rare seizure disorder that typically occurs between three and seven months of age. Key FindingsDeductive models developed to identify the combinations of variables that predict IS prior to diagnosis and during the treatment pathway: 557 patients had =2 symptoms pertaining to IS -- seizures, developmental delay, lack of eye contact and lack of muscle tone -- and a moderate or high severity ED visit.In this group, 55 percent of patients (n=304) had an IS diagnosis within a median 0.8 months of the triggering event. The most notable deductive combinations focused on pre-diagnosis of IS. MethodsThe study utilized data from the Symphony Health Integrated Dataverse database to identify triggers for early identification of IS patients from medical and pharmacy claims from 10.8 million patients under 2 years of age between May 2017 and April 2018. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) procedure codes were evaluated to identify the codes most likely to predict a subsequent diagnosis of IS. Researchers also used input from IS medical experts to determine the clinical, electrographic, radiologic, procedural and medication variables that may predict IS development.06:48SGMO Sangamo Therapeutics announces preliminary results from first three patients treated in Phase 1/2 THALES study evaluating investigational ST-400 ex vivo gene-edited cell therapy in transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (11.66 )The three patients treated with ST-400 experienced prompt hematopoietic reconstitution, demonstrating neutrophil engraftment in 14-22 days and platelet engraftment in 22-35 days (Table 1). No emerging clonal hematopoiesis has to date been observed by on-target indel pattern monitoring in the three treated patients. Reported adverse events (AEs) are consistent with the known toxicities of mobilization, apheresis, and myeloablative busulfan conditioning. One serious adverse event (SAE) related to ST-400 was reported. As previously disclosed, Patient 1 experienced hypersensitivity during ST-400 infusion considered by the investigator to be likely related to the product cryoprotectant excipient, DMSO, and which resolved by the end of the infusion.06:47LITE Lumentum to offer $850 mln aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2026 (72.08 )Lumentum intends to use approximately $196 million of the net proceeds of the offering to repay in full all amounts outstanding under its term loan credit facility, and a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to purchase up to approximately $200 million of its common stock concurrently with the pricing of this offering in privately negotiated transactions effected through the initial purchaser of the notes or its affiliates as its agent. Lumentum intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, working capital and potential acquisitions.06:47GWPH GW Pharma presents presents new data for EPIDIOLEX (101.05 )Co presented new data from a Phase 3 clinical trial of EPIDIOLEX (cannabidiol or CBD) oral solution, CV in tuberous sclerosis complex at the American Epilepsy Society (AES) Annual Meeting.The study found that patients treated with EPIDIOLEX 25 mg/kg/day or 50 mg/kg/day experienced a significantly greater reduction in TSC-associated seizures (49% for 25 mg/kg/day and 48% for 50 mg/kg/day) compared to placebo (27%; p=0.0009 and p=0.0018, respectively). New secondary endpoint data, presented for the first time at AES, showed that more patients on EPIDIOLEX experienced a 50% or greater reduction in seizures (36% for 25 mg/kg/day and 40% for 50 mg/kg/day) compared to placebo (22%; p=0.0692 and p=0.0245, respectively). Additionally, 48% of patients taking either dose of EPIDIOLEX in the study experienced a greater reduction in total seizure frequency compared to placebo (27%; p=0.0013 and p=0.0018, respectively). Caregivers and patients also reported overall improvement with EPIDIOLEX in 69% of patients on 25 mg/kg/day and 62% of patients on 50 mg/kg/day compared to 39% on placebo (p=0.0074 and p=0.0580, respectively). Additional analysis showed that patients taking EPIDIOLEX in the study experienced a greater reduction in composite focal seizures (52% for 25 mg/kg/day and 50% for 50 mg/kg/day) compared to placebo (32%; p=0.0076 and p=0.0116, respectively).06:47ARQL ArQule to be acquired by Merck (MRK) for $20 per share in cash for an approximate total equity value of $2.7 billion (9.67 )Cos have entered into a definitive agreement under which Merck, through a subsidiary, will acquire ArQule for $20 per share in cash for an approximate total equity value of $2.7 billion.

New data from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings showed 76% (16/21) of DS mice treated with STK-001 were seizure free compared to 48% (10/21) that were treated with a placebo. An 80% reduction in the average number of spontaneous seizures (3 seizures vs 16 seizures) was also observed among treated DS mice compared to placebo. The data showed improvements among mice treated with STK-001 compared to placebo, including: Significant increases in Scn1a mRNA and Nav1.1 protein expression in the brain at day 90; Significant improvements in survival among DS mice treated at postnatal day 2 or postnatal day 14 compared to placebo;97% (33/34) mice survived to day 90 after treatment on postnatal day 2, compared to 23% (14/62) mice in the placebo-treated group (p<0.0001).85% (45/53) mice survived to day 90 after treatment at postnatal day 14, compared to 64% (47/74) mice in the placebo-treated group (p<0.005). An increase in the number of DS mice that experienced no seizures following administration of STK-001 at postnatal day 2, as measured by EEG. Between postnatal day 22 and postnatal day 46, 76% (16/21) of DS mice treated with STK-001 were seizure free compared to 48% (10/21) in the placebo-treated group; An 80% reduction in the average number of spontaneous seizures (3 seizures vs 16 seizures) detected between postnatal day 22 and postnatal day 46 in DS mice after treatment with STK-001 compared to placebo (p<0.05).06:44BMY Bristol-Myers/Pfizer (PFE) present results from retrospective real-world data analyses reporting outcomes on the safety and effectiveness of Eliquis (58.95 )The Bristol-Myers Squibb-Pfizer Alliance today announced results from retrospective real-world data analyses reporting outcomes on the safety and effectiveness of Eliquis (apixaban) compared to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or warfarin for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with active cancer (n=14,086). The real-world data analyses were highlighted during oral presentations at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in Orlando, Florida.Results from the primary analysis showed that Eliquis use was associated with lower rates of major bleeding (MB) (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.47-0.86, p=0.003), clinically-relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding (HR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.70-0.94, p=0.006) and recurrent VTE (HR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.47-0.81, p=0.001) compared to LMWH. Eliquis was also associated with a lower rate of recurrent VTE (HR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.52-0.90, p=0.007) and similar rates of major bleeding (HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.53-1.0, p=0.051) and CRNM bleeding (HR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.77-1.04, p=0.145) compared to warfarin. Outcomes were defined based on diagnosis codes and setting of care.06:43APTO Aptose Biosciences reports early clinical observations with CG-806 and APTO-253 (2.56 )Key findings from dose levels 1 and 2 of CG-806 in heavily pretreated R/R CLL patients:CG-806's safety profile remains clean; no unexpected toxicities have been observed to date Notably, no myelosuppression, no drug-related adverse events or dose-limiting toxicityEarly evidence of clinical response has already been observed in a R/R CLL patient at dose level 2 Robust increase in peripheral blood lymphocytes (lymphocytosis)Evidence of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) target engagement Lymphocytosis, which is known as an indicator of BTK inhibition Inhibition of Phospho-BTK, Phospho-SYK and Phospho-ERK have been observed with a plasma inhibitory assay using plasma from the CLL patient on dose level 2Meaningful oral absorption and predictable pharmacokinetic (PK) profile06:43MGTA Magenta Therapeutics presents new results from MGTA-145 stem cell mobilization program at ASH (13.29 )These results, which were presented by John DiPersio, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Medicine and Chief of the Oncology Division, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, showed that MGTA-145 in combination with plerixafor met all the endpoints in the study, and safely mobilized a large number of high-quality stem cells in a single day. The cells were then shown to engraft in a humanized mouse model.06:41ABBV AbbVie presents long-term data from post-hoc analysis, further supporting sustained clinical benefit of fixed duration treatment with VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO (venetoclax) in combination with rituximab in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (86.98 )The updated data from the Phase 3 MURANO trial four-year analysis (median follow-up of 48 months with all patients off VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO treatment for a median of 22 months) showed that patients with R/R CLL who completed the chemotherapy-free, two-year fixed duration course of VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO treatment combination maintained progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Patients who completed treatment with the VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO combination also achieved higher rates of minimal residual disease (MRD)-negativity and complete remissions compared to those treated with a standard of care, bendamustine plus rituximab (BR).06:41EPZM Epizyme reports updated Phase 2 data for Tazemetostat; on track for NDA submission this month (18.22 )The data show that treatment with tazemetostat demonstrated meaningful clinical activity as assessed by both investigators and an Independent Review Committee (IRC), and was generally well tolerated in both FL patients with EZH2 activating mutations (n=45) and FL patients with wild-type EZH2 (n=54). The IRC assessment was conducted for inclusion in Epizyme's planned NDA submission to the FDA in December 2019. As assessed by the IRC, as of an August 9, 2019 data cutoff date, tazemetostat treatment resulted in: Objective response rate (ORR) of 69% for patients with an EZH2 mutation and 35% for patients with wild-type EZH2 Median duration of response of 11 months for patients with an EZH2 mutation and 13 months for patients with wild-type EZH2 Median progression-free survival of 14 months for patients with an EZH2 mutation and 11 months for patients with wild-type EZH2 Overall survival has not yet been reached for either FL patient population.06:40KPTI Karyopharm Therapeutics presents four posters relating to XPOVIO at ASH (16.29 )The four posters include: updated data from the Kyprolis (carfilzomib) arm of the Phase 1b/2 STOMP study evaluating selinexor in combination with backbone therapies in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma; new data from the Revlimid (lenalidomide) plus selinexor arm of the STOMP study evaluating this combination in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma; encore data highlighting the previously disclosed comparison of patients in the STORM study, Karyopharm's Phase 2b study evaluating XPOVIO in patients with heavily pretreated, triple class refractory multiple myeloma, to matched patients from the MAMMOTH study; and new Phase 1/2 data evaluating eltanexor in patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)."Efficacy data from our ongoing STOMP study investigating selinexor in combination with standard of care anti-myeloma agents continue to demonstrate a strong rationale for selinexor's potential expanded role in the future multiple myeloma treatment paradigm," said Sharon Shacham, PhD, MBA, Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer of Karyopharm. "The Kyprolis arm of the STOMP study continues to show clear signs of clinical activity, including a complete response rate of 21%, in patients with heavily pretreated Kyprolis-nave multiple myeloma. Additionally, preliminary data from the Revlimid arm of the Phase 1b/2 STOMP study show early but encouraging clinical activity, including in one patient who achieved a complete response, in patients with multiple myeloma in the front-line setting. And finally, we are pleased to be presenting new data from the eltanexor program showing impressive early activity, including a high rate of complete responses in elderly patients with higher-risk MDS."06:39IPHA Innate Pharma presents new, long-term data from pivotal Phase III trial of Lumoxiti; data expands on efficacy results and affirms manageable safety profile (6.20 )The final analysis showed that 36 percent (29/80) of the relapsed or refractory hairy cell leukemia patients achieved durable complete response (CR) with Lumoxiti at Day 181 of patients' respective evaluation, compared to the primary analysis in which 30 percent durable CR rate was reported. In addition, there was a 61 percent probability that patients who achieved a CR would maintain it after five years.06:38AGIO Agios Pharma announces that clinical proof-of-concept has been established based on preliminary analysis of Phase 2 trial of mitapivat in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (40.94 )The Phase 2 study has enrolled 12 of the intended 17 patients (nine with -thalassemia and three with a-thalassemia). As of the November 14, 2019 data cutoff date, eight patients, all with -thalassemia, were evaluable for the primary endpoint of a hemoglobin increase of =1.0 g/dL from baseline in at least one assessment during Weeks 4-12. All eight patients were treated with 50 mg of mitapivat twice daily for the first six weeks and escalated to 100 mg twice daily, and all patients remain on treatment (range 12.4-34.3 weeks). Seven of eight efficacy evaluable patients achieved a hemoglobin increase of =1.0 g/dL, and for responders the mean hemoglobin increase from baseline was 1.76 g/dL (range, 0.9--3.3 g/dL) during Weeks 4-12. The majority of adverse events were Grade 1 or 2 and consistent with previously published Phase 2 data for mitapivat in patients with pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency. Updated results from the Phase 2 thalassemia study will be presented at a medical meeting in the first half of 2020.06:38PRNB Principia Biopharma reports positive data of PRN1008 for Immune Thrombocytopenia in ongoing Phase 1/2 Trial (37.39 )Co announced consistent positive data from an ongoing Phase 1/2 trial of its investigational treatment, PRN1008, in 31 highly treatment-resistant and refractory patients (median of six prior therapies) with immune thrombocytopenia.Of the 31 patients, 39 percent (80 percent confidence interval (CI) 28, 50), irrespective of dose and duration of treatment, achieved the trial's primary endpoint of =2 consecutive platelet counts of =50,000/L, separated by at least five days, and increased by =20,000/L from baseline, without requiring rescue medication. In addition, 45 percent (80 percent CI 34, 57) of enrolled patients achieved any two platelet counts =50,000/L. Most patients who achieved the primary endpoint had a platelet count >30,000/L by the first week of treatment. Preliminary data on 13 patients treated at higher doses (300mg and 400mg twice daily) and who had completed at least 12 weeks of therapy, demonstrated a response rate of 54 percent (80 percent CI 37, 70) and 62 percent (80 percent CI 44, 77) for both endpoints respectively. To date PRN1008 has been well-tolerated at all doses studied, whether given as a monotherapy or with allowed concomitant ITP therapy (thrombopoietin and steroids), with no reported treatment related bleeding or thrombotic events. Related treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 35 percent of patients and were all grade 1 or 2.06:37ZIOP ZIOPHARM presents pre-clinical data of Rapid Personalized Manufacture (5.16 )Data were presented today in the poster presentation "Rapid Personalized Manufacture (RPM) of Sleeping Beauty System-generated NY-ESO-1-specific TCR-T Cells Co-Expressing Membrane-bound IL-15 Yields Antitumor Responses" and demonstrated:T cells can be genetically modified with the Sleeping Beauty system to express TCR and mbIL15T cells expressing TCR and mbIL15 exhibited superior anti-tumor effects compared with TCR-modified T cells without mbIL15T cells expressing TCR and mbIL15 are infused the day after gene transfer per RPMLow-dose of T cells genetically modified per RPM to express TCR and mbIL15 exhibit anti-tumor effectsT cells expressing TCR and mbIL15 persist in mouse model06:36TGTX TG Therapeutics presents triple therapy data from Phase I/II study of ublituximab in combination with umbralisib and venetoclax in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (7.12 )Title: A Phase 1/2 Study of Umbralisib, Ublituximab and Venetoclax in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)Overall response rate (ORR) of 87% (20/23) after U2 induction period at cycle 3, prior to introduction of venetoclax, in relapsed/refractory CLL patients, including patients refractory to ibrutinibU2 induction appeared to reduce venetoclax TLS risk, with no patients remaining as TLS high-risk following 3 cycles of U213 patients treated for >7 cycles and 9 patients for > 12 cycles: 100% ORR (13/13) after cycle 7 for the triple combination 100% ORR (9/9) including 44% Complete Response (CR) after cycle 12 for the combination100% (9/9) of patients had undetectable minimal residual disease (MRD) (<0.01%) in peripheral blood after 12 cycles of therapy; and78% (7/9) of patients who completed 12 cycles of therapy had undetectable MRD in bone marrow and have stopped therapy No patients (n = 27) have progressed to date with a median follow-up of 6.4 monthsTriple combination was generally well tolerated with no events of TLS observed06:36TAK Takeda Pharma presents Phase 3 TOURMALINE-AL1 results (20.26 )Co announced that results of the TOURMALINE-AL1 trial. Key findings, to be presented by Dr. Angela Dispenzieri, include: The first of two primary endpoints was not met in TOURMALINE-AL1. Hematologic responses were seen in 53% versus 51% of patients receiving NINLARO plus dexamethasone versus physician's choice (odds ratio 1.10 [95% CI 0.60-2.01], p=0.762).Complete response (CR) rate was 26% in the NINLARO plus dexamethasone arm versus 18% in the physician's choice arm. The second primary endpoint, two-year vital organ deterioration or death, was not mature at the time of analysis.Safety data includes: Drug-related adverse events (AE) were experienced by 82% of patients receiving NINLARO plus dexamethasone compared to 81% of patients receiving physician's choice. Serious adverse events (SAE) were experienced by 47% of patients in the NINLARO plus dexamethasone arm compared to 33% in the physician's choice arm.06:34BPMC Blueprint Medicines announces initial data from Phase 2 PIONEER clinical trial of avapritinib in patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis (78.48 )Initial data from the dose-finding Part 1 of the PIONEER trial showed rapid and robust reductions in serum tryptase, a well-established measure of mast cell burden, in patients treated with 25 mg, 50 mg or 100 mg of avapritinib once daily (QD). All dose levels of avapritinib tested were well-tolerated, and no patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse event (AE).Blueprint Medicines plans to report additional data from Part 1 of the PIONEER trial that will inform the selection of a recommended Part 2 dose (RP2D), including the change in patient-reported disease symptoms as measured by the Indolent SM Symptom Assessment Form (ISM-SAF), in the first quarter of 2020. The registration-enabling Part 2 of the PIONEER trial is anticipated to initiate patient screening in the first half of 2020.06:34REGN Regeneron Pharma announces initial clinical data for REGN5458 in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma (372.26 )Results were presented today at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting from the first two dose groups (3 mg and 6 mg weekly doses). Patients had a median of seven lines of prior systemic therapy, and all had failed CD38 antibody treatment. Responses were observed in 4 of 7 (57%) patients, including 3 of 4 (75%) in the 6 mg dose group. In the 6 mg dose group, 2 patients (50%) were also minimal residual disease (MRD) negative, meaning that no cancer cells were detectable in their bone marrow.As of data cutoff, there have been no neurotoxicity, dose-limiting toxicities or treatment discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs). The most common treatment-emergent AEs were lymphopenia (n=5), anemia (n=4) and thrombocytopenia and cytokine release syndrome (n=3 each).

The results from the pharmacokinetic and occupancy studies for the first seven patients have been in-line with expectations. The Company anticipates that a dose that achieves maximum target occupancy will be achieved in the next one or two dose cohorts. CPI-818 has been shown to bind covalently to ITK at low nanomolar concentrations without reacting with other kinases. In vitro studies demonstrated selective cytotoxicity to Sezary cells (malignant cells from patients with CTCL), while sparing normal T-cells, in three subjects not enrolled in the study. Preclinical murine models of lymphoproliferative and autoimmune disease showed CPI-818 inhibited the development of lymph node and spleen enlargement by preventing proliferation of abnormal T-cells. Treatment with CPI-818 led to regression of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly in animals with established disease.06:32CGC Canopy Growth names David Klein CEO effective January 14 (18.65 )In his current role as executive vice president and chief financial officer at Constellation Brands, David oversees all aspects of the company's finance operations, all mergers and acquisitions, as well as the company's information technology function.The appointment of David Klein follows a thorough recruitment process overseen by a special Hiring Committee of the Board using global recruitment company Heidrick & Struggles, which saw a wide variety of exceptional candidates vetted and interviewed.

Fourteen patients were evaluable at one month.AUTO3 was well-tolerated, with no patients experiencing = Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with primary infusion and 1 of 14 experiencing Grade 3 neurotoxicity that resolved swiftly with steroids. There were no pembrolizumab immune-related toxicities and the majority of grade 3 or higher adverse events were hematological. Low levels of serum cytokines are consistent with the observed low levels of CRS and neurotoxicity. Across all tested doses 5 patients achieved a complete response, with 4 of 5 complete responses ongoing, the longest at 18 months. All CRs were achieved without need for steroid or tocilizumab-based management of the patients or ICU level care.AUTO3 -- (Poster) - Phase 1/2 AMELIA clinical trial of AUTO3 in patients with relapsed/refractory pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pALL) (Abstract # 2620)AUTO3 was well-tolerated overall, with no patients experiencing = Grade 3 CRS and no patients experiencing = Grade 2 neurotoxicity, in doses =3x106 /kg CAR-T cells. No AUTO3-related deaths were reported.Among the 10 CAR T-nave patients, at a median follow-up time of 9.7 months (range 1.8- 18), 9 of 10 patients (90%) achieved a complete response, and 8 of 10 (80%) achieved complete molecular remission by PCR. Estimated overall survival at 12 months was 100%. There are 2 ongoing patients in complete molecular remission at 12 and 15 months post-AUTO3 infusion, respectively. The most common cause of relapse was due to loss of CAR T-cell persistence. The median persistence of CAR-T cells in blood was 170 days.06:29STOK Stoke Therapeutics presents new preclinical data on STK-001 for the treatment of Dravet syndrome (28.98 )Data from studies in non-human primates (NHP) showed STK-001 distributed throughout the brain and achieved target engagement and increased Nav1.1 protein expression throughout the cortex after a single intrathecal injection. Safety findings showed STK-001 to be well-tolerated at the two intrathecal dose levels studied. These data were presented in a poster session at the American Epilepsy Society (AES) Annual Meeting in Baltimore.Stoke plans to submit an investigational new drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in early 2020 and, subject to acceptance of the IND, plans to initiate a Phase 1/2 single-ascending dose study in children and adolescents with Dravet syndrome in the first half of 2020.06:28FATE Fate Therapeutics presents new in vivo preclinical data for FT596 -- company plans to initiate enrollment of first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in rarly 2020 (13.67 )FT596 is the first cellular immunotherapy engineered with three active anti-tumor components to be cleared for clinical investigation by the FDA. In addition to a proprietary CAR targeting CD19, FT596 expresses a novel high-affinity, non-cleavable CD16 (hnCD16) Fc receptor that has been modified to augment antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, enabling coincident targeting of CD19 and additional tumor-associated antigens such as CD20. FT596 also expresses an interleukin-15 receptor fusion (IL-15RF), a potent cytokine complex that promotes survival, proliferation and trans-activation of NK cells and CD8 T cells without the need for systemic cytokine support. Together, these features of FT596 are intended to maximize potency and minimize toxicity in treated patients. The Company plans to initiate enrollment of a first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in early 2020.New preclinical data presented at ASH showed that FT596 administered as a monotherapy exhibited durable tumor clearance and extended survival in vivo similar to primary CAR T cells in a humanized mouse model of CD19+ lymphoma. Additionally, when combined with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab, FT596 showed enhanced killing of CD20+ lymphoma cells in vivo as compared to rituximab alone. These data confirm previously presented in vitro findings that demonstrate the unique multi-antigen targeting functionality of FT596, and the product candidate's potential to effectively overcome CD19 antigen escape.The Company also announced that, in preparation for Phase 1 initiation, it had recently completed GMP production of FT596. In a single small-scale manufacturing campaign, the Company produced over 300 cryopreserved, infusion-ready doses of FT596 at a cost of approximately $2,500 per dose. The Company's iPSC product platform unites stem cell biology and precision genetic engineering to create renewable master engineered iPSC lines that can be repeatedly used to mass produce cancer-fighting immune cells, replacing the high production costs, weeks of manufacturing time, and complex manufacturing processes required for current-generation CAR T-cell immunotherapies with a lower-cost, easier-to-manufacture, well-characterized, off-the-shelf product that has the potential to reach many more patients.06:27SGMO Sangamo Therapeutics and Pfizer (PFE) report updated Phase 1/2 results showing sustained increased Factor VIII activity through 44 weeks (11.66 )Sangamo Therapeutics (SGMO) and Pfizer (PFE) announced updated follow-up results from the Phase 1/2 Alta study evaluating investigational SB-525 gene therapy in patients with severe hemophilia A. The data showed that SB-525 was generally well tolerated and demonstrated sustained increased Factor VIII (FVIII) levels following treatment with SB-525 through to 44 weeks, the extent of follow-up for the longest treated patient in the 3e13 vg/kg dose cohort.06:27KURA Kura Oncology provides clinical and regulatory updates for lead drug candidate, tipifarnib, in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (15.61 )In June 2019, Kura reported that the primary efficacy endpoint was achieved in each of the expansion cohorts in its Phase 2 trial of tipifarnib in relapsed or refractory PTCL: 1) patients with AITL, an aggressive form of T-cell lymphoma often characterized by high levels of CXCL12 expression, and 2) patients with PTCL who lack a single nucleotide variation in the 3'-untranslated region of the CXCL12 gene. Given the high level of activity observed among AITL patients, Kura continued to enroll patients to acquire more experience regarding safety and tolerability in this population. Based upon the 2016 revision of the World Health Organization classification of lymphoid neoplasms1, AITL and AITL-like histologies represent approximately one-third of all PTCL cases.As of the November 11, 2019 data cutoff date, a total of 26 patients with relapsed or refractory AITL were enrolled in all stages of the trial. Among the 20 patients evaluable for efficacy, five achieved a complete response (CR) and five achieved a partial response (PR), for an objective response rate (ORR) of 50% on an evaluable basis and 38% on an intent-to-treat basis. In addition, three patients experienced disease stabilization. Patients had a median of three prior regimens (range 1-7).Next-generation sequencing of 19 available patient biopsies showed that 10 (53%) carried C336R/Q386E variants in the killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) 3DL2, an immune checkpoint receptor. Four of the 10 patients with KIR3DL2 variants achieved a CR and three achieved a PR, for a CR rate of 40% and an ORR of 70%. This compares to a CR rate of 11% and an ORR of 22% among the nine AITL patients with KIR3DL2 wild type.Regulatory Update: Following FDA feedback from an end-of-Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting, Kura plans to initiate a Phase 2 registration-directed trial of tipifarnib in patients with relapsed or refractory AITL and related lymphomas in 2020. The multi-center, single-arm trial will target enrollment of 128 patients with AITL and AITL-like histologies who are relapsed or refractory to at least one prior systemic cytotoxic therapy.06:26PTLA Portola Pharma presents new interim results from ongoing Phase 2a study of cerdulatinib in patients with specific subtypes of T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (29.21 )As of the November 12, 2019 cut-off date, 64 PTCL patients and 40 CTCL patients treated with cerdulatinib as a single agent were evaluable for response. The overall response rate (ORR) was 34% in the PTCL cohort and 43% in the CTCL cohort. Among the subset of patients in the PTCL cohort with AITL, the ORR was 52% and the complete response rate (CR) was 37%.Among the 64 patients in the PTCL cohort, 14 patients (22%) achieved a CR and eight patients (12%) achieved a partial response (PR). In the subgroup of 27 patients with AITL, 10 patients (37%) achieved a CR, and four patients (15%) achieved a PR. The median duration of response is eight months for all PTCL patients and is greater than nine months in AITL patients. Follow-up is ongoing. Among the 40 patients in the CTCL cohort, three patients (8%) achieved a CR and 14 patients (35%) achieved a PR. Importantly, rapid improvements in pruritus, or severe itching -- a common and often serious condition associated with CTCL -- have been observed, as measured by the Likert scale.Cerdulatinib demonstrated good tolerability in both PTCL and CTCL. The most common Grade 3 or greater adverse events across the PTCL and CTCL cohorts with a frequency > 5% were lipase increase (25%), amylase increase (19%), neutropenia (12%), anemia (10%), diarrhea (8%), sepsis/bacteremia (6%), and febrile neutropenia (4%). The lipase and amylase changes were generally asymptomatic and not associated with pancreatitis.06:25XENE Xenon Pharmaceuticals provides updates on partnered neurology pipeline programs (13.95 )Xenon Pharmaceuticals announced that it will provide updates on its partnered epilepsy programs at the American Epilepsy Society Annual Meeting.Overview of clinical stage XEN901 and Related Patient Survey to be Presented in the "Genetic Epilepsies -- Updates in the Science and Diagnosis" on December 8thPre-clinical work suggests selective sodium channel inhibitors that reduce action potential firing in excitatory neurons, while sparing inhibitory interneurons, may provide promising drug profile06:25IMV IMV presents updated results from SPiReL at ASH (2.83 )The poster, which included additional data collected between the abstract submission and the presentation, continued to demonstrate a favorable therapeutic profile and treatment-associated clinical benefit in r/r DLBCL patients who received the DPX-Survivac combination regimen.06:24QURE uniQure presents updated clinical data on three patients treated in ongoing Phase IIb study of etranacogene dezaparvovec; additionally presents up to 4 years of follow-up data on the 10 patients in the Phase I/II trial of AMT-060 (66.05 )At Least One Year of Stable, Therapeutic Levels of FIX Activity in Patients Treated with Etranacogene Dezaparvovec: Featured in a poster presentation at ASH, the 52 weeks of follow-up data show that all three patients have stabilized and sustained FIX activity at therapeutic levels after the one-time administration of etranacogene dezaparvovec. Mean FIX activity for the three patients at 52 weeks after administration was 41% of normal, with the first patient achieving FIX activity of 50% of normal, the second patient achieving FIX activity of 31% of normal and the third patient achieving FIX activity of 41% of normal. The second and third patients had previously screen-failed and were excluded from another gene therapy study due to pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to a different AAV vector. Reported FIX activity was measured using an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay performed at a central laboratory.At one year after dosing, no patient in the study has reported any bleeding events. All patients have remained free of prophylaxis after receiving etranacogene dezaparvovec. One patient, who had earlier in the study undergone hip surgery due to a pre-existing condition, experienced back pain and treated himself with a single infusion of factor replacement, which was later determined by the patient and the investigator to be unrelated to a bleed. No other FIX infusions were reported by any patient.Stable FIX Expression and Durable Reductions in Bleeding and FIX Consumption for up to 4 Years Following AMT-060 Gene Therapy:In the ongoing Phase I/II study of AMT-060, all 10 patients continue to show long-term clinical benefit, including sustained increases in FIX activity, reduced usage of FIX replacement therapy, and decreased bleeding frequency. At up to 4 years of follow-up, AMT-060 continues to be well-tolerated, with no new serious adverse events and no development of inhibitors since the last reported data.All five patients in the second dose cohort of 2x1013 gc/kg (the dose being studied in the ongoing Phase III HOPE-B study of etranacogene dezaparvovec) continue to be free of routine FIX replacement therapy at 3.5 years after treatment. Based on the six months of data collected during the fourth year of follow-up, the mean annualized bleeding rate was zero compared to an average of 4 bleeds during the year prior to treatment, representing a 100% reduction. During this same period, the usage of FIX replacement therapy also declined 100% compared to the year prior to treatment. Mean FIX activity over 3.5 years was 7.5%.06:22FATE Fate Therapeutics reports clinical data from Landmark Phase 1 studies; No dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients (13.67 )Fate Therapeutics announced initial clinical data for its FT516 and FT500 off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived natural killer (NK) cell product candidates.No morphologic evidence of leukemia and complete neutrophil recovery observed in first patient treated with FT516 Monotherapy for AML following first dosing cycleNo dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients treated with FT500 for advanced solid tumorsFavorable FT500 Phase 1 Safety, Tolerability and Immunogenicity profile validates novel multi-dose treatment paradigm for off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived NK cell products.06:22BMY Bristol-Myers presents data from multiple studies evaluating lisocabtagene maraleucel at ASH (59.95 )These studies included an evaluation of liso-cel in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) (TRANSCEND CLL 004); a study in second-line patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients who were ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) (PILOT); and a separate analysis of patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma who received liso-cel in the outpatient setting across three studies."The results in relapsed or refractory CLL and SLL demonstrated a high rate of durable complete responses achieved in heavily pre-treated patients, including patients who have failed ibrutinib and venetoclax. We are encouraged by the potential of liso-cel to treat second-line relapsed or refractory large B-cell NHL patients who are not able to undergo a stem cell transplant. Finally, the analysis evaluating liso-cel administered in the outpatient setting demonstrates that not all patients require hospitalization and that the safety and efficacy profile across a variety of types of clinical sites is consistent."06:20LLY Eli Lilly presents interim clinical data from the LOXO-305 global Phase 1/2 BRUIN dose escalation trial (119.64 )At all doses studied, LOXO-305 delivered objective responses in patients who had received diverse prior therapies and had exhibited varied molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance.Of 16 CLL patients enrolled, there were 10 responders (8 partial responses, 2 partial response with ongoing lymphocytosis) among 13 patients eligible for response assessment, resulting in a 77% ORR. All patients with CLL have demonstrated tumor reduction, with evidence of deepening response over time. Responses were observed in patients with acquired resistance to prior BTK therapy (those with and without C481S mutations), in patients who were intolerant to prior BTK therapy, and in patients with acquired resistance to prior BCL2 therapy (including one with a known BCL G101V mutation). As expected, LOXO-305 treatment causes acute lymphocytosis, which resolves over time-a well described pharmacodynamic response associated with effective BTK inhibition. Of the three CLL patients not yet eligible for response assessment (one with the BTK C481S mutation), all three have demonstrated lymphocytosis early in cycle 1. All CLL responding patients remain in response and all CLL patients remain on study. Of eight MCL patients enrolled, there were three responses (1 complete response, 2 partial responses) among six patients eligible for response assessment, resulting in a 50% ORR. Two of the responders had progressed on prior BTK therapy (but without a documented C481x mutation). All MCL responding patients remain in response and on study. Three MCL patients discontinued therapy in cycle 1 due to progressive disease.Most treatment-emergent adverse events were Grade 1 in severity with the most commonly reported events, regardless of attribution, being fatigue (25% total: 21% Grade 1, 4% Grade 2) and diarrhea (18% total: 14% Grade 1, 4% Grade 2). Two adverse events =Grade 3 were attributed to LOXO-305 (Grade 3 leukocytosis and Grade 3 transient neutropenia). No dose limiting toxicities were reported and an MTD had not been reached.06:19AZN AstraZeneca reports full results from Phase III ELEVATE TN trial (47.68 )AstraZeneca presented results from the interim analysis of the Phase III ELEVATE TN trial, showing that CALQUENCE (acalabrutinib) combined with obinutuzumab or as monotherapy significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab, a standard chemo-immunotherapy treatment, in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemiaIn an exploratory analysis, CALQUENCE in combination or alone demonstrated consistent PFS improvements across most pre-specified subgroups of patients with high-risk disease characteristics, including the unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable gene (IGHV), del(11q) and complex karyotype. Overall, the safety and tolerability profile of CALQUENCE observed in the ELEVATE TN trial was consistent with its known profile.06:19BGNE BeiGene presents clinical data from three trials of its BTK inhibitor BRUKINSA at ASH (186.92 )In two oral presentations of BRUKINSA in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), the drug candidate demonstrated consistent safety and a high overall response rate (ORR); in the poster presentation of BRUKINSA combined with BeiGene's investigational anti-PD-1 antibody tislelizumab in patients with previously treated B-cell malignancies, the combination treatment showed preliminary efficacy and was generally well tolerated."The results presented today on BRUKINSA, a BTK inhibitor designed to maximize target occupancy and minimize off-target binding, demonstrated robust clinical activity and a safety profile consistent with what we've observed to date in our clinical trials, including safety data that supported the recent U.S. FDA accelerated approval in patients with previously treated mantle cell lymphoma," said Jane Huang, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, hematology at BeiGene. "CLL or SLL is the most common type of leukemia in adults, and despite the advancements of BTK inhibitor therapy for these cancers, there remains a need for highly selective BTK inhibitors capable of promoting long-term responses, and with a safety profile that is tolerable over time. The results presented here today further demonstrate the potential for BRUKINSA to help people living with these persistent, life-threatening cancers."06:18RCKT Rocket Pharmaceuticals presents 'encouraging' preliminary results from its Phase 1 trial of commercial-grade RP-L102 'Process B' for Fanconi Anemia (22.37 )Results presented in the poster highlight preliminary Phase 1 data from two pediatric patients (age 5 and 6 years) who were treated with "Process B" RP-L102 prior to the development of severe bone marrow failure and are in ongoing follow-up. Drug product was successfully manufactured using "Process B" optimization, including transduction enhancers, commercial-grade vector and modified cell processing. "Process B" drug product is manufactured to commercial grade standards, allowing for consistent drug product across patients and a vector copy number (VCN) two to three fold higher than that administered to optimally-treated "Process A" patients.Once transduced, drug product was infused fresh into patients without any prior conditioning regimen. To evaluate transduction efficiency, an analysis of the proportion of the MMC-resistant colony forming cells (CFC's) was conducted. Both patients exhibited early signs of engraftment based on peripheral blood, VCN and/or MMC-resistance. Preliminary phenotypic correction was also apparent in both patients, as evidenced by stabilization or increases in blood cell lineages. No safety or tolerability issues have been reported.06:18ABBV AbbVie reports new results from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE clinical trial showing the potential of this fixed-duration combination therapy (86.98 )AbbVie announced new data from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE (PCYC-1142) clinical trial,1 evaluating IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) in combination with VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO (venetoclax) in previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Results showed that patients who received up to 12 cycles of the combination regimen achieved high rates of undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD) in both peripheral blood (PB; 75 percent of patients) and in bone marrow (BM; 72 percent of patients). Safety data were consistent with the known safety profiles of IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO used as individual therapies.Results showed uMRD -- defined as less than 1 CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes (MRD<0.01 percent) by flow cytometry of PB or BM samples -- was achieved at any time after baseline in PB for 75 percent of patients (122 of 163 patients) and in BM for 72 percent (111 of 155 patients). The proportion of patients who had uMRD in PB increased over time from 57 percent after 6 cycles, 68 percent after 9 cycles, and 73 percent after 12 cycles of IMBRUVICA plus VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO. The high rates of uMRD in BM were consistent across high-risk subgroups, including in patients with del(17p), del(17p) or TP53 mutation, del(11q), complex karyotype, and unmutated IGHV status. In patients with uMRD in PB with matched BM samples, 93 percent of patients had uMRD in both PB and BM. With median follow-up of 14.7 months, 3 patients (2 percent) experienced disease progression.06:17OBSV ObsEva reports positive Phase 3 trial results from PRIMROSE 2 trial of linzagolix for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids (4.57 )The responder rate was 93.9% (p < 0.001) for women receiving 200 mg with ABT and 56.7% for women receiving 100 mg without ABT (p < 0.001), compared to 29.4% in the placebo group. Both doses achieved significant rates of amenorrhea (p < 0.001), reduction in pain (p < 0.001), and improvement in quality of life (p < 0.001). Additionally, significant improvement (p < 0.001) in hemoglobin levels, a reduction in number of days of bleeding and reduction in uterine volume were observed. Furthermore, a significant reduction in fibroid volume was also observed for the 200 mg dose with ABT (p < 0.008).The overall safety profile was in line with expectations and confirmed that linzagolix was well-tolerated. The most frequently observed adverse events (occurring in > 5% of patients) were headache, hot flushes, and anemia. Mean percentage change from baseline in BMD was consistent with previous clinical data."We look forward to the results from our second pivotal study, PRIMROSE 1 conducted in the US, in Q2 2020. Assuming positive results, we expect that it would lead to a Marketing Authorization Application submission with the European Medicines Agency by year-end 2020 and a New Drug Application submission with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by Q1 2021."06:16THOR Synthorx to be acquired by Sanofi (SNY) for $68/share in cash (25.03 )Under the terms of the merger agreement, Sanofi will commence a cash tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Synthorx common stock for $68 per share in cash for a total enterprise value of approximately $2.35 billion.

While the DOJ and SEC conduct separate investigations, the same facts have been shared by Ericsson with both authorities. The resolution relates to historical FCPA breaches ending Q1 2017. While the Company had a compliance program and a supporting control framework, they were not adequately implemented. Specifically, certain employees in some markets, some of whom were executives in those markets, acted in bad faith and knowingly failed to implement sufficient controls. They were able to enter into transactions for illegitimate purposes and, together with people under their influence, used sophisticated schemes in order to hide their wrongdoing.Separately, Ericsson agreed to resolve civil charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) relating to allegations of violations of the bribery and accounting provisions of the FCPA. Ericsson agreed to the entry of a judgment enjoining it from future violations of the FCPA and it agreed to pay a financial sanction of $458,380,000, plus pre-judgment interest of $81,540,000.As part of the settlement, Ericsson has agreed to engage an independent compliance monitor for a period of three years while the Company continues to undertake significant reforms to strengthen its Ethics & Compliance program.The combined payment of $1.06 b.

This may just be the calm before the storm considering all the macro-related events set to take place as the week unfolds. S&P Futures saw a relative quiet beginning with only a nine point overnight range. The market is currently trading around the 3144 area, with a high of 3148.50 and a low of 3139.50. In Asia, both China and Japan finished the day marginally higher. The Shanghai struggled to gain much following lighter than expected export data that saw a 1.1% fall in November, compared to a forecast of +0.8%.The Nikkei traded around in a narrow range that culminated with a gain of 0.3%. Heavyweights such as Softbank and Sony both gained more that 1% by day's end. European markets slightly under water. The weaker than expected Export data out of China has likely kept the EU markets in check.

AL002 is a monoclonal antibody intended to enhance the activity of TREM2 and is being developed by Alector for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in collaboration with its partner AbbVie (ABBV). The data were presented today at the 12th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) meeting. The AL002 presentation at CTAD showcases the first data in humans showing that a TREM2 activating antibody engages its target and demonstrates downstream activity in the CNS. The data reported today are from the study's SAD phase in 56 healthy adults, who were enrolled into nine escalating dose cohorts. AL002 was found to be generally safe and well-tolerated. AL002 reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) soluble TREM2 in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating proof-of-target engagement in the brain. AL002 elevated a biomarker for microglia activity in the CSF, indicating proof-of-mechanism. The Phase 1b portion of the study in Alzheimer's disease patients is on-going.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD16:19WTRE Watford Holdings agrees to purchase Axeria IARD; terms not disclosed (26.47 +0.25)Axeria IARD is a property and casualty insurance company based in France.

The median follow-up duration for all subjects was 11.3 months.Overall, the safety results were consistent with those observed in the phase 1 CRB-401 study, which evaluated the preliminary safety and efficacy of ide-cel. Instances of grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in 5.5% (7/128) of patients, including one fatal CRS event. Investigator identified grade 3 or higher neurotoxicity events (iiNT) occurred in 3.1% (4/128) of patients and there were no Grade 4 iiNT events reported. Grade 3 or higher CRS and iiNT events were reported in <6% of subjects at each target dose.

The most common treatment-related adverse events of any grade occurring in at least 20 percent of patients were fatigue, diarrhea, pyrexia, infusion related reaction, peripheral motor neuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy and increase in lipase. One treatment-related serious adverse event was pyrexia. Fifty-seven percent of patients (12/21) had at least one treatment-related adverse event greater than or equal to Grade 3, most commonly increase in lipase (24 percent, 5/21), peripheral motor neuropathy and peripheral sensory neuropathy (each 14 percent, 3/21), and fatigue and hyponatremia (each 10 percent, 2/21). Two-Year Follow-up Results from the Phase 1-2 Study of Brentuximab Vedotin in Combination with Nivolumab in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (Abstract #238, oral presentation at 2:45 p.m. ET on Saturday, December 7, 2019) Of the 91 treated patients, 85 percent (77/91) had an objective response, including 67 percent (61/91) with a complete response, 16 patients with a partial response and six patients had stable disease. Of the 91 treated patients, 67 patients received an ASCT per trial protocol with no additional salvage therapy. For all treated patients, the two-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 79 percent (95% CI: 68%, 87%). For the 67 patients who received an ASCT per trial protocol, the two-year PFS was 92 percent (95% CI: 80%, 97%). Median follow-up for all treated patients was 24.2 months (range 1.8-41.7) and the median PFS was not reached. Estimated overall survival at two years was 94 percent (95% CI: 85%, 97%) and median overall survival was not yet reached. Peripheral immune signatures were consistent with an activated T-cell response. Prior to ASCT, the most common adverse events of any grade occurring in more than 20 percent of patients were nausea, infusion related reaction, fatigue, diarrhea, pruritus, headache, vomiting and pyrexia. Other adverse events included peripheral neuropathy in 16 patients (18 percent) and neutropenia in six patients (7 percent). Two patients (2 percent) discontinued treatment due to adverse events, Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy and increased gamma-glutamyltransferase. Serious adverse events occurred in 14 patients (15 percent), including pneumonia, pneumonitis and pyrexia (two patients each); and Grade 3 Guillain-Barre syndrome (one patient).06:52GILD Gilead Sciences reports Long-term data from ZUMA-1 demonstrating about half of refractory large b-cell lymphoma patients were alive three years after Yescarta treatment (67.08 )Co announced new data from the ZUMA-1 trial of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) in adult patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma. These results included updated overall survival data from the pivotal phase 2 study after three years following a single infusion of Yescarta, as well as an analysis from a separate safety management cohort of patients receiving early steroid intervention for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events. Updated results from a separate ZUMA-1 safety management study (Cohort 4) were also presented at the meeting (Abstract #243). In this analysis, patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma treated with Yescarta received earlier steroid intervention, beginning when patients experienced Grade 1 neurologic events or experienced Grade 1 CRS with no improvement after three days of supportive care. Patients could receive optional bridging chemotherapy prior to Yescarta infusion. In the analysis, 41 patients had received Yescarta, with a median follow-up of 8.7 months; 73 percent of patients received corticosteroids and 76 percent received tocilizumab. Earlier steroid use appeared to decrease the percentage of patients with Grade =3 CRS (2 percent) and neurologic events (17 percent), each of which were numerically lower than rates in the registrational cohorts of ZUMA-1 (13 percent CRS, 31 percent neurologic events). There were no Grade 4 or 5 CRS or neurologic events and no Grade 5 AEs related to Yescarta in Cohort 4. Objective response rate per investigator assessment was 73 percent in Cohort 4, with 51 percent of patients achieving a complete response. The median duration of response was 8.9 months. Fifty-four percent of patients in this cohort remained in an ongoing response with at least six months of follow-up after Yescarta infusion. Median OS in Cohort 4 has not been reached.06:51CRTX Cortexyme reports new data revealing link between bacterial pathogen and genetic risk for Alzheimer's Disease (28.31 )Co announced the presentation of new data supporting the on-target activity of COR388, its lead investigational medicine, and linking the "gingipain hypothesis" for Alzheimer's disease (AD) to the significance of the APOE gene as a major risk factor for the disease.Gingipains from P. gingivalis cleave ApoE proteins and have a preference for cleaving ApoE4; and COR388, a gingipain inhibitor, prevents this. In in vitro experiments, cells infected with P. gingivalis exhibited gingipain-dependent ApoE cleavage activity that generated ApoE fragments similar to what was seen in the brains and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, uninfected cells had no significant ApoE protein-cleaving activity. Furthermore, P. gingivalis gingipains cleaved ApoE4 more readily than ApoE3. Finally, in the infected cells, COR388 alone was sufficient to block ApoE fragmentation. In a Phase 1b trial, COR388 reduced ApoE fragments in CSF. Cortexyme's Phase 1 clinical development program for COR388 included cohorts of healthy volunteers and subjects with Alzheimer's disease. In addition to assessing safety and initial clinical activity, investigators also assessed the level of ApoE fragmentation in the CSF of nine subjects with Alzheimer's disease. Six subjects received 50mg of COR388 twice daily while three subjects received placebo. After 28 days, a statistically significant decrease in ApoE fragments (both ApoE4 and ApoE3) was observed in subjects treated with COR388 versus those treated with placebo.06:51EGRX Eagle Pharma commences dosing in pilot study for novel estrogen receptor antagonist product candidate (56.43 )Co announces that the Company has commenced dosing in a pilot clinical study to assess the unique characteristics of its fulvestrant product candidate, which has the potential to enhance estrogen receptor ("ER") inhibition and improve patient outcomes. The results of the pilot study will inform the design of the Company's pivotal trial, which Eagle expects to commence in 2020.06:51BLUE Bluebirdbio presents new data from ongoing Phase 1/2 HGB-206 study of investigational LentiGlobin gene therapy for sickle cell disease (79.42 )HGB-206 is an ongoing, Phase 1/2 open-label study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LentiGlobin gene therapy for SCD that includes three treatment cohorts: Groups A, B and C. All results are as of the data cutoff date of August 26, 2019.Groups A and B:As of the data cutoff date, seven out of nine total patients in Groups A and B (five out of seven in Group A and two out of two in Group B) did not require regular RBC transfusions post-treatment. Overall, patients in Groups A and B experienced a reduction, but not complete elimination of VOC and ACS events at two years post-treatment, suggesting that the levels of gene therapy-derived hemoglobin may have been sufficient to reduce but not eliminate continued sickle-related disease manifestations. Group C As of the data cutoff date, 17 patients were treated with LentiGlobin for SCD in Group C, with the longest follow-up at 21 months; none required regular RBC transfusions post-treatment. In patients with six or more months of follow-up (n=12), median levels of gene therapy-derived anti-sickling hemoglobin, HbAT87Q, were at least 40% of total hemoglobin. Total hemoglobin and HbAT87Q levels ranged from 9.3 -- 15.2 g/dL and 2.7 -- 9.0 g/dL, respectively, at last visit. Treatment with LentiGlobin for SCD reduced key markers of hemolysis, including reticulocyte counts, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and total bilirubin concentration, which suggests that treatment is improving biological markers of the disease. Among the nine patients with at least six months of follow-up who had four or more VOC or ACS events in the two years prior to treatment, there was a 99% reduction in annualized rate of VOC and ACS. There were no reports of ACS or serious VOC at up to 21 months post-treatment in these patients. As previously reported, there was one non-serious Grade 2 VOC was observed in a patient approximately 3.5 months post-LentiGlobin for SCD treatment.HGB-206 Exploratory Assays bluebird bio presented results from exploratory assays in samples from a subset of patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD from Groups A, B and C, to assess the relationship between drug product characteristics and RBC physiology. To demonstrate the pancellular expression of the gene therapy derived anti-sickling Hb, HbAT87Q, bluebird bio developed an assay that enables detection of HbAT87Q and HbS protein in individual RBCs. In 12 patients who had at least six months of follow-up, the proportion of RBCs positive for HbAT87Q at the last study visit was more than 70% in all cases; with more than 90% of RBCs positive for HbAT87Q in four patients.On average, HbAT87Q present in RBCs of patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD was within the range of non-sickling adult Hb, HbA, present in the RBCs from people with sickle cell trait. The RBCs also resembled sickle cell trait RBCs with regard to propensity to sickle under low oxygen conditions. Sickling of RBCs from patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD was significantly less than that seen in untreated patients with SCD.06:49MNK Mallinckrodt plc presents data on a novel predictive model to identify infants at risk for infantile spasms (3.41 )Co announced findings on the use of a novel predictive model designed to more quickly identify infants with infantile spasms (IS), a rare seizure disorder that typically occurs between three and seven months of age. Key FindingsDeductive models developed to identify the combinations of variables that predict IS prior to diagnosis and during the treatment pathway: 557 patients had =2 symptoms pertaining to IS -- seizures, developmental delay, lack of eye contact and lack of muscle tone -- and a moderate or high severity ED visit.In this group, 55 percent of patients (n=304) had an IS diagnosis within a median 0.8 months of the triggering event. The most notable deductive combinations focused on pre-diagnosis of IS. MethodsThe study utilized data from the Symphony Health Integrated Dataverse database to identify triggers for early identification of IS patients from medical and pharmacy claims from 10.8 million patients under 2 years of age between May 2017 and April 2018. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) procedure codes were evaluated to identify the codes most likely to predict a subsequent diagnosis of IS. Researchers also used input from IS medical experts to determine the clinical, electrographic, radiologic, procedural and medication variables that may predict IS development.06:48SGMO Sangamo Therapeutics announces preliminary results from first three patients treated in Phase 1/2 THALES study evaluating investigational ST-400 ex vivo gene-edited cell therapy in transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (11.66 )The three patients treated with ST-400 experienced prompt hematopoietic reconstitution, demonstrating neutrophil engraftment in 14-22 days and platelet engraftment in 22-35 days (Table 1). No emerging clonal hematopoiesis has to date been observed by on-target indel pattern monitoring in the three treated patients. Reported adverse events (AEs) are consistent with the known toxicities of mobilization, apheresis, and myeloablative busulfan conditioning. One serious adverse event (SAE) related to ST-400 was reported. As previously disclosed, Patient 1 experienced hypersensitivity during ST-400 infusion considered by the investigator to be likely related to the product cryoprotectant excipient, DMSO, and which resolved by the end of the infusion.06:47LITE Lumentum to offer $850 mln aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2026 (72.08 )Lumentum intends to use approximately $196 million of the net proceeds of the offering to repay in full all amounts outstanding under its term loan credit facility, and a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to purchase up to approximately $200 million of its common stock concurrently with the pricing of this offering in privately negotiated transactions effected through the initial purchaser of the notes or its affiliates as its agent.

As of the November 14, 2019 data cutoff date, eight patients, all with -thalassemia, were evaluable for the primary endpoint of a hemoglobin increase of =1.0 g/dL from baseline in at least one assessment during Weeks 4-12. All eight patients were treated with 50 mg of mitapivat twice daily for the first six weeks and escalated to 100 mg twice daily, and all patients remain on treatment (range 12.4-34.3 weeks). Seven of eight efficacy evaluable patients achieved a hemoglobin increase of =1.0 g/dL, and for responders the mean hemoglobin increase from baseline was 1.76 g/dL (range, 0.9--3.3 g/dL) during Weeks 4-12. The majority of adverse events were Grade 1 or 2 and consistent with previously published Phase 2 data for mitapivat in patients with pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency. Updated results from the Phase 2 thalassemia study will be presented at a medical meeting in the first half of 2020.06:38PRNB Principia Biopharma reports positive data of PRN1008 for Immune Thrombocytopenia in ongoing Phase 1/2 Trial (37.39 )Co announced consistent positive data from an ongoing Phase 1/2 trial of its investigational treatment, PRN1008, in 31 highly treatment-resistant and refractory patients (median of six prior therapies) with immune thrombocytopenia.Of the 31 patients, 39 percent (80 percent confidence interval (CI) 28, 50), irrespective of dose and duration of treatment, achieved the trial's primary endpoint of =2 consecutive platelet counts of =50,000/L, separated by at least five days, and increased by =20,000/L from baseline, without requiring rescue medication. In addition, 45 percent (80 percent CI 34, 57) of enrolled patients achieved any two platelet counts =50,000/L. Most patients who achieved the primary endpoint had a platelet count >30,000/L by the first week of treatment. Preliminary data on 13 patients treated at higher doses (300mg and 400mg twice daily) and who had completed at least 12 weeks of therapy, demonstrated a response rate of 54 percent (80 percent CI 37, 70) and 62 percent (80 percent CI 44, 77) for both endpoints respectively. To date PRN1008 has been well-tolerated at all doses studied, whether given as a monotherapy or with allowed concomitant ITP therapy (thrombopoietin and steroids), with no reported treatment related bleeding or thrombotic events. Related treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 35 percent of patients and were all grade 1 or 2.06:37ZIOP ZIOPHARM presents pre-clinical data of Rapid Personalized Manufacture (5.16 )Data were presented today in the poster presentation "Rapid Personalized Manufacture (RPM) of Sleeping Beauty System-generated NY-ESO-1-specific TCR-T Cells Co-Expressing Membrane-bound IL-15 Yields Antitumor Responses" and demonstrated:T cells can be genetically modified with the Sleeping Beauty system to express TCR and mbIL15T cells expressing TCR and mbIL15 exhibited superior anti-tumor effects compared with TCR-modified T cells without mbIL15T cells expressing TCR and mbIL15 are infused the day after gene transfer per RPMLow-dose of T cells genetically modified per RPM to express TCR and mbIL15 exhibit anti-tumor effectsT cells expressing TCR and mbIL15 persist in mouse model06:36TGTX TG Therapeutics presents triple therapy data from Phase I/II study of ublituximab in combination with umbralisib and venetoclax in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (7.12 )Title: A Phase 1/2 Study of Umbralisib, Ublituximab and Venetoclax in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)Overall response rate (ORR) of 87% (20/23) after U2 induction period at cycle 3, prior to introduction of venetoclax, in relapsed/refractory CLL patients, including patients refractory to ibrutinibU2 induction appeared to reduce venetoclax TLS risk, with no patients remaining as TLS high-risk following 3 cycles of U213 patients treated for >7 cycles and 9 patients for > 12 cycles: 100% ORR (13/13) after cycle 7 for the triple combination 100% ORR (9/9) including 44% Complete Response (CR) after cycle 12 for the combination100% (9/9) of patients had undetectable minimal residual disease (MRD) (<0.01%) in peripheral blood after 12 cycles of therapy; and78% (7/9) of patients who completed 12 cycles of therapy had undetectable MRD in bone marrow and have stopped therapy No patients (n = 27) have progressed to date with a median follow-up of 6.4 monthsTriple combination was generally well tolerated with no events of TLS observed06:36TAK Takeda Pharma presents Phase 3 TOURMALINE-AL1 results (20.26 )Co announced that results of the TOURMALINE-AL1 trial.

All dose levels of avapritinib tested were well-tolerated, and no patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse event (AE).Blueprint Medicines plans to report additional data from Part 1 of the PIONEER trial that will inform the selection of a recommended Part 2 dose (RP2D), including the change in patient-reported disease symptoms as measured by the Indolent SM Symptom Assessment Form (ISM-SAF), in the first quarter of 2020. The registration-enabling Part 2 of the PIONEER trial is anticipated to initiate patient screening in the first half of 2020.06:34REGN Regeneron Pharma announces initial clinical data for REGN5458 in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma (372.26 )Results were presented today at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting from the first two dose groups (3 mg and 6 mg weekly doses). Patients had a median of seven lines of prior systemic therapy, and all had failed CD38 antibody treatment. Responses were observed in 4 of 7 (57%) patients, including 3 of 4 (75%) in the 6 mg dose group. In the 6 mg dose group, 2 patients (50%) were also minimal residual disease (MRD) negative, meaning that no cancer cells were detectable in their bone marrow.As of data cutoff, there have been no neurotoxicity, dose-limiting toxicities or treatment discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs). The most common treatment-emergent AEs were lymphopenia (n=5), anemia (n=4) and thrombocytopenia and cytokine release syndrome (n=3 each). Grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent AEs were seen in 5 patients and included lymphopenia (n=3), hypertension (n=2) and anemia, atrial fibrillation, fatigue, febrile neutropenia, pain in extremity, septic shock and thrombocytopenia (n=1 each).06:33STZ Constellation Brands names Garth Hankinson Executive Vice President and CFO (183.65 )Co announces that Garth Hankinson has been promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective January 13, 2020.

The results from the pharmacokinetic and occupancy studies for the first seven patients have been in-line with expectations. The Company anticipates that a dose that achieves maximum target occupancy will be achieved in the next one or two dose cohorts. CPI-818 has been shown to bind covalently to ITK at low nanomolar concentrations without reacting with other kinases. In vitro studies demonstrated selective cytotoxicity to Sezary cells (malignant cells from patients with CTCL), while sparing normal T-cells, in three subjects not enrolled in the study. Preclinical murine models of lymphoproliferative and autoimmune disease showed CPI-818 inhibited the development of lymph node and spleen enlargement by preventing proliferation of abnormal T-cells. Treatment with CPI-818 led to regression of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly in animals with established disease.06:32CGC Canopy Growth names David Klein CEO effective January 14 (18.65 )In his current role as executive vice president and chief financial officer at Constellation Brands, David oversees all aspects of the company's finance operations, all mergers and acquisitions, as well as the company's information technology function.The appointment of David Klein follows a thorough recruitment process overseen by a special Hiring Committee of the Board using global recruitment company Heidrick & Struggles, which saw a wide variety of exceptional candidates vetted and interviewed.

Fourteen patients were evaluable at one month.AUTO3 was well-tolerated, with no patients experiencing = Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with primary infusion and 1 of 14 experiencing Grade 3 neurotoxicity that resolved swiftly with steroids. There were no pembrolizumab immune-related toxicities and the majority of grade 3 or higher adverse events were hematological. Low levels of serum cytokines are consistent with the observed low levels of CRS and neurotoxicity. Across all tested doses 5 patients achieved a complete response, with 4 of 5 complete responses ongoing, the longest at 18 months. All CRs were achieved without need for steroid or tocilizumab-based management of the patients or ICU level care.AUTO3 -- (Poster) - Phase 1/2 AMELIA clinical trial of AUTO3 in patients with relapsed/refractory pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pALL) (Abstract # 2620)AUTO3 was well-tolerated overall, with no patients experiencing = Grade 3 CRS and no patients experiencing = Grade 2 neurotoxicity, in doses =3x106 /kg CAR-T cells. No AUTO3-related deaths were reported.Among the 10 CAR T-nave patients, at a median follow-up time of 9.7 months (range 1.8- 18), 9 of 10 patients (90%) achieved a complete response, and 8 of 10 (80%) achieved complete molecular remission by PCR. Estimated overall survival at 12 months was 100%. There are 2 ongoing patients in complete molecular remission at 12 and 15 months post-AUTO3 infusion, respectively. The most common cause of relapse was due to loss of CAR T-cell persistence. The median persistence of CAR-T cells in blood was 170 days.06:29STOK Stoke Therapeutics presents new preclinical data on STK-001 for the treatment of Dravet syndrome (28.98 )Data from studies in non-human primates (NHP) showed STK-001 distributed throughout the brain and achieved target engagement and increased Nav1.1 protein expression throughout the cortex after a single intrathecal injection. Safety findings showed STK-001 to be well-tolerated at the two intrathecal dose levels studied. These data were presented in a poster session at the American Epilepsy Society (AES) Annual Meeting in Baltimore.Stoke plans to submit an investigational new drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in early 2020 and, subject to acceptance of the IND, plans to initiate a Phase 1/2 single-ascending dose study in children and adolescents with Dravet syndrome in the first half of 2020.06:28FATE Fate Therapeutics presents new in vivo preclinical data for FT596 -- company plans to initiate enrollment of first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in rarly 2020 (13.67 )FT596 is the first cellular immunotherapy engineered with three active anti-tumor components to be cleared for clinical investigation by the FDA. In addition to a proprietary CAR targeting CD19, FT596 expresses a novel high-affinity, non-cleavable CD16 (hnCD16) Fc receptor that has been modified to augment antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, enabling coincident targeting of CD19 and additional tumor-associated antigens such as CD20. FT596 also expresses an interleukin-15 receptor fusion (IL-15RF), a potent cytokine complex that promotes survival, proliferation and trans-activation of NK cells and CD8 T cells without the need for systemic cytokine support. Together, these features of FT596 are intended to maximize potency and minimize toxicity in treated patients. The Company plans to initiate enrollment of a first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in early 2020.New preclinical data presented at ASH showed that FT596 administered as a monotherapy exhibited durable tumor clearance and extended survival in vivo similar to primary CAR T cells in a humanized mouse model of CD19+ lymphoma. Additionally, when combined with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab, FT596 showed enhanced killing of CD20+ lymphoma cells in vivo as compared to rituximab alone. These data confirm previously presented in vitro findings that demonstrate the unique multi-antigen targeting functionality of FT596, and the product candidate's potential to effectively overcome CD19 antigen escape.The Company also announced that, in preparation for Phase 1 initiation, it had recently completed GMP production of FT596. In a single small-scale manufacturing campaign, the Company produced over 300 cryopreserved, infusion-ready doses of FT596 at a cost of approximately $2,500 per dose. The Company's iPSC product platform unites stem cell biology and precision genetic engineering to create renewable master engineered iPSC lines that can be repeatedly used to mass produce cancer-fighting immune cells, replacing the high production costs, weeks of manufacturing time, and complex manufacturing processes required for current-generation CAR T-cell immunotherapies with a lower-cost, easier-to-manufacture, well-characterized, off-the-shelf product that has the potential to reach many more patients.06:27SGMO Sangamo Therapeutics and Pfizer (PFE) report updated Phase 1/2 results showing sustained increased Factor VIII activity through 44 weeks (11.66 )Sangamo Therapeutics (SGMO) and Pfizer (PFE) announced updated follow-up results from the Phase 1/2 Alta study evaluating investigational SB-525 gene therapy in patients with severe hemophilia A. The data showed that SB-525 was generally well tolerated and demonstrated sustained increased Factor VIII (FVIII) levels following treatment with SB-525 through to 44 weeks, the extent of follow-up for the longest treated patient in the 3e13 vg/kg dose cohort.06:27KURA Kura Oncology provides clinical and regulatory updates for lead drug candidate, tipifarnib, in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (15.61 )In June 2019, Kura reported that the primary efficacy endpoint was achieved in each of the expansion cohorts in its Phase 2 trial of tipifarnib in relapsed or refractory PTCL: 1) patients with AITL, an aggressive form of T-cell lymphoma often characterized by high levels of CXCL12 expression, and 2) patients with PTCL who lack a single nucleotide variation in the 3'-untranslated region of the CXCL12 gene. Given the high level of activity observed among AITL patients, Kura continued to enroll patients to acquire more experience regarding safety and tolerability in this population. Based upon the 2016 revision of the World Health Organization classification of lymphoid neoplasms1, AITL and AITL-like histologies represent approximately one-third of all PTCL cases.As of the November 11, 2019 data cutoff date, a total of 26 patients with relapsed or refractory AITL were enrolled in all stages of the trial. Among the 20 patients evaluable for efficacy, five achieved a complete response (CR) and five achieved a partial response (PR), for an objective response rate (ORR) of 50% on an evaluable basis and 38% on an intent-to-treat basis. In addition, three patients experienced disease stabilization. Patients had a median of three prior regimens (range 1-7).Next-generation sequencing of 19 available patient biopsies showed that 10 (53%) carried C336R/Q386E variants in the killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) 3DL2, an immune checkpoint receptor. Four of the 10 patients with KIR3DL2 variants achieved a CR and three achieved a PR, for a CR rate of 40% and an ORR of 70%. This compares to a CR rate of 11% and an ORR of 22% among the nine AITL patients with KIR3DL2 wild type.Regulatory Update: Following FDA feedback from an end-of-Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting, Kura plans to initiate a Phase 2 registration-directed trial of tipifarnib in patients with relapsed or refractory AITL and related lymphomas in 2020. The multi-center, single-arm trial will target enrollment of 128 patients with AITL and AITL-like histologies who are relapsed or refractory to at least one prior systemic cytotoxic therapy.06:26PTLA Portola Pharma presents new interim results from ongoing Phase 2a study of cerdulatinib in patients with specific subtypes of T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (29.21 )As of the November 12, 2019 cut-off date, 64 PTCL patients and 40 CTCL patients treated with cerdulatinib as a single agent were evaluable for response. The overall response rate (ORR) was 34% in the PTCL cohort and 43% in the CTCL cohort. Among the subset of patients in the PTCL cohort with AITL, the ORR was 52% and the complete response rate (CR) was 37%.Among the 64 patients in the PTCL cohort, 14 patients (22%) achieved a CR and eight patients (12%) achieved a partial response (PR). In the subgroup of 27 patients with AITL, 10 patients (37%) achieved a CR, and four patients (15%) achieved a PR. The median duration of response is eight months for all PTCL patients and is greater than nine months in AITL patients. Follow-up is ongoing. Among the 40 patients in the CTCL cohort, three patients (8%) achieved a CR and 14 patients (35%) achieved a PR. Importantly, rapid improvements in pruritus, or severe itching -- a common and often serious condition associated with CTCL -- have been observed, as measured by the Likert scale.Cerdulatinib demonstrated good tolerability in both PTCL and CTCL. The most common Grade 3 or greater adverse events across the PTCL and CTCL cohorts with a frequency > 5% were lipase increase (25%), amylase increase (19%), neutropenia (12%), anemia (10%), diarrhea (8%), sepsis/bacteremia (6%), and febrile neutropenia (4%). The lipase and amylase changes were generally asymptomatic and not associated with pancreatitis.06:25XENE Xenon Pharmaceuticals provides updates on partnered neurology pipeline programs (13.95 )Xenon Pharmaceuticals announced that it will provide updates on its partnered epilepsy programs at the American Epilepsy Society Annual Meeting.Overview of clinical stage XEN901 and Related Patient Survey to be Presented in the "Genetic Epilepsies -- Updates in the Science and Diagnosis" on December 8thPre-clinical work suggests selective sodium channel inhibitors that reduce action potential firing in excitatory neurons, while sparing inhibitory interneurons, may provide promising drug profile06:25IMV IMV presents updated results from SPiReL at ASH (2.83 )The poster, which included additional data collected between the abstract submission and the presentation, continued to demonstrate a favorable therapeutic profile and treatment-associated clinical benefit in r/r DLBCL patients who received the DPX-Survivac combination regimen.06:24QURE uniQure presents updated clinical data on three patients treated in ongoing Phase IIb study of etranacogene dezaparvovec; additionally presents up to 4 years of follow-up data on the 10 patients in the Phase I/II trial of AMT-060 (66.05 )At Least One Year of Stable, Therapeutic Levels of FIX Activity in Patients Treated with Etranacogene Dezaparvovec: Featured in a poster presentation at ASH, the 52 weeks of follow-up data show that all three patients have stabilized and sustained FIX activity at therapeutic levels after the one-time administration of etranacogene dezaparvovec. Mean FIX activity for the three patients at 52 weeks after administration was 41% of normal, with the first patient achieving FIX activity of 50% of normal, the second patient achieving FIX activity of 31% of normal and the third patient achieving FIX activity of 41% of normal. The second and third patients had previously screen-failed and were excluded from another gene therapy study due to pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to a different AAV vector. Reported FIX activity was measured using an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay performed at a central laboratory.At one year after dosing, no patient in the study has reported any bleeding events. All patients have remained free of prophylaxis after receiving etranacogene dezaparvovec. One patient, who had earlier in the study undergone hip surgery due to a pre-existing condition, experienced back pain and treated himself with a single infusion of factor replacement, which was later determined by the patient and the investigator to be unrelated to a bleed. No other FIX infusions were reported by any patient.Stable FIX Expression and Durable Reductions in Bleeding and FIX Consumption for up to 4 Years Following AMT-060 Gene Therapy:In the ongoing Phase I/II study of AMT-060, all 10 patients continue to show long-term clinical benefit, including sustained increases in FIX activity, reduced usage of FIX replacement therapy, and decreased bleeding frequency. At up to 4 years of follow-up, AMT-060 continues to be well-tolerated, with no new serious adverse events and no development of inhibitors since the last reported data.All five patients in the second dose cohort of 2x1013 gc/kg (the dose being studied in the ongoing Phase III HOPE-B study of etranacogene dezaparvovec) continue to be free of routine FIX replacement therapy at 3.5 years after treatment. Based on the six months of data collected during the fourth year of follow-up, the mean annualized bleeding rate was zero compared to an average of 4 bleeds during the year prior to treatment, representing a 100% reduction. During this same period, the usage of FIX replacement therapy also declined 100% compared to the year prior to treatment. Mean FIX activity over 3.5 years was 7.5%.06:22FATE Fate Therapeutics reports clinical data from Landmark Phase 1 studies; No dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients (13.67 )Fate Therapeutics announced initial clinical data for its FT516 and FT500 off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived natural killer (NK) cell product candidates.No morphologic evidence of leukemia and complete neutrophil recovery observed in first patient treated with FT516 Monotherapy for AML following first dosing cycleNo dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients treated with FT500 for advanced solid tumorsFavorable FT500 Phase 1 Safety, Tolerability and Immunogenicity profile validates novel multi-dose treatment paradigm for off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived NK cell products.06:22BMY Bristol-Myers presents data from multiple studies evaluating lisocabtagene maraleucel at ASH (59.95 )These studies included an evaluation of liso-cel in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) (TRANSCEND CLL 004); a study in second-line patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients who were ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) (PILOT); and a separate analysis of patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma who received liso-cel in the outpatient setting across three studies."The results in relapsed or refractory CLL and SLL demonstrated a high rate of durable complete responses achieved in heavily pre-treated patients, including patients who have failed ibrutinib and venetoclax. We are encouraged by the potential of liso-cel to treat second-line relapsed or refractory large B-cell NHL patients who are not able to undergo a stem cell transplant. Finally, the analysis evaluating liso-cel administered in the outpatient setting demonstrates that not all patients require hospitalization and that the safety and efficacy profile across a variety of types of clinical sites is consistent."06:20LLY Eli Lilly presents interim clinical data from the LOXO-305 global Phase 1/2 BRUIN dose escalation trial (119.64 )At all doses studied, LOXO-305 delivered objective responses in patients who had received diverse prior therapies and had exhibited varied molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance.Of 16 CLL patients enrolled, there were 10 responders (8 partial responses, 2 partial response with ongoing lymphocytosis) among 13 patients eligible for response assessment, resulting in a 77% ORR. All patients with CLL have demonstrated tumor reduction, with evidence of deepening response over time. Responses were observed in patients with acquired resistance to prior BTK therapy (those with and without C481S mutations), in patients who were intolerant to prior BTK therapy, and in patients with acquired resistance to prior BCL2 therapy (including one with a known BCL G101V mutation). As expected, LOXO-305 treatment causes acute lymphocytosis, which resolves over time-a well described pharmacodynamic response associated with effective BTK inhibition. Of the three CLL patients not yet eligible for response assessment (one with the BTK C481S mutation), all three have demonstrated lymphocytosis early in cycle 1. All CLL responding patients remain in response and all CLL patients remain on study. Of eight MCL patients enrolled, there were three responses (1 complete response, 2 partial responses) among six patients eligible for response assessment, resulting in a 50% ORR. Two of the responders had progressed on prior BTK therapy (but without a documented C481x mutation). All MCL responding patients remain in response and on study. Three MCL patients discontinued therapy in cycle 1 due to progressive disease.Most treatment-emergent adverse events were Grade 1 in severity with the most commonly reported events, regardless of attribution, being fatigue (25% total: 21% Grade 1, 4% Grade 2) and diarrhea (18% total: 14% Grade 1, 4% Grade 2). Two adverse events =Grade 3 were attributed to LOXO-305 (Grade 3 leukocytosis and Grade 3 transient neutropenia). No dose limiting toxicities were reported and an MTD had not been reached.06:19AZN AstraZeneca reports full results from Phase III ELEVATE TN trial (47.68 )AstraZeneca presented results from the interim analysis of the Phase III ELEVATE TN trial, showing that CALQUENCE (acalabrutinib) combined with obinutuzumab or as monotherapy significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab, a standard chemo-immunotherapy treatment, in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemiaIn an exploratory analysis, CALQUENCE in combination or alone demonstrated consistent PFS improvements across most pre-specified subgroups of patients with high-risk disease characteristics, including the unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable gene (IGHV), del(11q) and complex karyotype. Overall, the safety and tolerability profile of CALQUENCE observed in the ELEVATE TN trial was consistent with its known profile.06:19BGNE BeiGene presents clinical data from three trials of its BTK inhibitor BRUKINSA at ASH (186.92 )In two oral presentations of BRUKINSA in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), the drug candidate demonstrated consistent safety and a high overall response rate (ORR); in the poster presentation of BRUKINSA combined with BeiGene's investigational anti-PD-1 antibody tislelizumab in patients with previously treated B-cell malignancies, the combination treatment showed preliminary efficacy and was generally well tolerated."The results presented today on BRUKINSA, a BTK inhibitor designed to maximize target occupancy and minimize off-target binding, demonstrated robust clinical activity and a safety profile consistent with what we've observed to date in our clinical trials, including safety data that supported the recent U.S. FDA accelerated approval in patients with previously treated mantle cell lymphoma," said Jane Huang, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, hematology at BeiGene. "CLL or SLL is the most common type of leukemia in adults, and despite the advancements of BTK inhibitor therapy for these cancers, there remains a need for highly selective BTK inhibitors capable of promoting long-term responses, and with a safety profile that is tolerable over time. The results presented here today further demonstrate the potential for BRUKINSA to help people living with these persistent, life-threatening cancers."06:18RCKT Rocket Pharmaceuticals presents 'encouraging' preliminary results from its Phase 1 trial of commercial-grade RP-L102 'Process B' for Fanconi Anemia (22.37 )Results presented in the poster highlight preliminary Phase 1 data from two pediatric patients (age 5 and 6 years) who were treated with "Process B" RP-L102 prior to the development of severe bone marrow failure and are in ongoing follow-up. Drug product was successfully manufactured using "Process B" optimization, including transduction enhancers, commercial-grade vector and modified cell processing. "Process B" drug product is manufactured to commercial grade standards, allowing for consistent drug product across patients and a vector copy number (VCN) two to three fold higher than that administered to optimally-treated "Process A" patients.Once transduced, drug product was infused fresh into patients without any prior conditioning regimen. To evaluate transduction efficiency, an analysis of the proportion of the MMC-resistant colony forming cells (CFC's) was conducted. Both patients exhibited early signs of engraftment based on peripheral blood, VCN and/or MMC-resistance. Preliminary phenotypic correction was also apparent in both patients, as evidenced by stabilization or increases in blood cell lineages. No safety or tolerability issues have been reported.06:18ABBV AbbVie reports new results from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE clinical trial showing the potential of this fixed-duration combination therapy (86.98 )AbbVie announced new data from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE (PCYC-1142) clinical trial,1 evaluating IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) in combination with VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO (venetoclax) in previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Results showed that patients who received up to 12 cycles of the combination regimen achieved high rates of undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD) in both peripheral blood (PB; 75 percent of patients) and in bone marrow (BM; 72 percent of patients). Safety data were consistent with the known safety profiles of IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO used as individual therapies.Results showed uMRD -- defined as less than 1 CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes (MRD<0.01 percent) by flow cytometry of PB or BM samples -- was achieved at any time after baseline in PB for 75 percent of patients (122 of 163 patients) and in BM for 72 percent (111 of 155 patients). The proportion of patients who had uMRD in PB increased over time from 57 percent after 6 cycles, 68 percent after 9 cycles, and 73 percent after 12 cycles of IMBRUVICA plus VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO. The high rates of uMRD in BM were consistent across high-risk subgroups, including in patients with del(17p), del(17p) or TP53 mutation, del(11q), complex karyotype, and unmutated IGHV status. In patients with uMRD in PB with matched BM samples, 93 percent of patients had uMRD in both PB and BM. With median follow-up of 14.7 months, 3 patients (2 percent) experienced disease progression.06:17OBSV ObsEva reports positive Phase 3 trial results from PRIMROSE 2 trial of linzagolix for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids (4.57 )The responder rate was 93.9% (p < 0.001) for women receiving 200 mg with ABT and 56.7% for women receiving 100 mg without ABT (p < 0.001), compared to 29.4% in the placebo group. Both doses achieved significant rates of amenorrhea (p < 0.001), reduction in pain (p < 0.001), and improvement in quality of life (p < 0.001). Additionally, significant improvement (p < 0.001) in hemoglobin levels, a reduction in number of days of bleeding and reduction in uterine volume were observed. Furthermore, a significant reduction in fibroid volume was also observed for the 200 mg dose with ABT (p < 0.008).The overall safety profile was in line with expectations and confirmed that linzagolix was well-tolerated. The most frequently observed adverse events (occurring in > 5% of patients) were headache, hot flushes, and anemia. Mean percentage change from baseline in BMD was consistent with previous clinical data."We look forward to the results from our second pivotal study, PRIMROSE 1 conducted in the US, in Q2 2020. Assuming positive results, we expect that it would lead to a Marketing Authorization Application submission with the European Medicines Agency by year-end 2020 and a New Drug Application submission with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by Q1 2021."06:16THOR Synthorx to be acquired by Sanofi (SNY) for $68/share in cash (25.03 )Under the terms of the merger agreement, Sanofi will commence a cash tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Synthorx common stock for $68 per share in cash for a total enterprise value of approximately $2.35 billion.

While the DOJ and SEC conduct separate investigations, the same facts have been shared by Ericsson with both authorities. The resolution relates to historical FCPA breaches ending Q1 2017. While the Company had a compliance program and a supporting control framework, they were not adequately implemented. Specifically, certain employees in some markets, some of whom were executives in those markets, acted in bad faith and knowingly failed to implement sufficient controls. They were able to enter into transactions for illegitimate purposes and, together with people under their influence, used sophisticated schemes in order to hide their wrongdoing.Separately, Ericsson agreed to resolve civil charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) relating to allegations of violations of the bribery and accounting provisions of the FCPA. Ericsson agreed to the entry of a judgment enjoining it from future violations of the FCPA and it agreed to pay a financial sanction of $458,380,000, plus pre-judgment interest of $81,540,000.As part of the settlement, Ericsson has agreed to engage an independent compliance monitor for a period of three years while the Company continues to undertake significant reforms to strengthen its Ethics & Compliance program.The combined payment of $1.06 b.

This may just be the calm before the storm considering all the macro-related events set to take place as the week unfolds. S&P Futures saw a relative quiet beginning with only a nine point overnight range. The market is currently trading around the 3144 area, with a high of 3148.50 and a low of 3139.50. In Asia, both China and Japan finished the day marginally higher. The Shanghai struggled to gain much following lighter than expected export data that saw a 1.1% fall in November, compared to a forecast of +0.8%.The Nikkei traded around in a narrow range that culminated with a gain of 0.3%. Heavyweights such as Softbank and Sony both gained more that 1% by day's end. European markets slightly under water. The weaker than expected Export data out of China has likely kept the EU markets in check.

AL002 is a monoclonal antibody intended to enhance the activity of TREM2 and is being developed by Alector for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in collaboration with its partner AbbVie (ABBV). The data were presented today at the 12th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) meeting. The AL002 presentation at CTAD showcases the first data in humans showing that a TREM2 activating antibody engages its target and demonstrates downstream activity in the CNS. The data reported today are from the study's SAD phase in 56 healthy adults, who were enrolled into nine escalating dose cohorts. AL002 was found to be generally safe and well-tolerated. AL002 reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) soluble TREM2 in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating proof-of-target engagement in the brain. AL002 elevated a biomarker for microglia activity in the CSF, indicating proof-of-mechanism. The Phase 1b portion of the study in Alzheimer's disease patients is on-going.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD16:19WTRE Watford Holdings agrees to purchase Axeria IARD; terms not disclosed (26.47 +0.25)Axeria IARD is a property and casualty insurance company based in France.

Ninety-four percent of patients were refractory to an anti-CD38 antibody and 84% percent were triple refractory (refractory to an IMiD agent, PI and anti-CD38 antibody). Results for the primary endpoint (overall response rate [ORR]) and key secondary endpoint (complete response rate [CR]), as well as duration of response (DoR) and progression-free survival (PFS) across the target dose levels and at each of the three target doses explored in the study are presented in the table below. The median follow-up duration for all subjects was 11.3 months.Overall, the safety results were consistent with those observed in the phase 1 CRB-401 study, which evaluated the preliminary safety and efficacy of ide-cel. Instances of grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in 5.5% (7/128) of patients, including one fatal CRS event. Investigator identified grade 3 or higher neurotoxicity events (iiNT) occurred in 3.1% (4/128) of patients and there were no Grade 4 iiNT events reported. Grade 3 or higher CRS and iiNT events were reported in <6% of subjects at each target dose.

Treasury futures began rising last evening, continuing their push in steady fashion throughout the night. The Asian session saw the release of hotter than expected inflation figures from China, largely due to a 110% yr/yr surge in pork prices. The disappointment was partially offset by news that China's credit creation exceeded expectations in November. Treasury futures hit pre-market highs not long ago amid a weak showing from European equity markets. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% at 97.53.

EUR/USD:1.1064Long Bond Leads Quiet Monday AdvanceU.S. Treasuries of most tenors began the week with modest gains while the 5-yr note underperformed, finishing just above its flat line. The first session of the week was very quiet, and it followed an overnight affair that was just as subdued. Economic data received overnight painted a mixed picture, as China reported a smaller than expected trade surplus for November (actual $38.73 bln; expected $46.30 bln) while Japan's Q3 GDP growth was revised up to 0.4% from 0.1%. Treasuries started the cash session with modest gains, climbing toward their intraday highs from Friday shortly after the open. However, the rest of the session saw a slow return to today's opening levels. The U.S. Treasury sold $38 bln in 3-yr notes to solid demand, as the high yield stopped through the when issued yield by 0.2 bps while the bid-to-cover ratio and indirect takedown were above average. The U.S. Dollar Index faced some morning pressure but returned to little changed as the day went on, reclaiming its 200-day moving average (97.65) in the process. Yield Check: 2-yr: -1 bp to 1.62% 3-yr: -1 bp to 1.64% 5-yr: UNCH at 1.67% 10-yr: -1 bp to 1.83% 30-yr: -2 bps to 2.26%News: The House of Representatives could vote on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on December 18, according to CNBC. The Bank for International Settlements published its latest quarterly review, which noted that structural issues rather than temporary factors were responsible for the mid-September shortage in the funding market that prompted the Fed to begin conducting daily reverse repurchases. The BIS added that liquidity demand from hedge funds exacerbated the funding stress. Financial Times reported that the Chinese government has ordered the removal of all foreign computer equipment and software from government offices. The Bank of Japan will reportedly lower its assessment of industrial production due to prolonged weakness. Former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker died on Sunday.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -7.50.The S&P 500 futures trade roughly in-line with fair value following a quiet weekend in news, muted sessions in Asia and Europe, and a dearth of earnings reports today.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2135/743. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2209/891.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: December 9, 2019End of Document

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2135/743. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2209/891.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: December 9, 2019End of Document

The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2135/743. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2209/891.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: December 9, 2019End of Document

HONG KONG POLICE DENY THAT TRAIN-BOUND ARRESTEES WERE TAKEN TO MAINLAND CHINAStates News ServiceNovember 28, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1408 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Since the detention and torture of Hong Kong resident and former U.K consular employee Simon Cheng, fears are growing that some of the thousands of people arrested since the protest movement began may have been sent to mainland China.In a lengthy account of his interrogation and torture at the hands of state security police in Shenzhen posted to Facebook, the mainland Chinese city just across the border from Hong Kong, Cheng says he glimpsed a group of 10 young people at an interrogation center in Shenzhen."I saw around 10 young "criminal suspects" who were receiving interrogations in the center," Cheng wrote. "They are all handcuffed and in orange prisoner vest.""When I walked through the corridor, I heard one voice shout out from one of the questioning rooms: "raise your hands higher! Didn't you raise your hands and wave the flags in the protest?!" I guess they were torturing Hong Kong protesters."Cheng's account has fueled fears that a group of arrested protesters seen in video footage being escorted aboard an East Rail train last week were bound for detention in mainland China.Pro-democracy political party Demosisto, founded by the leaders of the 2014 pro-democracy movement, tweeted the video with the comment:"#HKPoliceTerrorists used East Rail Line train, which can reach HK-China border, to transfer arrestees. Nobody knows where the arrestees will be transferred! We mustn't let them go missing!"Patrick Poon, China researcher for Amnesty International, said the group has received a number of reports of missing arrestees, but that they are nearly impossible to verify, because of a lack of information.He said the protest movement has demanded an independent inquiry into police violence and abuse of power precisely because the current complaints system advocated by the administration of chief executive Carrie Lam adds up to the police investigating complaints against themselves."At present, there is no way to verify these reports with information from multiple sources," Poon said. "The Chinese and Hong Kong governments must explain this. Actually, we must have an independent inquiry.""It is very worrying, because in the current situation, there is nothing close to the necessary checks and balances," he said. "All that can happen is that the police provide the information with which they are to be investigated, so there is no credibility."Missing protestersFifteen threads posted to the LIHKG discussion forum since June detail missing protesters, with concerns that some may have died in custody and their deaths reported as suicide.A total of 46 people have been informally described as missing on the forum after becoming involved in the protest movement.According to the Hong Kong Police Force, police have issued 10 notices of missing persons during the past six months, five of whom were aged 15 to 35.Regarding the video clip of arrestees boarding a train, a police spokesman confirmed that they were indeed arrestees boarding an MTR train requisitioned by police, but said the train only traveled one stop and hadn't taken them to the terminus at Lo Wu on the border.The anti-extradition movement was sparked by widespread fears that the previously watertight border between mainland China and Hong Kong's separate legal jurisdiction was getting more and more porous, and that the possibility of extradition would put paid to any protections currently enjoyed by Hong Kong residents.A frontline protester who gave only a nickname A Wai said that was his biggest fear."My biggest worry is that the division between Hong Kong and mainland China is getting weaker," he said, citing the cross-border detentions and kidnappings of five Hong Kong booksellers starting in October 2015.He said Cheng's detention by Chinese police on the Chinese side of a border checkpoint in Hong Kong's West Kowloon high-speed rail terminus was a more recent example."Chinese police come to Hong Kong to arrest people whenever they feel like it," A Wai said. "I don't trust the Hong Kong government, either.""The Hong Kong government won't help us because the suicide or disappearance may have been caused by them," he said. "There's absolutely nothing we can do about it.""Trying to impose checks and balances on a powerful state machine that is targeting our citizens and even sowing terror among us makes us afraid," he said.Rumors of renditionsIcarus Wong of Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor group said its members are gravely concerned about the rumors of renditions to mainland China by train, but that Hongkongers are already being detained if they cross the border under their own steam."We don't have enough information to judge whether some people have been disappeared or not right now," Wong said. "What we do know is that some people are being intercepted by mainland public security officers when they cross the border into China, and then detained for hours of interviews and interrogations.""But as to whether there some people have been 'disappeared' or killed, we would really need more information to make judgement," he said.As of Nov. 21, a total of 5,856 people aged 11 to 83 were arrested during demonstrations in various districts on charges of participating in riots, illegal assembly, causing bodily harm, and assaulting a police officer.A total of 923 people have been charged. Of those arrested, 332 were under the age of 16, and 2,327 were students, the police public relations bureau said in a statement.Police on Wednesday were heard warning crowds of lunchtime protesters that they could face arrest if they chant slogans that are "untrue," government broadcaster RTHK reported.The crowd in Kwun Tong district had been chanting: "Hong Kong hasn't won if tyranny isn't dead.""It wasn't clear exactly what slogans the police considered to be unacceptable, but media reports suggested the crowd had also accused officers of being rapists and murderers a claim often heard during the ongoing unrest," the station reported.Protesters in Kowloon Bay meanwhile called for the immediate disbanding of the police force amid growing anger at what rights groups and overseas governments have termed excessive violence, as well as emerging reports of the torture and sexual abuse of detainees.Since the movement gripped Hong Kong in early June, state-run Chinese media has tried to characterize the anti-extradition movement, which later broadened to include demands for full democracy and an independent inquiry into police violence, as the work of a handful of pro-independence radicals bent on wreaking havoc at the instigation of "hostile foreign forces."'Silent majority' mythPart of the official narrative has been the presumed existence of a "silent majority" who support the government and police, love China, and are angry with the long-running disruption to their daily lives and the use of force by frontline protesters.But pro-democracy candidates won more than 80 percent of District Council seats after a record three million voters turned out in a ringing endorsement of the broader aims of the pro-democracy movement.Lam has withdrawn legal amendments that would have allowed extradition to mainland China, but protesters also want fully democratic elections to the city's Legislative Council (LegCo) and for the post of chief executive, an amnesty for the thousands of people arrested since protests began, an end to the use of the term "rioting," and an independent inquiry into police violence.Lam and her officials have repeatedly ruled out meeting any of the other demands, although analysts said economic concessions were likely in the pipeline in a bid to mollify residents.Officials at Hong Kong Polytechnic University (Poly U), where police have besieged protesters following violent clashes more than a week ago, have called on police to leave, saying that the blockade should end.A three-hour search on Wednesday found no sign of protesters anywhere on the campus, but many of the school's facilities, like classrooms and laboratories, were badly damaged, officials told RTHK.But police have said they will enter the university on Thursday, and a lone protester read out a statement saying around 20 people are still on the site, and could make a last stand if police enter the campus.Reported by Tseng Yat-yiu, Tam Siu-yin and Gao Feng for RFA's Mandarin and Cantonese Services.

On the heels of a torrid Christmas sales season, online retailing giant Amazon.com rose, while discount chain Target eased lower. Meanwhile, Tesla announced it would deliver its first Chinese-built cars starting Monday.The Dow rose 0.1%, adding to Thursday's new record high.

It's now 43% extended.Stock Market: A Pause That Refreshes?Some notable stocks paused or fell in early trading.Tesla dipped 0.3%, after announcing it will begin delivering China-built Model 3 electric cars starting on Monday.

The Chinese government also announced earlier it would exempt the car maker from some taxes. Tesla is working on a six-day winning streak.Another big stock market winner, FAANG and Dow stock Apple, rose 0.4% after Japan's Nikkei business news daily reported Friday that Apple and Sharp Corp. are considering acquiring Japan Display's smartphone screen factory in a deal valued at up to $820 million.

The Ibex 35 moves away from 9,400 points, the key that opens the door to a Christmas 'rally'CE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 10, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 683 wordsBodyThe falls are imposed on the European stock exchanges with the German DAX at the forefront. The day is dressed in a certain correction and the Ibex 35 -after a flat opening - gives way 9,300 points. Will there be a Christmas rally? The Spanish selective must still exceed 9,400 integers, which is the key that opens the door to that scenario.Ecotrader experts insist on the same requirements: for the exchanges to end the year with an accelerator, certain levels such as those mentioned 9,400 integers of the Ibex 35 or, in the case of the EuroStoxx 50, the 3,733 points in which their child is located must still be beat l analog and from which it is still at a distance of 1.5%.For these analysts, it is "a matter of time" for the index to exceed this area and "try to recover some of the wide spread open with the rest of the European exchanges" that currently hovers around 12 points. Also, the break of this level "would warn us of the likely start of a rally of between 2% and 4%, up to resistances of 9,600-9,800 points," they add.Regardless of the technical aspect of the exchanges, investors disengage the few macro references of the day. Kingdom's GDP stagnated in the third quarter despite a certain recovery in the industry.Investors are still awaiting developments, particularly awaiting further news on US-China trade negotiations, which, according to Link Securities experts, will largely determine, for better or worse, trend adopted at year-end by world stock markets.The data on Chinese exports in November have re-found that the trade conflict between the two countries is taking a toll on the Asian country to a greater extent than the US. Today it has been known that the unstoppable rise in pig prices, one of the most demanded products, has re-fired the CPI, which in November increased by 4.5% year-on-year, its largest increase in eight years.It looks to be seen whether the Chinese government chooses to give in enough so that phase one of the agreement can be closed. Next Sunday, if there is no order by US President Donald Trump, to the contrary, new tariffs will come into force on approximately 160 billion Chinese imports to the United States, tariffs that this time will affect products American consumers are very sensitive such as mobile terminals, laptops or toys."We understand that as long as there is no relevant news regarding the conduct of the negotiations, it is very feasible that the downward drips on the Western stock exchanges will continue"If no agreement is reached before the date, which, according to Link, seems complicated to happen, the best scenario for markets would be a delay in the entry into force of the aforementioned tariffs on the next 15th, which would be interpreted as a gesture of goodwill  by the Trump Administration. Otherwise, and in effect the rates, the stock markets are going to have a very complicated annual close.For now, investors are starting to get impatient, causing the shortsmen to choose to reduce their risk positions. "We understand that as long as there is no relevant news regarding the conduct of the negotiations, it is very feasible that the downward drips on the Western stock exchanges will continue," the experts determine.The Fed's two-day meeting begins    Investors will also have the last two-day meeting of the US Federal Reserve's year, which does not expect great news. In principle, and because it is discounting the market, the Fed will choose to keep the main parameters of its policy unchangedMonetary.Link's experts recall that the positive employment figures for November published in the US last Friday come to give the reason to the members of the institution, having decided at their last meeting to stop the way in the process of lowering  official types they had initiated.Thus, the resistance that the US economy, coupled with moderate inflation in the US, is adequate for the current level of official interest rates, the analysts say.Thursday will be the turn for the European Central Bank (ECB), and on the same day the UK elections are also held, which will clear the way for Brexit.Load-Date: January 27, 2020End of Document

Wall Street moves away from highs: Dow Jones pulls back falls to Home Depot crashCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 19, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 472 wordsBodyThe bulls want to win one more run on Wall Street. In the early bars of the session, the New York stock exchange has tried to look at highs, but gradually loses steam. Its three main indices have kicked off the day with promotions, but little is at risk. The Dow Jones is the one with the most falling to the ballast of Home Depot. The S&P; 500 is flat on 3,100 integers.Still, US equities continue to show no signs of weakness. Sum maximum after maximum. Yesterday he set new records, and today we will have to wait for the closing. This is because it is in "free rise", i.e. "the bulliest technical situation that exists", as Joan Cabrero, Director of Strategy at Ecotrader explains.And everything will be in order as long as the lows of last Christmas are not missed, that is: the 5,895 points on the Nasdaq 100, the 21,712 of the Dow Jones and the 2,346 of the S&P; 500.  Home Depot cuts forecastsAt the corporate level, the prominence lies this day in Home Depot. The DIY chain has presented its third-quarter results before the opening of the session in the United States. Most importantly, it has cut its forecasts for this year for the second time since summer. As a result, their shares plummet by more than 4% and lead the falls at the Dow Jones.Walgreens Boots and Dow, with moderate declines, accompany him at the bottom of the table. Boeing and Visa, on the other hand, lead purchases with upgrades of more than 1%.   China, pessimistic?Investors don't have major macro references on Tuesday. Therefore, they simply wait (optimistically) for any development stakes in the US-China trade negotiations, the world's two largest powers.Yesterday, doubts were raised at information from CNBC pointing to a patent pessimism in Beijing in the face of a possible deal with its Us challenger. As the television network reported, the Chinese government would be thinking of waiting to see what happens with the impeachment that is taking US President Donald Trump, and even wait for the result of the country's presidential election that will be held within a year.In parallel, the Us Executive announced a new three-month extension to the moratorium on Chinese tech giant Huawei.Yet both nations have yet to decide when and where their presidents, Trump and Xi Jinping, will sign the "phase one" of their trade deal. It is already said that the rubric does not occur until next month.Trump and Powell meetingIt should also be remembered that Trump met with Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve (Fed), on Monday. According to the agency, the central banker maintained ideas "consistent" with those transferred in the US Parliament's talklast week.In the face of these references, investors continue to show interest in U.S. fixed income. As a result, the ten-year treasury (Treasury) reduces its profitability to 1.8%.Load-Date: February 24, 2020End of Document

China reported a smaller than expected trade surplus for November with exports contracting against expectations for an increase. Treasury futures hit pre-market highs around 4:00 ET, and they remain just below those levels at this time. Investors will not receive any economic data today, but the U.S. Treasury will sell $38 bln in 3-yr Treasury notes. The FOMC will hold a policy meeting this week, but it is expected to be a non-event. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% at 97.57.

The cash session started in flat fashion after overnight action saw more of the same. Namely, there was a token headline pointing to "trade optimism" after China's Ministry of Finance announced that some U.S. soybeans, pork, and other commodities will be excluded from tariffs while economic data from Europe showed another drop in Germany's industrial production. Treasuries followed their flat start with a slide to fresh lows for the week after the Employment Situation report for November easily exceeded estimates. However, it wasn't long before the market bounced off lows, finding support near levels from Monday afternoon. Solid U.S. data helped the U.S. Dollar Index climb 0.3% to 97.70 after five days of losses. The Index lost 0.6% for the week but was able to claw back above its 200-day moving average (97.65). Yield Check: 2-yr: +4 bps to 1.63% 3-yr: +6 bps to 1.65% 5-yr: +5 bps to 1.67% 10-yr: +5 bps to 1.84% 30-yr: +4 bps to 2.28%News: The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow forecast for Q4 GDP was increased to 2.0% from 1.5% following the release of the Employment Situation report for November. Bank of Canada Governor, Stephen Poloz, will not seek another term once his current term ends in June 2020. Japan's October Leading Index fell to 91.8 from 92.2 (expected 92.0) while Coincident Indicator decreased 5.6% m/m (last 1.7%). October Household Spending fell 11.5% m/m (expected -9.8%; last 5.5%), contracting 5.1% yr/yr (expected -3.0%; last 9.5%). October Average Cash Earnings increased 0.5% yr/yr (expected 1.1%; last 0.5%). Australia's November AIG Construction Index fell to 40.0 from 43.9. Germany's October Industrial Production fell 1.7% m/m (expected 0.1%; last -0.6%). Italy's October Retail Sales fell 0.2% m/m (expected 0.5%; last 0.6%) but were up 1.0% yr/yr, as expected (last 0.8%). Today's Data: November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000) and October nonfarm payrolls revised to 156,000 from 128,000. November private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000) while October private sector payrolls revised to 163,000 from 131,000. November unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October. The U6 unemployment rate, which accounts for unemployed and underemployed workers, was 6.9%, versus 7.0% in October. November average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October. Over the last 12 months, average hourly earnings have risen 3.1%, versus 3.2% for the 12 months ending in October. The average workweek in November was 34.4 hours (Briefing.com consensus 34.4) versus 34.4 hours in October. The labor force participation rate was 63.2% in November versus 63.3% in October. The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017. The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity. Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September. The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis. Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September. The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.

5G: WHO CAN YOU TRUST?US Fed NewsDecember 3, 2019 Tuesday 5:26 PM  ESTCopyright 2019 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 601 wordsBodyPARIS, France, Dec. 3 -- The U.S. Embassy &#38; Consulates in France issued the following news release:Emerging 5G wireless networks will change the world. New interconnected applications will revolutionize businesses, improve infrastructure and transform personal communications.These new applications will be central to our lives, so keeping all this data secure is more important than ever.But how can you protect against violations of your privacy? What about stolen business secrets and disrupted vital infrastructure? As with everything else in modern society, you need to be able to trust your telecom company.WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO TRUST A TELECOM COMPANY?Consumers need to be able to trust that their 5G provider will keep their data secure and provide uninterrupted service. This is more than a technical issue.On a recent call with journalists, Robert Strayer, the State Department's chief diplomat for cybersecurity, explained the importance of users knowing that their 5G telecom company "cannot be compromised by a foreign government and asked to take steps to undermine [their] software and firmware."((c) Leigh Vogel/Concordia Summit/Getty Images)Robert Strayer, the State Department's chief diplomat for cybersecurity ((c) Leigh Vogel/Concordia Summit/Getty Images)Consumers are accustomed to constantly receiving hardware and software updates from their telecom companies. But what is in those updates? Strayer explained that assessment of one version as secure doesn't mean a telecom company won't later install a version that can be compromised.For telecom companies headquartered in Western countries, consumers have recourse and legal protections from data breaches. But consumers don't have such protections from telecom companies headquartered in China.Of course, every company claims it will never be compromised. This is why countries thinking of buying 5G networks should evaluate vendors based on objective factors. Strayer posed these questions to consider:* Is the company headquartered in a country where there is rule of law and an independent judiciary in place? This provides evidence of whether a company can withstand pressure to compromise its network.* Does the company have a transparent ownership structure? This ensures that consumers will know who is really making the decisions, particularly if a company is partially or wholly controlled by a foreign power.* Does the company have a history of ethical behavior? Past performance is the best way to determine whether consumers can trust a company's claims that it will not compromise its networks.Is Huawei trustworthy?Huawei is hoping to produce and sell its 5G network equipment around the world. However, there are clear reasons for countries and consumers to act cautiously.Huawei is headquartered in China, a country without an independent judiciary or enforceable rule of law. China even has a law that requires companies to help the government spy. That means there is no way to challenge the Chinese government if it orders a company to spy or steal.Additionally, Huawei also has a history of ethical violations, including stealing secrets from its competitors."There's a long track record of intellectual property theft by Huawei and of violations of corruption laws around the world," said Strayer. When it comes to 5G, the U.S. and its allies "need to ensure that we have only trusted vendors in 5G networks."from share America: https://share.america.gov/5g-who-can-you-trust/ For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at contentservices@htlive.comLoad-Date: December 3, 2019End of Document

Google-Citi deal could break the ice; bill calls for bank cooperation on gunsamericanbanker.comNovember 18, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 SourceMedia, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: Vol. 1; No. 1Length: 927 wordsByline: George YacikBodyReceiving Wide Coverage ...Seeking a meaningThe Chinese government seized control of another small rural bank over the weekend, "another sign that the problems" in China's banking system "are more widespread." While "China's banking system as a whole doesn't look overly stretched, smaller banks lent liberally to local governments and businesses, and bad debts are rising as China's economy sputters. Simultaneously, the banking sector has been hit by tougher rules from Beijing, such as stricter requirements on recognizing overdue loans. The changes are pushing up nonperforming loan ratios and revealingimpairments lurking within off-balance-sheet lending."Meanwhile, in the U.S., three banks have collapsed over the past month, "bringing the total number of failures this year to four," the Financial Times reports. "In a country with some 4,700 federally insured lenders, that is a small number. But given that the total last year was zero,the trend is worth watching.""Granted, the three bust banks are small canaries in the coal mine: between them they had less than $200 million in assets and five branches. But the last time there were zero U.S.-bank failures was 2006. In 2007 there were three. The year after that? No one needs reminding."Bankers should pay attention because the recent closingscould portend a stiffer regulatory stanceon capital adequacy and risk, industry experts said," American Banker reports. "Regulators could be looking to address instances of poor management and inadequate capital before the next economic downturn."Separately, the European Central Bank Fridayterminated the banking licenseof Anglo-Austrian Bank, formerly known as Bank Meinl, "one of Austria's best-known financial institutions, amid ongoing concerns over compliance failures and allegations of money laundering that have dogged the bank in recent months." The move, which was effective immediately, brings "to a close almost a century in banking for the Meinl dynasty."Financial TimesA matter of trustThe partnership between Citigroup and Google announced last week to "offer smart checking accounts through Google Pay " remains vague," and "given the history of the two institutions, and other recent attempts to mix West Coast tech with East Coast finance, it is tempting to conclude that this venture - code named Cache - will hit trouble.""But that would be too hasty," the paper says. "Silicon Valley has already cracked payments. It is only a matter of time before itoverturns more complex banking functions. Citi-Google could be a beachhead. If banks such as Citi - which can trace its roots to 1812 - are seeking to do deals with them, you can expect plenty more to follow.""Consumertrust issues have long been a stumbling blockfor challenger banks, but many say Google will face an even tougher time persuading customers to share their financial information as part of its planned checking account," American Banker reports.The number ofcontactless payments transactionsin the U.K. rose to more than 726 million in August, up nearly 14% compared to the year earlier figure. In pound terms, spending on contactless soared to £6.9 billion, up from £6 billion, according to U.K. Finance, the industry trade body."Contactless debit cards have been the norm for a while, and now an ever-increasing number of people are tapping through transactions on their credit card," said John Crossley, the director of price comparison website Compare the Market.Bank of America ignored FBI warnings about financing a leveraged buyout for the now-bankrupt Constellation Healthcare Technologies, according to FBI files made public in a U.S. court last week. The FBI told an executive at BofA "the entire transaction wassetting alarms off, and there was a concern that someone was attempting to defraud" the bank.

Google-Citi deal could break the ice; bill calls for bank cooperation on gunsAmerican BankerNovember 19, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent. All Rights ReservedSection: Vol. 184; No. 223Length: 927 wordsByline: George YacikBodyReceiving Wide Coverage ...Seeking a meaningThe Chinese government seized control of another small rural bank over the weekend, "another sign that the problems" in China's banking system "are more widespread." While "China's banking system as a whole doesn't look overly stretched, smaller banks lent liberally to local governments and businesses, and bad debts are rising as China's economy sputters. Simultaneously, the banking sector has been hit by tougher rules from Beijing, such as stricter requirements on recognizing overdue loans. The changes are pushing up nonperforming loan ratios and revealingimpairments lurking within off-balance-sheet lending."Meanwhile, in the U.S., three banks have collapsed over the past month, "bringing the total number of failures this year to four," the Financial Times reports. "In a country with some 4,700 federally insured lenders, that is a small number. But given that the total last year was zero,the trend is worth watching.""Granted, the three bust banks are small canaries in the coal mine: between them they had less than $200 million in assets and five branches. But the last time there were zero U.S.-bank failures was 2006. In 2007 there were three. The year after that? No one needs reminding."Bankers should pay attention because the recent closingscould portend a stiffer regulatory stanceon capital adequacy and risk, industry experts said," American Banker reports. "Regulators could be looking to address instances of poor management and inadequate capital before the next economic downturn."Separately, the European Central Bank Fridayterminated the banking licenseof Anglo-Austrian Bank, formerly known as Bank Meinl, "one of Austria's best-known financial institutions, amid ongoing concerns over compliance failures and allegations of money laundering that have dogged the bank in recent months." The move, which was effective immediately, brings "to a close almost a century in banking for the Meinl dynasty."Financial TimesA matter of trustThe partnership between Citigroup and Google announced last week to "offer smart checking accounts through Google Pay " remains vague," and "given the history of the two institutions, and other recent attempts to mix West Coast tech with East Coast finance, it is tempting to conclude that this venture - code named Cache - will hit trouble.""But that would be too hasty," the paper says. "Silicon Valley has already cracked payments. It is only a matter of time before itoverturns more complex banking functions. Citi-Google could be a beachhead. If banks such as Citi - which can trace its roots to 1812 - are seeking to do deals with them, you can expect plenty more to follow.""Consumertrust issues have long been a stumbling blockfor challenger banks, but many say Google will face an even tougher time persuading customers to share their financial information as part of its planned checking account," American Banker reports.The number ofcontactless payments transactionsin the U.K. rose to more than 726 million in August, up nearly 14% compared to the year earlier figure. In pound terms, spending on contactless soared to £6.9 billion, up from £6 billion, according to U.K. Finance, the industry trade body."Contactless debit cards have been the norm for a while, and now an ever-increasing number of people are tapping through transactions on their credit card," said John Crossley, the director of price comparison website Compare the Market.Bank of America ignored FBI warnings about financing a leveraged buyout for the now-bankrupt Constellation Healthcare Technologies, according to FBI files made public in a U.S. court last week. The FBI told an executive at BofA "the entire transaction wassetting alarms off, and there was a concern that someone was attempting to defraud" the bank. BofA went ahead with a $130 million loan to finance the acquisition. "Constellation filed for bankruptcy last year, and it is uncertain how much the lender will recover."New York TimesSuspicious mindsIn the wake of a school shooting in California last week, a Virginia Democrat has proposed a House bill that "would require banks and other financial institutions to work with the government to help identify and report suspicious or illegal financial activity related to firearms."

Show solidarity with Hong Kong, and let the protestors inspire youThe Nevada Sagebrush: University of Nevada - RenoNovember 12, 2019 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 754 wordsByline: Vincent RendonBodyStudio Incendo/Flickr Protests in Hong Kong gather crowds in the thousands demonstrating against increased control from Beijing. Americans can help the protestors by showing solidarity with their causes and vocalizing their support.Entering the sixth month of protests, events in Hong Kong took another turn when a police officer discharged their firearm at a protestor on Monday, leaving him in critical condition. The week prior, a student protestor died after falling from a parking garage, seemingly while trying to avoid tear gas. The further escalation in violence is a reminder of the very real stakes activists protesting for a better society face, and it's not likely to deescalate soon. Many of the protestors are college students or of the same age, fighting for their freedom in spite of the danger. It takes pure courage to do this, and citizens in the United States should look towards the protests in Hong Kong not as foreign troubles but an inspirational demonstration of people's willpower.The protests in Hong Kong started in June, over an extradition bill allowing Hong Kong citizens to be extradited to mainland China. Hong Kong views themselves as autonomous from China in many ways, and the extradition bill was seen as overreach from the Chinese government. Protests raged over the city since then, continuing even when the extradition bill was repealed in September. Ultimately, the protestors are still fighting for reasonable demands such as the release of all captured protestors and their amnesty and independent investigations of police brutality. Like many protests, young people and college students figure prominently in the ranks of demonstrators. Unlike many protests in the US, the protestors are actually taking direct action in the fight for change. This means they are taking the protest beyond simple rallies and marches, and in return are being beaten and tear gassed for it. Still, they keep on fighting, even after multiple skirmishes, injuries and a ban on wearing masks-with their autonomy on the line, they have yet to let anything stop them. In the US direct action feels frustratingly rare. When the daughter of local distributor of Starbucks in China made comments against the protestors, the protestors vandalized various Starbucks locations. In America we're lucky if people can organize a boycott that goes beyond a few people breaking things they already bought for the sake of an angry Facebook video. Activism is unfortunately slacktivism and I'm guilty of it too. We rely far too much on petitions, marches and hashtags and have no stomach to support protestors who cross the imaginary "civility" line to protect their land or community. In Hong Kong protestors are demanding the demonstrations not be referred to as riots, but in America no one stands up to demand the same label be scrubbed from the demonstrations in Ferguson. The events going on in Hong Kong are so important because of how they tie into the larger history of protest between government and citizens. The protestors in Hong Kong are young people fighting for what is right and for progress. We in America saw how powerful that can be during the civil rights movement. Many of the protestors in Hong Kong are fighting for expanded suffrage. We in America know how tiresome that fight was for women in the 1920s. Now the protestors are facing violence at the hands of their own government. We in America will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the shooting at Kent State next year, where four college students were killed by their own National Guard. Americans know who were on the right and wrong sides of each of these conflicts, and need to know the people of Hong Kong are on the right side in their own struggle. Right now, the people of Hong Kong are asking for our help. They deserve our show of support to help encourage them to keep fighting for their freedoms, it would be un-American not to offer them that. For their credit, many Americans are showing solidarity with Hong Kong. When gaming company Blizzard banned a player for supporting Hong Kong, gamers started a boycott against the company. Members in Congress are passing bills supporting the protestors. College students are organizing demonstrations in a show of support. Momentum needs to keep flowing in their direction, and whatever Americans can do to help Hong Kongers preserve their autonomy needs to be placed center stage and fought for. Vincent Rendon can be reached at Vrendon@Sagebrush.unr.edu or on Twitter @VinceSagebrush.Load-Date: November 12, 2019End of Document

Global Thin Layer Deposition Market Forecasts, 2019-2024 - Increase in Demand for Microelectronics & Consumer Electronics to Fuel the Market - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireNovember 14, 2019 Thursday 6:18 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 1218 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Thin Layer Deposition Market - Growth, Trends, and Forecast (2019 - 2024)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The thin layer deposition market is expected to register a CAGR of 15.25% over the forecast period of 2019-2024.In April 2019, The Centre for Process Innovation (CPI) and Beneq have signed a long term collaboration agreement for the use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) technologies in printable electronics applications.Thin-film semiconductor deposition is a next-generation technology that is achieving rapid acceptance across various industries. The range of applications of thin-film semiconductors in solar panels will create an increasing demand in thin-film semiconductor deposition manufacturing.The demand for thin layer deposition semiconductors has increased due to their advantages such as lightweight, higher efficiency, less space consumption, and flexibility in shape.

Global Blowing Agents Market Outlook, 2019-2024 with Honeywell International, The Chemours Company, Arkema, Sinochem Group Co, and Nouryon DominatingPR NewswireNovember 29, 2019 Friday 2:00 PM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1272 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, Nov. 29, 2019 BodyPR NewswireThe"Blowing Agents Market - Growth, Trends, and Forecast (2019 - 2024)"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.The market for blowing agents is expected to expand at a CAGR of 2.27% during the forecast period of 2019-2024.Major factors driving the market studied is rise in demand for polymeric insulation foams for buildings, automotive, and appliances. stringent environmental regulations regarding blowing agents is expected to hinder the growth of the market studied.Key HighlightsHigh Demand for Zero Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP) and Low Global Warming Potential (GWP) Blowing Agents is likely to act as an opportunity in the future. In terms of revenue, North America dominated the market studied during the forecast period. In terms of volume, Asia-Pacific dominated the global market.Market TrendsIncreasing Demand from the Building and Construction IndustryOwing to their non-VOC, non-ozone depleting, low global warming potential, and reduced energy consumption, blowing agents are environmentally acceptable, and are thus, used in building and construction. They help to create better uniform components, resulting in better, tighter insulation, higher energy efficiency, and limited energy consumption. Blowing agents are used as a component in building insulation, such as block pipe and roof insulation, doors, sheathing, and in structures that require foundation. They are also used as sealants for windows and doors. They are majorly used in polyurethane foams that have high utilization in pipes to prevent loss of heat and to maintain temperatures even during cold climates, to avoid freezing or cracking for long-distance heating. They are also used in phenolic foams, but with limited usage. Phenolic foams are majorly used in panels to act as insulating barriers in roofing, wall cavities, and floor insulation. The increasing construction activities worldwide is expected to significantly boost the blowing agents market. In North America, the demand from the United States is expected to increase, owing to the major growth in office buildings and in the residential, healthcare, & commercial sectors. The construction industry in the United States witnessed a steady growth in 2018 (by about 5%), as a result of increased private sector expenditure on residential construction and office space expansion. The Asia-Pacific region dominates the building and construction sector, with India, China, and various other South East Asian countries driving the market growth significantly. The positive factors like the aforementioned ones are expected to drive the market growth through the forecast period.China to Dominate the Asia-Pacific MarketAs a Group I member, China is expected to freeze HFC production and use at agreed baseline levels, by or before 2024, and is expected to phase down the production and use, beginning with a 10% phasedown below freeze levels, by 2029. Though the usage of CFC-11 was banned internationally in 2010, owing to the ozone depletion effects of the substance, evidence has been found proving the illegal production and usage of CFC-11 as a blowing agent in the rigid polyurethane foam insulation sector. According to a field study carried out by the Environmental Investigative Agency, a UK-based NGO, the atmospheric levels of CFC-11 in China are significantly greater than expected, proving the harmful nature of CFC-11. Apart from the banned CFCs and HCFCs (whose usage is regulated and is expected to phase out by 2040), China has been using alternative blowing agents, like preblended CP (cyclopentane), HFO blends, and water. China has the world's largest construction industry. However, the growth rate of the industry has become increasingly modest, as the Chinese government is looking to shift toward a services-led economy. China has the second-largest packaging industry in the world and is expected to witness a consistent growth during the forecast period, owing to the rise of customized packaging, increased demand for microwave food, snack foods, and frozen foods, among others. China has the world's largest textile and apparel industry, which is also a key player for the country's economy. However, there has been a drop in the market share occupied by the country in the global apparel export market, owing to the trade war with the United States and maturation of the market. Hence, the aforementioned factors are likely to affect the demand for blowing agents in China during the forecast period.Competitive LandscapeThe global market for blowing agents is fragmented. There are many local players in the market along with international players. The major companies include Honeywell International Inc., The Chemours Company, Arkema, Sinochem Group Co.

NetEase Reports Third Quarter 2019 Unaudited Financial ResultsPR NewswireNovember 20, 2019 Wednesday 6:00 PM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 6608 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Nov. 20, 2019 BodyPR NewswireNetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ: NTES) ("NetEase" or the "Company"), one of China's leading internet and online game services providers, today announced its unaudited financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2019.Third Quarter 2019 Financial Highlights[1]Net revenues[2] were RMB14,635.7 million (US$2,047.6 million), an increase of 11.2% compared to the third quarter of 2018. - Online game services net revenues were RMB11,534.8 million (US$1,613.8 million), an increase of 11.5% compared to the third quarter of 2018. - Youdao net revenues were RMB345.9 million (US$48.4 million), an increase of 98.4% compared to the third quarter of 2018. - Innovative businesses and others net revenues were RMB2,755.0 million (US$385.4 million), an increase of 4.5% compared to the third quarter of 2018. Gross profit was RMB7,870.4 million (US$1,101.1 million), an increase of 8.9% compared to the third quarter of 2018. Total operating expenses were RMB4,535.6 million (US$634.6 million), a decrease of 3.3% compared to the third quarter of 2018.  Net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company's shareholders was RMB12,885.4 million (US$1,802.7 million). Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company's shareholders was RMB4,726.0 million (US$661.2 million). [3] Basic net income per ADS from continuing operations was US$13.97; non-GAAP basic net income per ADS from continuing operations was US$5.12.[3][1] In September 2019, NetEase sold its Kaola e-commerce business, the principal terms of which were previously announced. As a result, Kaola has been deconsolidated from the Company and its historical financial results are reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations accordingly. The financial information and non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this press release is presented on a continuing operations basis, unless otherwise specifically stated.[2] Effective in the third quarter of 2019, the Company changed its segment disclosure to add the financial results of its certain advertising services and its private label e-commerce business Yanxuan into "innovative businesses and others" in light of the relatively small revenue contribution from those businesses to the Company's total consolidated net revenues in 2019. In addition, the Company has commenced separately reporting the results of Youdao. As a result, the Company now reports segments as online game services, Youdao and innovative businesses and others. See "Change of segment reporting" in this press release.[3] As used in this press release, non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company's shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income from continuing operations per ADS are defined to exclude share-based compensation expenses and net gain from disposal of business due to change in business focus. See "Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results" at the end of this press release.ThirdQuarter 2019 and Recent Operational HighlightsIntroduced thrilling new titles to China's gamer community including Cyber Hunter, Xuan Yuan Sword: Dragon Upon the Cloud and Bloom & Blade.

On a year-over-year basis, we achieved solid growth in net revenues of 11% and non-GAAP net income from continuing operations of 74%. In recognition of this success, our board of directors has approved a dividend of US$7.59 per ADS for the third quarter," said Mr. William Ding, Chief Executive Officer and Director of NetEase. "Our main areas of investment are online games, online education, music and private label e-commerce. With the completion of Youdao's IPO, we will continue to invest in knowledge tools, online courses and smart devices to empower even more efficient learning in China."Online games remain the cornerstone of our business with steady growth from our existing titles and exciting new titles in China and globally. Our flagship titleFantasy Westward Journey Onlinereached new record high gross billings this quarter. We also advanced our international brand with more hit titles such asKnives Out,Identity VandLife-Afterin Japan. Going forward, we will continue to focus on the growth of our robust online games business worldwide, as well as create additional value among our evolving businesses rooted in education, music and e-commerce," Mr. Ding concluded.ThirdQuarter 2019 Financial ResultsNetRevenuesNet revenues for the third quarter of 2019 were RMB14,635.7 million (US$2,047.6 million), compared to RMB14,448.4 million and RMB13,160.2 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively.Net revenues from online game services were RMB11,534.8 million (US$1,613.8 million) for the third quarter of 2019, compared to RMB11,433.4 million and RMB10,348.4 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively. Net revenues from mobile games accounted for approximately 71.0% of net revenues from online game services for the third quarter of 2019, compared to 72.2% and 68.0% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively.Net revenues from Youdao were RMB345.9 million (US$48.4 million) for the third quarter of 2019, compared to RMB322.8 million and RMB174.4 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively. Net revenues from innovative businesses and others were RMB2,755.0 million (US$385.4 million) for the third quarter of 2019, compared to RMB2,692.3 million and RMB2,637.4 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively.Gross ProfitGross profit for the third quarter of 2019 was RMB7,870.4 million (US$1,101.1 million), compared to RMB7,736.8 million and RMB7,224.1 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively.The quarter-over-quarter increase in online game services gross profit was primarily due to increased net revenues from certain PC-client games. The year-over-year increase in online game services gross profit was primarily due to increased net revenues from mobile games such asLife-After,InvincibleandIdentity V.The year-over-year increase in Youdao gross profit was primarily due to increased net revenues from its learning services and products, which in turn was driven by an increased number of paid student enrollments.The year-over-year decrease in innovative businesses and others gross profit was primarily due to decreased net revenues from certain advertising services which were affected by the macro-environment and increased expenses related to staff cost and content purchases.Gross Profit MarginGross profit margin for online game services for the third quarter of 2019 was 63.8%, compared to 63.1% and 65.1% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to higher revenue contribution from mobile games with comparatively lower margin.Gross profit margin for Youdao for the third quarter of 2019 was 25.8%, compared to 32.9% and 23.3% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in Youdao gross profit margin was mainly driven by a lower gross margin for its online marketing services.Gross profit margin for innovative businesses and others for the third quarter of 2019 was 15.2%, compared to 15.5% and 17.0% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in innovative businesses and others gross profit margin was primarily due to decreased net revenues from certain advertising services which were affected by the macro-environment and increased expenses related to staff cost and content purchases.Operating ExpensesTotal operating expenses for the third quarter of 2019 were RMB4,535.6 million (US$634.6 million), compared to RMB4,012.5 million and RMB4,688.6 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter increase in operating expenses was mainly due to increased marketing expenditures related to online game services and Youdao, as well as increased staff-related costs. The year-over-year decrease in operating expenses was mainly due to decreased marketing expenditures related to online games.Other IncomeOther income consisted of investment (loss)/ income, interest income, foreign exchange gains and others. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in other income were mainly due to the gain from the disposal ofKaolaand investment income. Income TaxesThe Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB1,116.7 million (US$156.2 million) for the third quarter of 2019, compared to RMB683.8 million and RMB842.9 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was 8.0%, compared to 16.7% and 28.8% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively. The effective tax rate represents certain estimates by the Company regarding the tax obligations and benefits applicable to it in each quarter, and the rate for the third quarter was affected by a number of factors including certain tax credits received and recognized in the quarter.Net Income and Non-GAAP Net IncomeNet income from continuing operations attributable to the Company's shareholders for the third quarter of 2019 totaled RMB12,885.4 million (US$1,802.7 million), compared to RMB3,354.2 million and RMB2,062.7 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company's shareholders for the third quarter of 2019 totaled RMB4,726.0 million (US$661.2 million), compared to RMB3,921.1 million and RMB2,712.3 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively.NetEase reported basic and diluted net income from continuing operations per ADS of US$13.97 and US$13.85, respectively, for the third quarter of 2019. The Company reported basic and diluted net income from continuing operations per ADS of US$3.64 and US$3.61, respectively, for the preceding quarter, and basic and diluted net income from continuing operations per ADS of US$2.25 and US$2.24 for the third quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP basic and diluted net income from continuing operations per ADS were US$5.12 and US$5.08, respectively, for the third quarter of 2019, compared to non-GAAP basic and diluted net income from continuing operations per ADS of US$4.26 and US$4.22, respectively, for the preceding quarter, and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income from continuing operations per ADS of US$2.95 and US$2.94, respectively, for the third quarter of 2018.      Quarterly DividendThe basic net income per ADS was US$13.80 for the third quarter of 2019. The board of directors has approved a dividend of US$7.59 per ADS for the third quarter of 2019. Such amount includes a regular quarterly dividend of US$4.14 per ADS (equivalent to approximately 30% of the Company's net income attributable to the Company's shareholders), plus a special dividend of US$3.45 per ADS. The total dividend of approximately US$1.0 billion is expected to be paid on December 13, 2019 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 6, 2019.NetEase paid a dividend of US$1.04 per ADS for the second quarter of 2019 on August 30, 2019.  Starting in the second quarter of 2019, the Company's policy has been to set quarterly dividends at an amount equivalent to approximately 20%-30% of the Company's anticipated net income after tax in each fiscal quarter. The determination to make dividend distributions and the amount of such distributions in any particular quarter will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will be based upon the Company's operations and earnings, cash flow, financial condition and other relevant factors.Other InformationAs of September 30, 2019, the Company's total cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current time deposits and short-term investments balance totaled RMB61,431.7 million (US$8,594.6 million), compared to RMB49,663.5 million as of December 31, 2018. Cash flow generated from continuing operating activities was RMB3,846.3 million (US$538.1 million) for the third quarter of 2019, compared to RMB4,928.1 million and RMB4,491.9 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively.Share Repurchase/ PurchaseProgramOn November 14, 2018, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved a share repurchase program of up to US$1.0 billion of the Company's outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months beginning on November 16, 2018. As of November 15, 2019, the last day of such program, approximately 1,000 ADSs had been repurchased under this program.The Company also announced today that its board of directors has approved a share purchase program of up to US$20.0 million of Youdao's outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months beginning on November 25, 2019.Under the terms of this program, NetEase may purchase Youdao's ADSs in open-market transactions on the New York Stock Exchange. It is expected that the timing and dollar amount of purchase transactions will be in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 10b-18 requirements and such purchases may be effected pursuant to a plan in conformity with SEC Rule 10b5-1. The extent to which NetEase purchases Youdao's ADSs will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions. This purchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.** The United States dollar (US$) amounts disclosed in this press release are presented solely for the convenience of the reader. Translations of amounts from RMB into United States dollars for the convenience of the reader were calculated at the noon buying rate of US$1.00 = RMB7.1477 on September 30, 2019 as set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into US$ at that rate on September 30, 2019, or at any other certain date. The percentages stated are calculated based on RMB.Change in Segment ReportingEffective in the third quarter of 2019, the Company changed its segment disclosure to add the financial results of its certain advertising services andYanxuaninto innovative businesses and others in light of the relatively small revenue contribution from those businesses to the Company's total consolidated net revenues in 2019. The Company sold itsKaolae-commerce business in September 2019. In addition, the Company has commenced separately reporting the results of its majority-controlled subsidiary Youdao, Inc. which completed its initial public offering and listing on the New York Stock Exchange in October 2019. As a result, the Company now reports segments as online game services, Youdao and innovative businesses and others. This change in segment reporting aligns with the manner in which the Company's operating decision maker ("CODM") currently receives and uses financial information to allocate resources and evaluate the performance of reporting segments. The Company retrospectively revised prior period segment information to conform to current period presentation.Impact of the Recently Adopted Major Accounting PronouncementIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 "Leases" as amended, which generally requires lessees to recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet and to provide enhanced disclosures surrounding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leasing arrangements. The Company adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2019 on a modified retrospective basis and did not restate comparative periods. The Company recognized approximately RMB577.0 million as total right-of-use assets as well as total lease liabilities for the operating leases on its consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019, excluding the impact from disposal ofKaola. The Company recognized RMB441.1 million and RMB449.8 million as total right-of-use assets and total lease liabilities, respectively, for the operating leases on its consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2019. Right-of-use assets are included in other long-term assets, and lease liabilities are included in accrual liabilities and other payables and other long-term payables, respectively based on payment terms on the consolidated balance sheet. Other than the foregoing, the Company does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on the net assets of the Company's consolidated financial statements.Conference CallNetEase's management team will host a teleconference call with simultaneous webcast at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, November 20, 2019 (Beijing/Hong Kong Time: 10:00 a.m., Thursday, November 21, 2019).

These statements are made under the "safe harbor" provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these forward-looking statements by terminology such as "will," "expects," "anticipates," "future," "intends," "plans," "believes," "estimates" and similar statements. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted by a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online game market will not continue to grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its leading position in that market within China or globally, which could occur if, for example, its new online games or expansion packs and other improvements to its existing games do not become as popular as management anticipates; the ability of NetEase to effectively market its games and other services and achieve a positive return on its marketing expenditures; the risk that changes in Chinese government regulation of the market for online games, education products and services and e-commerce may limit future growth of NetEase's revenues or cause revenues to decline; the risk that NetEase may not be able to continuously develop new and creative online services or that NetEase will not be able to set, or follow in a timely manner, trends in the market; the risk that the e-commerce market or the internet advertising market in China will not grow and will remain subject to intense competition; the risk that NetEase will not be able to control its expenses in future periods; competition in NetEase's existing and potential markets; governmental uncertainties (including possible changes in the effective tax rates applicable to NetEase and its subsidiaries and affiliates and the ability of NetEase to receive and maintain approvals of the preferential tax treatments); the risk that fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi with respect to other currencies could adversely affect NetEase's business and financial results; and other risks outlined in NetEase's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NetEase does not undertake any obligation to update this forward-looking information, except as required under the applicable law.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresNetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company's shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income from continuing operations per ADS, as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP").NetEase defines non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company's shareholders as net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company's shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses and net gain from disposal of business due to change in business focus. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company's shareholders enables NetEase's management to assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses and net gain from disposal of business due to change in business focus, which are non-cash charges or non-recurring in nature. NetEase believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the Company's current operating performance and prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates investors' assessment of its operating performance.Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company's shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of expense/ income that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses and net gain from disposal of business due to change in business focus have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company's shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company's shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. See "Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results" at the end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. Contact for Media and Investors:Margaret ShiNetEase,

Net revenues from mobile games accounted for approximately 71.0% of net revenues from online game services for the third quarter of 2019, compared to 72.2% and 68.0% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively.Net revenues from Youdao were RMB345.9 million (US$48.4 million) for the third quarter of 2019, compared to RMB322.8 million and RMB174.4 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively.Net revenues from innovative businesses and others were RMB2,755.0 million (US$385.4 million) for the third quarter of 2019, compared to RMB2,692.3 million and RMB2,637.4 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively.Gross ProfitGross profit for the third quarter of 2019 was RMB7,870.4 million (US$1,101.1 million), compared to RMB7,736.8 million and RMB7,224.1 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively.The quarter-over-quarter increase in online game services gross profit was primarily due to increased net revenues from certain PC-client games. The year-over-year increase in online game services gross profit was primarily due to increased net revenues from mobile games such as Life-After, Invincible and Identity V.The year-over-year increase in Youdao gross profit was primarily due to increased net revenues from its learning services and products, which in turn was driven by an increased number of paid student enrollments.The year-over-year decrease in innovative businesses and others gross profit was primarily due to decreased net revenues from certain advertising services which were affected by the macro-environment and increased expenses related to staff cost and content purchases.Gross Profit MarginGross profit margin for online game services for the third quarter of 2019 was 63.8%, compared to 63.1% and 65.1% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to higher revenue contribution from mobile games with comparatively lower margin.Gross profit margin for Youdao for the third quarter of 2019 was 25.8%, compared to 32.9% and 23.3% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively. The quarter-over quarter decrease in Youdao gross profit margin was mainly driven by a lower gross margin for its online marketing services.Gross profit margin for innovative businesses and others for the third quarter of 2019 was 15.2%, compared to 15.5% and 17.0% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in innovative businesses and others gross profit margin was primarily due to decreased net revenues from certain advertising services which were affected by the macro-environment and increased expenses related to staff cost and content purchases.Operating ExpensesTotal operating expenses for the third quarter of 2019 were RMB4,535.6 million (US$634.6 million), compared to RMB4,012.5 million and RMB4,688.6 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter increase in operating expenses was mainly due to increased marketing expenditures related to online game services and Youdao, as well as increased staff-related costs. The year-over-year decrease in operating expenses was mainly due to decreased marketing expenditures related to online games.Other IncomeOther income consisted of investment (loss)/ income, interest income, foreign exchange gains and others. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in other income were mainly due to the gain from the disposal of Kaola and investment income.Income TaxesThe Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB1,116.7 million (US$156.2 million) for the third quarter of 2019, compared to RMB683.8 million and RMB842.9 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was 8.0%, compared to 16.7% and 28.8% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively. The effective tax rate represents certain estimates by the Company regarding the tax obligations and benefits applicable to it in each quarter, and the rate for the third quarter was affected by a number of factors including certain tax credits received and recognized in the quarter.Net Income and Non-GAAP Net IncomeNet income from continuing operations attributable to the Company's shareholders for the third quarter of 2019 totaled RMB12,885.4 million (US$1,802.7 million), compared to RMB3,354.2 million and RMB2,062.7 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company's shareholders for the third quarter of 2019 totaled RMB4,726.0 million (US$661.2 million), compared to RMB3,921.1 million and RMB2,712.3 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively.NetEase reported basic and diluted net income from continuing operations per ADS of US$13.97 and US$13.85, respectively, for the third quarter of 2019. The Company reported basic and diluted net income from continuing operations per ADS of US$3.64 and US$3.61, respectively, for the preceding quarter, and basic and diluted net income from continuing operations per ADS of US$2.25 and US$2.24 for the third quarter of 2018.

The board of directors has approved a dividend of US$7.59 per ADS for the third quarter of 2019. Such amount includes a regular quarterly dividend of US$4.14 per ADS (equivalent to approximately 30% of the Company's net income attributable to the Company's shareholders), plus a special dividend of US$3.45 per ADS. The total dividend of approximately US$1.0 billion is expected to be paid on December 13, 2019 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 6, 2019.NetEase paid a dividend of US$1.04 per ADS for the second quarter of 2019 on August 30, 2019.Starting in the second quarter of 2019, the Company's policy has been to set quarterly dividends at an amount equivalent to approximately 20%-30% of the Company's anticipated net income after tax in each fiscal quarter. The determination to make dividend distributions and the amount of such distributions in any particular quarter will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will be based upon the Company's operations and earnings, cash flow, financial condition and other relevant factors.Other InformationAs of September 30, 2019, the Company's total cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current time deposits and short-term investments balance totaled RMB61,431.7 million (US$8,594.6 million), compared to RMB49,663.5 million as of December 31, 2018. Cash flow generated from continuing operating activities was RMB3,846.3 million (US$538.1 million) for the third quarter of 2019, compared to RMB4,928.1 million and RMB4,491.9 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively.Share Repurchase/ Purchase ProgramOn November 14, 2018, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved a share repurchase program of up to US$1.0 billion of the Company's outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months beginning on November 16, 2018. As of November 15, 2019, the last day of such program, approximately 1,000 ADSs had been repurchased under this program.The Company also announced today that its board of directors has approved a share purchase program of up to US$20.0 million of Youdao's outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months beginning on November 25, 2019.Under the terms of this program, NetEase may purchase Youdao's ADSs in open-market transactions on the New York Stock Exchange. It is expected that the timing and dollar amount of purchase transactions will be in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 10b-18 requirements and such purchases may be effected pursuant to a plan in conformity with SEC Rule 10b5-1. The extent to which NetEase purchases Youdao's ADSs will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions. This purchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.** The United States dollar (US$) amounts disclosed in this press release are presented solely for the convenience of the reader. Translations of amounts from RMB into United States dollars for the convenience of the reader were calculated at the noon buying rate of US$1.00 = RMB7.1477 on September 30, 2019 as set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into US$ at that rate on September 30, 2019, or at any other certain date. The percentages stated are calculated based on RMB.Change in Segment ReportingEffective in the third quarter of 2019, the Company changed its segment disclosure to add the financial results of its certain advertising services and Yanxuan into innovative businesses and others in light of the relatively small revenue contribution from those businesses to the Company's total consolidated net revenues in 2019. The Company sold its Kaola e-commerce business in September 2019. In addition, the Company has commenced separately reporting the results of its majority-controlled subsidiary Youdao, Inc. which completed its initial public offering and listing on the New York Stock Exchange in October 2019. As a result, the Company now reports segments as online game services, Youdao and innovative businesses and others. This change in segment reporting aligns with the manner in which the Company's operating decision maker ( CODM ) currently receives and uses financial information to allocate resources and evaluate the performance of reporting segments. The Company retrospectively revised prior period segment information to conform to current period presentation.Impact of the Recently Adopted Major Accounting PronouncementIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02  Leases  as amended, which generally requires lessees to recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet and to provide enhanced disclosures surrounding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leasing arrangements. The Company adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2019 on a modified retrospective basis and did not restate comparative periods. The Company recognized approximately RMB577.0 million as total right-of-use assets as well as total lease liabilities for the operating leases on its consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019, excluding the impact from disposal of Kaola. The Company recognized RMB441.1 million and RMB449.8 million as total right-of-use assets and total lease liabilities, respectively, for the operating leases on its consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2019. Right-of-use assets are included in other long-term assets, and lease liabilities are included in accrual liabilities and other payables and other long-term payables, respectively based on payment terms on the consolidated balance sheet. Other than the foregoing, the Company does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on the net assets of the Company's consolidated financial statements.Conference CallNetEase's management team will host a teleconference call with simultaneous webcast at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, November 20, 2019 (Beijing/Hong Kong Time: 10:00 a.m., Thursday, November 21, 2019).

These statements are made under the  safe harbor  provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these forward-looking statements by terminology such as  will,   expects,   anticipates,   future,   intends,   plans,   believes,   estimates  and similar statements. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted by a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online game market will not continue to grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its leading position in that market within China or globally, which could occur if, for example, its new online games or expansion packs and other improvements to its existing games do not become as popular as management anticipates; the ability of NetEase to effectively market its games and other services and achieve a positive return on its marketing expenditures; the risk that changes in Chinese government regulation of the market for online games, education products and services and e-commerce may limit future growth of NetEase's revenues or cause revenues to decline; the risk that NetEase may not be able to continuously develop new and creative online services or that NetEase will not be able to set, or follow in a timely manner, trends in the market; the risk that the e-commerce market or the internet advertising market in China will not grow and will remain subject to intense competition; the risk that NetEase will not be able to control its expenses in future periods; competition in NetEase's existing and potential markets; governmental uncertainties (including possible changes in the effective tax rates applicable to NetEase and its subsidiaries and affiliates and the ability of NetEase to receive and maintain approvals of the preferential tax treatments); the risk that fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi with respect to other currencies could adversely affect NetEase's business and financial results; and other risks outlined in NetEase's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NetEase does not undertake any obligation to update this forward-looking information, except as required under the applicable law.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresNetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company's shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income from continuing operations per ADS, as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ).NetEase defines non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company's shareholders as net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company's shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses and net gain from disposal of business due to change in business focus. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company's shareholders enables NetEase's management to assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses and net gain from disposal of business due to change in business focus, which are non-cash charges or non-recurring in nature. NetEase believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the Company's current operating performance and prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates investors' assessment of its operating performance.Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company's shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of expense/ income that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses and net gain from disposal of business due to change in business focus have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company's shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company's shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. See  Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results  at the end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.Tags: See Campaign:http://corp.netease.comContact Information:Margaret Shi NetEase, Inc. ir@service.netease.com Tel: (+86) 571-8985-3378 Brandi Piacente Investor Relations netease@thepiacentegroup.com Tel: (+1) 212-481-2050Tags:,           Profitwire,           Wire,           Asia,           EnglishLoad-Date: November 21, 2019End of Document

Global $5.6+ Billion Rare Earth Elements Market Forecast Study, 2019 to 2025 - Neodymium Volume Anticipated to Register a CAGR of 8.3%, Owing to Growing Demand for Permanent MagnetsPR NewswireDecember 11, 2019 Wednesday 1:00 PM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 808 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, Dec. 11, 2019 BodyPR NewswireThe"Rare Earth Elements Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report By Product (Cerium, Dysprosium, Erbium), By Application (Magnets, Catalyst), By Region, And Segment Forecasts, 2019 - 2025"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.The global rare earth elements market is anticipated to reach USD 5.62 billion by 2025, according to this report.The growing use of permanent magnets in the production of batteries for electric vehicles is expected to propel the demand for rare earth elements including neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, gadolinium, and terbium over the forecast period. Neodymium and praseodymium based rare earth permanent magnets are majorly used in the manufacturing of batteries.The growing demand for electric vehicles coupled with the government initiatives on reducing the CO2 emissions is expected to boost the demand for permanent magnets. In March 2019, the Chinese government reduced subsidies for electric vehicles in order to promote innovation amongst local manufacturers on account of declining costs. The incentives for electric cars with less than 400 km range decreased from 50,000 yuan to 25,000 yuan, while the incentives for vehicles ranging less than 250 km have been eliminated.According to USGS, China holds the largest amount of reserves with 44 million tons and Malaysia holds the least amount of reserves with 30 thousand tons. It also stated that the U.S. has USD 6.2 trillion worth of mineral reserves. However, the stringent regulatory policies towards mining in the U.S. has forced the companies to import the raw materials from China. Hence, the production of raw material has been a major challenge for the U.S companies.The increasing prices of rare earth elements and high investments to open new mines have given rise to recycling of the product. Japan is one of the major producer of recycled rare earth elements. In 2010, Hitachi developed a new technology for recycling rare-earth magnets from air conditioners and hard disk drives. It can separate recycle magnets approximately eight times more efficiently than conventional methods. In 2012, The Honda Corporation opened the first rare earth recycling plant. The company utilized used automotive parts containing metals to produce rare earth elements.The key players in the rare earth elements market are involved in acquisitions, expansions, and long term binding agreements with their customers. In Nov 2017, Hitachi Metals Ltd acquired Santoku Corporation, a Japanese manufacturer of alloys. This strategy was aimed at accelerating the production of neodymium magnet alloys in order to achieve sustainable growth in the global market.Further key findings from the report suggest:Neodymium is anticipated to register a CAGR of 8.3%, in terms of volume, from 2019 to 2025 owing to growing demand for permanent magnets Catalyst application accounted for a revenue share of 18.7% in 2018 owing to increasing demand from automotive and petroleum refining industries. Middle East & Africa is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.9%, in terms of volume, over the forecast period owing to rising investment in expansion of refinery capacities In 2016, Hitachi Metals Ltd entered into a joint venture with Zhong Ke San Huan Hi-Tech Co., Ltd. to manufacture Neodymium-Iron-Boron magnets The major players are adopting strategies like capacity expansion and agreements with the end-use industries to cater to growing demand for rare earth elements. For instance, in January 2018, Lynas Corporation signed an agreement with Bosch, an automotive component supplier. This agreement was aimed at ensuring continuous supply of rare earth materials to Bosch.Companies ProfiledLynas Corporation Ltd. Alkane Resources Ltd. Northern Minerals Ltd. Arafura Resources Ltd.

Global Rare Earth Elements Market: Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report, 2019-2025GlobeNewswireDecember 11, 2019 Wednesday 7:33 AM PTCopyright 2019 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: RESEARCH ANALYSIS AND REPORTSLength: 737 wordsBodyDublin, Dec.  11, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The     "Rare Earth Elements Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report By Product (Cerium, Dysprosium, Erbium), By Application (Magnets, Catalyst), By Region, And Segment Forecasts, 2019 - 2025"   report has been added to     ResearchAndMarkets.com's  offering.         The global rare earth elements market is anticipated to reach USD 5.62 billion by 2025, according to this report.The growing use of permanent magnets in the production of batteries for electric vehicles is expected to propel the demand for rare earth elements including neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, gadolinium, and terbium over the forecast period. Neodymium and praseodymium based rare earth permanent magnets are majorly used in the manufacturing of batteries.The growing demand for electric vehicles coupled with the government initiatives on reducing the CO2 emissions is expected to boost the demand for permanent magnets. In March 2019, the Chinese government reduced subsidies for electric vehicles in order to promote innovation amongst local manufacturers on account of declining costs. The incentives for electric cars with less than 400 km range decreased from 50,000 yuan to 25,000 yuan, while the incentives for vehicles ranging less than 250 km have been eliminated.According to USGS, China holds the largest amount of reserves with 44 million tons and Malaysia holds the least amount of reserves with 30 thousand tons. It also stated that the U.S. has USD 6.2 trillion worth of mineral reserves. However, the stringent regulatory policies towards mining in the U.S. has forced the companies to import the raw materials from China. Hence, the production of raw material has been a major challenge for the U.S companies.The increasing prices of rare earth elements and high investments to open new mines have given rise to recycling of the product. Japan is one of the major producer of recycled rare earth elements. In 2010, Hitachi developed a new technology for recycling rare-earth magnets from air conditioners and hard disk drives. It can separate recycle magnets approximately eight times more efficiently than conventional methods. In 2012, The Honda Corporation opened the first rare earth recycling plant. The company utilized used automotive parts containing metals to produce rare earth elements.The key players in the rare earth elements market are involved in acquisitions, expansions, and long term binding agreements with their customers. In Nov 2017, Hitachi Metals Ltd acquired Santoku Corporation, a Japanese manufacturer of alloys.

American Values Were Never the IssueAtlantic OnlineDecember 22, 2019 SundayCopyright 2019 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 988 wordsByline: Jemele HillBodyRecently, the National Basketball Association faced a torrent of criticism from several notable Republicans, including President Donald Trump, for supposedly prioritizing its business relationship with China-a repressive foreign dictatorship-over free speech and other American values.But strangely, that kind of outrage hasn't been directed at the professional golfers, including the superstar Phil Mickelson, who plan to play at an event next month in another repressive country: Saudi Arabia.  After the Houston Rockets' general manager, Daryl Morey, tweeted his support of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong in October, the NBA found itself in an uncomfortable dilemma in China, the league's second-most-important market. Commissioner Adam Silver said the Chinese government had pressured him to get Morey fired. While Silver never acquiesced, Senator Marco Rubio said it was "disgusting" to see the NBA being strong-armed by China. Rubio's fellow Florida Republican, Senator Rick Scott, tweeted that the NBA "is more interested in money than human rights." Trump            mocked two of the league's top coaches for "pandering to China" and being "so scared" of Beijing's wrath.Such indignation was conspicuously lacking-at least among conservative politicians-when Mickelson and other PGA Tour stars announced that they will play next month in the Saudi International tournament, a lucrative event on the European Tour. The host country, like China, has an abysmal record on human rights. According to Amnesty International, the kingdom executed 110 people in 2019 alone for various levels of political dissent. But, like many of the NBA's critics from a couple of months ago, Trump has been silent about the participation of Michelson and other American golfers.In fairness,            some in the media have chided Mickelson, because he's arguably the biggest name in the tournament field. But those criticisms have been mild compared with the vitriol directed at LeBron James, after the Los Angeles Lakers forward called Morey "misinformed" for cheering the Hong Kong protesters' fight for independence and democracy.           James was called a "coward" and            an "embarrassment," and Hong Kong protesters            burned his jersey.James's comments were cringe-worthy. Yet his tone was not nearly as unapologetic, politically apathetic, or insulting as the statements made by some of the golfers playing in Saudi Arabia in January.During an exchange on Twitter with a user who questioned him for playing in Saudi Arabia,            Mickelson replied, "I understand those who are upset or disappointed. You'll be ok. I'm excited to experience this for the first time." When Ewan Murray, the golf correspondent for The Guardian, challenged his decision to play in the Saudi tournament, Mickelson dismissed the criticism with a line he attributed to the comedian Kevin Hart: "           You do you booboo, cuz ima do me."It was a tone-deaf way to address a serious situation. Mickelson also has tried to rationalize playing in Saudi Arabia by calling it an opportunity to "grow the game" of golf. But it looks more like an opportunity for Mickelson to grow his bank account. In part because of the negative social and political implications, Tiger Woods            twice turned down offers of about $3 million just to appear in the Saudi tournament, ESPN has reported. Imagine what Mickelson must be getting paid to attend. Woods is not known for taking political stands, so the fact that he even considered it troublesome to play in Saudi Arabia speaks volumes.Last January, several of the world's top golfers played in the Saudi event just a few months after the Washington Post contributing journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered. The United Nations later determined that Khashoggi, an extremely vocal critic of the Saudi regime, was "the victim of a deliberate, premeditated execution, an extrajudicial killing for which the state of Saudi Arabia is responsible."The Saudi monarchy's involvement in the killing left the pro golfer Dustin Johnson unfazed. "Obviously, that was a concern with our team. I'm going over there to play a sport I'm paid to play. It's my job to play golf," he told reporters before appearing in the event last year. Referring to Khashoggi's death, he continued, "Unfortunately, it's in a part of the world where most people don't agree with what happened, and I definitely don't support anything like that. I'm going to play golf, not support them. I'm not a politician. I play golf."Had James or any other NBA player embraced money over moral responsibility as boldly as Johnson or Mickelson did, the castigation would have been severe and unrelenting.  But the relative silence greeting these pro golfers' decision to play in Saudi Arabia only proves just how fake and disingenuous the outrage directed at the NBA actually was.The China controversy was just a convenient tool used to taunt the NBA because several of the league's biggest stars have excoriated Trump and been outspoken about the social injustices that African Americans suffer all the time.            When the president chimed in, he made sure to belittle NBA coaches Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich, because both have used their high public profiles to disparage the president on several occasions. China's move against the Rockets gave Trump license to retaliate against his own critics.The real issue for Trump and other Republicans isn't that the NBA gave in to China-especially because these politicians don't seem to criticize other American businesses that do the same. Their problem is that prominent sports figures have dared to exercise their right to free speech at home.Because there are no political points to be gained, the professional golfers who will play in Saudi Arabia next month don't have to worry about their integrity or patriotism being questioned. They can just shut up and play golf.Load-Date: December 23, 2019End of Document

DANGERS AND QUESTIONS OF THE ZUCKERBERG ERAIPS - Inter Press ServiceNovember 15, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 IPS - Inter Press Service/Global Information NetworkLength: 2881 wordsByline: Roberto SavioDateline: ROME, Nov 15 2019 BodyThis year the Worldwide Web is thirty years old. For the first time since 1435, a citizen from Brazil could exchange their views and information with another in Finland.The Internet, the communications infrastructure for the Web is a little older. It was developed from the ARPANET, a US Defense Department project under the Advanced Research Projects Agency; the military designing it to decentralize communications in the case of a military attack.That network enabled scientists to communicate over email in universities. Then in 1989 Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in Switzerland invented the Hyperlink and the Worldwide Web (the Web) rapidly moved from scientists automating information sharing between universities and research institutions to the first Websites now available to the general public.In 2002 the first social media sites began as specialised websites. LinkedIn launched in 2003 then FaceBook in 2004, Twitter in 2006, Instagram in 2010 and so on...My generation regarded the arrival of the Web as a great prospect for democracy. We come from the Gutenberg era, an era that in 1435 changed the world. From manuscripts drafted by monks to be read by a few people in monasteries, the invention of reusable movable type meant that in just 20 years already eight million copies of printed books went all across Europe.Among many other things it also meant the creation of information. People who heretofore had merely a scant horizon beyond their immediate surroundings, could suddenly access information about their country, and even the entire world. The first newspaper was printed in Strasbourg in 1605. From then until 1989, the world was filled with information.Information had a very serious limit. It was a vertical structure. Just a few people sent news to a large number of recipients; there was little feedback. It wasn't participatory, it required large startup investments, it was easily used by economic and political powers.In the Third World, the media system was part of the State. In 1976, 88% of World news flows emanated from just three countries: the US, the UK and France. International news agencies based in these three countries included Associated Press (AP), United Press International (UPI), Reuters and Agence France Press (AFP).The world's media were dependent on their news services. Some alternative news agencies, like Inter Press Services, were able to put a dent in their monopoly. But what this Western media published, by and large was a biased window on the world.Then came the Internet, and with it, came horizontal communication. Every receiver was also a sender. For the first time since 1435, media were no longer the only window on the world. Like-minded people could take part in social, cultural and economic interactions.This change was evident in theÂ United Nations Woman's World Conference in Beijing, 1995.Â Women created networks prior to the conference,Â and came with a common plan of action.Â Governments were not so prepared, so the Declaration of Beijing was a turning point, one which was entirely unlike the bland declarations from the previous four World Conferences.Another good example is the campaign to eliminate anti-personnel landmines, started by the Canadian activist Jody Williams in 1992. This soon blossomed into a large coalition of Non-Governmental Organizations from more than 100 countries.Under mountingÂ pressure Norway decided to introduce the issue to the UN, where the US, China, and other manufacturers of landmines like the USSR, tried to block the debate, declaring that they would vote against it.The activists did not care, and 128 countries adopted the Mine Ban Treaty in 1997 with the US, China and the USSR voting against. A vast global movement was more powerful than the traditional role of the Security Council. The Internet had become the tool to create world coalitions.Those are just two examples of how far the Internet could change the traditional system of Westphalian state sovereignty as defined at the Conference of Westphalia in 1648. The Internet spanned national frontiers to bring on a new era.Let's say, for the sake of symbolism, that the Internet brought us from the Gutenberg Era, to the Zuckerberg Era, to cite the inventor of Facebook and a leading instance of what went wrong with this medium.The Internet came upon us with an unprecedented force. It took 38 years for the radio to reach 50 million people: television took 13 years; and the Web just four years. It had a billion users in 2005, two billion in 2011, and it now has three and a half billion users, three billion of those using social media.So the two traditional pillars of power, the political system and the economic system, also had to learn how to use the Internet. The US provides a good example. All of American media (national and regional publications) involves printing 50 million copies daily.Quality newspapers - both the conservative broadsheets like the Wall Street Journal, and progressive ones like the Washington Post or the New York Times - together print ten million copies a day. Trump has sixty three million followers on Twitter; they read Trump's tweets but don't buy newspapers.The Web has had two unforeseen developments. One was the dramatic reinforcement of the consumer society. Today advertising budgetsÂ are ten times larger than budgets for education, and education only lasts a few years compared with a lifetime of advertisement.With the development of social networks, people - now more consumers than citizens - have become objects for marketing goods and services, and recently also for political campaigns. All systems of information and communications extract our personal data, selling us on as consumers.Now the TV can see us while we watch it. Smartphones have become microphones that listen in on our conversations. The notion of privacy is gone. If we could access our data, we would find out that weÂ are followed every minute of the day, even into our bedrooms.Secret algorithms form profiles of each and every one of us. Based on these profiles platforms provide us with the news, the products, and the people that these algorithms believe we will like, thus insulating us in our own bubbles.Artificial intelligence learns from the data that it accumulates. China, with 1.35 billion people, will provide its researchers with more data than Europe and United States together. The Internet has given birth to a digital extractive economy, where the raw material is no longer minerals, but we humans.The other development that went awry is that the digital extractive economy has created unprecedented wealth.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos was recently divorced from his wife. In the settlement she received 36 billion dollars yet Bezos remains among the 10 richest people in the world. This is just one story from an increasingly sad reality of social injustice, where 80 of the world's richest persons hold the same wealth as nearly three billion poor people.A new sector is evolving, the "surveillance capitalism" sector, where money is made not from the production of good and services, but from data extracted from people.This new systemÂ exploits humans to give to the owners of this technology,Â a concentration of wealth, knowledge and power without precedent in history. The ability to develop facial recognition and other surveillance instruments no longer lies in the realms of science fiction.The Chinese government has already given every citizen a digital number, where all their 'good' and 'bad' behaviours converge. If a citizen goes below a level, their children will not be allowed to go to a good school, and the citizen themselves, though they may still be able to travel by train, won't have access to planes.These technologies will soon be in use all over the planet. London town now has 627,000 surveillance cameras, one for every fourteen citizens; in Beijing it's one for every seven.Â  A study conducted by The Rand Corporation estimates that by 2050, Europe too would also have one camera for every seven citizens.The interrelationship between democracy and the Internet is now creating a belated awareness in the political system. The European Parliament has just released a study, about the negative impact of the Internet. These impacts are:Â Â Â Â Â Â  Internet Addiction There is unanimity among doctors and sociologists that a new generation is coming, one which is very different from the previous one.Â Over 90% of those aged 15-24 uses the Internet, as against 11% for those over 55. Young people spend 21 hours per week on the PC, and 18 hours on a smart phone. This leaves little time for social and cultural interaction. 4.4% of European adolescents now show pathological InternetÂ use "that affects their lives and health". The American Academy of Psychology has officially included Internet Addiction as a new ailment.Â Magnetic resonance studies of those with Internet Addiction Disorder (IAD) show that they exhibit the same brain structure alterations as those who suffer from drug or alcohol addiction. Â Â Â Â Â Â  Harming cognitive development A particular warning is given about children under two years of age. More than 20 minutes a day of screen use reduces some of their neural development. People pushed to isolation tend to develop symptoms of distress, anger, loss of control, social withdrawal, familial conflicts, and an inability to act in real life. Internet users in tests were faster than non-users at finding data, but they were less able to retain data. Â Â Â Â Â Â  Information Overload The condition of having too much information hampers the ability to understand an issue, or to make effective decisions, an important issue for managers, consumers, and social media users. According to Microsoft, attention span for a title has gone from 12 seconds in 2000 down to 8 seconds in 2016. The attention span for reading has gone from 12 minutes to 8 minutes. Two new terms can be used: one, the 'popping brain', describes a brain less adept to adapt to a slower pace of real life and then there is 'Neuroplasticity'; i.e. the ability to alter one's behaviour after a new experience. Frequent immersion in virtual worlds can reduce neuroplasticity and also make it more difficult to adapt to the slower pace of real life. The need to compete in speed between social media channels is well known. For example Amazon estimates that oneÂ second of performance delay would cost 1.16 billion losses per year in sales. Â Â Â Â Â Â  Harmful effects in knowledge and belief The fact that social media deliberately tends to gather together users with similar views, tastes and habits, is fragmentingÂ society in a negative way for democracy, resulting in closed systems that don't allow for alternative viewpoints. Adolescents no longer discuss significant subjects. They go to their virtual world, and if they come across somebody from another group, they tend to insult each other. The Internet is full of fake news and misleading information, and users have great difficulty distinguishing accurate from inaccurate information. Echo chambers appear to be far more pervasive, and may unite those with more extreme and partisan political and ideological positions, therefore undermining possibilities for civil discourse and tolerance, supporting radicalization. Â Â Â Â Â Â  Harming public/private boundaries. The Internet blurs the distinction between the private and the public. Private life becomes public. This is especially negative for teenagers who lose the concept of privacy, for example by sending private photos across the Internet. One important observation is that teenagers now get their sexual education from pornography, where women are always an object to satisfy men's sexual phantasies. This is in turn creating a lack of respect for women, and a new generation that risk, for new reasons, returning to a patriarchal society. Group violations of teenage girls are clearly a result of this trend. Â Â Â Â Â Â  Harming social relationships The Internet is clearly a powerful instrument to create new communities. However, when used negatively, it can also damage communities, because of the migration to Internet of many human activities such as shopping, commerce, socialising, leisure, professional activities and personal interaction. That migration creates impoverished communication, incivility and a lack of trust and commitment. Â Â Â Â Â Â  Harming democracy The Internet has been a powerful tool for participation, and therefore for democracy. However the study notes with concern that a growing number of activities are also harmful to democracy. These include:Â a)Â The incivility of many online political discourses,Â b)Â Political and ideological polarisation, uniquely possible using the Internet.Â c)Â Misinformation, and, in particular, fake news,Â d)Â Voter manipulations through profiling based on harvested social media information. We all know what happened in the US elections with Cambridge Analytica data, gathered by Facebook, and how thousands of false web users and bots now heavily interfere in elections.We should add to this study some other considerations. The first is that finance now is now also run by algorithms.Â The algorithms do not only decide when to sell or buy shares, but now also decide where to invest.The Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) last month reached 14,400 billion dollars in trades, more than that traded by humans. This trend will continue with the development of artificial intelligence and soon finance will become even more dehumanized.Â  Even when Internet users invest themselves they too will be directed by machines and algorithms.A second consideration is that young people read less and less. Reading a book is very different to scrolling a screen. We are experiencing a progressive reduction in levels of culture. It's not uncommon to have university students that make grammar and spelling mistakes.Let us remember that when the Internet was still new, its proponents told us: it is not important to know, rather it is important to know how to find.Â We are more and more dependent on search engines, learning less and less, and we are unable to connect that data in a personal holistic logical system.There is clearly a need for regulation to reduce the negative aspects of the Internet and to reinforce positive values. The owners of social media platforms are now under increased scrutiny so they have taken the road of self-regulation.Twitter, for instance, has decided that it cannot be used for political purposes. ZuckerbergÂ is an exponent of market myths telling us that good news will automatically prevail over fake news. Except that platforms help users to read and findÂ only what they like, to maintain our attention, providing us what is striking, unusual and provocative. This is not a free market.The Zuckerberg era is clearly creating an entirely different generation, very different from the generations of the Gutenberg era. This raises many questions, from privacy to freedom of expression (now in private hands), from who will regulate, what to regulate and how.A five year-old child is now very different from a Gutenberg five year-old. We are in a period of transition.Â The meaning of democracy is changing. International relations are moving away from the search for common values via multilateralism, to a tide of nationalist, xenophobic and selfish views of the world.Terms like peace, cooperation, accountability, participation and transparency are becoming outdated.Â What is clear is that the present system is no longer sustainable. Policies disappear from debate, now referred to only as 'politics'. Vision and paradigms are getting scarce.Over and above all of this the threat of climate change is looming; yet last year toxic emissions from the five largest countries increased by 5%. Young people are largely absent from political institutions as is shown by the vote on Brexit where only 23% of the 18-25 age group participated.At this very moment we have large demonstrations in thirteen countries all over the world. In those streets young people do participate, frequently demonstrating rage, frustration and violence. If we cannot bring back horizontal communication to the Internet and we do not free it from the commercial fracturing of young people, the future is hardly rosy.Yet as the marches against Climate Change clearly demonstrate, if young people want to change the world, values and vision will return. It is evident that the Internet can be a very powerful tool. But who will redress these failings? Will the Internet become a tool for participation? How will this be done?These are questions that political institutions, if they really care for democracy, must address as soon as possible. TheÂ Zuckerberg era must make this choice now, in a few years time it will already be too late...Publisher of OtherNews, Italian-ArgentineÂ Roberto SavioÂ is an economist, journalist, communication expert, political commentator, activist for social and climate justice and advocate of an anti neoliberal global governance.

Hong Kong protesters set fire to entrance of fortified university to hold back policeCNN.comNovember 16, 2019 Saturday GENERAL_EDIT_CORRECTION ERROR Document ID 0 Has error Validate old format failed - Input Date Invalid - 0031: Unparseable date: "0031"ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 1108 wordsByline: By Ben Westcott, Jo Shelley and Rebecca Wright, CNNDateline: Hong Kong BodyProtesters set fire to the entrance of Hong Kong's Polytechnic University early Monday in a last ditch attempt to stop riot police from entering, as the siege of the heavily fortified campus entered its second day.The flames followed a night of violence as students hurled petrol bombs at Hong Kong police, who deployed water cannons and warned that if given no other choice they would use "live rounds."Around 8 a.m. on Monday, dozens of protesters attempted to leave the university through the main entrance as police fired rounds of tear gas. CNN witnessed multiple protesters being led away by police on the roads leading from the campus.The Hong Kong police force has yet to disclose how many people have been arrested in the almost 24-hour siege, and there are no clear numbers for those who have been injured.As of Monday morning, several hundred protesters were thought to remain barricaded inside the university's main building.Over the weekend, the site had been used to stockpile weapons, including bows and arrows, catapults and petrol bombs, though it was unclear how many weapons remained.Earlier Monday morning, the president of the university's student union said in a statement posted to Facebook that "thousands" of students were still on the campus, some of whom were injured. "We have tried to communicate with school authorities, but we have not received any reply after more than two hours," the president Derek Liu said.Liu accused riot police of storming the collegiate area of the university and carrying out "a massive arrest" of protesters. In a statement, police said claims that police "raided" the university were "totally false."Images from the ground on Monday morning showed scenes of devastation around the campus, with debris and trash littering nearby streets.Schools are closed across the city on Monday, extending a disruption that began last week. In a statement on Sunday, the government said the closures were "for the sake of safety."University 'widely damaged'Polytechnic University is one of a number of university campuses used in the past week as a rallying point for Hong Kong's anti-government protest movement. But unlike other campuses, such as the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the Polytechnic University sits in the center of the city, close to a number of major roads including a cross harbor tunnel.It's in the Hung Hom district, just across Victoria Harbor from Hong Kong Island, and is also less than 164 feet (50 meters) from a Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) base.Police attempted to clear the roads around Polytechnic University on Saturday night but were forced to back down after protesters started fires on the street and threw petrol bombs and bricks using catapults. Their hold on the high ground made it difficult for police vehicles to advance.Earlier Sunday, a police media liaison officer was hit in the leg with an arrow during the skirmish and police fired water cannons at protesters in the streets."They showed total disregard for the safety of everyone at scene," police said in a statement Sunday, confirming they tried to disperse the group using tear gas.A 23-year-old protester and Polytechnic University alumnus told CNN on Sunday he didn't have a plan and was just waiting to see how the police would react. "If we don't come out, no one will come out and protect our freedoms. Polytechnic University is my home," he said.Protesters on Sunday were using catapults to launch bricks and other hard objects at police lines from the university's balconies."Such attacks pose a grave threat to the safety of police officers, reporters and first aiders at the scene," said police in a statement, accusing protesters of firing petrol bombs and metal balls at their lines.On Sunday, the management of Hong Kong Polytechnic University issued a statement saying "dangerous chemicals" had been stolen from laboratories and condemned the protesters' "illegal acts and violence" in the campus which has, they say, "been widely damaged.""We understand that students care about the current social situation, however, they must be calm and rational when fighting for anything," the statement said. "Resorting to violence or other radical acts will not help solve the problem."In a fiercely worded statement, the police labeled the group holding the university "rioters," a loaded term in Hong Kong's protests that could result in a heavy prison sentence.In a statement Sunday evening, the Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union and the university's Staff Association said they were "very worried" about the safety of students and bystanders."We call on both sides to exercise restraint and avoid the use of deadly weapons. The current stalemate is caused by a series of government decision-making mistakes and should be resolved responsibly," the statement said.Six months of chaosThe protests in Hong Kong have now been raging for almost six months after they began in June over a controversial China extradition bill, which sparked huge marches across the city.When the government suspended but didn't withdraw the bill, the movement's focus quickly expanded to focus on complaints of police brutality and wider calls for democracy.The protests took a turn in early November after the protest-related death of a 22-year-old student, the first since the demonstrations began. Protesters began to fortify university campuses across the city, holding off police with weapons ranging from bows and arrows and petrol bombs.With both the government and protesters refusing to back down, there is no immediate end in sight to the Hong Kong demonstrations.Showing his dissatisfaction with the situation, Chinese President Xi Jinping made rare public comments on the demonstrations Thursday.He said that "radical" protesters had trampled the city's rule of law and that "stopping the violence and restoring order" was Hong Kong's most "urgent task."It came just hours before a 70-year-old man, who was struck by a brick during clashes between protesters and their opponents, died of his injuries. Police blamed protesters for throwing the object that killed him.For the first time since the start of the demonstrations in June, the PLA hit the streets of Hong Kong on Saturday, but only to clear up barricades and debris.Even that incursion was enough to spur pro-democracy lawmakers in Hong Kong to push for an explanation from the city's government.Chinese soldiers' efforts to clear roadblocks outside their barracks in Kowloon Tong was "purely a voluntary community activity initiated by themselves," the Hong Kong special administrative region government said in a statement to CNN.Load-Date: November 19, 2019End of Document

Huawei resists U.S. sanctions with 18% increase in revenuesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 31, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 419 wordsBody       In 2019, China's Huawei crossed several obstacles to its activity launched by the United States. However, the year ends with a positive balance just below the previous period.                                                Huawei is preparing to end 2019 with improved results despite sanctions that it has been targeted by the United States, which have blacklisted this company.Huawei's revenues increased 18% in the year to $122 billion, Huawei announced on Tuesday, just below growth of 19.5% a year earlier. In May, the company's founder Ren Zhengfei's predictions pointed to the profit being unchanged compared to the previous year.These figures were achieved after, precisely in May this year, the White House banned Huawei's exports to the United States by blacklisting the company. Business with U.S. companies was thus equally limited. Analysts, according to the Financial Times, attribute the company's results to a rapid reconfiguration of the supply chain."Huawei has made a good start for two reasons: it re-reputed the components originating in the United States very quickly; the inclusion in the list still allows the company to buy goods from several U.S. companies," Dragonomics analyst Dan Wang said in a statement to the FT. "There is a risk, however, that the U.S. will escalate sanctions and remove the latest option," he said.Huawei recorded orders for 240 million mobile phones in 2019, up from 206 million last year. This is the market where analysts see a higher risk, as Huawei cannot rely on Google's software due to the sanctions imposed on it – which led Huawei to create its own software.U.S. attacksThe growing tension between the United States and Huawei dates back to 2018, when Huawei's financial manager and its founder's daughter was detained in Canada by order of the United States following an investigation aimed at possible violations of sanctions to Iran.At the same time, the United States has come forward with accusations that the Chinese government may be using this technology for espionage actions. In this sense, Washington put pressure on its allies to also ban the Chinese manufacturer's equipment, citing concerns about national security and data privacy.Several countries have shown reluctance to accept Huawei's services from Germany to the UK, and some even ruled out the possibility of the company participating in the 5G network. However, the company had other victories, notably in India, which accepted Huawei to participate in the 5G spectrum tests.Load-Date: January 27, 2020End of Document

Macao proves success of 'one country, two systems' for 20 yearsPR NewswireDecember 19, 2019 Thursday 9:00 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 611 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Dec. 19, 2019 BodyPR NewswireA news report by China.org.cn on Macao's successful practice of "one country, two systems": Macao, a Chinese city on the coast of the South China Sea, like Hong Kong, experienced colonial rule for a long time. On Dec. 20, 1999, Macao was officially returned to the motherland by Portugal.However, unlike Hong Kong, now experiencing a serious test, Macao has remained prosperous and stable.After returning to the motherland, Macao's regional GDP in 2018 stood at 444.7 billion Macao patacas, compared to 51.9 billion Macao patacas in 1999, with the unemployment rate falling from 6.4% to 1.8% over the same period.It's noteworthy that, on the eve of the return, Macao had suffered a continuous economic decline, as people were worried about its future and the implementation of the "one country, two systems" policy. However, in the past two decades, Macao has maintained continuous and prosperous development, benefiting from the great importance given by the Chinese central government to various national strategies. Besides the gambling industry, Macao's potential has been tapped in many other fields, such as connecting China and the West in terms of trade and culture, developing industries based on science, technology and finance, and promoting the modernization of traditional Chinese medicine. Today, Macao is one of the world's fastest growing economies, and has one of the world's highest levels of per capita GDP.Macao shares a similar history and is under the same policy as Hong Kong. However, it has remained politically stable with balanced development of economy and society. It has also gradually integrated into China's governance system and development plan. An important reason for this, besides the differences with Hong Kong in regards to population and environment, is that Macao has found effective ways and gained positive experiences in implementing the "one country, two systems" policy in line with its own conditions.When formulating the Basic Law of Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR), the drafting team borrowed experiences from work related to the Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR, besides considering Macao's special conditions. The law is more rigorous and reasonable in stipulations on administrative dominance and democracy, thus avoiding the possibility of forming a "weak government" incapable of effective governance. Meanwhile, Macao's social security and public welfare systems are able to meet the changing needs of local people and disadvantaged groups amid rapid social development.More importantly, the Macao society, with various social organizations, has a strong sense of patriotism. Such a political environment and various mechanisms ensure that Macao is run by people who love the motherland. They can better integrate local ideas and local interests into the country's overall plans. They have a deeper understanding and show stronger support to domestic projects and international proposals, such as the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the Belt and Road Initiative.In the past 20 years, Macao's success in implementing "one country, two systems" has proven that the policy is correct and vibrant. We have every reason to believe that it can provide some positive experiences for Hong Kong's governance and Taiwan's return.China Mosaichttp://www.china.org.cn/video/node_7230027.htmMacao proves success of 'one country, two systems' for 20 yearshttp://www.china.org.cn/video/2019-12/19/content_75529342.htm View original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/macao-proves-success-of-one-country-two-systems-for-20-years-300977428.htmlSOURCE China.org.cnCONTACT: Ni Jingjing, +86-158-1109-0105, pr@china.org.cnLoad-Date: December 20, 2019End of Document

The company's loss estimate is consistent with industry insured losses of approx. $11 bln and its expected market share of less than 1% for this catastrophe event.Due to the nature of this event, including the complexity of loss assessment and factors contributing to the losses, and the preliminary nature of the information available to prepare this estimate, the actual net ultimate loss for this event may differ materially from this current estimate. The additional complexity caused by the multiple catastrophic events that have occurred in Japan in recent months, together with the expectation of a relatively high proportion of flood related losses attributable to Typhoon Hagibis, are also likely to lead to increased uncertainty surrounding the estimated net ultimate loss for this event.16:28BDX Becton Dickinson increases quarterly cash dividend to $0.79/share from $0.77/share (253.86 +3.97)16:25PANW Palo Alto Networks beats by $0.02, reports revs in-line with billings above guidance; guides Q2 revs in-line; reaffirms FY20 revs guidance; increases billings slightly, guides down EPS, impacted by announced acquisition of Aporeto for $150 mln (250.28 +3.41)Reports Q1 (Oct) earnings of $1.05 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.03; revenues rose 17.7% year/year to $772 mln vs the $769.34 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Billings increase 18% $897.4 mln vs. $870-890 mln guidanceCo issues guidance for Q2, sees EPS of $1.11-1.13, including Aporeto acquisition cost, may not be comparable to $1.30 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q2 revs of $838-848 mln vs. $844.65 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; billings $985-1.0 bln.Co issues guidance for FY20, lowers EPS to $4.90-5.00 from $5.00-5.10, including Aporeto, may not be comparable to $5.07 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; reaffirms FY20 revs of $3.44-3.48 bln vs. $3.47 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; raises billings to $4.105-4.165 bln from $4.095-4.155 blnCo is acquiring Aporeto Inc., a machine identity-based microsegmentation company for $150 million in cash Aporeto identifies workloads and applies microsegmentation across all infrastructures, helping customers secure their applications at scale.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal. It should be noted that a separate report from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal before the 2020 election is unlikely to be reached did not have a noticeable effect on the market.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.4%), which typically outperforms when the prevailing view on trade is positive, led all sectors in gains amid strength in the semiconductor stocks.

The acquisition is structured with an upfront payment of approx. $55 mln, which will be funded primarily through MTS' existing revolving credit facility, with expected earnout payments of up to an additional $25 mln based on financial performance through June 2021. Given the strong backlog position of MTS at the end of fiscal 2019, the solid backlog position of R&D, and the expected incremental Adjusted EBITDA generation, MTS expects rapid strengthening of its balance sheet following the closing of this acquisition, with a forecasted year-over-year net reduction in leverage by the end of fiscal 2020.16:14MTSC MTS Systems misses by $0.02, beats on revs; guides FY20 EPS below two analyst estimate, revs above two analyst estimate (60.56 +2.39)Reports Q4 (Sep) earnings of $0.37 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 worse than the two analyst estimate of $0.39; revenues rose 13.2% year/year to $224.08 mln vs the $218.07 mln two analyst estimate."As we enter our new fiscal year, we are excited about the resilience of our markets, our record year-end backlog, which topped $420 million, and the customer reception to our new product offerings.

Remission was defined as a BVAS score of zero and being off glucocorticoid treatment for ANCA vasculitis for at least the preceding four weeks. The pre-specified primary endpoints were remission of acute vasculitis activity at week 26 and sustained remission at week 52, where avacopan therapy was at least statistically non-inferior to the currently used glucocorticoid-containing standard of care (glucocorticoid SOC). The two primary endpoints were tested sequentially using a gatekeeping procedure to preserve the Type I error.BVAS remission at week 26 was achieved in 72.3% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 70.1% of subjects in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (p<0.0001 for non-inferiority). Sustained remission at 52 weeks was observed in 65.7% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 54.9% in the glucocorticoid SOC control group, achieving both non-inferiority and superiority to glucocorticoid standard of care (p=0.0066 for superiority of avacopan). Importantly, subjects who received avacopan experienced additional benefits compared to those in the glucocorticoid SOC control group.The topline safety results revealed an acceptable safety profile in this serious and life-threatening disease, with fewer subjects having serious adverse events (SAEs) in the avacopan group than in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (42% vs. 45%, respectively). Most reported SAEs were related to underlying ANCA vasculitis disease and commensurate with rates in previously published ANCA vasculitis trials. There were fewer subjects with serious infections in the avacopan group than the glucocorticoid SOC control group. A full analysis of the data is underway and expanded results are expected to be announced in the coming weeks.16:08HPE Hewlett Packard Enterprise beats by $0.03, misses on revs; guides Q1 EPS in-line; reaffirms FY20 guidance (17.45 +0.33)Reports Q4 (Oct) earnings of $0.49 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.46; revenues fell 9.2% year/year to $7.21 bln vs the $7.41 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.GAAP gross margins of 33.2%, up 250 basis points from the prior-year period and Non-GAAP of 33.3%, up 260 basis points from the prior-year period.

This includes the Demicks Lake Expansion project under construction in North Dakota, which is expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2020 and as designed will increase capacity by 175 mln cubic feet per day.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 97.80.Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for November declined to 70 from 71 in October.
