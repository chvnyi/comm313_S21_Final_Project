Shares of technology companies, particularly the mega-cap stocks, underperformed the broader market.The Nasdaq Composite lost 1.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 lost 0.6%.St. Louis Fed President James Bullard (FOMC voter), who was the lone dissident in this month's FOMC meeting, said he didn't think it was necessary to cut the fed funds rate by 50 basis points. Instead, he favored a 25 basis points reduction, viewing it as an "insurance" cut.This stance from one of the Fed's most vocal doves, in addition to comments from Fed Chair Powell, tempered the market's hopes for a 50 basis points cut next month. Fed Chair Powell reminded the market that monetary policy should not overreact to any individual data point or short-term swings in sentiment.Expectations for the upcoming G-20 summit were also lowered after a White House official told Reuters that the U.S. will not accept any new tariff conditions and that the U.S. is not willing to concede to the Chinese on trade. The goal is to simply reopen talks, which was not the constructive tone the market was anticipating.These subdued expectations, along with some disappointing economic data, contributed to some broad-based profit taking in equities. Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower, led by the mega-cap stocks within the information technology (-1.8%), communication services (-1.6%), and consumer discretionary (-1.1%) sectors. The materials sector was unchanged.Regarding economic data, new home sales for May and consumer sentiment for June both declined below expectations. On a related note, home construction company Lennar (LEN 48.22, -3.19, -6.2%) provided investors with downside Q3 guidance.In M&A news, the health care sector (-0.4%) was home to a mega-merger deal on Tuesday. AbbVie (ABBV 65.70, -12.75, -16.3%) announced it will acquire Allergan (AGN 162.43, +32.86, +25.4%) for about $63 billion, or $188.24 per share, in cash and stock. With shares of AbbVie losing over 16%, the premium was reduced to 37% over AGN's closing price on Monday.U.S. Treasuries finished on a mostly higher note. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 1.74%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.99%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 96.16. WTI crude was unchanged at $57.81/bbl.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data:The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index fell to 121.5 in June (Briefing.com consensus 132.0) from a downwardly revised 131.3 (from 134.1) in May. The index is at its lowest level since September 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects growing concern about trade tensions among consumers that had been previously lacking, but which had been showing up in business confidence surveys. Flagging confidence on the part of businesses and consumers alike, if it is sustained, is an adverse development for the growth outlook.New home sales declined 7.8% m/m in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 626,000 (Briefing.com consensus 683,000) from an upwardly revised 679,000 (from 673,000) in April.The key takeaway from the report is that demand was relatively soft despite a drop in mortgage rates and a 2.8% yr/yr decline in the median sales price of $308,000.The FHFA Housing Price Index for April increased 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%) following an unrevised 0.1% increase in March. The S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for April increased 2.5% as expected after increasing a revised 2.6% in March (from 2.7%).Looking ahead, investors will receive the following reports on Wednesday: Durable Goods Orders for May, the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index, and the Advance reports for International Trade in Goods, Retail Inventories, and Wholesales Inventories for May.Nasdaq Composite +18.8% YTDS&P 500 +16.4% YTDRussell 2000 +12.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.8% YTD16:19FDX FedEx beats by $0.18, reports revs in-line, guides FY20 EPS below consensus (156.01 -4.90)Reports Q4 (May) earnings of $5.01 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.18 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $4.83; revenues rose 2.8% year/year to $17.81 bln vs the $17.85 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Q4 was hurt by lower FedEx International Priority package and freight revenues at FedEx Express, higher costs at FedEx Ground and business realignment costs primarily associated with the U.S.-based voluntary employee buyout program. Partially offsetting these factors were the benefits from US volume growth, increased revenue per shipment at FedEx Freight and FedEx Ground, lower variable incentive compensation expenses and a favorable net impact of fuel at all transportation segments.Outlook: Co guides to FY20 non-GAAP EPS being a mid-single-digit percentage point decline (prior to the year-end MTM retirement plan accounting adjustment and excluding estimated TNT Express integration expenses). Current consensus is at $16.16, and FY19 actual was $15.52. So consensus is estimating 4% EPS growth, so the guidance of a mid-single-digit decline is a good bit below consensus estimates.16:19JAZZ Jazz Pharma will host webcast on July 2 at 4:30 p.m. EDT to provide investors with an update on Sunosi (136.50 +5.19)Sunosi (solriamfetol) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on March 20, 2019 to improve wakefulness in adult patients with excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

In connection with the transaction, the company expects to bring in a joint venture partner prior to closing.The property is currently 87.4% leased primarily to accounting, legal and technology tenants.16:17CFMS ConforMIS has secured up to $30 mln in debt financing from Innovatus Capital Partners and East West Bank and $3 mln in equity financing from Innovatus (3.84 -0.03)In addition, Innovatus purchased $3 million of the Company's common stock from the Company at the previous day's closing price.16:16APLE Apple Hospitality REIT appoints Rachael Rothman to position of Executive Vice President and CFO, effective July 1, 2019 (15.70 -0.02)Ms. Rothman will succeed Bryan Peery as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Treasuries started the cash session just above yesterday's closing levels, spending the first hour of the action in a narrow range. The opening gains were extended amid early weakness on the equity side, with Treasuries rising to highs after the release of weaker than expected New Home Sales for May (actual 626,000; Briefing.com consensus 683,000) and weaker than expected Consumer Confidence for June (actual 121.5; Briefing.com consensus 132.0). Midday action saw a pullback from highs, as the market responded to speeches from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Fed Chairman Jay Powell. The St. Louis Fed President was up first, and while he said that this is a good time for an "insurance cut", he ruled out the need for a 50-basis point cut. Fed Chairman Powell struck a similar tone, noting that the outlook has changed since early May, but monetary policy should not overreact to short-term swings in sentiment. The midday pullback was most visible in shorter tenors while the long bond remained near its high until the close. Today's $40 bln 2-yr Treasury note auction was met with strong demand. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.2% to 96.13, recording its first gain in five days. Yield Check: 2-yr: UNCH at 1.74% 3-yr: -1 bp to 1.68% 5-yr: -2 bps to 1.73% 10-yr: -3 bps to 1.99% 30-yr: -2 bps to 2.53%News: The implied probability of a 50-bps rate cut at the July meeting decreased to 36.4% from 42.6% after today's speeches from FOMC voters Bullard and Powell. Reuters reported that President Trump will meet with China's President Xi Jinping in Japan on Saturday. U.S. envoy to NATO, Kay Bailey Hutchinson, reiterated that Turkey will be excluded from the F-35 program if the country takes delivery of a Russian-made anti-aircraft weapon system. Chinese press reported that local government bond issuance could hit a record high in June due to continued stimulus. South Korea's Consumer Confidence decreased to 97.5 in June from 97.9, hitting a five-month low. The new British Prime Minister will be named on July 23. European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos said that the effects of negative rates must be watched closely, and that falling growth expectations could weaken the banking sector. $40 bln 2-year Treasury note auction results (prior 12-auction average): High yield: 1.695% (2.572%) Bid-to-cover: 2.58 (2.63) Indirect bid: 48.5% (46.3%) Direct bid: 24.2% (15.6%) Today's Data: New home sales declined 7.8% m/m in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 626,000 (Briefing.com consensus 683,000) from an upwardly revised 679,000 (from 673,000) in April. The key takeaway from the report is that demand was relatively soft despite a drop in mortgage rates and a 2.8% yr/yr decline in the median sales price of $308,000. The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index fell to 121.5 in June (Briefing.com consensus 132.0) from a downwardly revised 131.3 (from 134.1) in May. The index is at its lowest level since September 2017. The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects growing concern about trade tensions among consumers that had been previously lacking, but which had been showing up in business confidence surveys. Flagging confidence on the part of businesses and consumers alike, if it is sustained, is an adverse development for the growth outlook. The FHFA Housing Price Index increased 0.4% in April (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%) after increasing 0.1% in March.

The transaction represents a premium of +45% relative to co's closing price yesterday. Co's shareholders will own approx. 17% of AbbVie on a fully diluted basis following the closing of the acquisition. Shares reach their highest levels since November. ELAN (34.67 +3.4%): Various pharmaceutical companies and other healthcare names see strength in the wake of the AbbVie/Allergan deal. CAG (29.02 +3.27%): Posts moderate gains a few days in advance of its next quarterly results, which will be reported before the open on Thursday; in recent press, co today announced several product expansions for its Healthy Choice and Birds Eye brands. Consumer staples sector sees modest relative strength.Large Cap LosersABBV (66.04 -15.83%): Acquiring Allergan (AGN), as detailed above. Co sees the deal as providing immediate scale and profitability to its growth platform and significantly expanding and diversifying its global commercial scale and revenue base with new therapeutic areas, including medical aesthetics. Co expects the acquisition to provide annual pre-tax synergies and other cost reductions of at least $2 bln in year three as a result of optimizing the research and early stage portfolio, reducing overlapping R&D resources, and driving SG&A efficiencies, among other factors. It is expected to be 10% accretive to adj. EPS over the first full year, with peak accretion of greater than 20%. Annual combined revenue for 2019 is estimated at approx. $48 bln. Sinks to two-year lows. SHOP (284.44 -8.78%): Downgraded to Neutral from Outperform at Wedbush, citing valuation; the firm also increased co's price target to $305. The stock, which reached new all-time highs last week a bit shy of $340 and which continues to hold gains of circa +105% year-to-date, was also downgraded yesterday at ROTH Capital and last week at CIBC. ATHM (82.13 -7.73%): Chinese stocks generally underperform, with the Shanghai Composite Index having today ended a streak of gaining action, as the crucial G-20 meeting looms.

Fed Chair Powell didn't say anything either in a speech today to stoke expectations that the Fed is leaning at this juncture toward a 50 basis points cut at the July meeting.The other selling catalyst has been acknowledgment from White House officials that the goal for the G-20 meeting is to reopen trade talks, but that the U.S. will not accept any tariff conditions. That could be a stumbling block right out of the gate for China, which wants the U.S. to roll back existing tariffs. Separately, there was also an acknowledgment from White House officials that the trade talks could go on for months or years, which left an impression that the trade spat could be a prolonged one.Up to this point, there was some budding hope that the U.S. and China wil at least agree to forestall new tariff actions at this weekend's meeting. That's possible, but clearly, no guarantee has been given.Effectively, then, a short-term overbought market is finding reason to consolidate some strong June gains that were helped along in part by a hope the G-20 Summit would strike a constructive tone and that the Fed would cut rates by 50 basis pints in July. Those views are being called into question today, however, which is leading to the broad-based selling interest.The Russell 2000 is down 0.5%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.6%; the S&P 500 is down 0.8%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.5%.13:51FDX FedEx to report this evening (157.17 -3.73)FedEx (FDX 157.17, -3.73, -2.3%) will report its Q4 results after today's closing bell, followed by the management's conference call at 17:30 ET.The Capital IQ consensus expects the company to report an 18.3% yr/yr decrease in EPS to $4.83 on a 3.1% yr/yr increase in revenue to $17.85 bln. Last quarter, FedEx reported weaker than expected results and lowered its guidance to account for a slowing global economy. The weak outlook briefly pressured the stock, but FedEx was able to climb to a fresh 2019 high in mid-April. However, that push was followed by a return to the December low earlier this month. Continued relative strength in the U.S. economy should support FedEx's domestic business, but the international segment could see softness associated with slowing growth in Asia and Europe. FedEx's international segment accounts for roughly 30% of revenue. The company has had a difficult time integrating TNT Express into its business. Investors have known about this issue for a while, so any improvement on this front would be a positive. South China Morning Post reported today that the Chinese government may put FedEx on its list of unreliable foreign entities. Global Times speculated about this possibility on Sunday.FedEx trades at 9.9x forward earnings expectations, which represents a discount to UPS's (UPS 97.47, -2.25, -2.3%) 12.9x forward multiple.Editor's note: A previous version of this comment included the GAAP EPS estimate instead of the non-GAAP estimate.

Posts three-month highs.SAM (361.78 +3.59%): Now up by circa +7% over the past week, the stock today achieves a new all-time high on slightly above average volume.Mid Cap LosersBHF (33.63 -11.78%): Downgraded to Sell from Neutral at Goldman, which lowers co's target to $32 from $39, and to Underperform from Neutral at Credit Suisse, which cuts co's price target to $22 from $35, with both firms calling attention to sources of pressure to co's capital plans. Drops to five-month lows.UNIT (9.88 -7.58%): In recent items, co announced the planned offering by its subsidiary Uniti Fiber Holdings, Inc. of $300 mln aggregate principal amount of exchangeable senior notes due 2024, and it signaled that it has entered into an amendment to its credit agreement to extend the maturity date of its revolving credit facility. Co also yesterday announced that PEG Bandwidth Holdings, the holder of co's 3.00% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, has elected to convert all of its shares.JOBS (69.88 -6.18%): Dropped to its lowest levels since December in early trade; though now well off those morning lows, the stock continues to underperform on more than 3x average volume, lagging alongside Chinese peers generally ahead of the weekend's G-20 meeting.

The problem today perhaps is that Fed Chair Powell's remarks didn't necessarily make it clear that the Fed is inclined to cut the target range for the fed funds rate by 50 basis points at the July meeting.That sense of matters is wrapped up in the following two observations made in the speech:"Against the backdrop of heightened uncertainties, the baseline outlook of my FOMC colleagues, like that of many other forecasters, remains favorable, with unemployment remaining near historic lows.""But we are also mindful that monetary policy should not overreact to any individual data point or short-term swing in sentiment."This speech followed on the heels of St. Lois Fed President Bullard saying that he thought a rate cut would be coming in July, but that he doesn't think a 50-basis points rate cut is necessary.Accordingly, the Powell speech served as another focal point that tempered the market's growing, and pent-up, hope that the Fed would cut by 50 basis points at the July 30-31 meeting. It could still if events, and data, unfold in the interim that suggest such a cut is necessary, but for now, there appear to be some emerging hints in the Fed commentary that suggest the market is probably getting greedy with the expectation that a 50 basis points cut is on the way.13:09SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ABBV (57.23 mln -15.46%), AGN (23.25 mln +26.5%), TEVA (21.69 mln +7.27%), BMY (14.02 mln +0.45%)Materials: GOLD (17.35 mln -2.4%), GOLD (17.35 mln -2.4%), KGC (14.76 mln -2.78%), HMY (12.99 mln -5.16%)Industrials: GE (20.66 mln -0.68%)Consumer Discretionary: CZR (57.76 mln +2.27%)Information Technology: AMD (29.78 mln -0.38%), NOK (17.49 mln -0.79%), MSFT (15.84 mln -2.75%), MU (14.28 mln +1.27%)Financials: BAC (27.1 mln -0.66%), ITUB (15.37 mln -1.11%), BBD (13.41 mln -1.52%)Energy: CHK (31 mln -4.97%), SWN (13.3 mln -5.57%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: ABBV (11.7x -15.46%), AGN (7.08x +26.5%), XNCR (4.81x +13.29%), ATRS (4.04x +4.97%), ARQL (2.12x +9.89%)Materials: HMY (2.69x -5.16%), NG (2.25x -0.72%)Industrials: JOBS (3.46x -6.48%), DOOR (3.21x +2.21%)Consumer Discretionary: LEN (3.7x -5.74%), ERI (3.7x -3.87%), CZR (2.79x +2.27%), GRUB (2.19x +5.07%)Information Technology: SCSC (2.96x +2.61%)Financials: VMBS (6.89x +0.03%), VCIT (4.42x -0.01%), BHF (4.18x -13.12%), AEF (2.54x -0.27%)Energy: TOO (3.59x -1.72%)Utilities: ENIC (3x +0.84%)13:08SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: AGN (163.9 +26.5%), XNCR (38.37 +13.29%), RUBY (15.11 +10.21%), ARQL (11 +9.89%), TEVA (8.85 +7.27%), ENDP (3.84 +6.96%), DNLI (20.95 +6.72%), RARX (27.94 +6.56%), INO (2.57 +5.99%), PGNX (5.5 +5.36%)Industrials: GBX (28.96 +7.06%), TGI (19.74 +5.9%)Energy: MDR (8.79 +6.93%), LPI (2.9 +5.84%), OIS (17.94 +5.65%), GLOG (13.89 +5.63%)Consumer Staples: USNA (79.15 +9.41%), RAD (6.78 +7.62%), SPTN (11.53 +5.83%), ELF (13.87 +5.8%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: ABBV (66.33 -15.46%), EPZM (13.54 -10.48%)Industrials: JOBS (69.66 -6.48%)Consumer Discretionary: RGS (16.56 -6.76%), SCVL (26.5 -5.96%)Information Technology: GTT (18.52 -7.26%), GSKY (12.15 -6.22%), UPLD (44 -6.13%), SHOP (292.83 -6.09%)Financials: BHF (33.12 -13.12%), HIIQ (24.05 -7.96%), JT (4.08 -6.63%)Consumer Staples: DF (0.97 -6.21%)13:05BONDX Auction OutTreasury Auction Results$40 bln 2-year Treasury note auction: Auction results: High yield: 1.695% (When-Issued: 1.705%) Bid-to-cover: 2.58Indirect bid: 48.5% Direct bid: 24.2% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.572% Bid-to-cover: 2.63 Indirect bid: 46.3% Direct bid: 15.6%12:58WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stock market trades lower in front of Powell commentsThe S&P 500 is down 0.5%, as shares of technology companies weigh on the broader market.

Instead, Mr. Bullard prefers a quarter-point cut.Economic data released today has provided some insight into the housing sector and consumer sentiment that has also disappointed investors. New homes sales declined 7.8% m/m in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 626,000 (Briefing.com consensus 683,000), and the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index fell to 121.5 in June (Briefing.com consensus 132.0).Today's action has been largely risk-off, which is being reflected across losses in nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors. Leading today's retreat are the S&P 500 communication services (-1.4%), information technology (-1.2%), and consumer discretionary (-0.7%) sectors. The materials (+0.1%) and real estate (+0.02%) sectors cling onto slim gains.Home construction company Lennar (LEN 48.33, -3.13, -6.1%) has also contributed to the cautious sentiment after it issued downside Q3 guidance, discouraging investors after it provided positive quarterly results earlier in the day.Separately, there has been a mega-merger deal in the health care space. Allergan (AGN 164.00, +34.41, +26.6%) confirmed it will be acquired by pharmaceutical company AbbVie (ABBV 66.33, -12.12, -15.5%) for about $63 billion, or $188.24 per share, in cash and stock. With shares of AbbVie currently down over 15%, the deal represents a 37% premium to AGN's closing price on Monday.U.S. Treasuries have advanced, pushing the benchmark 10-yr yield down three basis points to 1.99%, as investors remain cautious about the economic outlook.

The fact that one of the Fed's biggest doves -- if not the biggest -- is seemingly trying to rein in the market's rate-cut hopes has taken some of that rate-cut premium out of stock prices.As a reminder, Fed Chair Powell has a speaking engagement at 1:00 p.m. ET.The Russell 2000 is down 0.2%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.5%; the S&P 500 is down 0.6%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.0%.12:00MSFT Microsoft hit by profit-taking interest (134.79 -2.99)Shares of Dow component Microsoft (MSFT 134.56, -3.22, -2.3%), which is also the largest stock by market capitalization, are underperforming today. That has to do in large part with how the stock has outperformed since June 3.Entering today, Microsoft was up 15% since June 3 (i.e. the day before Fed Chair Powell said the Fed would act appropriately to sustain the expansion) versus a 7.3% gain for the S&P 500 and a 9.2% gain for the Nasdaq Composite.A 15% move in a stock the size of Microsoft is a massive move and left shares of MSFT 21% above their 200-day moving average. The basis for today's selling, then, is a pullback from a short-term overbought condition.That condition was brought to light today by the analyst at Jefferies who raised his price target to $90 from $80, but maintained an Underperform rating and called the stock "materially overvalued."It won't be lost on investors that MSFT has defied the Jefferies view of the stock's prospects in a big way leading into today; nonetheless, with the broader market in a consolidation mode in front of the G-20 summit, the Jefferies view today looks to have served as another profit-taking catalyst.11:45SUMRX European Markets Update: DAX -0.27%, FTSE +0.13%, CAC -0.05%---Equity Markets---STOXX Europe 600: -0.03%Germany's DAX: -0.27%U.K.'s FTSE 100: +0.13%France's CAC 40: -0.05%Italy's FTSE MIB: -0.73%Spain's IBEX 35: -0.24%11:41SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Xencor (XNCR) rises on addition to S&P SmallCap 600 index -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersXNCR (38.25 +12.92%): Co will take the place of HFF Inc.

There is a conference call scheduled for 8:30 ET. Q4 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $0.76 (-4% yr/yr) on revenue of $4.24 bln (+8.8% yr/yr). The company is expected to guide for FY20 where consensus stands at $3.31 (-4.8% yr/yr) and $17.3 bln for revenues (+1.6% yr/yr).Looking back, the company beat on EPS four times in a row, but missed on revenues four times in a row. GIS shares increased 3% following its Q4 results. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, General Mills expects Blue Buffalo's net sales and segment operating profit growth will accelerate meaningfully, driven by significant distribution expansion in the FDM channel. Based on the GIS weekly Jun28 $54 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~6% in either direction by weekly expiration (Friday).On a positive report, look for resistance near the $58.00-58.50 area, while support sits near the $49.00-49.50 vicinity.GIS has a market cap of ~$32 bln and trades at ~16x FY20 earnings, a notable discount to the average consumer packaged goods stock at 22x.11:13XPH Pharma is the big winner today after second large M&A deal is announced in as many weeksPharma and biotech stocks are the clear winners in trading this morning. With ABBV announcing today it will acquire AGN just a week after PFE said it will acquire ARRY, there is a lot of excitement in the group. What's notable is that both acquiring companies have blockbuster drugs (ABBV with Humira and PFE with Lyrica) that are soon facing patent expirations. It's clear large pharmas want to restock their portfolios. It's leading to speculation as to which companies may be next.On the other side of the spectrum, China, IT and gold stocks are showing weakness today.10:35SUMRX Morning Commodities: Oil sheds gains, now modestly lower, gold over 1% higherCommodities are higher (+0.5% at 79.88 as measured by the Bloomberg Commodity Index)Dollar index is slightly lower (-0.04% at 95.9420)Looking at energy:Jul WTI crude oil futures are now -$0.08 (-0.1%) at $57.82/barrelIn other energy, Jul natural gas is -$0.4 (-1.9%) at $2.24/MMBtu Moving on to metals:Aug gold is currently +$18.15 (+1.3%) at $1436.35/oz, while Jul silver is +$0.05 at $15.43/ozJul copper is now +$0.03 (+1.0%) at 2.73/lb10:31SUMRX Economic Summary: Consumer Confidence & New Home Sales miss expectationsEconomic Data Summary:April Case Schiller Home Price Index 0.4% vs Briefing.com consensus of 2.5%; March was 2.7% April FHFA Housing Price Index 2.5% vs Briefing.com consensus of 0.2%; March was revised to 2.6% from 0.1% June Consumer Confidence 121.5 vs Briefing.com consensus of 132.0; May was revised to 131.3 from 134.1The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects growing concern about trade tensions among consumers that had been previously lacking, but which had been showing up in business confidence surveys.

This isn't altogether surprising given the lack of conviction seen in the futures market ahead of the open.At the same time, it isn't all that surprising given that market participants are spying a 1:00 p.m. ET speaking appearance by Fed Chair Powell as a potential market mover and given that the highly-anticipated G-20 summit is sitting on the weekend horizon.Just not much conviction right now on the part of buyers, who have been very active throughout the month of June, which is on track to be the best June for the S&P 500 since 1955!The broader market will be excused, then, for taking a little time to consolidate after a big run. Some disappointing consumer confidence data for June (121.5 vs. 132.0 Briefing.com consensus) and weaker-than-expected new home sales data for May (626K vs. 683K Briefing.com consensus) have also cast a pall on buying efforts.Treasuries, on the other hand, have benefited from the disappointing data.

INTERVIEW WITH JOE KERNEN, BECKY QUICK, AND ANDREW ROSS SORKIN OF CNBC SQUAWK BOXUS Fed NewsMay 23, 2019 Thursday 7:46 PM  ESTCopyright 2019 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 3197 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, May 23 -- The U.S. Department of State issued the following press release:QUESTION: Let's get right to this morning's Squawk newsmaker, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. We want to welcome you, not only to the show but welcome you into Times Square to our set. It's so much better to have - to see you here.SECRETARY POMPEO: Great to be in New York City today with you all.QUESTION: And normally if we have a secretary of state on, we think diplomacy and foreign policy. Can you believe how much of what you do now is in CNBC's domain in terms of economics and money and oil and cybersecurity?SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, it's a great point. I have very few meetings with foreign counterparts where we aren't talking about important economic issues, issues in trade relationships between our countries, a regulatory set of issues, all the things that drive economic growth. You all know you can't have a good national security for your nation - whether that's the United States or another country - if you don't have economic growth back home. It's an imperative.QUESTION: It's a good place to be that we're not talking necessarily about missiles aimed at us, although that's still something I'm sure that you worry about. So I was trying to figure out, do we start with Iran, which, unless it really deteriorates, that probably is not as big an issue to the markets as what's happening in China. So I want to start with China, and then we'll get to Iran because it affects oil prices, et cetera.But in terms of China, I know Steve Bannon is not part of the administration anymore, but just let me - just bear with me for a second. Destroying Huawei, according to Mr. Bannon, is 10 times more important than striking an overall trade deal. And I thought that might be hyperbole, Andrew, until I looked in your paper today, and I'm reading about - no, I did. And I'm reading about what's happening with - in the area where you have the Uighurs and these camps. They have set up a huge virtual cage of spying which supposedly - and here's a quote from your newspaper - they're arguing that China is using technology to strengthen authoritarianism at home and abroad, and that the United States is the only country that can stop this - I mean, is Bannon overstating the issues here?SECRETARY POMPEO: I'm going to say something that will surprise you. I think The New York Times has that story right. There is real risk, and you saw what President Trump has undertaken with respect to China. For too long - this is not partisan - presidents from both parties had ignored the challenges that were presented to American workers, to American technology, and to American national security that China presents. And he is pushing back in every element.The decision that was made to list Huawei had an enormous national security component to it. The company is deeply tied not only to China, but to the Chinese Communist Party, and that connectivity, the existence of those connections, puts American information that crosses those networks at risk. I've spent a lot of time over the last months talking to our partners around the world, explaining to them why putting their citizens' information, their citizens' national security (inaudible) at risk by having that technology inside of their systems.QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, I don't want to diminish the potential risk. Can you help us - is there evidence that we can point to specifically today to suggest that there was spyware or other kinds of spying taking place using Huawei hardware?SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, that's the wrong question, Andrew. If you put your information - your information - in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party, it's de facto a real risk to you. They may not use it today -QUESTION: Oh, I'm not diminishing -SECRETARY POMPEO: They may not use it today; they may not use it tomorrow.QUESTION: I don't want to diminish the risk. I'm just raising the question because we've also heard from the CEO of Huawei who says, look, we don't share this information, we're not working with the Chinese government, point to something specific.SECRETARY POMPEO: I mean, that's just false. That's just false. To say that they don't work with the Chinese government is a false statement.QUESTION: There's a law that they must work if asked.SECRETARY POMPEO: It is required to by Chinese law to do that. So it's just - the Huawei CEO on that at least isn't telling the American people the truth, nor the world.QUESTION: We've seen already that some of the partners you mentioned about, some of the other countries, have already started to take up and remove Huawei equipment or say that you can't use it going forward, several UK companies overnight and some Japanese companies as well. Do you expect us to see more of those companies in coming days or other countries?SECRETARY POMPEO: We do. We've been working at the State Department to make sure that everyone understands the risk. It's been really an educational mission as much as anything else. Every nation, every private company gets to make its own sovereign choices for the countries and private decisions for those entities; but as we share with them the risks, as we share with them the incapacity to mitigate those risks, which I think some thought could take place as a technical matter - we don't think there's much mitigation opportunity. As we share that, we're seeing them come to the same understanding that the United States has come to.QUESTION: Do you think we eventually wind up with two internets, one that is based around China and its closest partners and one that is the Western world?SECRETARY POMPEO: I hope that's not the case. We need a single place where information can be exchanged, but it has to be a systems that has Western values embedded in it, with the rule of law, property right protections, transparency, openness. It can't be a system that is based on the principles of an authoritarian, communist regime.QUESTION: How do you think about Huawei as a chess piece, if you will, in this larger trade discussion? And does it ultimately help us or hurt us? I mean, does China look at this and say: Okay, they've got us, and therefore we're going to - we're going to now work with them in a better way? Or do you think they say to themselves: You know what? They got us and we're really not going to work with their companies now?SECRETARY POMPEO: So remember there's two pieces to this. There's the national security component, and then there's what President Trump has been driving at to create a fair, reciprocal, balanced trade relationship between the two countries. I hope that we can keep those issues in their own place.We have an imperative to protect American national security. We have a need to make sure we get these trade rules right. I mean, you all know this. I come from Kansas. American workers in Kansas creating intellectual property, trying to grow their business, trying to take care of their families, and the Chinese steal that information. That's not right. We're trying to fix that.They force companies that invest in China to - and create JVs with the sole intention of making sure the government has access to the information that comes across there. Those are the kind of things that President Trump with Secretary Mnuchin and Ambassador Lighthizer are working on, and I hope they can come to an arrangement. If they do, it would be a good thing for China and for the United States.QUESTION: But global 5G is not going to include Huawei. It's not - it - we will not - is that our stated policy right now, that it's not going to be Huawei?SECRETARY POMPEO: We want the global 5G system, when it's ultimately built out, to have a Western value set embedded in it.QUESTION: Well, we've got -SECRETARY POMPEO: Not just American technology, but technology that will come from Europe. It'll come from other parts of Asia. This is a global phenomenon. Our requirement is that this technology create trusted networks. And if we have trusted networks, then, as you described, we can have a single system which will benefit the world.QUESTION: That sounds like - well, that's not just a small chess piece, I mean, that's not a pawn. That's like a - it's at least a rook, or maybe a queen, right?QUESTION: Why do you think -SECRETARY POMPEO: A bishop or a rook for sure.QUESTION: Yeah.QUESTION: Why do you think we've not led on 5G? Why has Huawei been able to get as far ahead as it has, and we don't have a company that's been able to build the microcells and some of the other devices that they've created?SECRETARY POMPEO: It's an important question, because we need to make sure that's fixed going forward, so it's not just a rearview mirror, "Why didn't we get there," but how is it the case that we're going to ensure that there are Western alternatives to Huawei.Yeah, I think there's lots of pieces to it, one of which is, if you're a state-directed business and you take on subsidies from the Chinese government, there's no doubt you can make real hay. When you show up not only with a low-cost, affordable product, but engage in behavior that the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act would prevent, yeah, you can get a little bit of foothold. I am convinced that the West will ultimately prevail, because I think the world wants systems that they can trust.QUESTION: What are the prospects for us actually getting a deal that has teeth, given that so much is at stake for the way the Chinese operate now? They would need to be dragged kicking and screaming into an agreement. Either it's lukewarm agreement or it's going to take years and years and years. Are you pessimistic?SECRETARY POMPEO: Joe, I don't know the answer to that. I've spoken to Secretary Mnuchin almost every day as they've been part of these discussions. I haven't been at the center of the actual negotiations.I've seen them make real progress. I hope they can continue to make it. These issues are not only important to the United States. We remind people these are good for the world and good for the people of China. If we get this right, this will create a trading system that can continue to create prosperity for citizens all across the world.QUESTION: Secretary Pompeo, can I just ask you, if you've - in touch with Steven Mnuchin almost every day, you've seen him make progress, but recently has there been more - a more downbeat sort of outlook on what happens? Because that's what the market seems to think.SECRETARY POMPEO: I think he said yesterday they don't have any meetings scheduled for his team to travel to China. I hope that by the time this show ends this morning they are back at it. It is important for the conversation to continue. It's important to both of our nations to try and get this right.It's tough, Joe, to your point. The things that - the changes, the transition we're asking China to make to create these fair, reciprocal trading rules is no doubt a big ask, but it's important for the United States, and President Trump is firmly committed to it.QUESTION: I briefly mentioned the Chinese ambassador. Was he - was that for a U.S. audience? I mean, or is that really the -QUESTION: Or for a Chinese audience, yeah.QUESTION: Or was that really the policy positions that - I mean, I watched him say that there's been no military buildup in the South China Sea on any of the islands. I watched him say that everybody knows Huawei is just a private corporation and it has nothing to do with the - I watched him say that the internment camps are actually jobs training for the Uighurs. I watched him say that every - that everything they had decided on, that the United States had pulled out three or four times and taken back what they had - I mean, it was -SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah.QUESTION: I - maybe Baghdad Bob is too strong, but that's - that was the - that was the feeling I got listening to some of - and if that's what we're hearing from our - the negotiators in the trade talks, I don't see it going anywhere ever.SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, the Chinese are building up in the South China Sea. The -QUESTION: That's a fact?SECRETARY POMPEO: The authoritarian nature of what's taking place in Xinjiang to the Uighurs, some million people held in camps - these are not community colleges. These are authoritarian re-education institutions, and we've seen what's going on in the technology space. Those are facts. I can't account for why the Chinese ambassador said what he said.QUESTION: They've criticized you overtly too in saying certain things, have they not?SECRETARY POMPEO: I'm sure they have.QUESTION: They may be watching this and they're going to be mad that I said "Baghdad Bob," but it just -SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. What's important, Joe - what's important, Joe, is not that - not name-calling. It's important to be honest, get the facts right, and then ensure that our nation protects its interests, and President Trump has done that at every turn.QUESTION: And he - again, referencing some people that know him, they are saying he's not going to back down. He's going to listen to Chuck Schumer and not going to back down on this. Is that -SECRETARY POMPEO: President Trump has made clear his expectations for how the United States will behave with regard to China.QUESTION: There's not an S&#38;P, Standard &#38; Poor 500-level where we decide to start talking more?SECRETARY POMPEO: These are important commercial - long-term commercial economic interests of the United States and national security interests. President Trump understands them.QUESTION: We could go till nine o'clock talking about China, but we should mention Iran. What is the latest there in terms of - you have on record saying that we have plenty of oil, we've got partners that will make up for any disruptions that we see from Iran. In recent days, have you seen them pull back on some of the more bellicose moves they made, whether it's the bomb near the embassy or the - and we don't know it's them, for sure -SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah.QUESTION: - with the ships, but it certainly looks like them.SECRETARY POMPEO: This threat, this threat from Iran, remains. We've had some luck in disrupting some of the tactical things that were in front of us, I think it's fair to say. But make sure we're still on high alert, we're still making sure we have the right resources in play. Your point - I remember when we began the maximum pressure campaign, there was talk probably on this show of oil going to 150. Your listeners should all know that when May 2nd came and we withdrew from the JCPOA, oil is now well below that. I think I saw Brent Crude at 69-something when I walked in here this morning. It's below where it was when we designated the IRGC a terrorist organization. We are confident that we've done the hard work to make sure that the market is well supplied, and I hope that we can continue to maintain that. I think we can.QUESTION: You have no problem saying unequivocally that this wasn't hyped by the administration for political purposes? The Democrats are sort of sounding that alarm.SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, none, no overhype, and we briefed Congress extensively Tuesday of this week. I think almost every member, Democrats and Republicans alike, walked out of that room understanding that the threats that we were discussing and the decision that President Trump made to take a posture to deter those threats and to protect our forces were wholly justified and reasonable.QUESTION: You and Bolton are on the same page?SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes.QUESTION: Yes?SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes. Well, look -QUESTION: Nothing going on there?SECRETARY POMPEO: Look -QUESTION: Nothing to any of those stories, Politico -SECRETARY POMPEO: Look - look, every - every - look, these stories - these stories are crazy. Every senior leader in the United States government will have a different view on something and they'll make their case where - none of us are wallflowers. President Trump wouldn't want a wallflower in his administration. He wants people who are voicing their views based on the facts as they see them. John does that. I do that. There are days when we don't agree perfectly, but John and I, from a policy perspective, and as we stare at the risk to the world, are in nearly complete alignment.QUESTION: Although the stories suggest that you're in favor of negotiating and he's in favor of not negotiating, not believing. Those are pretty important differentiations. Is -SECRETARY POMPEO: He's - talking about Iran?QUESTION: Yes.SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, the President's made clear that at the right time, negotiations are important. What John and I think is interesting - what the President says is really important, and the President has said that he is prepared at the right time, when the Iranians conclude that it's in their best interests to negotiate, we stand ready to take their call.QUESTION: I wanted to ask you one question. Your predecessor, Rex Tillerson, was in Washington apparently in the past two days. There was a report that he was interviewed by some congressmen and was asked about the President, President Trump's values, and he said that he - meaning Rex Tillerson - was guided by, quote, "American values" such as democracy and freedom, but that he could not offer the same assessment for the President. What do you make of that comment?SECRETARY POMPEO: It's pretty outrageous and it probably explains why Rex Tillerson is no longer the secretary of state.QUESTION: John Kerry's no longer secretary of state. Do you feel -SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, no, we got lots of folks still hanging around the Hill.QUESTION: Do you feel confident that you're the only one speaking for - with Iran's leaders at this point? Is there a cease-and-desist order there? I mean, now I hear they're waiting for 2020, China's waiting for - everybody's waiting for 2020 before we do anything. It's -SECRETARY POMPEO: Sadly, I'm not confident that we don't have others out trying to speak on behalf of the United States working against President Trump's policies. I wish I could say that I was confident of that. I'm not. I've seen - I saw Secretary Kerry travel to Munich. There's a security conference there every year. He was with Ernest Moniz, Wendy Sherman, and the whole gang that put in place the JCPOA, which fundamentally failed America, and it's what we're working to correct today. No, I'm not confident that we're in that place, and I hope when I - here's my assurance to you all.QUESTION: Yeah.SECRETARY POMPEO: When I'm done being the Secretary of State, I'll get off the stage.QUESTION: You see how well this dynamic works? He'll ask the Tillerson questions, I'll ask the John Kerry questions, and we cover the entire spectrum, right, Mr. Secretary?SECRETARY POMPEO: I love predictability, yes, sir.QUESTION: Yeah, exactly. (Laughter.)SECRETARY POMPEO: Exactly.QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, thank you.QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, thank you.QUESTION: Thank you.SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you all.QUESTION: Please come back.QUESTION: We appreciate it very much.QUESTION: Thank you very much.

INTERVIEW WITH JOE KERNEN, BECKY QUICK, AND ANDREW ROSS SORKIN OF CNBC SQUAWK BOXStates News ServiceMay 23, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 3148 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: New York City BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Department of State:QUESTION: Let's get right to this morning's Squawk newsmaker, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. We want to welcome you, not only to the show but welcome you into Times Square to our set. It's so much better to have to see you here.SECRETARY POMPEO: Great to be in New York City today with you all.QUESTION: And normally if we have a secretary of state on, we think diplomacy and foreign policy. Can you believe how much of what you do now is in CNBC's domain in terms of economics and money and oil and cybersecurity?SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, it's a great point. I have very few meetings with foreign counterparts where we aren't talking about important economic issues, issues in trade relationships between our countries, a regulatory set of issues, all the things that drive economic growth. You all know you can't have a good national security for your nation whether that's the United States or another country if you don't have economic growth back home. It's an imperative.QUESTION: It's a good place to be that we're not talking necessarily about missiles aimed at us, although that's still something I'm sure that you worry about. So I was trying to figure out, do we start with Iran, which, unless it really deteriorates, that probably is not as big an issue to the markets as what's happening in China. So I want to start with China, and then we'll get to Iran because it affects oil prices, et cetera.But in terms of China, I know Steve Bannon is not part of the administration anymore, but just let me just bear with me for a second. Destroying Huawei, according to Mr. Bannon, is 10 times more important than striking an overall trade deal. And I thought that might be hyperbole, Andrew, until I looked in your paper today, and I'm reading about no, I did. And I'm reading about what's happening with in the area where you have the Uighurs and these camps. They have set up a huge virtual cage of spying which supposedly and here's a quote from your newspaper they're arguing that China is using technology to strengthen authoritarianism at home and abroad, and that the United States is the only country that can stop this I mean, is Bannon overstating the issues here?SECRETARY POMPEO: I'm going to say something that will surprise you. I think The New York Times has that story right. There is real risk, and you saw what President Trump has undertaken with respect to China. For too long this is not partisan presidents from both parties had ignored the challenges that were presented to American workers, to American technology, and to American national security that China presents. And he is pushing back in every element.The decision that was made to list Huawei had an enormous national security component to it. The company is deeply tied not only to China, but to the Chinese Communist Party, and that connectivity, the existence of those connections, puts American information that crosses those networks at risk. I've spent a lot of time over the last months talking to our partners around the world, explaining to them why putting their citizens' information, their citizens' national security (inaudible) at risk by having that technology inside of their systems.QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, I don't want to diminish the potential risk. Can you help us is there evidence that we can point to specifically today to suggest that there was spyware or other kinds of spying taking place using Huawei hardware?SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, that's the wrong question, Andrew. If you put your information your information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party, it's de facto a real risk to you. They may not use it todayQUESTION: Oh, I'm not diminishingSECRETARY POMPEO: They may not use it today; they may not use it tomorrow.QUESTION: I don't want to diminish the risk. I'm just raising the question because we've also heard from the CEO of Huawei who says, look, we don't share this information, we're not working with the Chinese government, point to something specific.SECRETARY POMPEO: I mean, that's just false. That's just false. To say that they don't work with the Chinese government is a false statement.QUESTION: There's a law that they must work if asked.SECRETARY POMPEO: It is required to by Chinese law to do that. So it's just the Huawei CEO on that at least isn't telling the American people the truth, nor the world.QUESTION: We've seen already that some of the partners you mentioned about, some of the other countries, have already started to take up and remove Huawei equipment or say that you can't use it going forward, several UK companies overnight and some Japanese companies as well. Do you expect us to see more of those companies in coming days or other countries?SECRETARY POMPEO: We do. We've been working at the State Department to make sure that everyone understands the risk. It's been really an educational mission as much as anything else. Every nation, every private company gets to make its own sovereign choices for the countries and private decisions for those entities; but as we share with them the risks, as we share with them the incapacity to mitigate those risks, which I think some thought could take place as a technical matter we don't think there's much mitigation opportunity. As we share that, we're seeing them come to the same understanding that the United States has come to.QUESTION: Do you think we eventually wind up with two internets, one that is based around China and its closest partners and one that is the Western world?SECRETARY POMPEO: I hope that's not the case. We need a single place where information can be exchanged, but it has to be a systems that has Western values embedded in it, with the rule of law, property right protections, transparency, openness. It can't be a system that is based on the principles of an authoritarian, communist regime.QUESTION: How do you think about Huawei as a chess piece, if you will, in this larger trade discussion? And does it ultimately help us or hurt us? I mean, does China look at this and say: Okay, they've got us, and therefore we're going to we're going to now work with them in a better way? Or do you think they say to themselves: You know what? They got us and we're really not going to work with their companies now?SECRETARY POMPEO: So remember there's two pieces to this. There's the national security component, and then there's what President Trump has been driving at to create a fair, reciprocal, balanced trade relationship between the two countries. I hope that we can keep those issues in their own place.We have an imperative to protect American national security. We have a need to make sure we get these trade rules right. I mean, you all know this. I come from Kansas. American workers in Kansas creating intellectual property, trying to grow their business, trying to take care of their families, and the Chinese steal that information. That's not right. We're trying to fix that.They force companies that invest in China to and create JVs with the sole intention of making sure the government has access to the information that comes across there. Those are the kind of things that President Trump with Secretary Mnuchin and Ambassador Lighthizer are working on, and I hope they can come to an arrangement. If they do, it would be a good thing for China and for the United States.QUESTION: But global 5G is not going to include Huawei. It's not it we will not is that our stated policy right now, that it's not going to be Huawei?SECRETARY POMPEO: We want the global 5G system, when it's ultimately built out, to have a Western value set embedded in it.QUESTION: Well, we've gotSECRETARY POMPEO: Not just American technology, but technology that will come from Europe. It'll come from other parts of Asia. This is a global phenomenon. Our requirement is that this technology create trusted networks. And if we have trusted networks, then, as you described, we can have a single system which will benefit the world.QUESTION: That sounds like well, that's not just a small chess piece, I mean, that's not a pawn. That's like a it's at least a rook, or maybe a queen, right?QUESTION: Why do you thinkSECRETARY POMPEO: A bishop or a rook for sure.QUESTION: Yeah.QUESTION: Why do you think we've not led on 5G? Why has Huawei been able to get as far ahead as it has, and we don't have a company that's been able to build the microcells and some of the other devices that they've created?SECRETARY POMPEO: It's an important question, because we need to make sure that's fixed going forward, so it's not just a rearview mirror, "Why didn't we get there," but how is it the case that we're going to ensure that there are Western alternatives to Huawei.Yeah, I think there's lots of pieces to it, one of which is, if you're a state-directed business and you take on subsidies from the Chinese government, there's no doubt you can make real hay. When you show up not only with a low-cost, affordable product, but engage in behavior that the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act would prevent, yeah, you can get a little bit of foothold. I am convinced that the West will ultimately prevail, because I think the world wants systems that they can trust.QUESTION: What are the prospects for us actually getting a deal that has teeth, given that so much is at stake for the way the Chinese operate now? They would need to be dragged kicking and screaming into an agreement. Either it's lukewarm agreement or it's going to take years and years and years. Are you pessimistic?SECRETARY POMPEO: Joe, I don't know the answer to that. I've spoken to Secretary Mnuchin almost every day as they've been part of these discussions. I haven't been at the center of the actual negotiations.I've seen them make real progress. I hope they can continue to make it. These issues are not only important to the United States. We remind people these are good for the world and good for the people of China. If we get this right, this will create a trading system that can continue to create prosperity for citizens all across the world.QUESTION: Secretary Pompeo, can I just ask you, if you've in touch with Steven Mnuchin almost every day, you've seen him make progress, but recently has there been more a more downbeat sort of outlook on what happens? Because that's what the market seems to think.SECRETARY POMPEO: I think he said yesterday they don't have any meetings scheduled for his team to travel to China. I hope that by the time this show ends this morning they are back at it. It is important for the conversation to continue. It's important to both of our nations to try and get this right.It's tough, Joe, to your point. The things that the changes, the transition we're asking China to make to create these fair, reciprocal trading rules is no doubt a big ask, but it's important for the United States, and President Trump is firmly committed to it.QUESTION: I briefly mentioned the Chinese ambassador. Was he was that for a U.S. audience? I mean, or is that really theQUESTION: Or for a Chinese audience, yeah.QUESTION: Or was that really the policy positions that I mean, I watched him say that there's been no military buildup in the South China Sea on any of the islands. I watched him say that everybody knows Huawei is just a private corporation and it has nothing to do with the I watched him say that the internment camps are actually jobs training for the Uighurs. I watched him say that every that everything they had decided on, that the United States had pulled out three or four times and taken back what they had I mean, it wasSECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah.QUESTION: I maybe Baghdad Bob is too strong, but that's that was the that was the feeling I got listening to some of and if that's what we're hearing from our the negotiators in the trade talks, I don't see it going anywhere ever.SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, the Chinese are building up in the South China Sea. TheQUESTION: That's a fact?SECRETARY POMPEO: The authoritarian nature of what's taking place in Xinjiang to the Uighurs, some million people held in camps these are not community colleges. These are authoritarian re-education institutions, and we've seen what's going on in the technology space. Those are facts. I can't account for why the Chinese ambassador said what he said.QUESTION: They've criticized you overtly too in saying certain things, have they not?SECRETARY POMPEO: I'm sure they have.QUESTION: They may be watching this and they're going to be mad that I said "Baghdad Bob," but it justSECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. What's important, Joe what's important, Joe, is not that not name-calling. It's important to be honest, get the facts right, and then ensure that our nation protects its interests, and President Trump has done that at every turn.QUESTION: And he again, referencing some people that know him, they are saying he's not going to back down. He's going to listen to Chuck Schumer and not going to back down on this. Is thatSECRETARY POMPEO: President Trump has made clear his expectations for how the United States will behave with regard to China.QUESTION: There's not an SandP, Standard and Poor 500-level where we decide to start talking more?SECRETARY POMPEO: These are important commercial long-term commercial economic interests of the United States and national security interests. President Trump understands them.QUESTION: We could go till nine o'clock talking about China, but we should mention Iran. What is the latest there in terms of you have on record saying that we have plenty of oil, we've got partners that will make up for any disruptions that we see from Iran. In recent days, have you seen them pull back on some of the more bellicose moves they made, whether it's the bomb near the embassy or the and we don't know it's them, for sureSECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah.QUESTION: with the ships, but it certainly looks like them.SECRETARY POMPEO: This threat, this threat from Iran, remains. We've had some luck in disrupting some of the tactical things that were in front of us, I think it's fair to say. But make sure we're still on high alert, we're still making sure we have the right resources in play. Your point I remember when we began the maximum pressure campaign, there was talk probably on this show of oil going to 150. Your listeners should all know that when May 2nd came and we withdrew from the JCPOA, oil is now well below that. I think I saw Brent Crude at 69-something when I walked in here this morning. It's below where it was when we designated the IRGC a terrorist organization. We are confident that we've done the hard work to make sure that the market is well supplied, and I hope that we can continue to maintain that. I think we can.QUESTION: You have no problem saying unequivocally that this wasn't hyped by the administration for political purposes? The Democrats are sort of sounding that alarm.SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, none, no overhype, and we briefed Congress extensively Tuesday of this week. I think almost every member, Democrats and Republicans alike, walked out of that room understanding that the threats that we were discussing and the decision that President Trump made to take a posture to deter those threats and to protect our forces were wholly justified and reasonable.QUESTION: You and Bolton are on the same page?SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes.QUESTION: Yes?SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes. Well, lookQUESTION: Nothing going on there?SECRETARY POMPEO: LookQUESTION: Nothing to any of those stories, PoliticoSECRETARY POMPEO: Look look, every every look, these stories these stories are crazy. Every senior leader in the United States government will have a different view on something and they'll make their case where none of us are wallflowers. President Trump wouldn't want a wallflower in his administration. He wants people who are voicing their views based on the facts as they see them. John does that. I do that. There are days when we don't agree perfectly, but John and I, from a policy perspective, and as we stare at the risk to the world, are in nearly complete alignment.QUESTION: Although the stories suggest that you're in favor of negotiating and he's in favor of not negotiating, not believing.

What John and I think is interesting what the President says is really important, and the President has said that he is prepared at the right time, when the Iranians conclude that it's in their best interests to negotiate, we stand ready to take their call.QUESTION: I wanted to ask you one question.

There was a report that he was interviewed by some congressmen and was asked about the President, President Trump's values, and he said that he meaning Rex Tillerson was guided by, quote, "American values" such as democracy and freedom, but that he could not offer the same assessment for the President. What do you make of that comment?SECRETARY POMPEO: It's pretty outrageous and it probably explains why Rex Tillerson is no longer the secretary of state.QUESTION: John Kerry's no longer secretary of state. Do you feelSECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, no, we got lots of folks still hanging around the Hill.QUESTION: Do you feel confident that you're the only one speaking for with Iran's leaders at this point? Is there a cease-and-desist order there? I mean, now I hear they're waiting for 2020, China's waiting for everybody's waiting for 2020 before we do anything. It'sSECRETARY POMPEO: Sadly, I'm not confident that we don't have others out trying to speak on behalf of the United States working against President Trump's policies. I wish I could say that I was confident of that. I'm not. I've seen I saw Secretary Kerry travel to Munich. There's a security conference there every year. He was with Ernest Moniz, Wendy Sherman, and the whole gang that put in place the JCPOA, which fundamentally failed America, and it's what we're working to correct today. No, I'm not confident that we're in that place, and I hope when I here's my assurance to you all.QUESTION: Yeah.SECRETARY POMPEO: When I'm done being the Secretary of State, I'll get off the stage.QUESTION: You see how well this dynamic works? He'll ask the Tillerson questions, I'll ask the John Kerry questions, and we cover the entire spectrum, right, Mr. Secretary?SECRETARY POMPEO: I love predictability, yes, sir.QUESTION: Yeah, exactly. (Laughter.)SECRETARY POMPEO: Exactly.QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, thank you.QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, thank you.QUESTION: Thank you.SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you all.QUESTION: Please come back.QUESTION: We appreciate it very much.QUESTION: Thank you very much.Load-Date: May 23, 2019End of Document

The things that - the changes, the transition we're asking China to make to create these fair, reciprocal trading rules is no doubt a big ask, but it's important for the United States, and President Trump is firmly committed to it.QUESTION: I briefly mentioned the Chinese ambassador. Was he - was that for a U.S. audience? I mean, or is that really the --QUESTION: Or for a Chinese audience, yeah.QUESTION: Or was that really the policy positions that - I mean, I watched him say that there's been no military buildup in the South China Sea on any of the islands. I watched him say that everybody knows Huawei is just a private corporation and it has nothing to do with the - I watched him say that the internment camps are actually jobs training for the Uighurs. I watched him say that every - that everything they had decided on, that the United States had pulled out three or four times and taken back what they had - I mean, it was --SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah.QUESTION: I - maybe Baghdad Bob is too strong, but that's - that was the - that was the feeling I got listening to some of - and if that's what we're hearing from our - the negotiators in the trade talks, I don't see it going anywhere ever.SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, the Chinese are building up in the South China Sea. The --QUESTION: That's a fact?SECRETARY POMPEO: The authoritarian nature of what's taking place in Xinjiang to the Uighurs, some million people held in camps - these are not community colleges. These are authoritarian re-education institutions, and we've seen what's going on in the technology space. Those are facts. I can't account for why the Chinese ambassador said what he said.QUESTION: They've criticized you overtly too in saying certain things, have they not?SECRETARY POMPEO: I'm sure they have.QUESTION: They may be watching this and they're going to be mad that I said "Baghdad Bob," but it just --SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. What's important, Joe - what's important, Joe, is not that - not name-calling. It's important to be honest, get the facts right, and then ensure that our nation protects its interests, and President Trump has done that at every turn.QUESTION: And he - again, referencing some people that know him, they are saying he's not going to back down. He's going to listen to Chuck Schumer and not going to back down on this. Is that --SECRETARY POMPEO: President Trump has made clear his expectations for how the United States will behave with regard to China.QUESTION: There's not an S&#38;P, Standard &#38; Poor 500-level where we decide to start talking more?SECRETARY POMPEO: These are important commercial - long-term commercial economic interests of the United States and national security interests. President Trump understands them.QUESTION: We could go till nine o'clock talking about China, but we should mention Iran. What is the latest there in terms of - you have on record saying that we have plenty of oil, we've got partners that will make up for any disruptions that we see from Iran. In recent days, have you seen them pull back on some of the more bellicose moves they made, whether it's the bomb near the embassy or the - and we don't know it's them, for sure --SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah.QUESTION: -- with the ships, but it certainly looks like them.SECRETARY POMPEO: This threat, this threat from Iran, remains. We've had some luck in disrupting some of the tactical things that were in front of us, I think it's fair to say. But make sure we're still on high alert, we're still making sure we have the right resources in play. Your point - I remember when we began the maximum pressure campaign, there was talk probably on this show of oil going to 150. Your listeners should all know that when May 2nd came and we withdrew from the JCPOA, oil is now well below that. I think I saw Brent Crude at 69-something when I walked in here this morning. It's below where it was when we designated the IRGC a terrorist organization. We are confident that we've done the hard work to make sure that the market is well supplied, and I hope that we can continue to maintain that. I think we can.QUESTION: You have no problem saying unequivocally that this wasn't hyped by the administration for political purposes? The Democrats are sort of sounding that alarm.SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, none, no overhype, and we briefed Congress extensively Tuesday of this week. I think almost every member, Democrats and Republicans alike, walked out of that room understanding that the threats that we were discussing and the decision that President Trump made to take a posture to deter those threats and to protect our forces were wholly justified and reasonable.QUESTION: You and Bolton are on the same page?SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes.QUESTION: Yes?SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes. Well, look --QUESTION: Nothing going on there?SECRETARY POMPEO: Look --QUESTION: Nothing to any of those stories, Politico --SECRETARY POMPEO: Look - look, every - every - look, these stories - these stories are crazy. Every senior leader in the United States government will have a different view on something and they'll make their case where - none of us are wallflowers. President Trump wouldn't want a wallflower in his administration. He wants people who are voicing their views based on the facts as they see them. John does that. I do that. There are days when we don't agree perfectly, but John and I, from a policy perspective, and as we stare at the risk to the world, are in nearly complete alignment.QUESTION: Although the stories suggest that you're in favor of negotiating and he's in favor of not negotiating, not believing. Those are pretty important differentiations. Is --SECRETARY POMPEO: He's - talking about Iran?QUESTION: Yes.SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, the President's made clear that at the right time, negotiations are important. What John and I think is interesting - what the President says is really important, and the President has said that he is prepared at the right time, when the Iranians conclude that it's in their best interests to negotiate, we stand ready to take their call.QUESTION: I wanted to ask you one question. Your predecessor, Rex Tillerson, was in Washington apparently in the past two days. There was a report that he was interviewed by some congressmen and was asked about the President, President Trump's values, and he said that he - meaning Rex Tillerson - was guided by, quote, "American values" such as democracy and freedom, but that he could not offer the same assessment for the President. What do you make of that comment?SECRETARY POMPEO: It's pretty outrageous and it probably explains why Rex Tillerson is no longer the secretary of state.QUESTION: John Kerry's no longer secretary of state. Do you feel --SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, no, we got lots of folks still hanging around the Hill.QUESTION: Do you feel confident that you're the only one speaking for - with Iran's leaders at this point? Is there a cease-and-desist order there? I mean, now I hear they're waiting for 2020, China's waiting for - everybody's waiting for 2020 before we do anything. It's --SECRETARY POMPEO: Sadly, I'm not confident that we don't have others out trying to speak on behalf of the United States working against President Trump's policies. I wish I could say that I was confident of that. I'm not. I've seen - I saw Secretary Kerry travel to Munich. There's a security conference there every year. He was with Ernest Moniz, Wendy Sherman, and the whole gang that put in place the JCPOA, which fundamentally failed America, and it's what we're working to correct today. No, I'm not confident that we're in that place, and I hope when I - here's my assurance to you all.QUESTION: Yeah.SECRETARY POMPEO: When I'm done being the Secretary of State, I'll get off the stage.QUESTION: You see how well this dynamic works? He'll ask the Tillerson questions, I'll ask the John Kerry questions, and we cover the entire spectrum, right, Mr. Secretary?SECRETARY POMPEO: I love predictability, yes, sir.QUESTION: Yeah, exactly. (Laughter.)SECRETARY POMPEO: Exactly.QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, thank you.QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, thank you.QUESTION: Thank you.SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you all.QUESTION: Please come back.QUESTION: We appreciate it very much.QUESTION: Thank you very much.Copyright Targeted News ServicesTeamManager-6741143 TeamManagerLoad-Date: May 25, 2019End of Document

FCC Commissioner O'Rielly Issues Remarks at Brooklyn 5G Summit 2019Targeted News ServiceApril 25, 2019 Thursday 7:30 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3164 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Federal Communications Commission issued the following remarks by Commissioner Michael O'Rielly at the Brooklyn 5G Summit 2019:"Thank you, Chris, for that very kind introduction. Let me begin my remarks by extending my deepest appreciation to the summit's sponsoring hosts, Nokia and NYU WIRELESS Research Center, with a special thanks to Dr. Rappaport for his dogged dedication that makes this annual event such a success. I also want to highlight the great work of the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) engineers. Not only do they manage to make seemingly impossible tasks and requests doable and solvable, but they also arm Commissioners with the technical spectrum knowledge we need to greatly improve our overall policy making."Part of the benefit of being an FCC Commissioner is being invited to participate in different events throughout our great nation. With only so much travel permitted by my wife, today's event lured me to New York because of its extremely impressive roster of attendees, all with the intent of exploring the depths and technical intricacies of the topic at hand.This isn't the typical forum where a few buzzwords, like AI or blockchain or VR, are thrown around and then everyone heads to the cocktail hour; instead it's a premiere event designed to intellectually challenge all involved. I am honored to share the same stage with some of the brightest technological minds in business and academia.The Big Picture"When I consider what 5G may eventually mean for our society both at home and around the globe, I am reminded of a quote attributed to American sociologist Daniel Bell, "Technology, like art, is a soaring exercise of the human imagination." That simple statement defines the doorstep on which we stand today. 5G wireless technology-- if properly implemented and given the requisite resources -- is likely to alleviate a number of longstanding societal ills and, along the way, generate countless innovations that revolutionize the way humans work, play, communicate, and interact.To put a finer point on it, 5G has the capability to dramatically alter existing business models, create new ones never imagined, and generate improvements in consumer welfare far greater than ever seen before. I will try not to be guilty of over hyping its possibilities, but it is not too difficult to imagine a future where 5G has a positive impact on so many areas of our lives."At the same time, we should consider tempering certain expectations with a bit of realism, at least in the earliest stages of deployment. Consider the headline-grabbing business cases discussed publicly so far--services and features like remote surgery and autonomous cars. These will require serious leaps of faith by consumers before widespread implementation can occur. Instead, we might be wise to focus our attention on those slightly more modest, but still revolutionary, advances that are likely to have immediate impact in business manufacturing and services -- consider this an opportunity for wireless automation on a whole new scale. The improved speed, lower latency, and greater capacity resulting from 5G are a perfect fit to disrupt every stage of the business cycle, from labor, to supply chain, to production, to delivery. It will also have a lead role in creating so-called "Smart Cities." Without abandoning the vision of a futuristic, fully automated world, we would be warranted to adjust our horizontal sights to include an eye for uses that are about to be deployed sooner, making it easier to put in place the proper regulatory framework that allows for a long, steady runway of advancements far into the future."On that note and as previously referenced, the future success of 5G is dependent, first, on those in the right positions -- be it the private wireless sector, their financial backers, or those of us in government -- ensuring ample resources are available for it to flourish. From a regulator's perspective, this includes clearing and reallocating spectrum, especially in the midbands, where the technology can operate. Second, it also means addressing any challenges posed by both foreign governments and providers who may have malicious intent. Let me walk you through my views on both aspects.Mid-Band Spectrum Supply &#38;Demand"Although high-band spectrum holds out great promise for 5G and future communications services, and thanks to Dr. Rappaport who has been so helpful in expanding the Commission's vision of its upper spectrum limits, especially above 95 GHz, the U.S. government needs to be equally focused on providing the wireless sector with much needed mid-band spectrum for 5G networks. This effort has garnered much attention over the past few weeks.Many of the critiques of the Commission's efforts are a tad ironic, though, especially the ones coming from people who did everything they could to stymie improvements to the 3.5 GHz band. But,as someone who has been yelling from the rooftops about the need for mid-band spectrum for the past three years or so, I would like to offer a hearty welcome to the late arrivers to the party and I'm certainly looking forward to hearing their constructive ideas. So, let's talk about where we are with the mid bands right now."While the facts clearly show the U.S. leading the world in allocating and auctioning millimeter waves, our actions in the mid bands haven't been on par. Compare that the Commission recently finished the 28 GHz auction, ended the clock phase of the 24 GHz auction last week, and is moving on to the assignment round. These auctions will result in a total of1550 megahertz of millimeter wave spectrum being made available for 5G nationwide, but so far, the only sure thing we have in the mid bands is 3.5 GHz."And trust me, I do not want to minimize the importance of the 3.5 GHz band. I completed, at the Chairman's request, the effort to revisit the priority access licenses, or PALs, and adopt technical changes to make the spectrum more attractive for 5G networks. I continue to push for completion of the systems that will protect the incumbent Navy radar systems and enable the sharing paradigmen visioned for the band. I am proud of my efforts, especially since there were many interested parties with many divergent views, and we got through it without a single court challenge. This is almost unheard of at the FCC these days. But even as we're approaching the day when this spectrum will be fully available for 5G networks, we are talking about 70 megahertz of PALs - with any one entity only able to acquire 40 megahertz - and 80 megahertz of unlicensed-like, or GAA, spectrum. This is the equivalent of merely a 5G building block when multiple providers are craving a minimum of 100 megahertz channels. Basically, this supply is nowhere close to meeting demand."Our concerns should be heightened with the recent announcement that the 37, 39, and 47 GHz auction, which are the millimeter waves industry is clamoring for, will not even start until this December.This delayed auction has a domino effect. It is fair to conclude that if this auction is pushed back to December, then the 3.5 GHz auction has no chance of starting any earlier than the second quarter of 2020."Simply put, the Commission must make procedural changes to enable auctions to be held closer together and ideally even simultaneously. It cannot take months on end to upscale, reconfigure, and test our software between each auction. This is inexcusable. In the meantime, the Commission must announce the start date for the 3.5 GHz auction so that everyone is at least on notice as to when these mid-band licenses will be available."Next on my personal priority list is the 3.7 to 4.2 GHz band, or C-band, which must be a vital component of any mid-band strategy. Industry stakeholders have discussed different options, including the market-based approach that could repurpose 200 megahertz of spectrum relatively quickly while ensuring the incumbents will be accommodated. Hopefully, the satellite incumbents who are willing to surrender their spectrum rights will be able to find a way to increase the amount to be reallocated to 300 or more megahertz, but perfect cannot be allowed to be the enemy of good. It seems like some opponents of the market-based approach want all 500 megahertz or at least 500 megahertz in urban areas, while still somehow accommodating the various broadcast and cable operators whose programming is delivered using the spectrum. This seems farfetched - to nearly impossible - given the realities and equities at stake. Instead, we must be willing to adopt a plan that gets mid-band spectrum into providers' hands as soon as possible with the appropriate protections. To facilitate this, the Commission needs to finalize its review and wrap up this proceeding in the next few months. In other words, no more dawdling."In addition to CBRS and C-band, we need to tee-up even more mid bands for review, recognizing that doing so will likely cause some friction with existing federal government users. I accept the fate that the Commission cannot unilaterally dictate the reallocation of spectrum used by federal government agencies. However, we must expect greater attention to this issue and quicker action by these agencies - who are inconveniently parked in prime 5G bands - in order to meet our country's demand for more commercial spectrum.And, there are steps that can be taken by federal agencies in the near term to rectify the shortfall."In particular, I believe that NTIA and DOD must immediately make the 3.45 to 3.55 GHz band available for commercial use. This 100-megahertz block can be combined with spectrum at 3.5 and 3.7 to 4.2 GHz to create the large channel sizes that are required for true 5G services. The original schedule dictated that this spectrum would be made available for commercial use quickly, but NTIA and DOD mistakenly shifted course and opted for an unnecessary feasibility study. Anyone who's been around the federal government long knows that this type of maneuver is designed to circumvent the underlying policy directive. This unnecessary study should be concluded as soon as possible, and these frequencies reallocated for commercial use."Moreover, I call on our federal agencies to immediately initiate feasibility studies that are actually needed for the frequencies between 3.1 to 3.45 GHz. This spectrum is being used for "shipborne, land-based, and aeronautical mobile radar systems."While we have a general idea of what they are being used for, the particulars regarding exactly how, where, and what amount of spectrum is being used at any time are outdated, incomplete, and ultimately unhelpful. Perhaps the entire band may not be suitable for commercial use, but studies should be initiated, in this instance,to ensure that this spectrum is being used efficiently and determine whether some, or all, of the 350 megahertz can support commercial use."As an aside while I am discussing these DOD frequencies, I want to make clear that this spectrum should be repurposed for private sector use, not some sort of public-private or government-owned nationwide wholesale network. Some have suggested that frequencies in this range could be used as part of some convoluted scheme. While many of us were hopeful that the President's recent comments on the topic would put an end to these efforts, ideas in Washington rarely die, and this one seems to have more lives than the proverbial cat. There are too many reasons why such a proposal is completely flawed, but I will spare you that discussion today and reiterate my strong opposition to any nationalized 5G network."As long as I am discussing specific bands that deserve attention, it seems appropriate to throw another band into the mix. The 7.125 to 8.5 GHz band, which is primarily used by the government for fixed wireless systems, should also be studied to see if it can accommodate commercial operations. This idea of introducing non-federal uses into this band has been raised by others. Some have asserted, in an FCC proceeding, that it is possible to relocate fixed commercial users currently in the 6 GHz band to these frequencies. Additionally, some international organizations have been promoting this spectrum for globally harmonized mobile use. These are ideas that the U.S. should be exploring and NTIA should be studying."While it is not the focus of my discussion today, the Commission is also discussing mid-band spectrum for unlicensed use, such as the 5.9 and 6 GHz bands, so that wide channel blocks are available to meet the speed, capacity, and latency expectations demanded of next-generation Wi-Fi and other unlicensed uses. I will save this discussion for another day.International Complications &#38; Pitfalls"With your indulgence, let me turn the conversation to a major communications issue raging in D.C. and elsewhere: the appropriate reaction to foreign providers and nation states who are engaged in attempts to monopolize the development and deployment of 5G. If we accept as a given that a certain communist nation is trying to ensure its dominant global position in 5G, then we collectively need to understand the underlying motives driving this effort,the techniques being used to achieve it, its overall ramifications, and how best to respond."I assert that there are at least four fundamental concerns with the Chinese companies' approach to 5G. The first can charitably be referred to as the use of unfair advantages that arise from companies headquartered in a non-market economy competing with capitalist-minded providers. As currently structured, no Chinese communications company can be considered a fully distinct and separate entity from the Chinese government. Consider that Jack Ma, "CEO" of Alibaba and the most successful Chinese company head, is a ranking official in the Communist Party.Being a member of the state party in China, however, is much more than simply a voter registration or perhaps a reflection of one's preferences for one party or another. In China, party affiliation signals a much closer alignment with the powers that be and is virtually a prerequisite to accessing the levers of power - both politically and economically."It would be naive to think that Chinese companies can ignore or dismiss out of hand any "advice" they receive from their government. The state, therefore, ultimately gets to steer, in one form or another, every big company decision, and perhaps most importantly, can directly use its resources to greatly subsidize its providers. The state can also block foreign competitors from serving within China itself. From subsidized labor and low-cost loans, to unlimited operating capital, to everything in between, Chinese wireless providers have access to these government-sponsored advantages to lockdown their domestic market, expand their reach internationally, and gobble market share in each country they enter. In the long-run, the only solution, as I see it, is for global trade policy to be revised to take a harder line in accounting for companies from non-market economies."Second, Chinese attempts to use international multi-stakeholder organizations to skew standards in their favor, which I have discussed previously, continue to be extremely problematic. The most recent example is the inexplicable Chinese objection raised to a proposed change to the 5G standards introduced by the U.S. and other Western wireless providers and manufacturers. This objection could endanger a core principle - that 5G needs low-, mid-, and high- band spectrum. Specifically, the positive change sought would allow carrier aggregation of millimeter wave and paired sub-6 GHz spectrum using new dynamic spectrum sharing technology, which enables paired 4G spectrum also to be used for 5G without having to empty the band of 4G users. While it wouldn't replace the need for more mid-band spectrum for 5G than is currently available in the U.S., it would greatly accelerate the 5G roll out and would give consumers an early taste of the benefits of 5G. Sounds great, right? According to the objectors, this new technology is just happening too fast. It appears that they just can't keep up. That's an unacceptable position to take and a backward-looking approach. As the world heads into the next phase of 5G, we must embrace and foster technological innovation, not slow it down to meet some politburo's dictated timeline."Third, Chinese government involvement and interference in 5G development not only affects wireless providers but also the global manufacturing sector as well. For years, Chinese manufacturers have been obtaining market share internationally by exporting equipment that is not interoperable with other equipment brands, meaning that once a wireless provider or country invests in this equipment they are beholden to that Chinese manufacturer. This practice is more common than you may think. By providing below cost equipment, throwing cheap labor at service projects, and improving their equipment through stealing intellectual property, Chinese manufacturers have been able to win contracts throughout the world. One impact of this has been to devalue and shrink the number of communications equipment manufacturers. Where there once were many diverse competing companies, there are now three to four, depending on how you count. Chinese manufacturing prowess, built upon unfair advantages, continues to place an inordinate amount of pressure on other communications manufacturers and risks a further reduction in supply and ultimately market concentration. This is a scary prospect considering the national security implications, which gets me to my last point."Fourth and finally, the close relationship between Chinese companies and the state puts the national security of every rival country at risk. As Chinese equipment becomes more engrained in any given provider's network and as Chinese providers become more of a fixture in a nation's communications marketplace, it appears as though the Chinese government has the potential to access information that touches that equipment or is carried on that network. In our modern society, data and Internet networks are the core infrastructure for determining economic, diplomatic, and military might, and therefore are battlefields that will define our future. As a nation, we have an obligation to protect U.S. communications networks from foreign governments bent on accessing them to harm our citizens. Until this threat can be properly contained, we must strongly consider whether Chinese-related service offerings and equipment are unacceptable inputs for our communications networks."I'll stop there and turn to the question and answering portion of my presentation. Before doing so, I must reiterate my appreciation for being included in this wonderful summit. I only wish I was able to join you for yesterday's program."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6711557 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: April 27, 2019End of Document

Live at State With Economic and Business Affairs Bureau Deputy Assistant Secretary Robert StrayerTargeted News ServiceApril 29, 2019 Monday 9:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4798 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Department of State issued the transcript of the following special briefing by Deputy Assistant Secretary Robert Strayer:MODERATOR: Hello, and welcome to LiveAtState, the State Department's interactive virtual press briefing platform. I'm delighted to welcome participants joining us today from Europe, Africa, and around the globe. Today we'll be speaking with Robert L. Strayer, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Cyber and International Communications and Information Policy.

DAS Strayer, thank you for joining us today. I'll turn it over to you for some opening remarks.MR STRAYER: Thank you. The United States wants to maintain a secure cyberspace for future generations. We and our partners recognize that cyber policy issues are critical to not just protecting communications networks, but also to national security, human rights, and economic prosperity around the world. Because of its impact on these vital interests, cyber policy is a foreign policy priority for the United States. The security of information communications technologies, or ICTs, is an essential element of national security. These networks and services play a crucial role in the safety, security, and prosperity of each nation. The fifth generation of wireless technology, or 5G, will be transformative by providing consumers and businesses with up to 100 times faster connections than 4G networks provide, and with low latency, which is the time devices need to communicate with one another. Billions of new devices will become connected to the internet, enabling the internet of things. And these connections will empower a vast array of new critical services, from artificial intelligence to autonomous vehicles to telemedicine and automated manufacturing.Since 5G networks will begin to touch every aspect of our lives, the stakes could not be higher for its security. As countries around the world expand and update their ICT infrastructure, we are urging them to adopt a risk-based security framework. An important element of this is a careful evaluation of the supply chain and equipment vendors. In particular, this evaluation should result in the exclusions of equipment vendors that are subject to unchecked or extrajudicial control by a foreign power. These vendors could be ordered to undermine network security, to skim personal information, conduct espionage, distribute cyber attacks, and disrupt critical infrastructure.A significant cause for concern are a number of Chinese laws that compel their companies to cooperate with intelligence and security services without independent judicial controls. Responding to this risk, the United States enacted the National Defense Authorization Act last year, which prohibits the U.S. Government from using equipment or services from certain high-risk companies that are associated with, owned, or controlled by China. And no major U.S. wireless carrier plans to use Huawei or ZTE equipment in the buildout of its 5G network.The good news is that many other countries are also acknowledging this supply chain risk and strengthening their ITC security. And last month, the European Union Commission released a set of recommendations to improve the cyber security of 5G networks, noting that evaluations of equipment suppliers should include the risk of influence by a third country, notably in relation to its model of governance. These criteria must be rigorously applied.Moving forward in early May, the Czech Republic is hosting an important conference on 5G security that is attracting scores of countries. The United States welcomes their leadership and supports this initiative to create nonbinding principles on 5G network security that will drive global conversations on this issue. At the same time, many countries are not yet focused on 5G, but it's not premature for countries primarily using 2G and 3G networks to consider their strategies for ensuring future network security now. Decisions about who builds and how you secure 4G infrastructure are crucial because they will affect the security of future 5G networks.With that, I would be happy to answer your questions.MODERATOR: Great. Thank you, sir. First question comes from Martin Koelling at Handelsblatt in Germany: What are the risks and opportunities for cyber security in the 5G era? What is the speed and timeline of 5G expansion? What is the role of new technologies like pseudo-satellite, e.g. Softbank and Loon?MR STRAYER: So a number of new technologies will be built upon the 5G infrastructure. They will be empowered by the internet of things, they will be empowered by the very low latency and very high - up to 100 times what is current throughput on the networks. So we're going to see all kinds of not just new communications, but the ability for all kinds of critical infrastructure to ride over that infrastructure itself. So there's tremendous amount of economic growth that will occur in all the applications that ride on top of the actual infrastructure itself. So unlike the 4G networks of today, where they're relied on primarily for communications and the use of our smart devices, handheld smartphones, new types of direct machine communications will occur.MODERATOR: Next question is from Jack Stubbs at Reuters in the UK: How does the U.S. view the UK's reported decision to allow Huawei to build parts of its 5G network? And what do you want to achieve at the 5G conference in Prague?MR STRAYER: Well, first I would note that the United Kingdom has not announced a final decision. Like all of us, they're on a path of having continued conversations about security of 5G networks. I'd also point out that the United Kingdom, through their Huawei oversight board report, noted there were hundreds of vulnerabilities, including systemic engineering problems with Huawei technologies. So we're looking forward to continuing the conversations with them, and with a number of other countries at the Czech Republic-hosted conference that will occur later this week in Prague that will help define some nonbinding principles that all of us can apply to improving the security of our 5G networks, including with respect to the supply chain of the vendors.MODERATOR: Now, our platform is, as I was mentioning before the show, democratic. And we're going to turn next to the question that has the most votes right now, which is from Mark Bridge at The Times in the UK: Recently, you indicated that use of Huawei anywhere in a nation's 5G infrastructure would harm cooperation between that nation and the U.S. Britain will use Huawei equipment in parts of its 5G infrastructure. Will cooperation between the U.S. and the UK be hindered?MR STRAYER: It's premature to address that exact part of the question, but I will say this: As our economies become more interconnected, including our digital economies, more data transmits between the United States and Europe than any other part of the world, which of course includes the United Kingdom, we know that a disruption to services or a disruption to the ability to store or access information that transmits between those routes across the Atlantic will impact all of us. So indeed, it's not just about the sharing of intelligence or the cooperation on information sharing, it's about all the services that we're providing across the Atlantic today that could be disrupted. And it's not just the disruption, but as well as the intrusion of - insertion of cyber vulnerabilities or the use of the networks for espionage.MODERATOR: Next question along similar lines from The Wall Street Journal: What is the government's planned course of action for the now likely case that European allies such as Germany allow Huawei to build their 5G networks, in some detail if possible?MR STRAYER: Well, it's premature to assess that. I mean, we have said that if the risk to - if other countries insert and allow untrusted vendors to build out and become the vendors for their 5G networks, we will have to reassess the ability for us to share information and be interconnected with them in the ways that we are today. Exactly how that will be done will depend on the risk of the equipment that's put into the new networks.MODERATOR: Expanding a bit from Europe, Nike Ching from Voice of America asks: Can you please give us a sense, what is the strategy in alerting nations in Southeast Asia and Africa where Huawei is very popular?MR STRAYER: All right. So a year ago nobody was talking about the supply chain risks related to 5G networks, and there was a limited discussion related to 4G and 3G networks on the importance of supply chain security. So we've continued to have discussions with governments around the globe about supply chain security and its importance for all types of telecommunications networks, both the current generations of telecom networks as well as future generations. So we're going to continue to engage with those governments. We're going to share our views and our understandings about what are the avenues, and what is really going to be an enhanced attack surface in 5G because of the ability for much more software that will drive the networks and build a - for a potential adversary to compromise that software in any part of the networks.Furthermore, we're talking to countries about the shared values that we have, our shared values related to fundamental human rights and civil liberties. We want to talk about the importance of enabling the sharing of data in ways that are not going to be compromised that could result in authoritarian governments getting access to data and potentially compromising peoples' ability to have free expression, to peacefully assemble, or to exercise freedom of religion. We have, of course, seen that in China in recent years and we're very concerned about the ability of a government to compel telecommunications providers to provide that type of data to a government that has that track record.MODERATOR: Next question is from Steven Swinford at the Daily Telegraph in the UK: Do you believe that allowing Huawei to help build Britain's or any country's 5G telecoms network will risk national security even if it only applies to non-core parts of the network?MR STRAYER: It's the United States position that putting Huawei or other untrustworthy vendors in any part of the 5G telecommunications network is a risk. We are concerned that even at the edge of that network, where we're going to see increasingly what they're calling software-defined networks and the virtualization, the software virtualization of activities as part of the network that are done more today by hardware than software, but as they're increasingly done by software there's that increased attack surface. Having potentially compromised equipment and software provided by vendors in any part of that network is an unacceptable risk.MODERATOR: So a question along similar lines from Laurens Cerulus from POLITICO: Do you consider the distinction between core and radio networks a sensible approach to managing 5G security?MR STRAYER: It is our position in the United States that there is no way that we can effectively mitigate the risk to having an untrustworthy vendor in the edge of the network.MODERATOR: Next question from The Wall Street Journal: Is there anything that the U.S. Government and/or its allies could do to help Huawei's rivals in America and Europe to become more competitive, or to shield them from potential retributions on the Chinese market?MR STRAYER: I need to be clear here. The effort that we're undertaking around the world, our global diplomatic effort, has nothing to do with trade. It's 100 percent about national security interests. The conversations we're having are about national security. That said, it's also important to point out that there is no U.S. provider for the wireless radio networks, so we're not advancing a U.S. interest here. The primary competition to the Chinese are a Finnish company, a Swedish company, and a South Korean company.MODERATOR: Next question from Meaghan Tobin at the South China Morning Post: How will the U.S. approach to the military cooperation and intelligence sharing with nations which use Huawei in some aspects of their 5G networks - for example, allies like the Philippines and Thailand - within the U.S.'s historically conducted military exercises, how will that change if those are both going ahead with Huawei 5G tests?MR STRAYER: Well, certainly we want to have the opportunity to continue to have engagement with those governments about the future buildout of the 5G networks. They're in 4G - have 4G networks they - like all of us do - that are - they're now just starting to build out 5G networks. So we hope to convince them that in their 5G networks they should not have untrustworthy vendors in the network. That said, if there is an insertion of an untrustworthy vendor into a network, we're going to have to evaluate our ability to share information and how we would share that information.MODERATOR: Next question is from Markus Balser at Sueddeutsche Zeitung in Germany: Despite U.S. pressure, Germany refuses to exclude Huawei's 5G technology. How is this step seen by you? And is there a risk that Germany will lose access to intelligence sharing?MR STRAYER: So on the positive note, Germany has released a set of security standards related to 5G, which include looking at the ability for another country to undermine the data security laws in Germany and in the European Union. Acknowledging that general standard, though, the actual implementation that would occur down the road is very important. It's crucial that that be - that particular element related to the supply chain and the ability of a third country to compel its vendors to act in the interests of that - of an authoritarian country be considered. If that is actually applied in a rigorous way, then it should lead to the prohibition of Huawei and ZTE from networks in Germany and around the world.MODERATOR: Next question comes from Poland: The EU is coming up with the ACTA2 policy - A-C-T-A-2 policy. How beneficial are these kinds of policies as they infringe on our right to information?MR STRAYER: I'm not actually familiar with that law.MODERATOR: Okay. Well, we can attempt to come back to that at a different briefing.The next question is again about the ability of other companies to build out the 5G networks, specifically from Les Echos. The question is: Do Ericsson and Nokia have enough capacity to build the U.S. 5G network?MR STRAYER: Well, in our wireless carriers' view - I'm here representing the U.S. Government, of course. I cannot comment exactly on their internal supply chain issues. But my understanding is that our carriers have no concern about the ability for Ericsson, Nokia, and Samsung to supply their networks. Of course, they have said that they're not going to use Huawei or ZTE technology in their 5G networks.I think it's also important to recognize that when we talk about 5G, there's an entire ecosystem of component parts that will go into that well beyond just the wireless radio interface. There will be all kinds of networking and rallying that go on. There are American companies and companies around the world that supply that, including Cisco and Juniper. There's also going to be a very big importance too as we see more and more of the network virtualized - that is, software taking over the role that was previously performed by hardware. There'll be more data storage in effectively what is the cloud, a cloud environment. So there's many companies providing cloud infrastructure for that 5G ecosystem.MODERATOR: The next question from Parmy Olson at The Wall Street Journal: Can you elaborate on how the U.S. is defining, quote-unquote, 'sensitive networks' for 5G infrastructure? And is that definition different from the UK's current definition?MR STRAYER: Well, I don't really want to get into how we would define what are more sensitive networks and less sensitive networks. I would just revert back to the point I was making earlier, which is that in our view, because of the interconnectedness and the dramatic changes we're going to see in what 5G enables, that underlying infrastructure affecting the entire value stack of applications above it, that there are truly critical services that will be provided that we cannot see undermined in any part of a 5G network. We should be concerned about all parts of the 5G network going forward. And so therefore, no part of a 5G network should have parts or software coming from a vendor that could be under the control of an authoritarian government.MODERATOR: Next question from journalist Han Chen: Huawei and the Chinese Government have repeatedly denied U.S. allegations that Huawei equipment poses a security risk, claiming that the U.S. has not offered any concrete evidence. What is your strategy in countering those claims?MR STRAYER: Well, I think it's important to recognize that there's been a number of allegations that Huawei and ZTE over the years have been involved in intellectual property theft. In fact, there's currently an indictment against Huawei in the United States for the theft of intellectual property from T-Mobile, and that indictment notes that there was a campaign within the company to provide bonuses to employees who stole intellectual property.It's also important to recognize that it's not just the intellectual property theft. It's the ability for the government under their national intelligence law to compel that company to act in any way that is in the interests of the Chinese Communist Party. So in the future, they could be asked to do things they're not asked to do today. The way we look at it is there is a combination of intent, capabilities, and opportunity. With regard to intent, we've seen that China has a history of intellectual property theft that has occurred over the years that resulted in a statement in the Rose Garden in 2015 with President Obama that it was not lived up to.We noted last December, on December 20th, that China was behind the global hacking of what are called managed service providers, including global cloud providers around the world. And what China did is they used that data that it stole from some of the biggest companies around the world to provide to its own companies for their economic benefit. So we know there's a history of intellectual property theft.We also know there's a use of data in China that's contrary to the values that we have in the West. We've seen data used to assign social credit scores to then conduct surveillance against citizens, and then to use that information to put more than a million Uighurs into re-education camps. So those uses of data are completely contrary to the West's view, so we know there's an intent to use data in different ways than we would ever want to see used under our views about fundamental human rights.Secondly, we come to the capabilities. With regard to capabilities, we know there's the national intelligence law in China, the counterterrorism law, and then a number of other laws that come together to provide the Chinese Government complete control over their private sector and state-owned companies.And then lastly, opportunity. As I mentioned before, the attack surface in a 5G network is greatly expanded. Some have asked, "Where is the smoking gun?" Well, it's hardly appropriate to ask for the smoking gun evidence when we don't even have 5G networks built out yet, we don't have a history of 5G, and the - especially as U.S. cases get built out to provide massive amounts of new data, the temptation will be there to come after that data and use it for illicit purposes.So that all combined - the intent, the capabilities, and the opportunity - what we really have here is a loaded gun, is something that Western democracies who value human rights should think very carefully about if they want to give that to an authoritarian regime with very different values about the uses of data.MODERATOR: Next question from Peter O'Dwyer at The Times, Ireland edition: Was the EU commission's decision to ask member-states to carry out a risk assessment of the security risks posed by 5G technology rather than to ban Huawei sufficient from a U.S. point of view? And what should Ireland, which is currently undertaking such an assessment, consider as part of that exercise?MR STRAYER: We think that the European Commission's recommendation to conduct assessments by the end of June and then come up with a European-wide policy is a positive first step. Of course, it's very important that this analysis, this evaluation, be done in a very rigorous way, particularly as it relates to the supply chain. As I mentioned earlier, the European Union's recommendation is set to consider the governance of third countries where vendors are located. So it's very important to look at the laws in that country, the legal regime, the ability for companies there to seek independent judicial redress, to object if they are compelled to do something by the government. That, of course, does not exist in China. There is not an independent judiciary and there is an inability for companies to say that they do not want to comply with Chinese Communist Party direction. So with that in mind, we are hopeful that countries in Europe apply that type of framework and evaluation as they think about what kind of vendors they want in their 5G networks.So as I said, the European Commission's recommendations highlighting security related to 5G and including the fact that supply chain security is important is a positive first step, but it's going to be - the truth, the sort of - it will be borne out in how the - those standards and those evaluations are done in the months ahead. So we're in a very critical time for discussions with the European Union in the next few months.MODERATOR: Another question from POLITICO: Can operators maintain a multi-vendor policy to manage their cyber security risks without having access to Chinese vendors?MR STRAYER: Certainly. I think that question probably refers to who's managing the networks themselves. There's a number - a wide number of Western companies providing cybersecurity threat intelligence and cybersecurity management tools. If you just go to the RSA cyber conference, there's tens of thousands of companies that are there. There's no reason that one would have to necessarily turn to a Chinese company.MODERATOR: A question from Jack Stubbs at Reuters in the UK: Has the U.S. approach to 5G shifted away from Huawei and towards calling for increased security standards across the board? If so, why the shift?MR STRAYER: There has not been a shift. Our entire diplomatic effort has always started with the premise that we need a risk-based security framework that includes looking very carefully at the supply chain. We think that an evaluation of the supply chain for a risk-based approach - that includes looking at the insertion of intentional vulnerabilities - must require - requires someone to look at the countries where those vendors are located and the laws of those countries, particularly as it relates to authoritarian regimes, their ability to compel companies to act in that country's interest.So we've started from that general framework and we look at the laws that are in place and then the vendors that are subject to those laws are the ones that we say should be excluded from providing 5G infrastructure. So we're not targeting a particular country. I know there's been a number of questions about different countries, companies within countries. We've answered those questions, in our view, about those companies' activities and some concerns about them, but the overall framework that we're applying here is a security framework that does - that has been applied to a particular country and particular vendors.MODERATOR: Next question, another from Africa, from Pearl Matibe at NewsDay, in Zimbabwe: Zimbabwe was doing deals with China. What are the next steps that would ensure emerging markets with U.S. 5G technology infrastructure? Is the U.S. open to establishing a working group with the diaspora?MR STRAYER: Well, I will say more generally, the Chinese One Belt, One Road program has been offering countries in Africa and around the world what are basically loan terms that you would never find in any type of Western development bank, but what we have the countries thinking about is the strings that are attached to that. These are essentially predatory loans. They often ask for collateral to be attached to those loans. As we see in some cases, it's required countries to give up the ownership of their ports when they weren't able to make payments. They've also done these deals in many cases in non-transparent ways. It's very hard for the public and others to have knowledge of what kind of deals are being struck in these deals. They're not in - done in the best practices that we would consider in the West to be ways that countries and companies should be doing business.So we would like to have a very close dialogue with countries like Zimbabwe about how we can potentially assist them in financing their infrastructure. There's a number of development banks around the world who are able to invest in that type of infrastructure. So whether it's all sorts of important infrastructure, including telecommunications infrastructure, we seek to be very engaged with them and look for opportunities to make that economic prosperity come about in ways that are transparent and will lead to the long-term prosperity of citizens in those countries.MODERATOR: And we have one final question, this one again from POLITICO: Have you been satisfied with the draft Prague principles that you've seen so far? What elements do you consider key for these non-binding principles to work?MR STRAYER: Well, I will say that I am very satisfied with our engagement with the Czech Republic and their very diligent work on these principles. I don't want to get ahead of them and the announcement of the principles that they are going to have at their conference. I look forward to having discussions with them. We really appreciate their leadership on this important issue and their drafting of the principles.MODERATOR: And before we wrap, I would like to give you the opportunity for any final remarks.MR STRAYER: Thank you. Thank you very much for having me, and I appreciate everyone who's been on in the online world, participating and asking all these great questions. This really comes to a fundamental question about values, about entrusting in your data with countries, and those that share values with you. And in important ways, we've seen the compromise of those values and the violation of fundamental human rights and civil liberties with regards to the freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, and the freedom to practice religion as one chooses. So we urge countries to think very carefully as they implement requirements related to 5G infrastructure, including related to the supply chain, and think very carefully about the values of the companies and the countries that they are being asked to do business with and receive offers from countries that have a track record that is checkered at best.MODERATOR: Unfortunately, that is all the time we have for today.

DAS Strayer, thank you for joining us today. Ill turn it over to you for some opening remarks.MR STRAYER: Thank you. The United States wants to maintain a secure cyberspace for future generations. We and our partners recognize that cyber policy issues are critical to not just protecting communications networks, but also to national security, human rights, and economic prosperity around the world. Because of its impact on these vital interests, cyber policy is a foreign policy priority for the United States. The security of information communications technologies, or ICTs, is an essential element of national security. These networks and services play a crucial role in the safety, security, and prosperity of each nation. The fifth generation of wireless technology, or 5G, will be transformative by providing consumers and businesses with up to 100 times faster connections than 4G networks provide, and with low latency, which is the time devices need to communicate with one another. Billions of new devices will become connected to the internet, enabling the internet of things. And these connections will empower a vast array of new critical services, from artificial intelligence to autonomous vehicles to telemedicine and automated manufacturing.Since 5G networks will begin to touch every aspect of our lives, the stakes could not be higher for its security. As countries around the world expand and update their ICT infrastructure, we are urging them to adopt a risk-based security framework. An important element of this is a careful evaluation of the supply chain and equipment vendors. In particular, this evaluation should result in the exclusions of equipment vendors that are subject to unchecked or extrajudicial control by a foreign power. These vendors could be ordered to undermine network security, to skim personal information, conduct espionage, distribute cyber attacks, and disrupt critical infrastructure.A significant cause for concern are a number of Chinese laws that compel their companies to cooperate with intelligence and security services without independent judicial controls. Responding to this risk, the United States enacted the National Defense Authorization Act last year, which prohibits the U.S. Government from using equipment or services from certain high-risk companies that are associated with, owned, or controlled by China. And no major U.S. wireless carrier plans to use Huawei or ZTE equipment in the buildout of its 5G network.The good news is that many other countries are also acknowledging this supply chain risk and strengthening their ITC security. And last month, the European Union Commission released a set of recommendations to improve the cyber security of 5G networks, noting that evaluations of equipment suppliers should include the risk of influence by a third country, notably in relation to its model of governance. These criteria must be rigorously applied.Moving forward in early May, the Czech Republic is hosting an important conference on 5G security that is attracting scores of countries. The United States welcomes their leadership and supports this initiative to create nonbinding principles on 5G network security that will drive global conversations on this issue. At the same time, many countries are not yet focused on 5G, but its not premature for countries primarily using 2G and 3G networks to consider their strategies for ensuring future network security now. Decisions about who builds and how you secure 4G infrastructure are crucial because they will affect the security of future 5G networks.With that, I would be happy to answer your questions.MODERATOR: Great. Thank you, sir. First question comes from Martin Koelling at Handelsblatt in Germany: What are the risks and opportunities for cyber security in the 5G era? What is the speed and timeline of 5G expansion? What is the role of new technologies like pseudo-satellite, e.g. Softbank and Loon?MR STRAYER: So a number of new technologies will be built upon the 5G infrastructure. They will be empowered by the internet of things, they will be empowered by the very low latency and very high up to 100 times what is current throughput on the networks. So were going to see all kinds of not just new communications, but the ability for all kinds of critical infrastructure to ride over that infrastructure itself. So theres tremendous amount of economic growth that will occur in all the applications that ride on top of the actual infrastructure itself. So unlike the 4G networks of today, where theyre relied on primarily for communications and the use of our smart devices, handheld smartphones, new types of direct machine communications will occur.MODERATOR: Next question is from Jack Stubbs at Reuters in the UK: How does the U.S. view the UKs reported decision to allow Huawei to build parts of its 5G network? And what do you want to achieve at the 5G conference in Prague?MR STRAYER: Well, first I would note that the United Kingdom has not announced a final decision. Like all of us, theyre on a path of having continued conversations about security of 5G networks. Id also point out that the United Kingdom, through their Huawei oversight board report, noted there were hundreds of vulnerabilities, including systemic engineering problems with Huawei technologies. So were looking forward to continuing the conversations with them, and with a number of other countries at the Czech Republic-hosted conference that will occur later this week in Prague that will help define some nonbinding principles that all of us can apply to improving the security of our 5G networks, including with respect to the supply chain of the vendors.MODERATOR: Now, our platform is, as I was mentioning before the show, democratic. And were going to turn next to the question that has the most votes right now, which is from Mark Bridge at The Times in the UK: Recently, you indicated that use of Huawei anywhere in a nations 5G infrastructure would harm cooperation between that nation and the U.S. Britain will use Huawei equipment in parts of its 5G infrastructure. Will cooperation between the U.S. and the UK be hindered?MR STRAYER: Its premature to address that exact part of the question, but I will say this: As our economies become more interconnected, including our digital economies, more data transmits between the United States and Europe than any other part of the world, which of course includes the United Kingdom, we know that a disruption to services or a disruption to the ability to store or access information that transmits between those routes across the Atlantic will impact all of us. So indeed, its not just about the sharing of intelligence or the cooperation on information sharing, its about all the services that were providing across the Atlantic today that could be disrupted. And its not just the disruption, but as well as the intrusion of insertion of cyber vulnerabilities or the use of the networks for espionage.MODERATOR: Next question along similar lines from The Wall Street Journal: What is the governments planned course of action for the now likely case that European allies such as Germany allow Huawei to build their 5G networks, in some detail if possible?MR STRAYER: Well, its premature to assess that. I mean, we have said that if the risk to if other countries insert and allow untrusted vendors to build out and become the vendors for their 5G networks, we will have to reassess the ability for us to share information and be interconnected with them in the ways that we are today. Exactly how that will be done will depend on the risk of the equipment thats put into the new networks.MODERATOR: Expanding a bit from Europe, Nike Ching from Voice of America asks: Can you please give us a sense, what is the strategy in alerting nations in Southeast Asia and Africa where Huawei is very popular?MR STRAYER: All right. So a year ago nobody was talking about the supply chain risks related to 5G networks, and there was a limited discussion related to 4G and 3G networks on the importance of supply chain security. So weve continued to have discussions with governments around the globe about supply chain security and its importance for all types of telecommunications networks, both the current generations of telecom networks as well as future generations. So were going to continue to engage with those governments. Were going to share our views and our understandings about what are the avenues, and what is really going to be an enhanced attack surface in 5G because of the ability for much more software that will drive the networks and build a for a potential adversary to compromise that software in any part of the networks.Furthermore, were talking to countries about the shared values that we have, our shared values related to fundamental human rights and civil liberties. We want to talk about the importance of enabling the sharing of data in ways that are not going to be compromised that could result in authoritarian governments getting access to data and potentially compromising peoples ability to have free expression, to peacefully assemble, or to exercise freedom of religion. We have, of course, seen that in China in recent years and were very concerned about the ability of a government to compel telecommunications providers to provide that type of data to a government that has that track record.MODERATOR: Next question is from Steven Swinford at the Daily Telegraph in the UK: Do you believe that allowing Huawei to help build Britains or any countrys 5G telecoms network will risk national security even if it only applies to non-core parts of the network?MR STRAYER: Its the United States position that putting Huawei or other untrustworthy vendors in any part of the 5G telecommunications network is a risk. We are concerned that even at the edge of that network, where were going to see increasingly what theyre calling software-defined networks and the virtualization, the software virtualization of activities as part of the network that are done more today by hardware than software, but as theyre increasingly done by software theres that increased attack surface. Having potentially compromised equipment and software provided by vendors in any part of that network is an unacceptable risk.MODERATOR: So a question along similar lines from Laurens Cerulus from POLITICO: Do you consider the distinction between core and radio networks a sensible approach to managing 5G security?MR STRAYER: It is our position in the United States that there is no way that we can effectively mitigate the risk to having an untrustworthy vendor in the edge of the network.MODERATOR: Next question from The Wall Street Journal: Is there anything that the U.S. Government and/or its allies could do to help Huaweis rivals in America and Europe to become more competitive, or to shield them from potential retributions on the Chinese market?MR STRAYER: I need to be clear here. The effort that were undertaking around the world, our global diplomatic effort, has nothing to do with trade. Its 100 percent about national security interests. The conversations were having are about national security. That said, its also important to point out that there is no U.S. provider for the wireless radio networks, so were not advancing a U.S. interest here. The primary competition to the Chinese are a Finnish company, a Swedish company, and a South Korean company.MODERATOR: Next question from Meaghan Tobin at the South China Morning Post: How will the U.S. approach to the military cooperation and intelligence sharing with nations which use Huawei in some aspects of their 5G networks for example, allies like the Philippines and Thailand within the U.S.s historically conducted military exercises, how will that change if those are both going ahead with Huawei 5G tests?MR STRAYER: Well, certainly we want to have the opportunity to continue to have engagement with those governments about the future buildout of the 5G networks. Theyre in 4G have 4G networks they like all of us do that are theyre now just starting to build out 5G networks. So we hope to convince them that in their 5G networks they should not have untrustworthy vendors in the network. That said, if there is an insertion of an untrustworthy vendor into a network, were going to have to evaluate our ability to share information and how we would share that information.MODERATOR: Next question is from Markus Balser at Sueddeutsche Zeitung in Germany: Despite U.S. pressure, Germany refuses to exclude Huaweis 5G technology. How is this step seen by you? And is there a risk that Germany will lose access to intelligence sharing?MR STRAYER: So on the positive note, Germany has released a set of security standards related to 5G, which include looking at the ability for another country to undermine the data security laws in Germany and in the European Union. Acknowledging that general standard, though, the actual implementation that would occur down the road is very important. Its crucial that that be that particular element related to the supply chain and the ability of a third country to compel its vendors to act in the interests of that of an authoritarian country be considered. If that is actually applied in a rigorous way, then it should lead to the prohibition of Huawei and ZTE from networks in Germany and around the world.MODERATOR: Next question comes from Poland: The EU is coming up with the ACTA2 policy A-C-T-A-2 policy. How beneficial are these kinds of policies as they infringe on our right to information?MR STRAYER: Im not actually familiar with that law.MODERATOR: Okay. Well, we can attempt to come back to that at a different briefing.The next question is again about the ability of other companies to build out the 5G networks, specifically from Les Echos.

And so therefore, no part of a 5G network should have parts or software coming from a vendor that could be under the control of an authoritarian government.MODERATOR: Next question from journalist Han Chen: Huawei and the Chinese Government have repeatedly denied U.S. allegations that Huawei equipment poses a security risk, claiming that the U.S. has not offered any concrete evidence. What is your strategy in countering those claims?MR STRAYER: Well, I think its important to recognize that theres been a number of allegations that Huawei and ZTE over the years have been involved in intellectual property theft. In fact, theres currently an indictment against Huawei in the United States for the theft of intellectual property from T-Mobile, and that indictment notes that there was a campaign within the company to provide bonuses to employees who stole intellectual property.Its also important to recognize that its not just the intellectual property theft. Its the ability for the government under their national intelligence law to compel that company to act in any way that is in the interests of the Chinese Communist Party. So in the future, they could be asked to do things theyre not asked to do today. The way we look at it is there is a combination of intent, capabilities, and opportunity. With regard to intent, weve seen that China has a history of intellectual property theft that has occurred over the years that resulted in a statement in the Rose Garden in 2015 with President Obama that it was not lived up to.We noted last December, on December 20th, that China was behind the global hacking of what are called managed service providers, including global cloud providers around the world. And what China did is they used that data that it stole from some of the biggest companies around the world to provide to its own companies for their economic benefit. So we know theres a history of intellectual property theft.We also know theres a use of data in China thats contrary to the values that we have in the West. Weve seen data used to assign social credit scores to then conduct surveillance against citizens, and then to use that information to put more than a million Uighurs into re-education camps. So those uses of data are completely contrary to the Wests view, so we know theres an intent to use data in different ways than we would ever want to see used under our views about fundamental human rights.Secondly, we come to the capabilities. With regard to capabilities, we know theres the national intelligence law in China, the counterterrorism law, and then a number of other laws that come together to provide the Chinese Government complete control over their private sector and state-owned companies.And then lastly, opportunity. As I mentioned before, the attack surface in a 5G network is greatly expanded. Some have asked, Where is the smoking gun? Well, its hardly appropriate to ask for the smoking gun evidence when we dont even have 5G networks built out yet, we dont have a history of 5G, and the especially as U.S. cases get built out to provide massive amounts of new data, the temptation will be there to come after that data and use it for illicit purposes.So that all combined the intent, the capabilities, and the opportunity what we really have here is a loaded gun, is something that Western democracies who value human rights should think very carefully about if they want to give that to an authoritarian regime with very different values about the uses of data.MODERATOR: Next question from Peter ODwyer at The Times, Ireland edition: Was the EU commissions decision to ask member-states to carry out a risk assessment of the security risks posed by 5G technology rather than to ban Huawei sufficient from a U.S. point of view? And what should Ireland, which is currently undertaking such an assessment, consider as part of that exercise?MR STRAYER: We think that the European Commissions recommendation to conduct assessments by the end of June and then come up with a European-wide policy is a positive first step. Of course, its very important that this analysis, this evaluation, be done in a very rigorous way, particularly as it relates to the supply chain. As I mentioned earlier, the European Unions recommendation is set to consider the governance of third countries where vendors are located. So its very important to look at the laws in that country, the legal regime, the ability for companies there to seek independent judicial redress, to object if they are compelled to do something by the government. That, of course, does not exist in China. There is not an independent judiciary and there is an inability for companies to say that they do not want to comply with Chinese Communist Party direction. So with that in mind, we are hopeful that countries in Europe apply that type of framework and evaluation as they think about what kind of vendors they want in their 5G networks.So as I said, the European Commissions recommendations highlighting security related to 5G and including the fact that supply chain security is important is a positive first step, but its going to be the truth, the sort of it will be borne out in how the those standards and those evaluations are done in the months ahead. So were in a very critical time for discussions with the European Union in the next few months.MODERATOR: Another question from POLITICO: Can operators maintain a multi-vendor policy to manage their cyber security risks without having access to Chinese vendors?MR STRAYER: Certainly. I think that question probably refers to whos managing the networks themselves. Theres a number a wide number of Western companies providing cybersecurity threat intelligence and cybersecurity management tools. If you just go to the RSA cyber conference, theres tens of thousands of companies that are there. Theres no reason that one would have to necessarily turn to a Chinese company.MODERATOR: A question from Jack Stubbs at Reuters in the UK: Has the U.S. approach to 5G shifted away from Huawei and towards calling for increased security standards across the board? If so, why the shift?MR STRAYER: There has not been a shift. Our entire diplomatic effort has always started with the premise that we need a risk-based security framework that includes looking very carefully at the supply chain. We think that an evaluation of the supply chain for a risk-based approach that includes looking at the insertion of intentional vulnerabilities must require requires someone to look at the countries where those vendors are located and the laws of those countries, particularly as it relates to authoritarian regimes, their ability to compel companies to act in that countrys interest.So weve started from that general framework and we look at the laws that are in place and then the vendors that are subject to those laws are the ones that we say should be excluded from providing 5G infrastructure. So were not targeting a particular country. I know theres been a number of questions about different countries, companies within countries. Weve answered those questions, in our view, about those companies activities and some concerns about them, but the overall framework that were applying here is a security framework that does that has been applied to a particular country and particular vendors.MODERATOR: Next question, another from Africa, from Pearl Matibe at NewsDay, in Zimbabwe: Zimbabwe was doing deals with China. What are the next steps that would ensure emerging markets with U.S. 5G technology infrastructure? Is the U.S. open to establishing a working group with the diaspora?MR STRAYER: Well, I will say more generally, the Chinese One Belt, One Road program has been offering countries in Africa and around the world what are basically loan terms that you would never find in any type of Western development bank, but what we have the countries thinking about is the strings that are attached to that. These are essentially predatory loans. They often ask for collateral to be attached to those loans. As we see in some cases, its required countries to give up the ownership of their ports when they werent able to make payments. Theyve also done these deals in many cases in non-transparent ways. Its very hard for the public and others to have knowledge of what kind of deals are being struck in these deals. Theyre not in done in the best practices that we would consider in the West to be ways that countries and companies should be doing business.So we would like to have a very close dialogue with countries like Zimbabwe about how we can potentially assist them in financing their infrastructure. Theres a number of development banks around the world who are able to invest in that type of infrastructure. So whether its all sorts of important infrastructure, including telecommunications infrastructure, we seek to be very engaged with them and look for opportunities to make that economic prosperity come about in ways that are transparent and will lead to the long-term prosperity of citizens in those countries.MODERATOR: And we have one final question, this one again from POLITICO: Have you been satisfied with the draft Prague principles that youve seen so far? What elements do you consider key for these non-binding principles to work?MR STRAYER: Well, I will say that I am very satisfied with our engagement with the Czech Republic and their very diligent work on these principles. I dont want to get ahead of them and the announcement of the principles that they are going to have at their conference. I look forward to having discussions with them. We really appreciate their leadership on this important issue and their drafting of the principles.MODERATOR: And before we wrap, I would like to give you the opportunity for any final remarks.MR STRAYER: Thank you. Thank you very much for having me, and I appreciate everyone whos been on in the online world, participating and asking all these great questions. This really comes to a fundamental question about values, about entrusting in your data with countries, and those that share values with you. And in important ways, weve seen the compromise of those values and the violation of fundamental human rights and civil liberties with regards to the freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, and the freedom to practice religion as one chooses. So we urge countries to think very carefully as they implement requirements related to 5G infrastructure, including related to the supply chain, and think very carefully about the values of the companies and the countries that they are being asked to do business with and receive offers from countries that have a track record that is checkered at best.MODERATOR: Unfortunately, that is all the time we have for today.

Apr. 30 20199:30am 11:30am5th Floor, Woodrow Wilson CenterThere will be a webcast of this event There will be a podcast of this eventAs one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, Southeast Asia is witnessing the world's biggest jump in greenhouse gasses. The International Energy Agency estimates that the region's energy demand will grow by 66 percent by 2040, with coal accounting for almost 40 percent of this increase. Since President Xi Jinping launched China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013, Chinese investment in coal and gas have intensified in Southeast Asia. The World Resources Institute has estimated that 75% of the $145 billion BRI loans from China's major banks have supported fossil fuel energy projects, including $10 billion for coal plants. Although China produces 90% of the world's solar panels, Chinese solar power companies are a notably small part of BRI energy investments, but with President Xi calling for a "greener" BRI, this could change.At this CEF meeting, speakers will provide stories of China's energy engagement in Southeast Asia, highlighting the opportunities for China to play a bigger role in supporting the region's clean energy transition. Courtney Weatherby (Stimson Center) will review China's role as an energy investor in Southeast Asia and explore the growing interest for solar and other renewables to meet region's future energy demand. She also will share stories of new clean energy targets and policy shifts in Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia. Sam Geall (chinadialogue) will discuss the Chinese government's ambitious plan to add over 10 GW capacity of solar photovoltaic power to benefit over 2 million rural households across China by 2020. He will talk about how these solar initiatives in China could inform the government's efforts to increase clean energy investments in the Belt and Road Initiative. Darrin Magee (Hobart and William Smith Colleges) will delve into how an interconnected smart grid linking solar power plants in Cambodia with hydropower plants in China's Yunnan Province could balance energy supplies and reduce the need for more hydropower in the region.SpeakersModeratorJennifer L.

Here's what the industry's top executives earned in 2018.The stolen data included names, health identification numbers, dates of birth, social security numbers, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, employment information, and income data, the indictment said.Anthem paid the US government $16 million as a result of the privacy violation in October 2018.One of the techniques Wang is said to have used was a "spearfishing" email, a targeted message designed to trick the recipient into treating it as legitimate.Emails with hyperlinks were sent to employees of the four companies, the DOJ said. If they clicked on the link it installed malware which opened a back door to the company's computer server, the indictment said. Wang and the other man were both charged with one count of conspiracy to commit fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and two substantive counts of intentional damage to a protected computer.Read more: 4 healthcare costs in retirement no one warns you aboutIn a statement, DOJ assistant attorney general Brian Benczkowski said: "The allegations in the indictment unsealed today outline the activities of a brazen China-based computer hacking group that committed one of the worst data breaches in history.""These defendants allegedly attacked US businesses operating in four distinct industry sectors, and violated the privacy of over 78 million people by stealing their PII (personally identifiable information)."In February 2015, Bloomberg reported that the FBI believes the hack was sponsored by the Chinese government. An Anthem spokeswoman told Business Insider in an emailed statement:"We are grateful for the support and partnership of the FBI and extended law enforcement team in investigating the sophisticated cyber-attack that Anthem was a victim of in February 2015, and are pleased with the action taken today.""There is no evidence that information obtained through the 2015 cyber-attack targeting Anthem has resulted in fraud."NOW WATCH: The rise and fall of Donald Trump's $365 million airlineSee Also:• Take a tour of the closest Chinese city to North Korea, which Kim Jong Un recently passed to meet Trump - the nearest thing to the outside world most North Koreans will ever see• The 50 best video games of all time, according to critics• Israel's Iron Dome missile-interception system stopped 86% of an enormous rocket barrage despite Hamas claims to have overwhelmed itLoad-Date: May 14, 2019End of Document

Under President Trump s leadership, Americans will be able to trust that our data and infrastructure are secure. HUAWEI SAYS  BRING IT ON :Senior executives for Chinese telecommunications group Huawei said Wednesday they would  welcome  the U.S. banning use of technology deemed a national security risk, as President Trump considers signing an executive order on the matter. Making America safer from a national security perspective, we welcome it,  Andy Purdy, the chief technology officer for Huawei Technologies USA, told The Hill in an interview.Purdy s comments came shortly before the president signed the executive order on Wednesday afternoon.Don Morrissey, the head of congressional, state and local governmental affairs for Huawei, told The Hill that it s Huawei s  firm desire to be able to talk to the government and look at solutions on cybersecurity that cover all vendors, that look at risk mitigation. Scrutiny from the Senate:Huawei s potential impact on the rollout of fifth generation wireless technology, or 5G, was a focus of a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday on national security threats stemming from 5G. Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) suggested that the U.S. should consider severing business ties with other countries that use Chinese technology, telling reporters that  until China stops being a communist dictatorship, we are not going to support working with a country that uses their technology. Huawei executives pushed back on those comments, with Purdy saying the Senate hearing  really manifested a misunderstanding or lack of understanding of the role of equipment vendors and the role of the network operators and how those relationships are managed, how risk is managed. They misunderstand the relationship of the equipment vendor like Huawei with customer data. During Tuesday s Senate hearing, there appeared to be bipartisan support and an understanding of the dangers posed by allowing Chinese companies access to 5G networks in the U.S., or to those of the American allies. If our allies decide to trust Huawei, they are deciding to trust the Chinese government with their big data,  Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said.IT S A NO FROM US:The White House on Wednesday said it declined to sign on to a global call to fight online extremism, citing concerns about freedom of speech.New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and French President Emmanuel Macron are meeting in Paris on Wednesday to rally support for the  Christchurch call,  a pledge to coordinate efforts to crack down on online terrorist content following the March attack on worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.The shooting was livestreamed on Facebook and appeared on all of the major social media platforms.What the White House says:The White House said in a statement that while it stands with the international community in  condemning terrorist and violent extremist content online,  it is not currently  in a position to join the endorsement. The White House s Office of Science and Technology Policy said in the statement that it believes the  best tool to defeat terrorist speech is productive speech.  We maintain that the best tool to defeat terrorist speech is productive speech, and thus we emphasize the importance of promoting credible, alternative narratives as the primary means by which we can defeat terrorist messaging,  the statement reads. We encourage technology companies to enforce their terms of service and community standards that forbid the use of their platforms for terrorist purpose,  it added.The pushback:The decision could open up the Trump administration to criticism it is not doing enough to combat white supremacists.Trump was widely condemned for saying there were  very fine people on both sides  of a 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., where a counterprotester was killed. It also ended a Department of Homeland Security program designed to combat domestic terrorism.What the pact means:The Christchurch call asks the top social media companies to step up their efforts to investigate and remove toxic online content from their platforms and asks them to commit to share more information about online terrorism with government authorities.Top executives with Google, Facebook and Twitter are scheduled to attend the summit. Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Twitter are expected to sign the nonbinding agreement.LIVESTREAM CRACKDOWN:Facebook will start restricting the use of its livestreaming feature for users who violate its content policies in a new shift that comes in response to the mosque attacks in New Zealand earlier this year that were livestreamed and quickly spread across social media.The company announced in a blog post on Tuesday that users who break rules involving terrorism, hate speech and violence will not be allowed to use Facebook Live for a certain amount of time. For instance, someone who shares a link to a statement from a terrorist group with no context will now be immediately blocked from using Live for a set period of time,  Guy Rosen, Facebook s vice president of integrity, wrote in the post.  We plan on extending these restrictions to other areas over the coming weeks, beginning with preventing those same people from creating ads on Facebook. The social media company has struggled to respond to the withering criticism from New Zealand officials after the shooter broadcasted the attack that left 50 people dead.Tags: See Campaign:https://thehill.com/policy/technology/overnights/443937-hillicon-valley-trump-signs-order-aimed-at-protecting-usContact Information:HARPER NEIDIG, MAGGIE MILLER, OLIVIA BEAVERS AND EMILY BIRNBAUMTags:,            Cybersecurity Newswire,            Wire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: May 20, 2019End of Document

OVERSEAS TECH WORKERS WARN OF 'RACE TO BOTTOM' IN CHINA OVERTIME ROWStates News ServiceApril 23, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 794 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Overseas tech workers have come out in support of colleagues in China, warning of a "race to the bottom" following comments made by tech tycoon Jack Ma about the "996" overtime culture in the industry.Tech workers in China started a repository--usually used to share programming projects--on GitHub, a platform that is used daily by developers to collaborate on projects.Calling it 996.ICU in reference to the grueling, 12 hours a day, six days a week schedule expected of many tech employees in China, they hit back at the growing pressure to put in regular overtime."By following the '996' work schedule, you are risking yourself getting into the ICU (Intensive Care Unit)," the project description says, followed by a copy of China's Labor Law, under which such hours are illegal.Alibaba founder and billionaire Ma has previously referred to a 72-hour working week as "a blessing.""If we find things we like, 996 is not a problem. If you don't enjoy [work], every minute is torture," Ma wrote in recent blog post."We, the workers of Microsoft and GitHub, support the 996.ICU movement and stand in solidarity with tech workers in China," a statement signed by 150 tech workers on GitHub said. "We know this is a problem that crosses national borders."The statement said workers at Microsoft and the industry as a whole faced similar pressures to work extreme overtime."Another reason we must take a stand in solidarity with Chinese workers is that history tells us that multinational companies will pit workers against each other in a race to the bottom as they outsource jobs and take advantage of weak labor standards in the pursuit of profit," the statement said."We have to come together across national boundaries to ensure just working conditions for everyone around the globe."Widespread support seenIt said the 996.ICU page on GitHub had garnered more than 200,000 "stars", indicating widespread support for Chinese tech workers.Since the repository went viral, however, Chinese browsers had restricted access to the page, warning users that it contains "malicious content," the statement said."We must entertain the possibility that Microsoft and GitHub will be pressured to remove the repository as well," it said. "We encourage Microsoft and GitHub to keep the 996.ICU GitHub repository uncensored and available to everyone."Comments appended to the page via the "issues" section were mixed."It's time to sing anThe Internationalean," wrote user wckgo, while user ilioner wrote: "There are plenty of places in Chengdu where you have to work from nine to 10 p.m.""It's nearly International Labor Day, May 1 -- help wanted," wrote lcgtpr, while nufeng74 commented: "To oppose 996 is to promote job creation."Meanwhile, users created a hashtag calling on supporters to send copies of China's Labor Law, which stipulates a 40-hour working week, to Ma, as a form of "humorous, artistic protest." Telecoms giant Huawei is also listed as a possible recipient.Overtime should be limited to three hours a day, "for special reasons," totaling no more than 36 hours in any given month, to be paid at time-and-a-half, the law states.But according to the 996.ICU page, many employees never see any overtime pay at all.Huawei also seen as culpritJournalist Wen Zhao said Huawei is notorious for forcing employees to work overtime."The 996 schedule seems to come from the internet industry," Wen said. "Huawei was the first to implement it, and ... Alibaba started it last year.""These big companies will close ranks and will turn this working pattern into a routine practice; they have huge influence," he said.According to an analysis in the Financial Times, in the past, Chinese programmers worked overtime in the past, but were better rewarded with share options, benefits that are seldom seen in today 's industry.Gong Shujia, a telecommunications engineering expert in the United States, agreed."In the 1990s, Huawei brought in what it called the camp-bed ethos, meaning that employees would lay out a mattress in the office, sleeping and eating there, and working almost round the clock," he said.He said there have been calls for GitHub to restrict access to companies imposing the 996 schedule on workers.However, Wen Zhao said any pressure for change is unlikely to come from the ruling Chinese Communist Party."I don't think the Chinese government will investigate or sanction those big IT companies, because if they did, the companies might lay off employees, causing unemployment figures to rise," Wen said."And in China, it's pretty easy for the government to come to an agreement with companies," he said.Reported by Shi Shan for RFA's Mandarin Service.

Tariffs miss real China trade war; Global digital domination is at stakeUSA TODAYMay 13, 2019 MondayFIRST EDITIONCopyright 2019 Gannett Company, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 7ALength: 790 wordsByline: Orit FrenkelBodyPresident Donald Trump's tariffs by tweets  and brinkmanship on both sides of the negotiating table have led to a breakdown in talks with China, an escalating trade war, and no doubt many sleepless nights  in Chinese and U.S. boardrooms.  But for the United States, the unease is misdirected.What should keep our businesses and politicians up at night has little to do with levies on specific commodities or Chinese products. While Washington targets Beijing with tariffs over individual  grievances, China is laying the foundation to direct and influence digital trade -- the booming engine of global commerce -- unopposed, with deep pockets and grand ambitions.This should be our strategic and diplomatic focus, because what China is doing globally in this sphere has serious economic and national security implications for us today and well into the future. To the question of who will write the digital trade rules for the 21st century, the answer must be the United States. If it's China, we will have ceded the global digital future to Beijing.Digital trade covers everything from e-commerce to bank transfers to data collection.  Today there are almost 4.4billion internet users around the world, up more than 1,000% since 2000, with global e-commerce sales topping $2.8 trillion in 2018.The costs of our inactionGlobal regulations have not kept pace with this rapid growth, and U.S. businesses are forced to operate through a spider's web of regulatory environments. Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., chair of the Digital Trade Caucus, warned recently that it's critical for Americans to "reassert ourselves on the world stage" now and make sure that "we're helping shape global digital governance."We're seeing the costs of American inaction in real time.With legitimate concerns over privacy and cybersecurity, and given the regulatory vacuum, many countries have moved to restrict digital trade. Nigeria, Turkey and others have data localization requirements mandating that companies doing business in their borders must keep the data in country on local servers, among other restrictions, rendering digital trade impractical.Of even greater concern are countries like China and Vietnam, which use digital restrictions to censor the internet and monitor citizens. China provides its internet regulatory principles to developing countries -- essentially exporting these tools of suppression.With more people on the web than any other country, China has aspirations to  remake cyberspace in its own image.  Beijing launched the Digital Silk Road in 2015, investing $200 billion in a global digital infrastructure. This is a subset of China's larger Belt and Road Initiative, a government global infrastructure program with $340 billion invested to date.When developing countries buy Chinese equipment, they receive the tools to censor and control their internet while leaving their networks vulnerable to Chinese government cybertheft and interference.U.S. needs digital Marshall PlanWashington can and must act to counter Beijing's well-funded and deliberate technological march across the planet. First, the United States must lead  negotiations with like-minded nations for an international agreement laying out global digital rules of the road. It should be based on American values with the goal of securing an internet future of free, open and secure trade -- not the Chinese model of limited access, censorship and government manipulation. Other countries could aspire to it and join over time.Second, the United States must launch a major foreign assistance initiative to allow countries in the developing world to purchase U.S. internet and information and communications technology equipment, countering China's aggressive and cheap financing of equipment. This "Digital Marshall Plan" would make the financing of a digital infrastructure in the developing world a strategic priority.America would also need to provide technical assistance to develop internet regulations that allow open commerce, respect for privacy and protection of human rights.Beijing is well ahead of Washington in the race to establish trade rules that tame -- or rather maim -- digital commerce. Beijing surely understands that though today's tariff battles must be fought, the trade wars of tomorrow will be waged on a digital battleground. If we don't commit to urgent, strategic investments and diplomacy to counter China  today, Beijing will have a clear path to digital dominance that could undermine America's national security and economy for generations.Orit Frenkel, former senior manager for international trade and investment for General Electric, is executive director of the American Leadership Initiative and president of Frenkel Strategies. Load-Date: May 13, 2019End of Document

Welcome back everybody.I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Friday, April 5th.Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.Trade in focus -- President Trump is optimistic about reaching a deal with China after meeting with Beijing's top negotiator yesterday. He says all issues will be addressed.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They very much want to make a deal, we'll see what happens. It is a very complex deal. It's a very big deal. It's one of the biggest deals ever made, maybe the biggest deal ever made.It will be a great deal for our farmers. Technology, intellectual property theft. Everything is covered.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Investors are also waiting on the March jobs report this morning. It is out in about an hour and a half, we are expect 180,000 jobs added to the economy in the month of March, We're expecting the unemployment rate to have held steady at 3.8 percent.Markets are higher ahead of the numbers. Take a look at futures this morning showing a gain of about 30 points on the Dow Industrials. The S&P 500 up 4.5 and the Nasdaq up 15.This after the markets were mostly higher yesterday. Aa you see here, Dow Industrials picking up 166 points yesterday, two-thirds of 1 percent.Global markets this morning -- mostly firmer, take a look at the European indices right now. And you see the FT 100 up 18, the CAC 40 in Paris up 11, and the DAX index in Germany, down this morning by about 5 points.In Asia overnight, markets were fractionally higher on the session as you can see. The market in China and Hong Kong were closed for a holiday.Slowing chip demand hitting Samsung, the company reporting first-quarter profit was down 60 percent. We've got details.And Amazon's Alexa getting into healthcare. Details on the new medical skills later this hour.Plus Winter is coming to Shake Shack. The burger chain gearing up for the series premier of "Game of Thrones". It is the very latest effort, the new marketing effort for the show.All that coming up but first to our top story this hour -- Striking a Deal.President Trump announcing yesterday that "quote, a monumental trade agreement between he U.S. and China could be finalized within the next four weeks. But has no plans yet for a much anticipated summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping.The progress follows days of intense negotiations between Washington and Beijing. Ending yesterday with an Oval Office meeting between President Trump and the Chinese vice premier. The President said the proposed deal with China will cover all bases including agriculture, technology and IP theft.Joining me right now in a "First on Fox Interview" is the Secretary of State of the United States -- Mike Pompeo. Mr. Secretary -- it's always a pleasure to see you.MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Good to be with you this morning -- Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us.The IP theft issue is something we've spoken about before. How do you change something that is really ingrained in a country's culture? Do you think the U.S. is going to be able to come up with some kind of an enforcement mechanism to put in place so the Chinese keep their promises of not stealing from the west?POMPEO: Yes. Maria - this is a challenge. That's why the negotiations have taken as long as they have and why we're not complete yet. President Trump has for the first time called out China for this theft of intellectual property.Hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars stolen by the Chinese over the past decades. President Trump is addressing it. The work that is being done is about the enforcement mechanism. What is it you do they don't live up to the world. We've seen the Chinese enter into deals before where they didn't follow through. And the mission that Secretary Mnuchin, Ambassador Lighthizer have is to get this deal done in a way that after the deal is done, after the signing ceremony American companies can count on the fact they can do business in China without substantial risk, their IP will be stolen and if it is, they will have a tool to recover for their loss.BARTIROMO: And that's why the President has been using tariffs as leverage.POMPEO: As a proxy, as leverage -- yes. Yes, to get them to come to the table and take seriously the fundamental obligation for engaging in commerce with the American business community and with American citizens.BARTIROMO: And there's more to it. I mean we are trying to do a deal with a country that is just absolutely the opposite of our culture. Right. I mean when you look at the human rights abuses, for example, in China talk to us about this police state that they have created in terms of for example rounding up Chinese Muslims. You know, they're saying that it is for vocational training and yet there are officers with guns and barbed wire around these vocational training centers for Muslims.POMPEO: Maria -- there's a long history of China not abiding by its constitution which says people can practice their faith -- in China's own constitution.And yet, today, they've rounded up close to a million Muslims, Uighurs. In one part of country, trading them horribly they say their reeducation gaps but they frankly won't let people in to see what's truly going on there, very limited access to this.I met with four Uighurs last week in my office. One of them --BARTIROMO: These are survivors of the camp.POMPEO: Some of them are survivors. Some of them have family members in those camps. One of them, after our meeting, had his aunt and uncle rounded up and taken to a camp in China.This is the kind of thing that they do to impact his behavior. He's here in America to impact his behavior here in America. It's unacceptable. They need to let us in. An uncle and is in a camp as well. She needs to get here U.S. passport back. This is kind of behavior, these human rights abuses are tragic, they're historic and President Trump is taking on each of these challenges.BARTIROMO: So is this part of the discussion in terms of this near-term trade deal? What is the discussion with the Chinese in terms of the broader issues, not necessarily a quid pro quo on the trade deal.POMPEO: So the trade deal has its own conversation, its own dialogue was taking place but it is against the background of all these other broader issues. Issues with China's use of technology in ways that will fundamentally put Americans at risk.The technology from Huawei that is now being put in place all across the world. It's a company that is very close to the Chinese government and will do what the Chinese government asks it to do. So we have sounded the alarm urging nations security apparatus from around the world not to put this technology.The challenges with China are manifold and we're approaching each of them sometimes in separate silos but often as part of a broader conversation with China asking him to engage in trade, in conduct, in human rights as human rights activities that are consistent with values Americans hold dear.BARTIROMO: Yes. And when you came back from your Europe trip which was really an important trip when you were in Poland, we talked about this how you were getting a little pushback from the European nations. You broke news on this program when you said look, we would be forced to share less information with those countries that are using Huawei telecom.What is your take on what Italy has done signing a memorandum of understanding with China. I understand that may not include technology and telecom. What is your take on China's relationship with Italy?POMPEO: So I was with the Italian foreign ministry yesterday. He was in town for the celebration of NATO'S NATO's 70th anniversary and we had a conversation about this. I think each of the European countries including Italy is working its way through this problem set.I think they now have become aware of the risks to their own people not only directly from their technology but the risks that America won't be able to work as closely with them, something they often count on and depend upon.I think we'll see European countries begin to take this threat very seriously and I think we will make real progress of protecting citizens around the world from the threat of Chinese surveillance state, Chinese technology inside of these networks.BARTIROMO: Look, I mean the world wants to get into China., we know that, right? 1.4 billion people they want a chance to sell to those consumers but there are real risks here. So is that understanding, the partnership between Italy and China does that exclude telecom? Does that exclude technology?POMPEO: So I don't know the details of what's in their agreement. It is the case where we want to trade with China too. I want America businesses to thrive and flourish and engage in commerce. we have a deep economic relationship with them that are of real value to American consumers.This is what President Trump's trade negotiations are about. He wants that to be fair. He wants that to be and reciprocal. He wants American businesses to have a fair shake when we deal with China, not have to worry that if they do a deal, they're going to up the seed corn of their the corner of their business.BARTIROMO: The President made a big deal of the fentanyl agreement with the Chinese, that they are going to promise that they are going to classify all classes of fentanyl.Let's watch this closely and tell me what your thoughts are here because I guess there was one issue that the Chinese say that fentanyl is used in a lot of things including fertilizer. How do you make sure that fentanyl is not coming over the border? Because isn't this the synthetic precursor for opioids?POMPEO: It is. This is a very important issue, the commitment that President Xi made to Trump was a very important commitment Now China needs to follow through. I think we've seen some progress, some administrative progress inside of China. We hope they'll deliver on this.You know, the President's down at the border today. One of the element of the crisis that's down there, we see it in the human suffering that takes place along the border that President Trump is so focused on. But he's also focused on narcotics, drugs that are coming across the country.This fentanyl that comes from China often is trafficked through Mexico across that very border, it's one more reason we have to get control of the crisis at the border today.BARTIROMO: Yes. let me ask you about the border. Because the President is planning to cut hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to these three central American countries in retaliation for what he's calling their lack of help in cutting the flow of migrants to the U.S. border.What is your take on this? I mean El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, already very weak countries, foreign assistance programs are critical for them Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras already very weak countries, foreign assistance programs are critical for them.Is this going to work? Is this another threat? Or how significant is this?POMPEO: Maria -- Many of the illegal crossers today, those who are coming across the border illegally today are coming from the three northern triangle countries -- Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.We have been working with those countries, state department, DHS. There are two pieces for their effort pieces to their effort.One is will -- are they willing to help us, are they willing to stop people from leaving the country. The second is capacity. We've given them hundreds of millions of dollars over the past years to create the capacity for them to do so. They have not demonstrated the will. The willingness to actually engage in stopping these caravans from coming across their border.Our mission by telling them this aid will be conditioned on the change in their behavior, is to convince them that they ought to have the will.That they need to try, they need to work at it. We'll work with them to build out their capacity to do so but we have not yet seen enough demonstration of their commitment to actually preventing these folks from crossing into Mexico and making this dangerous trek across Mexico and then coming unlawfully into the United States.BARTIROMO: Well, there are a lot of pushbacks around this from the administration because the number of apprehensions are soaring. Why has the number increased so much? Is the word getting out that the U.S. has porous borders, let's go there now and let's make -- leave our families.POMPEO: Yes. I think It is always about incentives, right. What is the risk, what is the cost and then what is the opportunity when they come into the United States, what is their opportunity versus what they are facing wherever it is they live whether that is in Mexico or in the northern triangle.Mexico tried to keep them in Mexico by providing some forms of visas. I think that created a further incentive for them to leave Guatemala or Honduras or El Salvador and go to Mexico. And then they realized they wanted to make the transit into the United States.POMPEO: We have to control our border. President Trump is going to go down there today and talk about the tools that we have at our disposal. So that's what we ultimately need is to Congress to change the laws. So that we can return these individuals who aren't here properly under asylum Back to the country which they came.BARTIROMO: Yes. The President's using every leverage point that he can. And I get that. He's talking now about tariffs on cars coming out of Mexico. But does that contradict the USMCA deal? I mean, you know we had senator Capito here earlier -- pardon me. And she says look, you know, I'm going to support this deal. But I know that a lot of Democrats have come on this program and said we're not going to support. Now the President is talking about new tariffs on cars coming out of from Mexico.POMPEO: We are trying to create the conditions at the border that will keep Americans safe, that will reassert American sovereignty along our the southern border. the President is using every tool in his kit.He is also trying to convince congress to take this threat seriously. We're now seeing members of congress from both sides of the aisle acknowledge the crisis, acknowledge that we're now in the thousands of people coming across the border each day with narcotics and trafficking and persons also coming across the border.What we need Congress -- once they recognize the crisis we need them to change. These are simple changes to the law. They could do them today. They need to move. It's time. This crisis, the American people are not going to stand for this, President Trump is using every tool in his kit try and to try and the incentive, change the behavior so that we can reduce the risks here in the United States.BARTIROMO: He sure is. And the President is also using the tariffs throughout quite effectively with the Chinese. Do you expect that the President will likely leave4 those tariffs in place that are currently there for China?POMPEO: I think he's hoping what he gets is a real deal, an unenforceable deal not just on the amount of trade to make that fair and reciprocal and important component but also to protect from illegal theft of intellectual property, technology transfer that is forced.If he gets that size of deal I'm confident the President will say that is fair. Our tariffs are equal, we are operating in a reciprocal trading arrangement. Let's go and compete and have a great relationship commercially between our countries.BARTIROMO: On the IP theft, the White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow this week said that China is finally acknowledging the issues around intellectual property theft. This is the first time they are doing this I think because they were consistently denying that they were even stealing, right.POMPEO: It is a good first step. Doesn't seem like much to you and I acknowledge something that is patently true that we've known about for decades but no president was prepared to take on. But yes, their acknowledgment that there is a problem that this is happening is a good first step because absent that if they don't understand what's happening won't acknowledge that, then it's really hard to fix and it is impossible to enforce.So they've made real progress. There's still work to do that's why the President said yesterday, we don't have a time just set to resolve this but the team is hard at work and we hope China is negotiating in good faith to get to the resolution.BARTIROMO: How worried are you about the agricultural situation, the fact that there is swine flu going on there. The fact that China produces and consumes 50 percent of the world's pork and 20 percent of their hogs are diseased?POMPEO: It is a real challenge for China. A real risk that they will have a supply shortfall. We hope we get for an opportunity to sell good-old hogs and hogs from the united states of America.BARTIROMO: Yes. I think they've got 100 million dead hogs to dispose of. It's pretty extraordinary.Mr. Secretary -- I want you to stay with us. You've been doing such an incredible job across the world. You said at the start of your term you want to get the State Department's swagger back, you certainly have.And yet one group is dissing you this morning. We are going to talk Come back and talk about that. More with Secretary Mike Pompeo when we come right back.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. And back with me in a "First on Fox Interview" is the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.And Mr. Secretary I was thinking about this yesterday. China has 1.4 billion people. The U.S. has 320 million or something. I mean it's a much larger country. They want to be number one. They've got their belt and road. Is it just a matter of time that China will be running the world, China will overtake the United States in a number of areas?POMPEO: I don't remotely believe that. It depends on decisions we make. Are we prepared to engage with them, and confront them when they behave in ways that are maligned? Are we prepared to do the things we need to do everyone?President Trump has in ways that are maligned. President Trump from produced regulations allowing our economy to grow. All the things that create wealth for the united states. Are we prepared to underwrite our military the way President Trump has so that we can keep our country secure.If we do those things we will have partners around the world who want to be part of western values, who want to be part of our democracy. They live in a nation with a very different value set.I am bullish on America. If you are betting you should bet on us.BARTIROMO: Yes. I would bet on America too even as, you know, the Chinese are putting military bases across the world. We have the strongest and best military in the world -- on the planet.POMPEO: Yes, ma'am. No doubt about it.BARTIROMO: Look, you are doing so much Mr. Secretary and we can't even get into every issue today from Russia to ISIS to across the world, Venezuela. Because of all of this the world thanks you for your efforts and how hard you are working.You were honored with the James W. Foley American Hostage Freedom Award and earlier this week they are basically taking the award back. They are saying the freedom award that was given to you is going to be taken back.It was named for the journalist beheaded in 2014 but it is because of complaints from media critics of the administration prompting this hostage rights group to withdraw this historic freedom award. What do you say to that?POMPEO: It was very unfortunate. I was set to receive an award on behalf of the State Department, the good work that this administration has done to bring back hostages. We work on this issue every day and we've brought back to now almost dozen Americans who were detained. Those families, I was with them. I had a big group of families, families whose children had not been returned, families whose children were still detained and then group from 1979 of people who had been held by the Iranian is back when our embassy was captured in 1979.We work on this every day to get every American back. President Trump is so focused on this so I was very proud that President Trump's work and the work that the State Department has done was going to be recognized with this award.I regret there was pressure applied by the media for the award to be withdrawn.BARTIROMO: As soon as it was announced then it is withdrawn. What did they say to you in terms of why they are pulling this award?POMPEO: I don't know the details of what took place but I think the moderator didn't want to be around this administration. I think some of the folks whoa re underwriting the dinner didn't want to be part of it.From my perspective I just regret it. Diane Foley, who runs the organization had her son beheaded. She has worked so hard on behalf of getting Americans on to continue to give back to this nation.I just so regret this took place. The work that this administration has done will continue. Award or no award we're going to keep working at this problem. And every family out there today that has one of their family members detained should know that United States is hard at work even as I sit here to get them back whether it is Bob Levinson, the longest held person in Iran or any of the others. We are going to work to get them back and I'm confident we will be successful.BARTIROMO: Mr. Secretary -- thank you for all your work.POMPEO: Thank you -- Maria.BARTIROMO: We appreciate you joining us this morning. That was really an injustice to you.Secretary Mike Pompeo joining us there.Coming up -- is Samsung under pressure this morning. The company seeing a sharp drop in profits, what is behind that slow down.Then Shake Shack has a new offering for "Game of Thrones" fans. We've got access to the limited secret menu this morning, back in a minute on that.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Samsung is out with an earnings warning. This morning.Cheryl Casone with details -- Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK, CORRESPONDENT: Well, Maria Samsung expecting to post 60 percent decline in its first-quarter profit. That's due to sluggish demand for memory chips. The company issued a regulatory filing last week and it warned larger than expected declines in memory prices.And U.S. aviation history is set to be made today. Hawaiian Airlines celebrating its inaugural nonstop flight from Boston to Honolulu. The is the longest nonstop flight ever within the United States. Travel time, 11 hours and 25 minutes, 5100 miles. The old record, 11 hours and 10 minutes -- that was from New York to Honolulu which is also doozy because I have taken that one.All right. Winter is coming to Shake Shack, the burger chain getting on all of the "Game of Thrones" mania with some very unique things on the menu. There is a catch -- if you want to order this, you have to order them in the show's fictional language. If you are not fluent at this point, don't worry, Shake Shack has a translation and pronunciation guide to help you out especially if you don't watch the show which a lot of us still don't.BARTIROMO: Those jewelry stores closing down is concerning but you know what, some people think younger people are not wearing jewelry. They don't like gold and millennials and things like that.Thank you Sheryl.JAMIE COURTNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Well, there's so much costume jewelry. You've seen a lot of those stores and designers pop up which gives another affordable option for the younger generation.M1: We are not seeing malls closing down. I think you have experiences coming into malls where people will go for the right coming into malls. It's just happens to be where people go for the right experiences, happens to be not for jewelry right now.BARTIROMO: Real quick on Secretary Pompeo. He's dealing with so much and doing so much, amazing that this group is taking this award back. It's really disgusting actually in my view. You said appalling earlier and I agree with you.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes. We were talking about it yesterday. I feel like again, they make the left, the liberal media, they make an effort to continue to divide this country and cannot come together on any issue, whether it is, you know, saving hostages, whether it's decriminalizing homosexuality around the world which our U.S. ambassador to Germany Rick Grenell has been strongly strong on.BARTIROMO: That's right.MCDOWELL: How about criminal justice reform so you have people who have been imprisoned for years upon years and who are now getting out of prison imprisoned for small drug crimes. I just think that you have to focus, on again let's talk about policy over personality. You can debate about somebody's personality, never get anywhere.BARTIROMO: And on the China story, you know when you start digging in to China's behavior it is so much more than looking at how much soybean and natural gas China buys from the United States. So much more. Even so much more than just intellectual property theft and the forced transfer of technology.This issue today that we discussed with -- that I discussed with the Secretary, that they're rounding up Chinese Muslims right now, a million people have been rounded up because they want to make sure they understand Chinese culture. And you know, they are called vocational training centers but in fact, they are guarded by men with guns and barbed wire. I mean It is pretty outrageous.How does the U.S. all of this stuff that China has been doing for so long and become partners with them?MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL: That's the thing. Hopefully we are shining a light on this and this trade deal will start to focus on that even more and we will get a more balanced place in the world, not only on trade but in humanitarian efforts.BARTIROMO: Absolutely.Let's take a quick break. We want to get on the road to 2020 from healthcare to the border crisis. Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz taking questions. His answers coming up.Then Beyonce teaming up with Adidas.

What did it all means for the economy in your life, coming up.Trade is in focus this morning, President Trump is optimistic about reaching a deal with China after meeting with Beijing's top negotiator yesterday. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was with me earlier in the hour talking about the deal.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: He keeps hoping what he gets is a real deal, an enforceable deal along not just the amount of trade to make that fair and reciprocal unimportant component but also to protect from illegal theft of intellectual property, technology, transfer that is forced. If he gets that size of deal, I'm confident the president will say that's fair.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Markets this morning are higher, Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading of 26 points on the Dow, S&P 500 is up 3-1/4 and the NASDAQ is up 12 right now.After the markets mostly higher yesterday, in fact, the Dow had a nice rally at the close, up 166 points yesterday at 04:00 on Wall Street, up two-thirds of one percent.

How the company plans to take on Fortnite, one of the most successful names out there.All those stories coming up this Friday morning, but first our top story this half an hour. 2020 vision, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz holding a Town Hall last night on Fox News. Hillary Vaughn is live in Kansas City after the big event with more. Hillary, good morning to you.HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Good morning, Maria. Well, Howard Schultz says he finally make a decision about whether or not he's going to run in 2020 by this summer. He spent equal time bashing both Democrats and Republicans in his Town Hall last night but he says he's a bipartisan problem solver that will bring both parties together if he's president.HOWARD SCHULTZ, FORMER CEO, STARBUCKS: When President Trump took the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that was a tremendous strategic mistake. What's going on right now is really a tragedy because this is a trade and tariff war that is causing farmers across the country, steel people -- steelworkers in the country, a consumer tax and their business is underwater. In addition to that, there's no strategy that I can recognize to get us out of this.President Trump is correct and the Republican leadership is correct that we need fierce, strict levels of control on that border to keep bad people from coming in, illegal immigrants should not come in.We should be funding ICE and giving them all the tools and resources they need to secure the borders and arrest the bad people.I would be a proponent, a strong proponent of Universal Catastrophic Coverage. And if we did that, we would begin to lower the cost and that would have a significant impact, it would be catalytic on bringing that premium down. I do believe strongly that every American has the right for affordable care, affordable healthcare in America.(END VIDEO CLIP)VAUGHN: Schultz says he hasn't figured out yet if he would choose a Republican or a Democrat as his running mate if he does decide to run in 2020, Maria.BARTIROMO: That's very interesting, Hillary. Thanks so much, Hillary Vaughn in Kansas City this morning.Joining us right now to react is former senior advisor to the Clintons, MDC Partners' CEO and the president of The Stagwell Group, managing partners as well, Mark Penn. Mark, good to see you this morning.MARK PENN, PRESIDENT AND MANAGING PARTNER, THE STAGWELL GROUP: Good morning.BARTIROMO: What's your reaction to Howard Schultz?PENN: Well, I thought it was an overall pretty good performance. He struck some balance, he came out for bipartisanship. I thought some of the weird things was the way he said China was a competitor. And so, he sort of went after Russia but let China off the hook in terms of their human rights, in terms of their expansion. He was on Fox News. If I were him I would have courted a little bit more of the Trump voters rather than turn them off on some of those points.BARTIROMO: Oh, that's a good point. I mean, you know, you've got this situation where many of the Democratic candidates are radical frankly. You know, they're endorsing all of these crazy things like the Green New Deal and 70 percent tax rates, tax on wealth form Elizabeth Warren.I'm wondering if at some point the Dems say Howard, come over here and be our -- be our candidate because you're more middle-of-the-road than all these people. Would that happen or it would never pass muster for the -- for the broad Democratic strategy today to different party?PENN: Well, he'd have to reconsider his strategy. I think he's come out and said I'm going to be an independent. Independent to win needs to take equally from the Democrats and the Republicans. Otherwise they become a spoiler. If he takes more from the Democrats more of a suburban vote that by have Starbucks CEO appeal then he would be more of a Democratic spoiler and that's basically what Democrats are afraid of.I saw it last night and he was a little bit more of a Democratic spoiler than right down in the middle, I think he's got to watch that if he wants to have a true independent candidacy.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Real quick, Mark Penn, Dagen McDowell. Pete Buttigieg, I think the announcement is April -- mid April, April 14th, that was -- I followed his husband on Twitter. There's actually on a Wall Street Journal op-ed on Buttigieg that the mayor may sound moderate but his vision is aggressively partisan.PENN: Well, look, I think that you see a lot of partisanship right now in the Democratic primary because after all, it is a primary of partisans and it's driven very heavily by caucuses. So, that doesn't surprise me at all. That's exactly what we're -- what we're seeing. I don't know where it's going to be when the dust settles.Obviously, I thought Vice President Biden would give the biggest opportunity for the center to reassert itself among Democratic voters. I'm concerned about all the hits he took in the previous couple of days.MCDOWELL: All right, we will leave it there. Mark, it's good see you. Thank you so much for weighing in here.PENN: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Mark Penn there. And we've had a busy week from the presidential election to the issues across the world. In case you missed it, take a look at a look back from MORNINGS WITH MARIA this week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA), HOUSE MINORITY WHIP: Democrats that are denying there's a crisis at the border, they're playing politics in games with America's national security, they're human traffickers, there's drugs coming over. When you just talked about these kids that are being abused, it's some of the most blatant forms of child abuse.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are in the most liberal country when it comes to immigration, more than a million people become a citizen every year and we want to make sure we maintain that growth. The challenge we have is our loss.REP. JEFF VAN DREW (D-NJ), HOUSE AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE MEMBER: What we just need to have -- you know, more conversation, more bipartisanship, we really need to do more here at the border to try to straighten this out. If we can get the border under control then we won't have the problem at the ports of entry with moving things through quickly enough and that's the issue.BARTIROMO: Last night, we scheduled an interview with Carlos Ghosn at 05:30 p.m. last night. I came back to work, I'm sitting there, getting ready for the interview. I'm texting with his lawyer, he's lawyer says OK, he's going to be calling in momentarily. Now it's 10 to 06:00, we are waiting for Carlos to call in to discuss the interview. I already spoke with Carlos Ghosn over the weekend on Saturday and he discussed the charges, told me everything that you've heard here first for the last hundred days, that this was a coup, he's denying all of these charges and saying that he is innocent.All of a sudden, I get this text from the lawyers, 10 agents just showed up. They are -- they took him into a room. They are in the room alone with Carol, his wife, Carol and Carlos Ghosn in the room with prosecutors, talking for a few minutes, then we see them take Carlos in the car and drive away, they took him to the prosecutor's office and they interrogated him. This is an extraordinary situation. It is getting worse. He is once again behind bars.STEPHANIE POMBOY, PRESIDENT, MACROMAVENS: My feeling is that we analyze China through a western lens and the reality is they have a much longer timeframe. You know, obviously Xi isn't up worrying about re-election. He has the luxury of time which our politicians don't.GORDON CHANG, CONTRIBUTOR, DAILY BEAST: The question though is, you know, we've had a decades of failed trade agreements with China. The question is do you remedy that with another deal? So, we will see how this goes.BARTIROMO: What are using out there in terms of your customers and whether or not they have the ability or desire to spend more money on all of this?MARK HURD, CEO, ORACLE: I think the U.S. is good, I think the U.S. has been solid for a while. I think the thing we open up with NetSuite are great example of the U.S. economy. Most NetSuite is sold into small or medium business. Mostly companies that are domestic and their growth is outstanding. They are investing.BARTIROMO: We've got a new study to tell you about from Merrill Lynch, showing 79 percent of parents in the U.S. provide some financial support to their adult children. That's 72 percent of parents are putting their children's financial interests over their own retirement savings.CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT, RAMSEY SOLUTION: The parents are actually setting themselves up to potentially become a burden later in life. So, it's really important to train the young people on how to handle money.SARAH JESSICA PARKER, ACTRESS, U.S.: Have a glass of wine, literally, every single day.TIM LIGHTBOURNE, CO-FOUNDER, INVIVO & CO.: The Sarah Jessica Parker wine will be in stores around August. So, we sit down with her in May. We bring over here about eight samples of the new harvest.MCDOWELL: You're dangerous to give me a screw off bottle (INAUDIBLE). Warm is warm and I don't care.JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: She said she ended the day with a wine. I'm thinking maybe we should start ours.MCDOWELL: You know what. This is -- this is -- this is my (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Beyonce is stepping into sneakers sphere. Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, this is interesting. Beyonce is now a creative partner with Adidas. The singer developing a signature footwear collection and she's relaunching her Ivy Park (INAUDIBLE) leisure brand. Beyonce started Ivy Park back in 2016 taking full control of it last year from Philip Green following sexual harassment allegations against the retail tycoon. Take a look at shares of Adidas up about 22 percent so far this year.Now to Snap teaming up with Fitbit. They're launching the first ever Bitmoji clock face, there it is. Which would be integrated into your Fitbit smartwatches. Your Bitmoji avatar updates throughout the day based on your fitness data and your personal health. I guess maybe it'll frown at you if you don't work out.Anyway, Snap is also announcing a push into the social gaming platform featuring original and third-party games from Zynga, Game Closure, Spry Fox and others that turn up the heat on Fortnite and other multiplayer games that have become so popular.And Snapchat stories is heading to the dating app Tinder. Users e-mailed a post stories directly to their dating profile later this year. that should be interesting.All right, and the dating app Bumble has launched a print magazine, Bumble Mag is a 100 page lifestyle magazine. It's got articles and advice about - - yes, dating but also careers, relationships. Bumble's got about 50 million users worldwide. And that is your dating exercise update on headlines.BARTIROMO: I like that. Thank you so much, Cheryl.Coming up, Amazon's Alexa getting some medical experience now. How it works right after this. Amazon shares up a fraction this morning, stay with us.BARTIROMO: (AUDIO GAP) in focus, digital startup Livongo announcing its partnership with Amazon and leading healthcare organizations to develop a new HIPAA compliant voice service for Amazon Alexa. The initiative aiming to help millions of Americans better manage chronic conditions.Joining us now in Fox Business exclusive is Livongo founder and executive chairman, Glen Tullman. Glen, it's great to have you on the program. Thanks so much for joining us.GLEN TULLMAN, FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, LIVONGO: Good morning, Maria. How are you?BARTIROMO: I'm great. So, this is really important. Healthcare is probably one of the really critical industries that's getting impacted by technology and A.I. How will it be HIPAA compliant, tell us how it works. And what Alexa will be able to do with regard to healthcare?TULLMAN: Well, Livongo is about empowering people with chronic conditions to live better and healthier lives. And there's a 180 million Americans who have a chronic condition, 30 million of them -- more than 30 million have diabetes. And the question is how can we make it easier for them to stay healthy?So, you know that at home the easiest interface we all use is what we're doing today is voice and this allows people to talk to more than a hundred million Alexa enabled devices and ask them questions like, when they check their blood sugar, what was my blood sugar when I read most recently checked it. And to get what we call health nudges or health tips about how to stay healthier and better manage their diabetes.So, it's a real breakthrough. And of course, the news from Amazon is that they're being very careful from a privacy standpoint because these are the first HIPAA enabled skills that allow people to interact with the Alexa devices.BARTIROMO: Yes. So, it's about data, right? I mean, the data that you're going to get from your Alexa is basically the data that's out there. Because most people when they want -- when they have questions about their healthcare, they Google it now, right? They go to webMD, they go to Livongo. I mean, they're going to places to get their questions answered first probably even before they call their doctor.TULLMAN: Well, I think the difference is at Livongo, what we're using is cellular enabled meters and continuous glucose monitors to actually get information from people's bodies. And then we're giving them personalize responses that allow them to better manage what's happening in their bodies.So, we're using what we call an AIAI engine to take all the information including information from their own body, put it together, interpret that information and then deliver it back to those people and iterate just like the way that -- you know, we figure out on what the best movie is or what the best book is. We're now figuring out what the best way for an individual to manage their own healthcare. So, it's a personalized service that comes to you through this voice-enabled application.MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER & CEO OF ROSECLIFF: Hi, Glen. This is Mike Murphy. For our venture capital fund, we've invested in a lot of technology companies that are focused on healthcare and I'm a big believer in telemedicine but the pushback on it, the negative side of that is so I've heard from doctors that you need to get out -- people need to get out and see a doctor because there could be a bigger condition there. I'm just wondering if you could speak to that a little bit because we're investors in Rome and we're investors in KEBs, we believe these types of companies are going to change the healthcare industry but I'd love your opinion on that.TULLMAN: Sure. Well, if you think about our healthcare system today, it's great at things like if you have need heart surgery, there's no better place to be than right here in the United States and got to one of our top hospital. And if you have a broken arm, we're pretty good at fixing that too. The challenges our system wasn't designed to manage chronic conditions because those are 24 by seven by 365 and those require an individual to manage her own or his own condition.So, what we want to do is, we want to give them the tools to better self manage their own condition. So, this isn't really like on telemedicine, you need to talk to your physician about something. But what we're doing is we're enabling people with information, with health nudges, with insights to better manage their own bodies and that's the future healthcare.BARTIROMO: Glen, what an -- what an incredible company, another fantastic billion-dollar company. Are you ready to take this company public soon?TULLMAN: Well, look, we are about building a great company and the way you do that is you take great care of your members.BARTIROMO: Right.TULLMAN: We have a net promoter score that's great and we're ready to do whatever comes next, we'll see what that is.BARTIROMO: IPO this year?TULLMAN: You know what, all we can do is build a great company and we'll see what happens.BARTIROMO: Glen, it's good to see you. Glen Tullman. We'll be right back.Load-Date: April 5, 2019End of Document

Times of warCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 23, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 623 wordsBody The context becomes more adverse against growth from several fronts and this can mean a volatile summer and corrections in the markets.  At the time of writing, the positions of the governments of both China and the United States are going to increase commercial reprisals.  The United States threatens to increase tariffs on the entire spectrum of goods imported from China.  It has also imposed restrictions on the operation of Chinese companies of great importance, such as Huawei. The rumors remain in the sense that more Chinese entities can be added to this blacklist.  China for its part has responded by also imposing tariffs on a large number of goods imported from the United States. This Wednesday there were also rumors that the Chinese government might have the intention of restricting exports of some materials whose main client is the United States.  Apparently the war is under way. The truce declared in November ended the week in which the talks turned out to be a mere formality, given the confirmation of China's change of position and the raising of tariffs by North America.  It seems naive to point out where things are going if the conflict escalates or escalates further. This represents a serious threat to global growth and, in a very direct instance, a very difficult obstacle for the stock markets.  Think of many companies whose cost of your supplies will rise. The American government's warrant to substitute imports can not give results in a short period of time. Think of technology companies, or automotive, or telecommunications, or industrial companies too, which have a good part of their operations dependent on China's consumption and where the possibility of restrictions or lower growth means lower than expected profits.  Think of a dollar that will become more expensive. We are seeing it. Since the first week of May, the dollar has had a sudden upward movement. It does not have a relevant magnitude yet, but it is one of the largest short-term bouts of recent years against Asian currencies such as the renminbi, the Taiwanese dollar or the Korean won. The movement against the euro and emerging currencies has also been rising.  The renminbi again approaches the relevant brand of the Rmb7 per dollar, to surpass it we could observe a breakdown of many currencies in downward movements in their quotes against the dollar, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. And an extension of the strength of the dollar will continue to test the capital markets that have so far resisted near their highs, what investors least expect is a blow to the value of the broadcasters' profits and pressure on margins.  These times of war can be defined with the presence of an uncertainty that can lead to despair. Because it is a strategic and political issue, we can wait, why not ?, an infinite succession of statements, threats, lack of resolution, et cetera. Apparently an optimistic line such as that raised last November by both governments is not considered now as a possibility.  In this context of risks to growth, the Mexican economy sails. The government continues to exercise austerity and while it is not reflected in greater credibility on the stability of public finances and, above all, the situation of Pemex, the peso looks fragile. For this reason, Banxico remains in the position of not modifying fees and sending a message of caution. I think many of them give themselves up for service if we end the summer with the dollar close to 19 pesos and with a stable rate curve. Not to mention, wars have consequences.  * Rodolfo Campuzano Meza is Director of Strategy and Portfolio Management at INVEX.Any question or comment can be sent to the email: [email protected] Twitter: @invexbanco. Load-Date: May 23, 2019End of Document

China creating blacklist to hit back at U.S. for Huawei banFierceWirelessMay 31, 2019Copyright 2019 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 402 wordsByline: Kendra ChamberlainHighlight: The Chinese government said it will pursue “necessary measures” against companies on the list, which will likely include U.S. firms.BodyThe Chinese government has said it's developing an “unreliable entity list” in response the U.S. government's decision to blacklist Huawei, and prevent Huawei from sourcing components from U.S. firms. China is placing foreign firms, organizations and individuals on the list that it claims engage in activities such as violating contracts, cutting off supplies for noncommercial reasons, and not obeying market rules. Gao Feng, a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce, said the government will pursue “necessary measures” against companies on the list, and said the details of such actions would be released soon, according to a Bloomberg report. China's announcement comes amid escalating tensions between China and the Trump administration, as a trade war between the two countries lags on. Earlier this month, the Commerce Department officially placed Huawei on its “entity list,” barring U.S. companies from engaging in export trading with the company in an effort to cut off critical elements of Huawei's supply chain. RELATED: Commerce Department offers temporary exemptions to Huawei blacklistingIn the wake of the blacklisting, companies such as Google, which supplies the operating system for Huawei's smartphones, and chipmakers Intel and Qualcomm have made arrangements to phase out or cut off relations with the company. Several firms around the world, including Toshiba and Panasonic, have made similar moves.Several countries are also considering banning Huawei gear from 5G wireless networks, amid U.S. lobbying that Huawei poses a security threat. This week, Rogers Communications' vice chairman Philip Lind called for Canada to ban Huawei products from its telecommunications networks, arguing that Huawei poised too big of a security risk to be used, according to Bloomberg. RELATED: Huawei ramps up legal fight against U.S. with new filingPresident Trump recently declared a national emergency with regard to telecom equipment in the U.S., citing security risks. But, as trade negotiations between the U.S. and China have stalled, the president hinted last week that he may consider using Huawei as a bargaining chip in future trade deals with China. “It's possible that Huawei even would be included in some kind of trade deal,” Trump said last week, according to a report from CNN. “If we made a deal, I can imagine Huawei being included in some form of, some part of a trade deal.” Load-Date: June 5, 2019End of Document

Ahead of Xi-Trump Meet, US Blacklists 5 Chinese Supercomputing GroupsStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeJune 23, 2019 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 466 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBodyThe Commerce Department last month blacklisted telecommunications giant Huawei, further heightening tensions with Beijing.The five entities to be added to the list include: Chengdu Haiguang Integrated Circuit and two aliases; Chengdu Haiguang Microelectronics Technology and two aliases; Higon and five aliases; Sugon and nine aliases and the Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology and two aliases.Just as ISC19 wrapped up yesterday, showcasing the latest in supercomputing technology, the US added five Chinese entities including Sugon to its blacklist prohibiting them from access to advanced technology vital to supercomputing according to multiple news reports.Wall Street takes a breather with all eyes on Fed meetingWhile the central bank left interest rates unchanged, investors are betting on at least one interest rate cut this year. For the week, the S&P 500 climbed 2.2 percent, the Dow added 2.41 percent and the Nasdaq rose 3.02 percent.The blacklisted entities are central to China's attempt to build a next-generation supercomputer capable of handling one quintillion calculations a second. It said they raised national security concerns because the computers were being developed for military uses or in cooperation with the Chinese military. As The Wall Street Journal points out, supercomputing is essential for the development of nuclear weapons, encryption, missile defense and more. The restrictions will impact sales to the firms by USA chipmakers such as Intel, AMD, and Nvidia. "Still, its exclusion from American technology will represent an especially bitter pill for Beijing to swallow, as its supercomputers form the core of some of the Chinese government's most sensitive and important systems". Sugon has publicly acknowledged "a variety of military end uses and end users of its high-performance computers", while Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology's mission is "to support China's military modernization".Sugon and the Wuxi Jiangnan Institute, which the USA said is owned by a Chinese army research institute, are involved in China's push to develop next-generation "exascale" high performance computing to assist with military modernization. The policy for granting such licenses is that there's a presumption of denial of such a request, according to the Commerce Department statement. The action raised fears that trade war between U.S. and China could turn into a broader economic conflict. As a result, Huawei has lost access to components and licensed software from Qualcomm, Intel, Microsoft, and Google.Stapleton Roy, former US ambassador to China, says that both the USA and China are suffering from the trade war. Reportedly, one prototype of the country's upcoming exascale supercomputer is based entirely on Chinese homegrown CPUs.Load-Date: June 24, 2019End of Document

Ltd. on its "Entity List", effectively banning us companies from selling to the Chinese telecom giant.Foreign enterprises, organizations, or individuals that do not comply with market rules, deviate from a contract's spirit, or impose blockades or stop supplies to Chinese enterprises for non-commercial purposes, and seriously damage the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises, will be included on a list of 'unreliable entities'. "China may pick a few "bad examples" to punish, but it's unlikely to hit everyone in the supply chain".China will investigate whether FedEx Corp damaged the legal rights and interests of its clients, the official Xinhua news agency said on Saturday, after Chinese telecoms giant Huawei said parcels intended for it were diverted.It is not a coincidence that this move comes after Microsoft, Google.Jose Antonio Reyes: Former Arsenal winger dies aged 35The versatile forward won 21 caps for Spain, and will be fondly remembered by football fans, particularly at his beloved Sevilla. Shortly before the closure of the summer transfer window in 2006, he left the London-based club to join Real Madrid on loan.Gao Feng, a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce, said the government will pursue "necessary measures" against companies on the list, and said the details of such actions would be released soon, according to a Bloomberg report.China's response seems to escalate trade-war tensions, but in reality, there's probably little that China can do to whatever companies end up on its list.Although the Chinese government responded to fresh U.S. tariffs by hiking its own tariffs on imports from the United States, its response to the ban on Huawei until now had been limited to formal complaints over the "abuse" of national security measures and "unilateral trade sanctions". Not to mention that China also needs Apple's business just as much as Apple needs China. Bloomberg News reported Friday thatBeijing has readied a plan to restrict exports of rare earths to the US if needed, according to people familiar with the matter.The Financial Times, meantime, quoted Huawei's chief strategy architect, Dang Wenshuan, as saying that USA citizens working in research and development at the company's Shenzhen headquarters were sent home two weeks ago.Load-Date: June 2, 2019End of Document

Continue reading Tencent shuts down PUBG Mobile in China for patriotic alternativeTech giant Tencent has dropped the hugely popular mobile version of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds in China after failing to secure a license from the government to collect revenues from the game.Instead, the company is migrating users over to a similar title, Heping Jingying or Elite Force for Peace, reports Reuters and the Financial Times. Heping Jingying has already been approved for monetization by the Chinese Communist party, thanks in no small part to its patriotic overtones. One analyst described the game as  a tribute to the People's Liberation Army Air Force    part of China's national military   with anti-terrorism themes.Geopolitics may have played a part in PUBG's demisePUBG Mobile launched in March last year, and has become one of the world's most popular video games, with as many players as Fortnite. According to estimatesfrom China Renaissance, the game had roughly 70 million domestic players, which would have allowed Tencent to generate annual revenues from in-app purchases of roughly $1.18 billion to $1.48 billion.However, an array of political and cultural factors seem to have doomed the title. Over the past few years, the Chinese government has become particularly hostile to video games perceived as violent or addictive, with the state-run People's Dailypaper describing Tencent's mobile smash hit Honor of Kings as  poison  that spreads  negative energy. Photo by Anthony Kwan/Getty Images for Hong Kong Tourism BoardPUBG has become an international phenomenon, and is playable on mobile, PC, and consoles.Tencent has already shut down one game because of this hostility, and is making accommodations in new titles. Not only is Heping Jingying patriotic, but it's less violent than PUBG. Characters do not bleed when shot and only those aged 16 and over can play.Geopolitics might also have contributed to PUBG Mobile's rejection. Tencent licenses the game from South Korean company Bluehole, and Chinese authorities can be hostile to South Korean goods. In 2017, Beijing launched a boycott of South Korea's products and services after the country agreed to the installation of the American missile-defense system THAAD along its border with North Korea.For Chinese gamers, though, the disruption should be minimal. Tencent is allowing users to port over characters from PUBG Mobile to Heping Jingying, and one analyst told Reuters that the new game was incredibly similar to the older title. The gameplay, the background, the graphic design and the characters, they're almost the same,  said IHS Markit games analyst Cui Chenyu.Tags:  See Website:            https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18536564/pubg-mobile-china-tencent-dropped-monetizationContact Information:James VincentTags:           Wire,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: May 10, 2019End of Document

Chinese Premier Promises Market Liberalization In Speech To Multinationals' CEOsThe FrontrunnerJune 21, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 388 wordsBodyReuters (6/20, Chen, Blanchard) reports that the Chinese Commerce Ministry said Thursday that it "hoped U.S. officials would bring a problem-solving attitude to renewed trade talks in advance of a meeting between" President Trump and Xi in Japan next week at the G20 summit. Reuters goes on to report that the Chinese government "has repeatedly promised to open its market wider to foreign investors and provide them with better services and treatment," and on Thursday, Premier Li Keqiang "reiterated those promises" while "speaking to a group of 19 chief executives of foreign multinationals in Beijing."Politico Analysis: Trump Causes Spike In Chinese Spending On DC Lobbyists.Politico (6/20, Meyer, 4.29M) reports that apart from Huawei, "eight other Chinese companies have spent at least $7.9 million hiring Washington lobbying and public relations firms since last spring, right before Trump cracked down on a different Chinese telecom company, ZTE," which is "nearly eight times what the same companies spent in the same period a year earlier." According to Politico, "The ramp-up shows how Chinese companies, which in the past have been hesitant to play the Washington influence game, are increasingly worried about threats from the Trump administration, as well as Democrats and Republicans in Congress eager to crack down on China. And it's another sign that Trump's trade war with China is driving business on K Street."Politico Analysis: Cook's "Bond" With Trump Could Allow Apple To Escape Tariffs.Politico (6/20, Overly, 4.29M) reports that Apple CEO Tim Cook's "carefully cultivated relationship" with President Trump "faces a high-stakes test as his company hustles to protect its money-making iPhone from the administration's trade war with China." Politico says Cook himself "has been the most effective weapon in Apple's lobbying arsenal as it navigates Trump's policies on issues like taxes and trade, meeting with the president and his family members as recently as last week," which is "in contrast to the reluctance of many other tech executives to engage with Trump." Politico says "that bond could prove critical to the company as it seeks to exempt its iPhone and other products, including tablets and computers, from Trump's latest round of proposed tariffs on $300 billion worth of Chinese-made goods."Load-Date: June 21, 2019End of Document

Credit Suisse Research Institute: China's Tech Giants Transform Healthcare Sector With Cutting-Edge TechnologiesTargeted News ServiceJune 26, 2019 Wednesday 8:33 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1135 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: ZURICH, Germany BodyCredit Suisse, a financial services provider, issued the following news release:The Credit Suisse Research Institute released its 'Healthcare Transformation' report, which analyzes the impact of technology on the future of the sector and the way in which Chinese tech giants are paving the way with smart health services. The report is based on the work of leading healthcare and business academics from the Universities of Pennsylvania and St. Gallen.In a chapter on China's technology giants delivering smart health services, Dr. Alexander Braun and Niklas Hausle of the University of St. Gallen conclude that Chinese tech giants such as Ping An, Tencent and Alibaba are building healthcare ecosystems to improve customer experience and plug the gaps in the medically underserved country.Fast growing but medically underservedThe Chinese healthcare service industry is expected to reach RMB 8 trillion in revenues by 2020 (Figure 1), which is around three times as much as 10 years ago/i, driven by rising income levels and the higher life expectancy of Chinese customers.However, the Chinese healthcare system faces a number of challenges linked to China's transformation from an emerging market to an industrial country. The biggest of these is related to China's demographic transition to an aging society, which is exacerbated further by the one-child policy. The country is also facing an extreme shortage of qualified personal and overworked doctors, particularly in the rural areas, and hospitals are severely understaffed. While countries such as Switzerland and Germany have a medical doctor density of 42 per 10,000 people, China's stands at only 18/ii.Tackling the healthcare gaps with cutting-edge technologiesTo address these challenges, the Chinese tech giants are building their own healthcare ecosystems, using cutting-edge technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced biometrics. They aim to provide a faster and better way to meet the increasing demand for healthcare services and significantly reduce waiting times through AI-assisted online consultation services. With internet-supported telemedicine, essential medical services can also be provided to remote rural areas.* Ping An healthcare ecosystem: Ping An's healthcare ecosystem is based on three entities: the client (patient), medical service providers (clinics, doctors or pharmacies), and payers (insurance companies and the Chinese government). Its health service ecosystem has over 265 million healthcare portal users and approximately 3,000 participating hospitals. This creates strong network effects and synergies in the health service industry. Ping An bases its healthcare operations on modern technologies such as AI, blockchain technology and cloud computing.* Tencent healthcare ecosystem: Tencent is building its healthcare ecosystem inside its Wechat ecosystem. Tencent's healthcare portal Doctorwork connects over 10 million patients with around 440,000 certified doctors and 30,000 hospitals, providing AI-assisted screening and consultation. Tencent is also developing medical chatbots and clinical decision support software to increase the efficiency of its online consultation network. To complete its vast ecosystem, Tencent offers the WeSure insurance service through partnerships with over 20 insurance companies.* Alibaba healthcare ecosystem: Alibaba is building its ecosystem around central healthcare functions and is targeting wellness and health lifestyle products to enhance the "health and happiness" of its customers. On the technology side, it also features an AI diagnostic system called DoctorYou, which assists doctors in their diagnosis and decision-making. Furthermore, Alibaba operates an AI-assisted processing system called ET Medical Brain. Since Alibaba Cloud is the biggest cloud service provider in China, it can exploit its market-leading position to collect data more easily.AI: the answer to modern healthcareThis is a golden era for AI, says Dr. Lyle Ungar of the University of Pennsylvania, in a chapter on AI and healthcare: the road to modern health. He believes AI promises to radically change healthcare, "democratizing" it by supporting patient access to online automated medical diagnosis, allowing people to collect and analyze far more "medical" data at home, personalizing healthcare delivery, supporting phone-based behavioral health intervention, and changing how people communicate with doctors and hospitals.There is a clear need for discussion on how AI systems, their developers, and the companies that use them should be regulated, according to Dr. Martin Eling and Martin Lehmann of the University of St. Gallen in a chapter on the regulatory response to AI in healthcare. They suggest the need to regulate AI does not come as a surprise if we consider how the internet of the 21st century has, to some extent, become a lawless territory where companies and individuals are exposed to many unregulated risks that they are struggling to control.Urs Rohner, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group and Chairman of the Credit Suisse Research Institute, commented: "The future of the healthcare sector brings huge opportunities from the digital revolution - be it artificial intelligence, robotics or personalized medicine. But it is equally important for us to address some of the upcoming challenges we will have to face collectively as the sector evolves."See graph here (https://www.credit-suisse.com/corporate/en/articles/media-releases/csri-china-s-tech-giants-transform-healthcare-sector-201906.html)Credit Suisse AGCredit Suisse AG is one of the world's leading financial services providers and is part of the Credit Suisse group of companies (referred to here as 'Credit Suisse').

Google is fighting to maintain ties with Huawei, saying blacklisting the Chinese firm could jeopardize national securityBusiness Insider USJune 7, 2019 Friday 05:43 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc.

In response, Google suspended its ties with Huawei, cutting it off from the Android operating system used by all Huawei phones.Huawei is not yet totally frozen out, as the DOC granted the company a three-month grace period.Google executives have been asking the DOC for either another extension or to be entirely exempted from the ban, according to the FT. Their argument hinges around national security, specifically the risks that could arise if Huawei were forced to make its own version of Android.Read more: Here are all the companies that have cut ties with Huawei, dealing the Chinese tech giant a crushing blow"Google has been arguing that by stopping it from dealing with Huawei, the US risks creating two kinds of Android operating system: the genuine version and a hybrid one. The hybrid one is likely to have more bugs in it than the Google one, and so could put Huawei phones more at risk of being hacked, not least by China," a source with knowledge of the discussions told the FT.President Donald Trump administration's justifies its Huawei ban on national security grounds, as it claims the phone maker acts as a proxy for the Chinese government to spy. Huawei denies this.Huawei has said publicly that it has been working on getting its own operating system ready in case it were cut off from Android. Huawei executive Richard Yu told CNBC that the new OS could be ready for Chinese customers as soon as this year, and for the rest of the world by early 2020.A Google spokesman told Business Insider: "like other US companies, we're engaging with the Department of Commerce to ensure we're in full compliance with its requirements and temporary licence.

The Age of 'Chimerica' Is Coming to an EndAtlantic OnlineJune 5, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1905 wordsByline: Reihan SalamBodyThe story of the Chinese technology giant Huawei is, in miniature, the story of China's extraordinary economic rise. Founded in 1987 in Shenzhen, which at the time was still an unglamorous backwater, Huawei's early efforts centered around reselling telecom equipment imported from neighboring Hong Kong and, at the same time, working feverishly to figure out how to manufacture low-cost imitations of such equipment.In less than a decade, Huawei went from being little more than a middleman to being one of Asia's leading manufacturers of network technology, helped along by the support of the Chinese party-state, including the People's Liberation Army, an early and devoted customer. Today Huawei is by one account the world's seventh-largest tech company, and a mainstay of Shenzhen's thriving hardware ecosystem. In recent years, the company has            routinely sold more smartphones than Apple, and in 2018            it generated roughly as much revenue as Microsoft.But that was all before Donald Trump made what could ultimately be one of the most consequential decisions of his presidency: By adding Huawei to what is known as the "entity list," the Trump administration has cut off one of China's most successful multinationals from the U.S. technology that it has heretofore needed to function. This is a decision that will have profound implications for the Chinese economy. Yet it will also test the United States, which has grown dependent on Chinese manufacturing prowess in building out its own network infrastructure. What happens next could forever transform the relationship between the world's largest economies.[           Richard Fontaine: The China problem isn't going away]Trump's decision to clip Huawei's wings was not made lightly. It came in the face of evidence that Huawei's growing reach poses serious security challenges to the United States and its allies. For one, Huawei has evinced a willingness to aid China's clandestine intelligence-gathering efforts. In 2017, it came to light that            Huawei-made servers in the African Union headquarters had been surreptitiously feeding classified information to a server farm in Shanghai on a nightly basis for more than five years. To date, nothing this brazen or damning has come to light in a G20 country, but there have long been concerns about Huawei's eyebrow-raising security shortcomings. A            March report from the British government suggested that despite Huawei being at the bleeding edge of 5G hardware, the security of its technology was "very, very shoddy," a fact China hawks attribute to intentional design rather than a lack of sophistication.To many in China, however, Trump's blacklisting of Huawei looks rather a lot like a frontal assault on one of their country's foremost national champions, if not            an echo of the Opium Wars of the 19th century. The Chinese government has promised            a forceful response that will target U.S. companies, and even individual U.S. citizens, it deems "unreliable."Understanding China's vehement defense of Huawei is impossible without situating the company in China's long-term vision for its economy. As Matthew Klein has            perceptively noted in           Barron's, since the financial crisis China has moved away from its old strategy of deluging wealthy Western markets with low-cost goods. Despite China's continued            suppression of living standards,            the cost of labor in China's cities has risen as a result of a shrinking working-age population and sharp inflation in housing costs. Apple CEO Tim Cook has gone so far as to            say that these pressures have moved Chinese manufacturing outside the low-wage target that multinationals such as Apple seek. This move away from being the "workplace of the world" is not a problem in itself. In fact, the "Made in China 2025" program reflects the Chinese Communist Party's hope of aiming a new "           China shock" at Silicon Valley. The issue, though, is that China's enormous            debt overhang might not allow for the seamless pivot the party is counting on.Whereas the United States and Japan can service their debts at little cost, at least for now,            debt service in China comes out to 20 percent of GDP. Given this debt burden, China was counting on its high-tech industries to win large market shares abroad and free up subsidies for the country's struggling state-owned enterprises, which absorbed            70 percent of all new loans from 2013 to 2017.[           Read: The Huawei drama is a gift to U.S. tech companies]Huawei, with its stratospheric rise, was the poster child for this approach. Yes, part of its competitive advantage still stemmed from government largesse, but the overall performance of the company more than made it a net benefit for the country. If the United States kicks off a trend of barring high-tech Chinese companies from lucrative Western markets, though, the Huawei model will be severely damaged. China would still press on with its push into high-tech sectors out of a desire to limit its own vulnerability to the type of supply-chain disruptions it is now facing, but the cost to the state would be far higher.The purpose of "Made in China 2025" is to cultivate national champions, not create more wards of the state. Beneath all of the fawning media attention, the obstacles facing the Chinese economy are formidable. China is facing down the            Japanese cocktail of high debt levels and an aging population, only it's doing so before joining the ranks of the world's richest countries. And unlike the government in Tokyo, the Chinese Communist Party cannot countenance a deep and lasting recession that could prove fatal to its legitimacy.A recognition of China's structural challenges, though, should not obscure that the United States has vulnerabilities of its own. With the exception of the dot-com decade from 1995 to 2005, the Unites States has seen            lackluster productivity growth since the 1970s, which has contributed to wage stagnation and all of its associated ills. The economic wonders of 5G remain highly speculative, but unlike previous generations of wireless technology, there is reason to believe that 5G will have major cross-industry effects. To highlight a single            but very promising example, when Ericsson installed its early 5G-sensor system in a factory for jet-engine blades, the defect rate was brought down by 10 percent, reducing the per blade cost by more than $4,000. Even if the 5G boosters are proved wrong, and its contributions to the economy end up being marginal, the upside is too large for the United States not to get in the race.If blacklisting Huawei appreciably raises the cost of deploying 5G networks in the United States, American firms might find themselves at a distinct disadvantage. Over the next few years, as AT&amp;T and Verizon build out their 5G infrastructure, swearing off Huawei means they will do so with hardware manufactured by Ericsson, a Swedish multinational, or Nokia, a Finnish one, as if to underscore the extent to which the United States has allowed its industrial know-how to atrophy. And Ericsson and Nokia hardware            can be as much as 20 percent more expensive than Huawei's offerings. When you consider this per unit premium compounded over the            upper-bound estimate of 800,000 new 5G cells, the premium U.S. telecom companies will be forced to pay to guard against the threat of Chinese subversion is staggering. For smaller companies, particularly wireless providers for rural communities, the cost of moving away from Huawei could be prohibitive, unless the government steps in.[           Peter Beinart: China isn't cheating on trade]Consider the case of Nemont,            as relayed by Charlie Campbell of           Time. A pint-size wireless carrier operating in rural Montana, its tight margins forced it to rely on Huawei technology for its 4G hardware. Turning to a higher-cost supplier was simply not an option. Smaller players in the heartland such as Nemont would look to the federal government for relief should the Trump administration stick with the Huawei blacklist. The White House had already pledged $20 billion to expand rural broadband before the ban, a bill that may have to climb higher still.While there's nothing to say that either Ericsson or Nokia won't find some cost-cutting innovations over the next few years to change this basic calculus, we should not bank on it. Instead, it would be wise to be seek out opportunities for cost-cutting and efficiency gains elsewhere in the process. At a minimum, the United States must overcome regulatory obstacles that have all but thwarted every other major effort to build out 5G infrastructure in recent years. Many of America's larger cities and metros find themselves squeezed by soaring expenditures and cash-strapped voters who rightly resist new taxes. This has left ambitious politicians scrambling for revenue sources to paper over fiscal imbalances, even when this strategy risks deterring productive investment.Take Portland, Oregon, where installing a 5G antenna required            a $7,500 builders fee and then a recurring annual fee of somewhere between $2,500 and $3,500; or Dallas, where the right to build 5G antennae would cost you a one-time fee of $280,000. A recently announced            Federal Communications Commission policy would constrain revenue-hungry local governments. Under the new guidelines, cities would be required to set their fees at however much it cost them to review the 5G-antenna application, which itself would have to be approved or declined within 90 days. It's a policy that can't hurt, but it won't make the challenge of replacing Huawei's technology all that much easier to overcome.And so Trump has to make a decision. If he doesn't want to cede the emerging 5G economy to a Chinese tech giant, whether out of security concerns or a larger anxiety about the loss of U.S. technological superiority, he must decide on an alternative course. One option would be to work with other market economies to reduce their collective dependence on Huawei's low-cost networking technology. But that would require deft diplomacy-not the president's strong suit-as America's partners in this endeavor would need to be reassured that they have something to gain from willingly paying higher prices to fend off an amorphous Chinese challenge.Alternatively, Trump could commit to a more ambitious strategy of rebuilding the U.S. industrial commons, and perhaps even building up U.S. national champions that can outcompete Huawei in manufacturing networking technology. In short, he could craft a "Made in the U.S.A. 2025" agenda fit to compete with "Made in China 2025." Suffice it to say, the United States is not known for its ability to engage in this sort of long-term industrial planning, and even attempting to do so would raise hackles among free traders on the left and the right. Blacklisting Huawei is one thing. Figuring out exactly what to do next will prove to be quite another.Regardless of the outcome of the Huawei controversy, it is yet another sign that the enmeshment of the Chinese and U.S. economies that has defined the past 20 years-           the age of "Chimerica"-is coming to an end, and this will mean a painful adjustment for Chinese and Americans alike.Load-Date: June 6, 2019End of Document

FCC denies China Mobile USA application to provide telecom services  FierceWirelessMay 9, 2019Copyright 2019 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 615 wordsByline: Monica AllevenHighlight: As expected, the FCC today voted to deny China Mobile's application to provide telecom services between the U.S. and foreign destinations. The vote was unanimous.BodyAs expected, the Federal Communications Commissiontoday voted to deny China Mobile's application to provide telecom services between the U.S. and foreign destinations. The vote was unanimous.China Mobile USAfiled an application back in 2011 requesting authority to provide international facilities-based and resale services in the U.S., but it wasn't until last year that the government made a recommendation on behalf of the executive branch to deny the application due to national security and law enforcement concerns.In the order adopted today, the FCC said it found that China Mobile USA did not demonstrate that its application was in the public interest. In fact, the FCC found that due to several factors related to China Mobile USA's ownership and control by the Chinese government, granting such an application would raise substantial and serious national security risks.RELATED: FCC's Pai says he'll bar China Mobile from U.S.Several commissioners also called on the agency to do more in terms of protecting the nation's telecom security, especially in light of 5G coming down the pike.Commissioner Brendan Carr said the Chinese government owns a number of other carriers that already are operating in the U.S., including China Unicom and China Telecom, and those companies hold the same Section 214 authorization that China Mobile sought. “Our national security agencies should examine whether the FCC should revoke those existing Section 214 authorizations, and the FCC should open a proceeding on those matters,” he said.Commissioner Geoffrey Starks said the need for strong FCC action to address security vulnerabilities has never been greater. “As we move into a world of 5G and the Internet of Things, and our network grows larger and more interconnected than ever, real risks and the potential harm of telecom network vulnerabilities will grow exponentially,” he said, before raising a number of questions he saidneed to be answered, including how to address the continued operation of 2G and 3G networks with known cybersecurity flaws.Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel also made a call to action. “We are at an inflection point as the world races to deploy next-generation wireless networks,” she said. “With 5G service, we will have wireless capability built into the world around us. This will provide a whole new range of opportunities for civic and commercial life. But as they multiply, this will vastly expand our surface exposure to attack.”RELATED:FCC Chairman Pai: Private sector should build 5G; security is key issueChairman Ajit Pai was part of a U.S. delegation that last week attended an international conference on 5G network security hosted by the Czech Republic. There was a broad consensus at that meeting that network security is not only a priority but a necessity, he said. Theconference produced a set of 5G security principles that reflect a common understanding of the importance of security in 5G.Pai also joined several other Administration officials yesterday in a detailed briefing of members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and while he said he can't discuss what transpired in the meeting, “I can say that at the intersection of national security and communications lies a strong bipartisan consensus in favor of proactive measure to protect our networks at the front end, not as an afterthought,” he said.Separately, the commission adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that proposes to reallocate the 1675-1680 MHz band for terrestrial fixed and mobile (except aeronautical mobile) use on a shared basis with existing federal users.

(AP) - The young woman lay on a mat in the concrete hallway of a Beijing hospital on June 4, 1989. She weakly held up an X-ray showing a bullet in her shoulder. Knowing I was a journalist, she whispered something I had heard numerous times in the previous three weeks: "Report the truth."She was among the tens and possibly hundreds of thousands of people on the streets of Beijing when soldiers from the People's Liberation Army shot their way through the heart of the Chinese capital and retook Tiananmen Square, the nexus of nationwide protests seeking social freedom and democracy.The crackdown 30 years ago Tuesday stopped in its tracks a slow opening to the world that senior leader Deng Xiaoping had launched a decade earlier. The U.S. and China formalized diplomatic ties in 1979, and reporting from China in the 1980s, I had written about investment and expansion by Disney, Coca-Cola and Kentucky Fried Chicken.Foreign investment eventually returned and economic reforms continued, but a fundamental political change settled on China in the wake of Tiananmen, said Wang Chaohua, who in 1989 was a graduate student and No. 14 on a most-wanted list of 21 fugitives published by the government in the weeks after June 4."Before 1989 the official slogan was 'anding tuanjie' (peaceful solidarity)," Wang told me last week. "After the crackdown Deng emphasized 'wending yadaoyiqie' (stability over all else). The new slogan was no longer speaking to society, but to the (Communist) Party. . And the roots are in Tiananmen."The story of China's economic success is familiar. When I returned to China as a correspondent from 2010-2013, Chinese brands such as Baidu, Alibaba and Huawei were expanding aggressively overseas, and Apple, Nike, Nestle, Toyota and Mercedes-Benz were turning China into a critical market.For a foreign correspondent, there was far more access to information than in the 1980s. All ministries had spokespeople, albeit often elusive, and statistics were abundant, albeit often suspect.But the government also tracked down and sent away reporters who went to Tibetan Buddhist areas of Sichuan province after a wave of self-immolation protests, and blocked the websites of major Western media, as well as Gmail, Whatsapp, Reddit, Tumblr and Pinterest and a host of others.That pattern continues today in far-west Xinjiang, where authorities disrupt foreign journalists' attempts to report on the re-education camps that have sprung up, housing up to an estimated million ethnic Uighurs.This clampdown on information can be traced in large part to the government's failure to stop the news flow from the hundreds of journalists covering the Tiananmen protests in 1989. It was only at the end that authorities moved against journalists en masse.As I went back to the Beijing Hotel to file updates and radio reports on the night of June 3, a plainclothes security official and three uniformed officers confiscated one of my videocassettes, filled with two hours of footage from the previous several days. They had been waiting in the empty lobby, picking off journalists as they came in.I was outside the hotel on June 5 when I saw people ducking and running toward me ahead of approaching tanks. I took one shot before hustling upstairs for a better view. It was only weeks or months later that I printed the photo and discovered the man who had stood in front of the tanks in what would become an iconic image of Tiananmen. My photo showed him waiting in apparent calm, moments before the confrontation.The next day, I was - foolishly - taking photos of a column of soldiers marching straight at me. A commander barked orders while pointing at me, and two soldiers, their eyes on me, started running in my direction. I turned and ran, and heard two shots. Dropping to my knees behind a minivan, I furiously unwound my film, hid it in my sock, and waited for the soldiers to come.They never did, and when I peeked under the van, I saw them walking away. After the column had marched past, I crossed a parking lot, hopped a wall and retrieved a bicycle I had borrowed. A group of onlookers, who had watched everything, burst into applause when they saw me.In the ensuing years, the Chinese government has scrubbed virtually all mentions of the protests from textbooks, the media and the internet. Meaningful political reform seems unlikely as today's leader, President Xi Jinping, tightens his hold on power. And a commitment to transparency and accountability still seems a distant possibility. Only when that happens, though, will most Chinese learn the truth.___Jones, an instructor in international journalism at Claremont McKenna College, was an AP correspondent in Tokyo, Paris and New York from 1982 to 1997.Load-Date: June 4, 2019End of Document

Bloomberg and the China Center for International Economic Exchanges to Host New Economy Forum in Beijing in November 2019Targeted News ServiceMay 20, 2019 Monday 8:21 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1726 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyBloomberg Media issued the following news:New York and Beijing - Bloomberg and the China Center for International Economic Exchanges (CCIEE) today announced that the 2019 New Economy Forum will be held in Beijing on November 20-22 on the shores of Yanqi Lake, looking out at the Great Wall. Nearly 500 of the world's most influential business executives, technology innovators, government officials, experts and academics from over 60 countries and regions will gather in Beijing to propose solutions to the massive disruption that's occurring, as the balance of global economic power shifts towards the Asia Pacific.The new economy will increasingly be shaped by emerging powers as well as by advanced technologies, while an industrial revolution is fostering critical developments in the fields of science and technology, trade and finance. At the same time, trade protectionism is on the rise and multilateral institutions such as the WTO are facing challenges. Will conflicts over trade push countries to continue building walls that impede the flow of ideas, people, capital and other critical elements of production? Can collaboration enable growth that is inclusive and sustainable? The leaders attending the New Economy Forum are committed to working together and sharing insights to address looming challenges that could imperil prosperity and social stability.Launched in 2018 by Michael R. Bloomberg, Founder of Bloomberg L.P. and Bloomberg Philanthropies, and Three-Term Mayor of New York City, the New Economy Forum is committed to promoting the smooth transition from the old economy -- one based on labor-intensive manufacturing and trade in goods -- to a new one focused on industrial automation, digital services and exchanges of data. The New Economy Forum has become a unique global convening platform where businesses and governments, using facts and data, can engage in an open exchange of ideas on how to ease the global transition that is underway.Co-hosted by Bloomberg and the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, the 2019 New Economy Forum will focus on the topics of global economic governance, trade, technology, finance and capital markets, climate change, urbanization and inclusion. The forum will search for solutions to key challenges and issues brought about by global economic transitions, explore how to foster critical development drivers in the new economic era, promote sustainable development, reduce inequality and address climate change worldwide."We are experiencing a period of profound change in the world, where new economic centers are emerging, new trading alliances are being formed and new technologies are upending industries," said Michael R. Bloomberg. "The New Economy Forum will address these seismic shifts through high-level and frank dialogue, while also fostering private-public collaboration. China is an integral part of these discussions, and the New Economy Forum will bring leaders there from around the world to tackle common challenges and advance our shared interests."The forum's Advisory Board includes many of the world's most influential government and business leaders, led by former U.S. Secretary of State and National Security Advisor Dr. Henry A. Kissinger as Honorary Chair, along with former U.S. Treasury Secretary and Paulson Institute Chairman Henry M. Paulson, Jr. and Zeng Peiyan, Former Vice Premier of the State Council, PRC and Chairman of CCIEE, as co-Chairs.Dr. Henry A. Kissinger said, "The world is undergoing a historic transformation. Different societies, themselves in flux, are seeking ways of shaping their relationships with each other in a manner that promotes new avenues of peace and progress. China and the United States, as the two largest economies and technologically most advanced countries, have a critical role in this process. The New Economy Forum will provide an opportunity for this global dialogue among outstanding personalities. I support the visionary initiative of my long-time friend, Mike Bloomberg, in setting up this forum and look forward to participating."Zeng Peiyan said, "Today's world is facing a once-in-a-century transition. A new round of technological revolution and industrial transformations are profoundly changing the world. New economies, new businesses and new growth drivers are developing robustly, emerging economies are growing rapidly, and the reform of global governance systems and international order are accelerating. The world is full of hope and challenges. Developed and developing countries should work together to build a peaceful, prosperous and beautiful community for all mankind."Henry M. Paulson, Jr. said, "In the spirit of its founder, The Bloomberg New Economy Forum is action-oriented and focused on achieving real results. At a time when governments and businesses around the world are buffeted by new and emerging risks, the forum provides an opportunity for leaders to better understand these challenges and forge joint solutions."We are pleased to receive the support and participation of our advisors, including:Henry A.

U.S. Bans Sale of Technology to Five Other Chinese OrganizationsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 22, 2019 SaturdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 392 wordsBodyThe U.S. government on Friday banned companies in the country from selling technology to four companies and a research center based in China, citing national security reasons and thus repeating the steps it already took with Huawei in mid-May.The order was issued by the Commerce Department run by Wilbur Ross on Friday by including five other organizations in their list of entities "acting contrary to national security or U.S. foreign policy interests" China's linked to the development of supercomputers.New additions to the list are Sugon, China's leading manufacturer of supercomputers (very high-performance computers) and three of its chip-making subsidiaries: Higon, Chengdu Haiguang Integrated Circuit and Chengdu Haiguang Microelectronics Technology.The Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computational Technology was also banned.The US government's decision will mean that, as in the case of Huawei, these entities will lose access to American technology, which could have significant consequences by cutting off the supply of some of the chip makers pointers in the world.This is the case, for example, of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Intel, and Nvidia, all of whom are Americans and Sugon vendors.In its brief, commerce alleged that some of the supercomputers these organizations help create are being used by the Chinese government to "simulate nuclear explosions and military activities."Supercomputing, an industry that both China and the United States are betting heavily on, is set to play a key role in the development of nuclear weapons, encryption mechanisms, and military defense systems.A few days after the Administration that runs Donald Trump listed Huawei on Google's "list of entities" and the country's major microprocessor manufacturers announced that they were cutting off business relationships with the Chinese giant, which caused a major international stir-up, especially because their phones are going to lose access to Google Mobile Services.Within hours of Google's announcement, Commerce issued a 90-day license that lifted the ban on Huawei and its affiliated companies during that period to facilitate the transition.Next week Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to hold a meeting at the G20 country summit in Osaka, Japan, in which they try to unblock the stalemate of trade talks between the two states.Load-Date: June 22, 2019End of Document

China formally arrests two Canadians on national security groundsCNN WireMay 16, 2019 Thursday 10:12 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 540 wordsByline: By Ben Westcott, CNNDateline: HONG KONG (CNN) BodyHONG KONG (CNN) --  Chinese authorities have formally arrested two Canadians who have been held in detention for five months on suspicion of espionage, in a move likely to increase tension between Ottawa and Beijing.Former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor were detained on December 10, accused of gathering and stealing "sensitive information and other intelligence" since 2017.Their detainment came shortly after the arrest of a Chinese executive in Vancouver, a move which infuriated Beijing and sparked a diplomatic crisis.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Thursday the arrest of Kovrig and Spavor had been approved by "Chinese prosecutorial authorities" and asked Canada to stop "making irresponsible remarks on China's rule of law.""Michael Kovrig was recently arrested for spying on state secrets and intelligence for foreign entities, and Michael Spavor was recently arrested for stealing and unlawfully providing state secrets to foreign entities," Lu said.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has previously called for the immediate release of both Kovrig and Spavor, describing their detentions as "arbitrary."China's move to detain the two men was widely interpreted in Canada as retaliation for the country's decision to arrest Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Chinese tech giant Huawei.Meng was taken into custody on December 1, 2018, in Vancouver on behalf of the United States on charges of working to evade Iran sanctions.The Chinese government has repeatedly protested Meng's detention, saying the arrest was political. At her latest court hearing on May 9, her lawyers reiterated that she was innocent and called the arrest "an unlawful abuse of process."Speaking in March, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said that both Canada and the US had "abused their bilateral extradition treaty and took forced actions on a Chinese citizen."Meng is currently under house arrest in Vancouver and is facing extradition to the US. Spavor and Korvig, meanwhile, have been held in a detention facility, its location undisclosed to the public, with only occasional visits from Canadian embassy staff. Both Canadians have a long history of working in China. Former diplomat Kovrig is northeast Asia senior adviser for the nonprofit organization, the International Crisis Group (ICG). Spavor is the founder of Paektu Cultural Exchange, a company that helps facilitate trips to North Korea. Spavor had previously assisted former NBA player Dennis Rodman in travel to Pyongyang to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.The formal arrest of the two men raises the possibility of them facing trial, though no date has been set. Their ongoing detainment in China has led to calls inside of Canada for the country to take a tougher line with Beijing. In a strongly-worded speech in early May, Canadian opposition leader Andrew Scheer said the relationship with China needed a "total reset.""So long as China is willing to hold our exports hostage, all the while committing human rights violations on an industrial scale, we have no choice as Canadians but consider other trade partners," he was quoted as saying.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Meanwhile, the Nasdaq, technological stocks, fell 3.41%, to settle at 7,647,024 and the benchmark S & P 500 closed the first day of the week with a fall of 2.41%, to 2,811.87 units.  "The market is realizing that this is an absolute break in (commercial) negotiations and everything has fallen," said Michael O'Rourke, head of market strategy at JonesTrading in Connecticut. "It could be very bad, there is a lot of uncertainty, this should lead to a new slowdown in the economy," he added.  Among stocks especially vulnerable to US and Chinese tariffs, those of Boeing Co fell 4.9% and those of Caterpillar Inc fell 4.9%, while the Philadelphia Chip index fell 4.7 percent.  Meanwhile, Apple Inc's shares sank 5.8% under pressure from increased commercial tensions and a decision by the US Supreme Court to allow an antitrust lawsuit accusing the company of monopolizing the iPhone applications market.  Yields on US Treasuries fell to six-week lows and the return on 10-year notes fell to less than the three-month debt, an investment that many see as a potential harbinger of a recession, while that gold prices rose to near three-month highs.  European markets fall European stocks fell, amid escalating trade war between the United States and China, which affected investor confidence and led them to take refuge in assets considered safe.  The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 1.2% and suffered declines in all its sub-sectors, except for the signatures of basic services.  Meanwhile, the German DAX index lost 1.5%, while French shares fell 1.2 percent. The securities in London sank to a two-month closing low of 0.6 percent.  Graham Secker, strategist at Morgan Stanley, said that the short-term worsening in the risk-reward scenario for equity markets could lead to higher performance sectors considered defensive.  International analysts attributed the losses to Monday's announcement by the Chinese government to impose new tariffs on exports of US $ 60 billion worth of products as of June 1.  In a statement, the Ministry of Finance of China reported that Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council decided to impose additional tariffs of 25.0, 20.0 and 10.0% on more than five thousand American products.  The decision of the Chinese government was in response to the increase from 10.0 to 25.0% to the tariff rates announced last Friday by the United States against the imports of Chinese products, worth 200,000 million dollars, which take effect this Monday.  With information from Reuters. Load-Date: May 13, 2019End of Document

Last quarter, FedEx reported weaker than expected results and lowered its guidance to account for a slowing global economy. The weak outlook briefly pressured the stock, but FedEx was able to climb to a fresh 2019 high in mid-April. However, that push was followed by a return to the December low earlier this month. Continued relative strength in the U.S. economy should support FedEx's domestic business, but the international segment could see softness associated with slowing growth in Asia and Europe. FedEx's international segment accounts for roughly 30% of revenue. The company has had a difficult time integrating TNT Express into its business. Investors have known about this issue for a while, so any improvement on this front would be a positive. South China Morning Post reported today that the Chinese government may put FedEx on its list of unreliable foreign entities. Global Times speculated about this possibility on Sunday.FedEx trades at 9.9x forward earnings expectations, which represents a discount to UPS's (UPS 97.47, -2.25, -2.3%) 12.9x forward multiple.13:50SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Brighthouse Financial (BHF) sinks on analyst downgrades -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersTEVA (8.8 +6.67%): Various biotech/pharma names move higher following AbbVie's (ABBV) premium acquisition of pharmaceutical peer Allergan (AGN).

Drops to five-month lows.UNIT (9.88 -7.58%): In recent items, co announced the planned offering by its subsidiary Uniti Fiber Holdings, Inc. of $300 mln aggregate principal amount of exchangeable senior notes due 2024, and it signaled that it has entered into an amendment to its credit agreement to extend the maturity date of its revolving credit facility. Co also yesterday announced that PEG Bandwidth Holdings, the holder of co's 3.00% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, has elected to convert all of its shares.JOBS (69.88 -6.18%): Dropped to its lowest levels since December in early trade; though now well off those morning lows, the stock continues to underperform on more than 3x average volume, lagging alongside Chinese peers generally ahead of the weekend's G-20 meeting.

The problem today perhaps is that Fed Chair Powell's remarks didn't necessarily make it clear that the Fed is inclined to cut the target range for the fed funds rate by 50 basis points at the July meeting.That sense of matters is wrapped up in the following two observations made in the speech:"Against the backdrop of heightened uncertainties, the baseline outlook of my FOMC colleagues, like that of many other forecasters, remains favorable, with unemployment remaining near historic lows.""But we are also mindful that monetary policy should not overreact to any individual data point or short-term swing in sentiment."This speech followed on the heels of St. Lois Fed President Bullard saying that he thought a rate cut would be coming in July, but that he doesn't think a 50-basis points rate cut is necessary.Accordingly, the Powell speech served as another focal point that tempered the market's growing, and pent-up, hope that the Fed would cut by 50 basis points at the July 30-31 meeting. It could still if events, and data, unfold in the interim that suggest such a cut is necessary, but for now, there appear to be some emerging hints in the Fed commentary that suggest the market is probably getting greedy with the expectation that a 50 basis points cut is on the way.13:09SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ABBV (57.23 mln -15.46%), AGN (23.25 mln +26.5%), TEVA (21.69 mln +7.27%), BMY (14.02 mln +0.45%)Materials: GOLD (17.35 mln -2.4%), GOLD (17.35 mln -2.4%), KGC (14.76 mln -2.78%), HMY (12.99 mln -5.16%)Industrials: GE (20.66 mln -0.68%)Consumer Discretionary: CZR (57.76 mln +2.27%)Information Technology: AMD (29.78 mln -0.38%), NOK (17.49 mln -0.79%), MSFT (15.84 mln -2.75%), MU (14.28 mln +1.27%)Financials: BAC (27.1 mln -0.66%), ITUB (15.37 mln -1.11%), BBD (13.41 mln -1.52%)Energy: CHK (31 mln -4.97%), SWN (13.3 mln -5.57%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: ABBV (11.7x -15.46%), AGN (7.08x +26.5%), XNCR (4.81x +13.29%), ATRS (4.04x +4.97%), ARQL (2.12x +9.89%)Materials: HMY (2.69x -5.16%), NG (2.25x -0.72%)Industrials: JOBS (3.46x -6.48%), DOOR (3.21x +2.21%)Consumer Discretionary: LEN (3.7x -5.74%), ERI (3.7x -3.87%), CZR (2.79x +2.27%), GRUB (2.19x +5.07%)Information Technology: SCSC (2.96x +2.61%)Financials: VMBS (6.89x +0.03%), VCIT (4.42x -0.01%), BHF (4.18x -13.12%), AEF (2.54x -0.27%)Energy: TOO (3.59x -1.72%)Utilities: ENIC (3x +0.84%)13:08SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: AGN (163.9 +26.5%), XNCR (38.37 +13.29%), RUBY (15.11 +10.21%), ARQL (11 +9.89%), TEVA (8.85 +7.27%), ENDP (3.84 +6.96%), DNLI (20.95 +6.72%), RARX (27.94 +6.56%), INO (2.57 +5.99%), PGNX (5.5 +5.36%)Industrials: GBX (28.96 +7.06%), TGI (19.74 +5.9%)Energy: MDR (8.79 +6.93%), LPI (2.9 +5.84%), OIS (17.94 +5.65%), GLOG (13.89 +5.63%)Consumer Staples: USNA (79.15 +9.41%), RAD (6.78 +7.62%), SPTN (11.53 +5.83%), ELF (13.87 +5.8%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: ABBV (66.33 -15.46%), EPZM (13.54 -10.48%)Industrials: JOBS (69.66 -6.48%)Consumer Discretionary: RGS (16.56 -6.76%), SCVL (26.5 -5.96%)Information Technology: GTT (18.52 -7.26%), GSKY (12.15 -6.22%), UPLD (44 -6.13%), SHOP (292.83 -6.09%)Financials: BHF (33.12 -13.12%), HIIQ (24.05 -7.96%), JT (4.08 -6.63%)Consumer Staples: DF (0.97 -6.21%)13:05BONDX Auction OutTreasury Auction Results$40 bln 2-year Treasury note auction: Auction results: High yield: 1.695% (When-Issued: 1.705%) Bid-to-cover: 2.58Indirect bid: 48.5% Direct bid: 24.2% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.572% Bid-to-cover: 2.63 Indirect bid: 46.3% Direct bid: 15.6%12:58WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stock market trades lower in front of Powell commentsThe S&P 500 is down 0.5%, as shares of technology companies weigh on the broader market. Investors have shown some caution, buying into U.S. Treasuries, in front of an appearance from Fed Chair Powell at the top of the hour.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.9%. The Russell 2000 is up 0.1% after underperforming yesterday.Mr. Powell's position as Fed Chair usually commands the most attention, but the market has taken a leg lower in recent action after St. Louis Fed President James Bullard (FOMC voter) said a half-point cut in the fed funds rate would be too much. Instead, Mr. Bullard prefers a quarter-point cut.Economic data released today has provided some insight into the housing sector and consumer sentiment that has also disappointed investors. New homes sales declined 7.8% m/m in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 626,000 (Briefing.com consensus 683,000), and the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index fell to 121.5 in June (Briefing.com consensus 132.0).Today's action has been largely risk-off, which is being reflected across losses in nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors. Leading today's retreat are the S&P 500 communication services (-1.4%), information technology (-1.2%), and consumer discretionary (-0.7%) sectors. The materials (+0.1%) and real estate (+0.02%) sectors cling onto slim gains.Home construction company Lennar (LEN 48.33, -3.13, -6.1%) has also contributed to the cautious sentiment after it issued downside Q3 guidance, discouraging investors after it provided positive quarterly results earlier in the day.Separately, there has been a mega-merger deal in the health care space. Allergan (AGN 164.00, +34.41, +26.6%) confirmed it will be acquired by pharmaceutical company AbbVie (ABBV 66.33, -12.12, -15.5%) for about $63 billion, or $188.24 per share, in cash and stock. With shares of AbbVie currently down over 15%, the deal represents a 37% premium to AGN's closing price on Monday.U.S. Treasuries have advanced, pushing the benchmark 10-yr yield down three basis points to 1.99%, as investors remain cautious about the economic outlook. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 96.21.Reviewing today's batch of economic data:The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index fell to 121.5 in June (Briefing.com consensus 132.0) from a downwardly revised 131.3 (from 134.1) in May. The index is at its lowest level since September 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects growing concern about trade tensions among consumers that had been previously lacking, but which had been showing up in business confidence surveys. Flagging confidence on the part of businesses and consumers alike, if it is sustained, is an adverse development for the growth outlook.New home sales declined 7.8% m/m in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 626,000 (Briefing.com consensus 683,000) from an upwardly revised 679,000 (from 673,000) in April.The key takeaway from the report is that demand was relatively soft despite a drop in mortgage rates and a 2.8% yr/yr decline in the median sales price of $308,000.The FHFA Housing Price Index for April increased 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%) following an unrevised 0.1% increase in March. The S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for April increased 2.5% as expected after increasing a revised 2.6% in March (from 2.7%).12:48TALKX Market Briefing: Bullard reins in scope of rate-cut expectationsThe stock market has hit an air pocket, moving to its lows for the session, following comments from St. Louis Fed President Bullard (FOMC voter) who said he sees a rate cut coming in July, but that he doesn't think a 50-basis points rate cut is necessary.This remark caused some knee-jerk selling interest, as there has been a growing belief that the Fed will be inclined to cut the target range for the fed funds rate by 50 basis points at its July 30-31 FOMC meeting. The fact that one of the Fed's biggest doves -- if not the biggest -- is seemingly trying to rein in the market's rate-cut hopes has taken some of that rate-cut premium out of stock prices.As a reminder, Fed Chair Powell has a speaking engagement at 1:00 p.m. ET.The Russell 2000 is down 0.2%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.5%; the S&P 500 is down 0.6%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.0%.12:00MSFT Microsoft hit by profit-taking interest (134.79 -2.99)Shares of Dow component Microsoft (MSFT 134.56, -3.22, -2.3%), which is also the largest stock by market capitalization, are underperforming today. That has to do in large part with how the stock has outperformed since June 3.Entering today, Microsoft was up 15% since June 3 (i.e. the day before Fed Chair Powell said the Fed would act appropriately to sustain the expansion) versus a 7.3% gain for the S&P 500 and a 9.2% gain for the Nasdaq Composite.A 15% move in a stock the size of Microsoft is a massive move and left shares of MSFT 21% above their 200-day moving average. The basis for today's selling, then, is a pullback from a short-term overbought condition.That condition was brought to light today by the analyst at Jefferies who raised his price target to $90 from $80, but maintained an Underperform rating and called the stock "materially overvalued."It won't be lost on investors that MSFT has defied the Jefferies view of the stock's prospects in a big way leading into today; nonetheless, with the broader market in a consolidation mode in front of the G-20 summit, the Jefferies view today looks to have served as another profit-taking catalyst.11:45SUMRX European Markets Update: DAX -0.27%, FTSE +0.13%, CAC -0.05%---Equity Markets---STOXX Europe 600: -0.03%Germany's DAX: -0.27%U.K.'s FTSE 100: +0.13%France's CAC 40: -0.05%Italy's FTSE MIB: -0.73%Spain's IBEX 35: -0.24%11:41SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Xencor (XNCR) rises on addition to S&P SmallCap 600 index -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersXNCR (38.25 +12.92%): Co will take the place of HFF Inc.

There is a conference call scheduled for 8:30 ET. Q4 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $0.76 (-4% yr/yr) on revenue of $4.24 bln (+8.8% yr/yr). The company is expected to guide for FY20 where consensus stands at $3.31 (-4.8% yr/yr) and $17.3 bln for revenues (+1.6% yr/yr).Looking back, the company beat on EPS four times in a row, but missed on revenues four times in a row. GIS shares increased 3% following its Q4 results. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, General Mills expects Blue Buffalo's net sales and segment operating profit growth will accelerate meaningfully, driven by significant distribution expansion in the FDM channel. Based on the GIS weekly Jun28 $54 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~6% in either direction by weekly expiration (Friday).On a positive report, look for resistance near the $58.00-58.50 area, while support sits near the $49.00-49.50 vicinity.GIS has a market cap of ~$32 bln and trades at ~16x FY20 earnings, a notable discount to the average consumer packaged goods stock at 22x.11:13XPH Pharma is the big winner today after second large M&A deal is announced in as many weeksPharma and biotech stocks are the clear winners in trading this morning. With ABBV announcing today it will acquire AGN just a week after PFE said it will acquire ARRY, there is a lot of excitement in the group. What's notable is that both acquiring companies have blockbuster drugs (ABBV with Humira and PFE with Lyrica) that are soon facing patent expirations. It's clear large pharmas want to restock their portfolios. It's leading to speculation as to which companies may be next.On the other side of the spectrum, China, IT and gold stocks are showing weakness today.10:35SUMRX Morning Commodities: Oil sheds gains, now modestly lower, gold over 1% higherCommodities are higher (+0.5% at 79.88 as measured by the Bloomberg Commodity Index)Dollar index is slightly lower (-0.04% at 95.9420)Looking at energy:Jul WTI crude oil futures are now -$0.08 (-0.1%) at $57.82/barrelIn other energy, Jul natural gas is -$0.4 (-1.9%) at $2.24/MMBtu Moving on to metals:Aug gold is currently +$18.15 (+1.3%) at $1436.35/oz, while Jul silver is +$0.05 at $15.43/ozJul copper is now +$0.03 (+1.0%) at 2.73/lb10:31SUMRX Economic Summary: Consumer Confidence & New Home Sales miss expectationsEconomic Data Summary:April Case Schiller Home Price Index 0.4% vs Briefing.com consensus of 2.5%; March was 2.7% April FHFA Housing Price Index 2.5% vs Briefing.com consensus of 0.2%; March was revised to 2.6% from 0.1% June Consumer Confidence 121.5 vs Briefing.com consensus of 132.0; May was revised to 131.3 from 134.1The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects growing concern about trade tensions among consumers that had been previously lacking, but which had been showing up in business confidence surveys.

Escalation of tariffs between the US and China falters the marketsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 14, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 812 wordsBody The trade war between the United States and China intensified yesterday, as Beijing said it would raise tariffs on 60 billion dollars of US products, which defied Donald Trump's warnings and caused a massive sale in international markets.  China's Ministry of Finance said it would increase levies on different products ranging from liquefied natural gas and frozen spinach to toothpaste, in "response to unilateralism and US trade protectionism," the way they described the decision. of the Trump administration last Friday to raise tariffs on 200 billion dollars of Chinese imports to 25 percent.  The Trump government was expected to retaliate later on Monday by releasing details of a plan to affect another 300 billion dollars in Chinese imports with tariffs of 25 percent, a measure he said last week after The trade negotiations in Washington between the US and Chinese negotiators failed to reach an agreement.  "China should not retaliate, that is only going to make things worse!" Trump tweeted before the Chinese announcement, warning Beijing that it will be "very damaged" if the trade conflict continues. "They had a great deal, almost complete, and they backed off!" He wrote.  In response, stocks fell, as investors fled to more secure assets, including government debt. All the indices of US markets registered a fall, with the S & P 500 that experienced a decline of 2.3 percent, and the Nasdaq, with a heavy load of technology companies, with a fall of 3.2 percent for the midday operations in New York. York International stocks fell to their lowest level since March, with the FTSE All World index recording a loss of 1.8 percent, its biggest one-day decline since December.  The tariff increases announced by Beijing yesterday will affect sectors ranging from heavy manufacturing and industry to agriculture and household goods. Apple's shares fell 6 percent in midday trading, while Caterpillar's declined 5 percent.  "Companies like Apple and Caterpillar have significant exposure to revenues outside the US, immediate mass sales will have an impact on these types of companies," said Kristina Hooper, head of international markets strategy at Invesco. "It is not a specific history of a sector, it is more a history of high capitalization".  Expectations in the market increased that the US Federal Reserve would respond with a reduction in interest rates. The probability of a cut before the end of the year, derived from futures prices, was 74 percent, compared to 58 percent a week ago. The yield on Treasuries fell almost 9 basis points to reach 2.18 percent, its lowest level since February 2018.  The intensification of tensions affected the currency of China and the currencies of emerging markets in general. The yuan fell 0.9 percent on its parity with the US dollar in overseas markets, after it crossed the threshold of 6.9 yuan for the first time this year. The MSCI index that tracks emerging market currencies was down 0.7 percent, putting it on track for its biggest fall of 2019.  "The confrontation now has escalated into a testosterone battle between two leaders who believe they have a lot to prove to their constituents. But as this display of machismo lasts longer, there is a greater chance of a recession, not in the US, but globally, "said Bernard Baumohl of the New York-based Economic Outlook Group.Sweater.  Beijing said that to 2 thousand 493 articles from the United States will register an increase of tariffs up to 25 percent from June 1. Among them, liquefied natural gas, agricultural products such as natural honey; compounds such as potassium sulfate, which are commonly used in fertilizers; and various manufacturing products such as LED spotlights.  In two other lists of one thousand 78 and 974 articles, tariffs will increase to 20 and 10 percent, respectively. These lists include many household products, such as toothpaste and chlorine, along with many types of clothing, equipment related to manufacturing, as well as swimming equipment for men and machinery that makes shoes.  A smaller list of 595 items will not register an increase beyond the current 5 percent level. Among these items are chemical products and industrial materials such as formaldehyde and lithium. Electronic and motorized devices, such as marches for aircraft, airplane and boat engines, and 3D printers also prevented an increase in tariffs.  "China sticks to its strategy of proportional and measured retaliation against US tariffs. The Chinese government's message is clear, it wants a resolution of the trade dispute and is willing to make concessions, but it will not shy away from a confrontation if that is the path chosen by Trump, "said Eswar Prasad, professor of international trade at the Cornell University.  With information from Don Weinland, James Politi, Joe Rennison, Richard Henderson, Pan Kwan Yuk and Nicolle Liu. Load-Date: May 14, 2019End of Document

Huawei: Trojan horse in the living room of your houseCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 29, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1448 wordsBody        Trump's accusations against Huawei could be a mere protectionist pretext. (Photo: EFE)  The "stay still" of the Trump administration against Huawei has been a tough lie against the idea of the "unstoppable" Chinese ascent, supposedly and irremediably supposed to unseat the current supremacy of the United States. It will not be like that, apparently for quite some time.  In this regard, remember that last week, with the argument of defending national security and the alleged use of spyware by Huawei to send critical data of its users to the Chinese government, the Trump administration vetoed American companies the purchase and sale of components of Huawei, a decision whose enormous impact began to be seen after the resolution of Google to cut its commercial relations with the Chinese company.  Google's initiative calls into question the viability of the company, the second largest manufacturer of cell phones in the world and the largest telecommunications company. Huawei has 180,000 employees and reaches "more than a third of the world's population" with its products, according to its website. According to the researcher Counterpoint, 17% of smartphones in the world are Huawei, only surpassed by Samsung (21%) and above Apple (12%).  Google will no longer provide Android updates or give access to its Play Store application store to the future terminals of the Chinese brand, nor will it allow the installation of such popular platforms as Gmail, Google Maps or YouTube. In addition, immediately to the blockade were joined by numerous US companies and other countries: from processor manufacturers, such as ARM, Qualcomm and Intel, to operators such as Vodafone or the Japanese NTT Docomo, Softbank and KDDI. This puts even more into question Huawei, because many of the components of their smartphones were designed on the platforms of these providers.  Now, are there any grounds to think that Huawei is a real danger to the security of the information of its users? Trump did not present a single test to support his position. In that sense, would you believe Trump just because he says so? In principle, there is a well-founded fear that the Chinese dictatorial government will force companies to have access to industrial secrets, user data and other confidential information. Recall only that China was involved for many years in many types of espionage, including cybernetics, intellectual property theft and industrial sabotage. Additionally, and for greater seriousness, the most recent Chinese laws, fundamentally the law of security of the State, force the Chinese organizations to collaborate in the national intelligence efforts.  On the other hand, the prevention against Huawei is not limited to the United States. The list of countries that have banned their technology under the same or similar assumptions is long: New Zealand, Australia, England (with restrictions), Canada, Belgium, Czech Republic, and has been put under evaluation in Germany and Japan, South Korea. In this regard, there is an undeniable concern about the participation of Chinese technology companies in security matters, specifically against Huawei.  Additionally, the accusations against Huawei for espionage are not new. Just last January an employee of his was arrested and charged in Poland in a case of industrial espionage, or, let us recall the recent arrest in Canada of Meng Wanzhou (the executive director and heiress of the company) undervarious charges by the United States, such as banking, electronic fraud, espionage and commercial relations with Iran with an extradition process under way. Or the accusations against Huawei for the same charges now, but from the Obama administration. Or in another rank, the frustrated sale of Moneygram to Alibaba, due to the refusal of a Chinese company to access data from millions of US users.  Trump's accusations against Huawei could be false and be a mere protectionist pretext to prevent the Chinese brand from having total supremacy in 5G technology, something that China has dubbed the "new silk route" and that will fundamentally decide good part of our future and its connectivity. It would not be the first time that a US government lies blatantly. Remember only the alleged chemical weapons in Iraq.  Nobody in their right mind could put their hands on the fire by Huawei or claim strictly that their terminals are free of any "back door" enabled to spy. The fear that the Chinese 5G leave a back door open and put a Trojan horse in all the rooms of the world is more than justified and has a credible background. But at the end of the day, the Chinese dictatorship would not do anything that the government of Washington did not do in complicity with Silicon Valley, as Edward Snowden revealed to us with all the harshness.  In any case, those who today protest the Trump veto conveniently forget that China imposes tougher restrictions on American companies and there has never been a protest to reject them. Thus, companies such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and others from the United States and Europe (and even Asian countries such as Japan and South Korea) have the Chinese market forbidden. Those who today protest only for Huawei have a short memory or a blatantly political agenda.  China has no respect for intellectual property and environmental laws, low costs for almost slave labor and child labor. China is also the existence of concentration camps for brainwashing, "reeducation", repression and illegal internment of part of its population. It is a hard religious persecution. There are in that country, for example, 100,000 North Korean slave workers, more than in any other country, a contemporary slavery of uprooted and unprotected people who have nowhere to go, can not leave their work, can not say no to anything, and they are not paid for it. Thus, if someone does not respect the rules of the free market are China and its companies, today alleged champions of "free competition" for some sectors.  China and the United States today are hostage to the free market, globalization and technological innovation. In any case, everything could point, as Steve Bannon suggests, to a strategy to force the Chinese government to carry out some liberalizing reforms in its economic system. In that scenario, Huawei may just be an incidental victim of his own success, but not the only one. It remains to be seen, in that sense, the Chinese response, which could be very hard too. But the truth so far and in the end is that in the hands of Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, free trade, globalization and technological innovation begin to be less themselves and more mere bureaucratic efforts at the hands of dishonest, unscrupulous politicians and ambitious.  .TF_1.ob-strip-layout .ob-widget-header {width: 100%; color: #ffffff; background: # 008ec5; padding: 6px 0px 2px 6px; font-family: \ 'notosans \', \ 'Arial \', \ 'Helvetica \', \ 'sans-serif \'; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 5px; border-bottom: 3px solid #ddd; font-size: 18px; text-transform: uppercase; background: # 003a5b! important; border-color: #bbbbbb;margin-top: 20px;}.

Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the Button on the East Coast.Coming up, my exclusive one on one interview with President Trump. The President will be headed to Japan today for the G-20 meeting and his important sideline meeting with president Xi Jinping of China. In the 8:00 a.m. Hour, before departing, I'll talk with President Trump exclusively about trade, Huawei, Iran, the border crisis, Mueller's upcoming testimony, and the Democratic debates which begin tonight. That's President Trump live this morning in the 8:00 a.m. hour. Join us.Markets are rallying today, trading higher on renewed optimism over a U.S.- China trade deal going into the meeting between President Trump and President Xi. This following yesterday's selloff meanwhile.It was the worst day for the month for the markets yesterday. the Dow Industrials were down 180 points, two-thirds of 1 percent. And losses accelerated throughout the day after comments from Fed chair Jay Powell. He said the Fed will take a wait and see approach to cutting interest rates. With that, markets tumbled. Nasdaq was down 121 points, 1.5 percent.This morning, a bit of a bounce in Europe. It's fractional, however. Take a look. FT 100 is up 4 points, CAC 40 is up 2.5, and the DAX index in Germany is up by 48 points.Markets were mixed overnight meanwhile in Asia following the selloff on Wall Street with Japan down half a percent, that was the worst performer actually.Trouble in the Dominican Republic once again, a teenage tourist falls into a coma while on vacation.

Why her latest fashion line is getting her into some trouble. We'll tell you all about it.All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning and joining me to break it all down Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; the American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp; and the "Wall Street Journal's" wealth management reporter, the host of the podcast "Secrets of Wealthy Women", Veronica Dagher is here. Good to see you.VERONICA DAGHER, WEALTH MANAGEMENT REPORTER, "WALL STREET JOURNAL": Great to be here.BARTIROMO: Great show so far -- guys.DAGHER: For sure. Yes, I'm really interested to hear what we're going to hear out of the G-20 at the end of this week. I think so much of the market is focused on that, want to see if there's going to be any news. It sounds like they're getting closer to some sort of agreement potentially. I think so much of investors are just waiting to see.BARTIROMO: Well, the Chinese have been bulking up in terms of their military, they're pumping out submarines left and right. And the want to replace the U.S. as the number one super power. So there's that.MATT SCHLAPP, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION: Yes. Pretty important problem which is you have economics and national security all interwoven. This is not just a question about what's happening in the domestic economy. It's a question about these problems around the globe. Who is going to be in charge? I would rather it be us.BARTIROMO: Well, somebody says here the other day, the U.S. Has a duty to stop China. And after I started thinking about it, I thought, you know what, I think I agree with that. The U.S. has a duty to stop China because you don't want a communist country the dominant player in the world.SCHLAPP:: Right. And look, this is happening in all kinds of pernicious ways. Look at our busses, look at our trains. Chinese -- basically subsidiaries controlled by the government -- are buying our infrastructure left and right. Does that make sense?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Well we take power away from China by not borrowing so much debt as a nation and not needing to rely on them to be a willing purchaser of our treasury securities.BARTIROMO: That's a scary thing.SCHLAPP:: Well, if we elect a socialist, that's going to get worse.If we elect a socialist that gets worse, more spending.MCDOWELL: OH, no, no, no, no, no. They're going to get the Federal Reserve to buy all the debt. We're going to monetize the debt because they bail the banks out. That's what they're going to do.SCHLAPP:: Ok.MCDOWELL: I'm being sarcastic. But that's the idea. That is the kind of emerging idea among these socialists of the Democratic Party.BARTIROMO: Hey, are you surprised that Elizabeth Warren is where she is -- Dagen. I mean she is among the leadership on the Dem right now.MCDOWELL: No, she's had some naturally organic things happen on Twitter where, you know, she's got a plan for that. Like where she offered to find one of her supporter of boyfriend --(CROSSTALKING)MCDOWELL: -- and it was little things. But she's actually on the ground. She has got great political skills -- I will say that for her. Her ideas are -- I don't know -- Leninesque.BARTIROMO: But there's the confiscation idea --(CROSSTALKING)BARTIROMO: There's the confiscation idea, right. That's the wealth tax.MCDOWELL: Right.SCHLAPP:: that's right.MCDOWELL: Let's go back to the dawn of the Soviet Union for these policy ideas.BARTIROMO: Yes.We've got a big show coming up this morning.Joining us this morning -- my exclusive interview with President Trump in the 8:00 a.m. hour. Don't miss it. We're going to talk a lot about what you just heard here with the President coming up this morning in about an hour.The President just tweeted on the border and the Democrats actually. And here's what the President just said. "Too bad the Dems in Congress won't do anything at all about border security. They want open borders which means crime but we are getting it done including building the wall. More people than ever before are coming because the U.S.A. economy is so good. The best in history." Writes the President this morning.Our top story this hour is "Gearing up for the G-20". The President is leaving today for the G-20 summit in Japan where he will meet face to face with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday among other leaders.Investors are watching this very high stakes meeting obviously The outcome could weigh heavily on markets and the global outlook as the world's two largest economies work to end an ongoing trade feud. The meeting comes amid signs of slowing Chinese consumer spending and a weakening Chinese economy.Joining me right now in a "Fox Business Exclusive" is Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross. Mr. Secretary -- it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining me.WILBUR ROSS, U.S. SECRETARY OF COMMERCE: Thank you for having me on -- Maria.BARTIROMO: So first let's talk China for a moment. Can the President accept a deal if the Chinese refuse to stop stealing intellectual property and forcing transfers of technology.ROSS: Well, As you know, there are several components that we've always had to the negotiations. The easy part is just solving to some degree the present deficit -- more soybeans, more LNG -- stuff like that.The second part, which is harder, is the structural reforms that you mentioned, -- property respect, not forced technology transfers, equal market access, things of that sort.And then the third bucket is the hardest one of all, which is enforcement and punishment in the event that there's a failure to live up to the structural reforms.BARTIROMO: Where would you say we are in terms of a deal? Are we closer than we ever have been or farther?ROSS: Well, you never have a deal on anything until you have a deal on everything.BARTIROMO: ok.ROSS: We got very, very far before the talks broke off but then there was retrograde motion by the Chinese. So hopefully they'll get back to where they were before they had a second thought and then we can go forward from there and close the remaining gaps.BARTIROMO: Mr. Secretary -- we're going to have an official from Huawei on the show tomorrow, actually. And I want to get your take on Huawei. You've got the Huawei black list, the U.S. ban taking a toll on certain American technology companies as well.Some now finding ways to resume business with Huawei, despite the ban and despite all the commentary about Huawei being a national security risk from this administration. The world's largest chip makers like Micron, Qualcomm, Intel restarting shipments to Huawei in ways that are still compliant with the Commerce Department restrictions. What's your reaction to that?ROSS: Well, there's always some marginal activity around the edges, relocating production from here to there, things of that sort. But the fundamental situation remains. We do have very severe national security concerns about Huawei. And we intend to use the proper measures to enforce the matters that have been put to rest.So we'll see how people are doing and we'll see what the outcome is. I don't think it's quite as simple as some of the stories.Huawei has been waging a huge PR campaign on the one hand saying oh, we are ok, everything is fine. And on the other hand saying there will be dire consequences.BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, what about FedEx? FedEx, of course, is suing the Commerce Department over the restrictions on Huawei following the recent shipping errors involving Huawei packages.We just heard from the CEO, Fred Smith, he was on Fox just the other day. I want to play this sound bite for you and get your reaction. Here's Fred Smith on "SPECIAL REPORT" last week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FRED SMITH, CEO, FEDEX: The increasing use of restrictions on exports and imports by the Commerce Department in various geopolitical and trade disputes creates just an impossible burden on FedEx and common carriers, because under the Department of commerce's regulations, we are expected to be policemen for these export and import controls.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: What about this lawsuit -- Secretary?ROSS: Yes. I have a great deal of respect for Fred, but he frankly is misinterpreting the regulations. What the regulations simply say is that neither FedEx nor any other common carrier can knowingly carry goods that are in violation of the rules -- knowingly. That means they have to know that they are in violation.We're not asking Fred or anyone else to be a policeman. We're just asking them not to conspire with people to avoid the things. So we look forward to dealing with that matter in the litigation. I think it's unfortunate that he has misinterpreted the rules. The courts will not misinterpret.BARTIROMO: Yes. But Secretary -- how are they supposed to know? I mean these are packages, right?ROSS: They don't have to know. They have to not know that it's a violation. The regulation says you cannot knowingly ship it. They do have mechanisms for trying to understand and they use -- remember, this is not new. There are over a hundred entities that are on the list.So it isn't as though this suddenly came out of the blue with Huawei. These processes have been going on for years. FedEx has pretty well complied with them over the years. I think this is a tempest in a tea pot.BARTIROMO: So when are you expecting this to go to the courts then? What's the timing on this?ROSS: Well, we already went to court the day that he appeared on you, on Fox, he filed it about the same time with the court.BARTIROMO: Ok.ROSS: And he gave me a wake-up call, a heads-up call just before he filed. And I tried to explain to him that he was misinterpreting the regulation but they went ahead and filed. So this will get itself dealt with.BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, Secretary -- we just got news from Reuters that hackers working for China's Ministry of State Security broke into networks of eight of the world's biggest technology service providers. There was an effort to steal commercial secrets from their clients, according to sources familiar with these attacks.So here you have a meeting that's set, that the President is going to meet with President Xi Jinping at the G-20 on Saturday. And before this meeting you've got Chinese hackers directed by the Chinese government to get into these global telecom companies. Your reaction?ROSS: Well, I'm going to be at the G-20. In fact I'm leaving with everybody else in a couple hours to go there. It's not surprising timing. I think they're probably just trying to send us a message of their capabilities. But it certainly does not alleviate the very legitimate national security concerns that we have about Huawei and about other entities over there.BARTIROMO: What's the biggest national security risk -- Secretary? I understand that there are back doors. For example, just recently we heard from Vodaphone. The Vodaphone infrastructure includes Huawei infrastructure in Italy and an executive at Vodaphone noticed there was a back door in that infrastructure where all the data going through Vodaphone went back to the Chinese government.So can you in a practical way explain to our viewers what specifically is the national security risk around Huawei?ROSS: Well, the national security risk in concept is several things. One is invasion of phone conversations. Second would be disrupting them. Third would be taking other actions that paralyze whole systems. With the advent of 5G, which is really the big concern, everything is interrelated.Think about what the world would be like if you knocked out GPS, if you knocked out telecommunications all together.BARTIROMO: And the Chinese have the ability to do that, given that it's a Huawei, Chinese company. Real quick -- yes, go ahead, Secretary.ROSS: There's the danger. There's the danger of it. And because 5G is so software-driven, this artificial notion that you can segregate one part from another leaves us very, very skeptical.BARTIROMO: Secretary -- real quick, what would be a victory for the U.S. coming out of the G-20 meeting with President Xi Jinping?ROSS: Well, we're not looking for a victory. What we're looking for is a sensible deal that addresses the legitimate issues that we have. This is not a thing where one company is going to be pinned to the floor and knocked out. That's not the idea.The idea is, there are inappropriate activities underway by the Chinese. They must cease. If they do, and if we make some redressing of the trade imbalance, then that's a reasonable deal for both parties.So this is not a try to pin someone to the mat thing. This is to try to address some legitimate problems.BARTIROMO: And what if they don't agree to any of that?ROSS: Well, if they don't, they don't. The President has made it very clear that he's happy to go the alternate route if he has to. The alternate route of tariffs is not a bluff.BARTIROMO: Right. All right. Secretary -- it's good to see you this morning. Thanks very much. Safe travels.ROSS: Thank you very much.BARTIROMO: Wilbur Ross.Stay with me for my exclusive interview with President Trump coming up at 8:00 a.m. Eastern this morning.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.President Trump is tweeting again this morning on the border. He says this. "Democrats want open borders which equals violent crime, drugs and human trafficking. They also want very high taxes like 90 percent Republicans want what's good for America, the exact opposite." Writes the President.This ahead of the first of the 2020 debates tonight. The Democratic primary debate tonight.Another tourist meanwhile falling ill in the Dominican Republic.Cheryl Casone with the details here. And Cheryl -- what? This is an incredible story.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: It's a sad story -- Maria. 15-year-Candela Ciccone fell into a coma just before she was about to head home to Argentina. The doctors there believe that she has a life threatening diabetes condition even though her family says she has no history of diabetes. At least 12 Americans have died in the Dominican Republic under mysterious conditions.Well, Delta airlines is now allowing passengers that want to cancel or change their flight schedule to the Dominican Republic, they can do that now for free. Flight cancellations to the Caribbean nation have jumped 45 percent in the last few weeks. That's according to flight data company. Bookings have dropped, we should say, nearly 60 percent.All right. Audi is recalling more than 20,000 Q3 SUVs for turn signal issues. The affected vehicles the 2016 to 2018 model years. Audi says a software update will fix that problem.Well, the Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into the chicken industry. Top poultry producers are being accused of colluding to keep prices high. The investigation includes Tyson Foods, Pilgrim's Pride, Sanderson Farms and Purdue Farms.All of these companies denying the accusations but shares of these companies actually fell pretty sharply when that news came out -- Maria.Those are your headlines.BARTIROMO: All right. Cheryl -- thank you.Coming up, tackling the drug crisis. My next guest discusses how his company's partnership with Google is tackling the opioid epidemic.Then Kardashian controversy. Kim Kardashian is facing backlash across the world today over the name of her new shapewear line, her critics, ahead.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.The opioid crisis, Alexandria Real Estate teaming up with Google to build a new way and place to fight the drug epidemic in America -- part of the campus is already open. The whole facility expected to be finished next year.Joining us right now is Alexandria Real Estate executive chairman and founder, Joel Marcus. Joel -- it's great to see you again.JOEL MARCUS, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE: Great pleasure -- Maria. Happy to be here.BARTIROMO: Why was this so important to you to be a part of this partnership?MARCUS: Well, as you know, we deal with campuses and building clusters to try to create innovative solutions to some of life's most challenging diseases.And over the past couple years we have studied and looked at the opioid crisis and it is probably the health crisis of our lifetime, much like AIDS was several decades ago. 115 people are dying every day, more than cumulatively have died in the Vietnam War. So we had to act.BARTIROMO: Tell us about the campus.MARCUS: So we studied with Google actually Verily, which is their subsidiary a couple of years ago and thought about trying to create a holistic campus where you could have from intake to detoxification, sober living, family reunification, job training and then ultimately job placement in a safe and secure environment.And we chose Dayton, Ohio because Dayton was in fact the patent capital of the world, the Wright Brothers were there. it had a long history of success but fell in with internationalization and the technology revolution, lost about two-thirds of its population and fell in to become really the center of the opioid crisis in America but they've actually done an amazing job over the last couple of years in reducing the deaths per capita.BARTIROMO: Wow.DAGHER: How many jobs in the community is this creating because it sounds like it's a very big campus.MARCUS: Well, it's about a 60,000 square foot campus that's in process. We have an outpatient piece now that we just opened about a week ago. Rob Portman was there -- Senator Portman. The goal though is really to create this safe environment and use it as a model for other communities.It's not so much about job placement. It's really about can we create a detoxification and a living situation that will help people permanently get off of the opioid situation. Because the amount of recidivism, the rate of recidivism after a 28-day treatment, you're put back on the street, is like 99 percent. It's just an awful statistic.SCHLAPP: What's interesting is you're intertwining this idea of drug addiction with economic opportunity, kind of a malaise. It takes both. Someone has to feel hope, right. Get off drugs, I feel like I can take care of my family obligations.MARCUS: Yes. Yes. I mean we always look at it as if you can revitalize a person, that's great philanthropy and good. And if you can help revitalize a community by putting people back into the workforce, that's got to be great business.So that's kind of how we thought about it.MCDOWELL: Joel -- what research did you rely on, basically related to preventing recidivism for opioid addictions that this is kind of environment that would deliver the best results.MARCUS: Yes. So we are focused on the infrastructure side and Verily obviously being an Alphabet or Google subsidiary, is really at the forefront of using data to try to create this.As you know, you could treat cancer patients all the same or you could treat them very specifically based on their own DNA and their own situation. So that's the meaning of targeted therapies. Everybody's tumor or blood cancer is different.Same thing in opioid crisis. There have been some famous -- there's a famous book and movie, "Beautiful Boy", which talked about the Chef (ph) family and the child was in -- started drugs at 11 years old. I think marijuana. And went into hard drugs. And only when they found that the underlying reason was for some of the addiction issues was bipolar disorder and depression were they able to treat that and then make success happen.MCDOWELL: I read that book.MARCUS: So it's a remarkable kind of situation. So we think a data-driven solution will be the key to success. Nobody knows yet because nobody's been successful really.BARTIROMO: Joel before you go, real quick on real estate, what are you seeing right now?MARCUS: Of course. Well, we've been fortunate. Our stock is up almost 25 percent since I saw you in early January.BARTIROMO: Every time I see you it's like it's up 60 percent since the last time I saw you. That's another 25 percent.MARCUS: So the demand still remains white hot in the great centers of innovation -- Cambridge, San Francisco, Seattle, San Diego and New York City and so forth. I think if you just think about 10,000 diseases, 500 addressable therapies, we're still in the early innings of trying to figure out disease and now we have the prospects of real cures.BARTIROMO: But the growth in tenants, technology, health sciences.MARCUS: And AG tech now.BARTIROMO: And AG tech.MARCUS: Yes. Our three fly wheels so-to-speak.BARTIROMO: Great to have you -- Joel.MARCUS: Great pleasure -- always. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Joel Marcus -- there.Coming up, taking the stage, the first 2020 Democratic debate is tonight. Who is taking questions first -- we're going to get into it when we come back.And then America's favorite fast food, McDonald's, Burger King and KFC, step aside. The big winner coming up. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, June 26th. Your top stories right now, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.My exclusive one on one interview coming up with President Trump. The president will be headed to Japan today for the G20 meeting and his important sideline meeting with President Xi Jinping of China. In the 8:00 a.m. hour before he leaves, I'll talk with the president exclusively about trade, Huawei, Iran, the border crisis and Mueller's testimony and as well the Democratic debates which begun tonight and tomorrow. That's President Trump live in the next hour. Join us, coming up.Markets are rallying this morning on hopes of a trade deal as we near the G20 meeting. The Dow Jones Industrial Average right now up 103 points, the S&P Futures are up 11-1/2 and the NASDAQ Futures higher by 48-1/4.Yesterday meanwhile was the worst day of the month for the markets. Boeing, Microsoft, Apple all accounting for half of the Dow's losses, and it was down 179 points yesterday. The S&P was down 27, and the NASDAQ was down 121 points, partly on comments from Jay Powell, chairman of the Fed who said they're going to wait and watch and take your time on interest rate cuts.In Europe this morning, markets are fractionally moving, take a look, FT- 100's barely in positive territory, up about a point. The CAC Quarante in Paris is up four points and the DAX Index in Germany is up 43.Markets were mixed overnight in Asia following the selloff on Wall Street. As you see there, fractional moves pretty much across the board.China hacking accusations, hackers working for China broke into networks of eight of the world's largest telecom service providers to steal commercial secrets according to Reuters.Plus, backlash from across the world, why Kim Kardashian's latest fashion line is getting her into some trouble over a trademark.All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning, but first, our top story this half an hour, 2020 vision, 10 Democrats are facing off tonight in Miami in the first debate of the 2020 election cycle. Tonight's candidates include Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Beto O'Rourke and Bill de Blasio. Tomorrow night, we've got frontrunner Joe Biden going head to head with Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg among others. Tonight's debates come as special counsel Robert Mueller has agreed now to testify in front of the House Judiciary Committee and the House Intel Committee on July 17th. The president took to Twitter last night, reacting to it. Saying, presidential harassment.Joining us right now is former Pennsylvania governor and former DNC chairman, Ed Rendell. Mr. Chairman, good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us this morning.ED RENDELL, FORMER GOVERNOR, PENNSYLVANIA: Good morning, Maria.BARTIROMO: What are you expecting out of these debates?RENDELL: Well, this debate tonight, just by the luck of the draw, four of the five leading candidates in the polls are in tomorrow night's debates. But this is a big opportunity for Elizabeth Warren. She's been creeping up on Bernie Sanders to sort of get the leadership of the progressive lane and she's going to have the attention focused on her.If she does well tonight, if she delineates some specific proposals, I think she'll have a chance to really jump up. For the others, for the Beto O'Rourkes, for the Amy Klobuchars, for the Jay Inslees, this is an opportunity to introduce themselves to the American people. And people say, well, they're all two percent or one percent, what chance do they have?Remember, this time in 2012, Rick Santorum was at no percent and he wound up winning Iowa and almost winning the Republican nomination. So, you can't count anybody out.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's pretty incredible that you're -- we're talking about socialism practices and programs and actually debating them. Don't you think, governor? I mean, are you surprised to see Elizabeth Warren having the success that she's had, begin her socialist programs, like, I don't know, confiscation, a wealth tax, Medicare for All from Bernie Sanders? Do you think one of these guys, the real far left progressives are actually going to be the candidate?RENDELL: No, I don't. I think in the end the majority of Democrats are focused on one thing. We want a candidate who can win. And I think the problem for Sanders and Warren is the programs that are -- have good (INAUDIBLE) goals but the question is, how do we pay for them? Do they set up what the American people would be scared to hear, socialism.Remember, the two biggest socialism projects we have in the United States are Medicare and Social Security. The two most popular government programs. But still, Americans are scared when you use the label. The president is very adept at deflecting attention under his opponents and calling them names that stick.So you know, I think it's going to be trouble for Warren or Sanders if they become our nominee, not impossible to win but much more easy for Trump to attack.MCDOWELL: Governor, it's Dagen McDowell, do any of these candidates push back on the socialist ideas from an Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders? Because you mentioned Medicare, and I keep saying this, Medicare's hospital insurance fund runs out of money in seven years. And this is according to the Trustees Report, and only then it will be able to pay out $0.89 on the dollar through the tax revenue that comes in. They don't talk about that. They want more government. They want a bigger social safety net when the government as exist today is doing a poor job running it.RENDELL: Well, you can debate that point. Medicare has about a two percent administrative overhead. Most private insurance companies have 10, 11 percent overhead. But --MCDOWELL: But if it's running out of money, if the hospital insurance fund is going to run out of money in seven years and not one person in Washington D.C. is doing anything about it, that's a problem.RENDELL: Well, we have rural hospitals are on the brink of closing until the affordable care act passed. That's kept rural hospitals and lesser known hospitals alive in the country. So, look, these are big issues. And we've got to be able to propose solutions that are affordable. And I think that's what's going to be the focus tonight. Can the programs you talk about, can they be implemented, can we afford them, who's going to pay for them? Those are the questions that I think our candidates have to answer.SCHLAPP: So, you get to this question, governor, about whether or not the Democrats are looking for a true believer, a candidate who literally tingles -- they get tingles up their legs, to quote someone we all know, or someone who can just beat the president. I hear different Democrats say they want different things. Sounds like you're more practical. You're saying all we really care about in the end is winning the election, it's not about the socialism that they're all seeming to hug.RENDELL: Well, look, there's very little difference (INAUDIBLE) you know, Bernie Sanders is for Medicare for All which would mean no private insurance companies. But other candidates like Joe Biden are for strengthening the affordable care act and maybe making Medicare available for people between 55 and 65 which would take some of the cost drivers out of the system. So the goals are pretty much similar. So what Democrats -- 70 percent of Democrats, their first priority is someone who can stand up to the president and win the election. And I think that's the important thing. And that's what people are going to highlight, I think, without any question.BARTIROMO: What about the battle at the border? Let's talk about standing up there, because the House passed a $4.5 billion funding bill yesterday to provide food, water and shelter for migrants entering the country at the southern border. The GOP-led Senate expected to take up its own version of this legislation this week. All coming as employees at Wayfair, you may have seen, they're planning a walk-out after the company declined to end bed sales to border facilities, governor.You know, this bill that the House passed does nothing in terms of stopping the apprehensions, does nothing in terms of reversing those loopholes like the Flores agreement and the asylum standards. What's your reaction to all of this?RENDELL: Well, look, we have a very serious short-term problem. The conditions the people, particularly children are held in at the border are unconscionable. And we have to that short-term problem. I think what the Democrats did was give the administration resources to have better treatment of the children who are kept in isolation.Remember, this wasn't a problem under President Obama because children within 72 hours were placed with some relatives that they had in the United States. So this is a short-term answer. It's not the long-term answer, Maria. The questions that you raised have to be addressed in a more comprehensive way. (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: Yes, we're showing -- we're showing video.RENDELL: We have an emergency problem at the border.BARTIROMO: We're showing video right now of me at the border and I met all these children, because obviously the children -- the number of children crossing has been soaring. The question is, are they really with their real parents? Because there's this renting of kids program going on in Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador where women are getting money to give their kids to other people so that they can come over the border and look like families.RENDELL: Well, most of them have to have relatives in the United States to be placed.BARTIROMO: Well, I don't know that to be true, governor. I don't know that to be true, governor, actually. Because these kids are being rented.RENDELL: Well, that's wrong.BARTIROMO: They're being rented to come over to -- these kids are being put into incredible situations, so isn't it more of an important issue to tackle these people coming over the border, to change those loopholes?RENDELL: The whole immigration process should be looked at but this is not the time to do it. When we have kids walking around without diapers, without basic sanitary conditions, in places that no human being should be. That problem has to be addressed first.BARTIROMO: Yes and that's why the Border Patrol -- that's why the Border Patrol officers, governor, the Border Patrol officers are acting like nurses, right? They're taking the kids, they're taking them to the hospital, they're helping the kids with colds and all this stuff. They're having to leave their post at the border to go do other stuff to take care of these kids because they're sick, because they've been hitchhiking in on their feet for four months, coming, walking toward the border. Shouldn't we deal with that in terms of people coming to the border? I mean, do you not see that as a crisis, these asylum standards and the -- and the Flores agreement enabling people to just come with kids?RENDELL: The whole asylum process has to be looked at. But right now, we've had a humanitarian crisis which demands resources and that has to be dealt with and dealt with swiftly. We can't do this in two weeks. I think the president's idea of coming up with a solution in two weeks is unrealistic. We should solve the immediate problem right now.BARTIROMO: Yes, but this has been -- this has been an immediate problem for about a year, if not more, right? How come nothing's been done yet? I mean, seriously, it's pretty incredible that the two sides can't just get together to fix this.RENDELL: Well, I agree. The gridlock -- the gridlock --BARTIROMO: This is not a new problem in the last two weeks.RENDELL: The gridlock is embarrassing. But what's going on is worse. It's an international disgrace that the United States is keeping people in these conditions. There's no question about that. I mean --BARTIROMO: Well, what conditions? I was at the border. I spoke with the Border Patrol people and they said, they're questioning what we're talking about when we say these conditions. What conditions? I mean, the president asked the Democrats for money for more beds. They said we don't want any more beds. There's no more beds to happen. I mean, that's what the Democrat -- Nancy Pelosi said we're not giving any money for any more beds. So that's why the detention facilities are overwhelmed.RENDELL: The detention facilities are overwhelmed because we're having all these people trying to get into the country. And I think the policies of the administration have perpetrated that.When President Obama left office there were less people trying to get into the United States than any time in recent history. Now, all of a sudden, it's soared because of the idea that we're going to close the borders and there's going to be no chance to get in.Look, the people who come here under false pretenses should be booted out and booted out as quickly as possible. But the people who come here legitimately seeking asylum have the right under our constitution to have their cases heard. So we need more judges. We need faster processes. Those things are all --BARTIROMO: Yes, it all requires money and they're running out of money this month.RENDELL: It does.BARTIROMO: All right, governor, great to have you here. We love having you all the time. Ed Rendell, good to see you, sir. Thank you.I'll be speaking exclusively in the next hour with President Trump that is in the 8:00 a.m. hour. He will weigh in on all of this. So don't miss my important interview coming up with the president at 8:00. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Chinese hackers reportedly breaking into eight major computer services company. Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now, Cheryl.CASONE: That's right, Maria. Reuters reports the hackers got into the networks of some of the world's biggest technology service providers in order to steal commercial secrets from their clients. The companies include Fujitsu, Computer Sciences Corporation and DEC Technology which we should add, was spawn off from Hewlett Packard Enterprise.Well, Chipotle rewards, the chain announcing a bonus program for hourly employees. Chipotle giving them a boost each quarter equal to one week's pay, meaning they could make an extra month's pay every year. Shares of Chipotle up about 70 percent so far this year.McDonald's, KFC, take a seat, Chick-fil-A, once again America's favorite restaurant, fast food chain, topping the American customer satisfaction index for the fourth year in a row, Chick-fil-A now the third largest restaurant chain in the U.S. by sales of $10 billion.And there is this, Kim Kardashian has launched her own shapewear line. The name is causing backlash, Kimono Solutionwear. Twitter users criticizing her for being insensitive to the Japanese, you know, the culture of the people, because they've been wearing Kimonos for centuries. She's filed a trade mark for the name, Kimono. The reality star says she's been developing the underwear line for years. She's by the way, Maria, she filed a trademark for the name Kimono. That means she think she can own that one. Not for sure.MCDOWELL: Not Kimono.CASONE: Kind of been around for centuries, but all right.BARTIROMO: Wow.MCDOWELL: It's not Kimono, it's Kim, oh, no.BARTIROMO: Kim, oh, no.MCDOWELL: Put a dash in it Kardashian. Kim, oh, no.BARTIROMO: That is great. It's hilarious. Oh, God. What do you think about that? Send us a tweet.Coming up, protecting your children, what some are doing to remove harmful content from YouTube. We've got that on the other side of this break. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Watchdog groups are going after YouTube, petitioning the FTC to remove all YouTube content directed at children and level billions in fines at the streaming giant. The move follows claims that YouTube violated privacy requirements for data collection on children.Joining us now, the cyber guy, Kurt Knutsson joining us in L.A. with more on that. Good morning, Kurt.KURT KNUTSSON, THE CYBER GUY: Hi, Maria, Good morning to you. $42,530 per violation is what they're after from Facebook and this one. I'm sorry, not Facebook but YouTube. Alphabet under fire here, not only from these two groups but Senator Ed Markey firing off a letter to the FTC mainly getting a head start on what is expected to be results of an investigation on YouTube that they are indeed capturing data for children that are 13 or under 13 years which is what COPPA or the Children's Online Protection Privacy Act says they cannot do.These advocacy groups so Maria, are saying that they hold now 25 million records of children inside the Google database, YouTube and Google obviously pair companies and children companies of Alphabet. And at this point, well, the FTC can either ignore this letter, this guidance from these groups or they could use it as perhaps a road map of what they might actually do against the big video giant YouTube.BARTIROMO: So, I wonder if they're going to respond, what the response has been. Dagen, what do you think about this? You've talked about this a lot in terms of the content on YouTube.MCDOWELL: I think that there's a great deal more that all of these social media companies and these online content providers can do to police -- really police the bad actors and not avoid getting in the way of free speech.Again, it was like a few years ago during the rise of ISIS that you had the head of YouTube (INAUDIBLE) on where you just were bragging about how they were policing the content and they were basically videos of ISIS murdering people all over YouTube.BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.MCDOWELL: So if you can police, say, child pornography which they're required to do by law, they can certainly police some of the really hideous content.BARTIROMO: You would think so, Kurt. What are they saying about it?KNUTSSON: Well, what they're saying is they're hiding actually behind a lot of their terms of use language legally which says, we're not here for kids. This platform is not for kids.However, if you look at particular channels of information on YouTube, such as Toy Review Blogs that are, you know, up to 18 million followers inside of YouTube on some of these channels. Well, I mean, how is that not for kids?So, at this point I think they've got a tough argument and they've got the court of public opinion coming up against them and the FTC about to do something about it.BARTIROMO: For sure. Kurt, thank you. We'll be watching. Kurt Knutsson, joining us there.Still ahead, my exclusive interview with President Trump moments from now, next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA. He'll join us at 8:15 this morning. Stay with us.Load-Date: June 26, 2019End of Document

The bid with the US, the common axis between Putin and Xi JinpingCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 6, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 791 wordsBody In a meeting in which they showed good harmony, the presidents of Russia and China promised to strengthen their cooperation.  They agree to counter protectionism and Trump's unilateral approaches.  The presidents of Russia and China, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, promise to further strengthen the growing cooperation between the two countries, during a meeting held yesterday in the Kremlin, at times of tensions shared with the United States in trade and in almost all fronts of the world political arena.  After lavishing praise on each other and the ties of their countries, the leaders attacked the United States in a statement in which they expressed their intention to counter certain Washington trade policies and their rejection of the position of the government of President Donald Trump. regarding Venezuela and Iran.  "The parties intend to counteract the imposition of unfounded restrictions on access to markets for IT products with the excuse of guaranteeing national security, as well as the export of high technology products," the joint statement issued to the end of negotiations.  Thus the Russian and Chinese leaders reacted to the decision of the Donald Trump administration to veto the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, among other reasons, for accusations of industrial espionage and for being an "instrument" of the Chinese government.  For years, China and Russia increasingly question the global order led by the United States that followed World War II. "Protectionism and unilateral approaches are on the rise, and a policy of force and hegemony is increasingly in vogue," the Chinese president said, referring to tariffs by CNN.  On his eighth visit to Russia since he came to power, in 2012, Xi called Putin a "great friend" and said that both met more than 30 times in the past six years. "We decided that we will raise our bilateral relations to a higher level and that we will take our links to a new era," said Xi, sitting next to Putin in a Kremlin hall.  Against the USA  Russia's relations with the United States declined due to the Ukraine crisis, the war in Syria and accusations of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election, while China is engaged in a trade war with the United States.  The Russian leader emphasized that Moscow and Beijing have the same vision on many global issues, and in particular, mentioned their shared opposition to the US withdrawal from the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), a pact signed during the Cold War. considered a mainstay in the control of weapons.  Meanwhile, both leaders reiterated their rejection of a military intervention in Venezuela and called for an inclusive political dialogue between President Nicolás Maduro and the head of the National Assembly, Juan Guaidó.  Mexico-USA  The United States has another open front. Yesterday, in Washington, negotiations between Vice President Michael Pence and Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard began to resolve a dispute originated when Trump ordered a 5 percent tariff on products from the Aztec country if it did not curb the flow of illegal immigrants.  The Mexican offensive, the largest delegation of officials in the era of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, seeks to achieve a commitment to avoid that tax before it goes into effect on Monday.  "Mexico wants to reach an agreement. They sent their best people to try, "said Trump, in a clear sign of predisposition todialogue.  Trade tension will reduce world GDP  The tariff war between the US and China can subtract half a percentage point from the global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020, equivalent to the loss of some US $ 455,000 million, the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Christine Lagarde, warned yesterday. recently announced tariffs between the United States and China could subtract around 0.3 percent of world GDP by 2020, "he said. Lagarde attributed" more than half "of this impact to the effects on business confidence and the financial market. He added that, taking into account also the tariffs implemented last year, world GDP in 2020 could be reduced by 0.5 percent. In this way, the official pointed out the priority to resolve current trade tensions while progressing in the modernization of the international trading system. This includes the formation of consensus among countries on how to strengthen the rules of the World Trade Organization ( WTO), particularly in the case of subsidies, intellectual property and trade in services. The IMF studies suggest that the liberalization of trade in services would release some US $ 350 billion in the economy in the long term.

China rejects threats, tariffs as way to resolve trade warAssociated Press InternationalJune 20, 2019 Thursday 11:27 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 625 wordsDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - China warned Thursday that threats and tariffs will not resolve trade tensions between the two biggest economies and blasted Republican Sen. Marco Rubio for his criticism of technology giant Huawei over patents.Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said Thursday that its "core concern" over mutual respect has to be properly accommodated."If the US insists on taking unilateral trade measures against China, it will definitely bring serious impacts on the economy of itself and the welfare of its people," Gao said in a routine briefing.Trump and Xi are due to meet at a summit of the Group of 20 on June 28-29. It's unclear when the two countries' negotiating teams will resume detailed talks, which stalled in May when the U.S. accused China of reneging on earlier commitments.The talks are aimed at ending the dispute over trade and technology that has resulted in Trump imposing 25% tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese exports and considering expanding those tariffs to include another $300 billion of Chinese products.The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Huawei is asking U.S. phone carrier Verizon to pay licensing fees for more than 200 of its patents. While Huawei declined to comment on the matter, company spokesman Joe Kelly said it will hold a briefing later this month on being more aggressive about collecting intellectual property licensing fees.Rubio filed an amendment to the U.S. defense authorization bill this week that would prevent Huawei Technologies and other companies on security watch lists from pursuing damages in U.S. patent courts. That followed a move by Huawei to seek $1 billion in damages it says it is owed in unpaid patent licensing fees, reports said.A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman described Rubio's effort to block Huawei's lawsuit as "bizarre.""We know that someone in the U.S. leaves no stone unturned to smear and suppress other countries' enterprises, yet we did not expect that they would so blatantly manipulate the laws and rules," said the spokesman, Lu Kang."This not only damages the reputation and image of the U.S. but also harms its own companies in the long run."The U.S. has accused Chinese companies such as Huawei of committing forced technology transfers and stealing trade secrets. Last month, the U.S. placed Huawei on its "Entity List," which effectively bars American companies from selling components to Huawei without government approval.Washington claims Huawei poses a national security threat because it may be beholden to China's ruling Communist Party. But American officials have presented no evidence of any Huawei equipment serving as intentional conduits for espionage by Beijing. Huawei's placement on the Entity List is widely seen as intended to persuade resistant U.S. allies in Europe to exclude Huawei equipment from their next-generation wireless networks, known as 5G.Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei has denied that Huawei would share user data with the Chinese government if ordered to do so.On Monday during a panel discussion opened to the media he said there are no backdoors in Huawei's equipment that anyone could access, and that Huawei is willing to enter into a "no backdoor" agreement with any nation that wants one.Huawei brought a lawsuit in the U.S. this March challenging the constitutionality of a national security law which prevents the U.S. government and its contractors from using Huawei equipment. The complaint, filed in Plano, Texas, where Huawei's American operations are headquartered, alleges that the law singles out Huawei for punishment while denying the company due process.Ren said during the panel discussion that Huawei will not use its many patents as a "weapon," but did not rule out seeking royalties for usage.Load-Date: June 21, 2019End of Document

Eagle and Dragon II: Huawei and Battle for 5G MarketCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 22, 2019 SaturdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1048 wordsBody       The Chinese government will support Huawei – and the semiconductor industry – with all its power. (Image: Flickr)A white paper recently published by the Chinese government announces that it aspires to reach an agreement consistent with its "core interests" but will "never commit to matters of principle" as it is "not afraid" of a very costly trade war for both sides. It sounds like mere rhetoric, but it's not.Along side with the Chinese change of position in the May negotiations - explained in the last installment - Xi Jinping's publicized visit to a rare earth farm subtly warned Washington that Beijing would even bet on slowing chip production American, something that only the experts took note of. Unnecessary would be to warn that this would escalate censorship and repression by responding for the purposes of the trade war on its people. It is nothing for a political culture – intact in its authoritarianism – heir to Mao's crazed campaigns and genocidal famines. So the only thing at risk in China is Xi's credibility in terms of the overall strategy of his grand "china-made in China 2025" plan.The big "asymmetric" robberyThe problem for a reasonable agreement between China and the United States is the difference between what the parties consider reasonable:Beijing aims to maintain exchange rate manipulation, extreme protectionism of its domestic market, subsidies and privileges to mercantilist companies designated as "national champions" such as Huawei, which added to forced-to-cover transfer, industrial espionage on behalf of the State – together and for its protégés – and the brazen theft of technologies, in China, refer to a "asymmetrical" and "non-market" approach. This is key to Xi's grandiose China 2025 plan for China's new superpower.But this accelerated development strategy through the theft of technology, the conquest of developed markets for Chinese exports alongside the closure of the Chinese market to companies in those markets – except for limited quotas and with forced transfer and unlimited technology and management – it's what the Trump administration must neutralize one way or another. Washington can no longer turn a blind eye to Chinese mercantilism. It could afford to get China out of the misery of Maoist socialism by integrating it into the global market. Goals accomplished and far exceeded. It's already a competition for global hegemony. Washington risks too much without a bipartisan consensus on the issue. And the Chinese regime is trying to seize the window of opportunity of democratic weakness that only bipartisan consensuses neutralize.China's conservative wing clings to the "asymmetric strategy" because it would ensure they didn't give up an inch more in market reforms. The reformist wing also – although they would admit to reducing it partially and very slowly – because maintaining the abuse of concessions to underdeveloped economies in one that competes to control cutting-edge technology markets would ensure that developed countries outnumber in a few years. And the United States as the world's first economy. To submit to the same rules as the rest would be to give up what has worked for them. And they consider compatible with new reforms, limited and exclusively economic.huaweiFor Xi Jinping Huawei is the top "national champion" in China's global mercantilist expansion. Through Western human resources and technologies - a West that includes Japan andSouth – along with cheap labor and minimal environmental regulations in China – advantages in exchange for those that Western companies voluntarily and unintentionally delivered their technology and management to Chinese competitors, without gaining equivalent access to the Chinese market– the Chinese giant's products are as competitive – in quality, technological advancement and price – as to be a symbol of China's new superpower.That's why the regime is so committed to private Huawei as to arrest two Canadians on contrived espionage charges in retaliation for the arrest in Canada of a senior Huawei executive and daughter of the company's founder, in response to the request U.S. extradition on charges of national security-sensitive industrial espionage.The War for 5GThe Chinese government will support Huawei – and the semiconductor industry – with all its power. It trusts them to achieve a dominant global position in 5G technology. And controlling 5G would be to control the near technological future of the world. But Trump's executive order against Huawei seriously threatens Chinese telecoms giants. Western suppliers with immediately irreplaceable know-how are obliged to reject it. Google started. And British chip producer ARM Holdings followed, announcing that it will not license new products for Huawei. There will be others.With china's bid for a protracted trade war, Huawei would lose any chance of establishing itself in Western markets with 5 G technology. It would maintain expectations of expansion in much of Asia, Africa and Latin America. And the global 5G market would be split between the Western and the Chinese sphere. The battle between China and the West over politically sensitive technologies is served.The most unlikely scenario today is that Trump will surprise Osaka - or at another time in the near future - sneaking up on Beijing's aspirations. That would be something like Beijing's undetermined promises of approaching international rules - which Trump would present to his electorate as a great victory - in exchange for Washington's more or less covert and short-term promises of continuing to see elsewhere – that would strengthen Xi's position within the party. Even so would Huawei regain its previous access to Western markets to obtain key 5G components.Not only did Washington stand guard against China on sensitive technologies. Huawei will quickly lose involvement in Europe in smartphones and 5G. China will receive its own protectionist limitation medicine of its companies' participation in irreplaceable foreign markets. And the stakes to conquer underdeveloped markets from politically sensitive and radically anti-American bridgeheads will be revealed costly and fragile, something we will discuss in the third and final installment of this series about the Eagle and the Dragon.Load-Date: June 22, 2019End of Document

TWO MORE ETHNIC MONGOLIANS JAILED IN CHINA, WECHAT GROUPS DELETEDStates News ServiceApril 26, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 766 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Chinese authorities in the northern region of Inner Mongolia have detained two more group chat moderators on the social media platform WeChat after they took part in demonstrations in support of herding communities, a New York-based rights group said on Friday.Ethnic Mongolian herders Bai Xiurong and Altanbagan, were detained by riot police at the scene of a demonstration outside government offices in Urad Middle Banner on April 22, the Southern Mongolian Human Rights and Information Center (SMHRIC) said in a statement on its website.More than 100 herders from the banner, a county-like division, had gathered in front of the local government building to demand a meeting with Bu Xiaolin, chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, who was on a visit to the area, it said.Around a dozen people were detained, while Bai and Altanbagan were "thrown into SWAT vehicles" and each handed a 14-day administrative detention sentence, which is handed down by a police committee without the need for a trial."Bai Xiurong's sister was summoned yesterday ... She was forced to surrender Bai Xiurong's phone," SMHRIC quoted herder Tsetseg as saying in an audio message."The [police] accessed her phone and wiped out all the WeChat discussion groups she maintained," he said.Since Bai's arrest, her disabled elderly parents, who need constant care, have been left unattended, and her livestock have gone without food or water, SMHRIC said.Herders also traded information about the detentions on WeChat, in spite of the group chat shutdowns, it said."Some were released around midnight and the early morning of April 23 while [the rest of us] herders staged a sit-in outside the government building, demanding the immediate release of all arrested herders," an unidentified local herder said via the social media platform.Footage of the protest sent to SMHRIC showed hundreds of police arriving at the scene.One protester says in the video: "We are treated like animals. They rounded up us like fencing up livestock," he said. "Whoever comes to the government to express his or her opinion is arrested like this."Three writers detainedThe detentions come after authorities in the region detained three ethnic Mongolian writers for speaking out for their ethnic group in the face of action by Chinese government officials and companies.Tsogjil, 40, who hosted a number of discussion groups on the social media platform WeChat, was detained on April 16 in the regional capital Hohhot. He had been preparing to file an official complaint with the regional government on behalf of ethnic Mongolian herders in Heshigten Banner.O. Sechenbaatar, 68, was detained along with a herder named Baldan at a protest near Lake Dalainuur in the region's Heshigten Banner earlier this month. He has been placed under criminal detention on suspicion of "obstructing officials in the course of their duty," it said.Sechenbaatar had also hosted a number of WeChat groups to provide local Mongolian herders with a venue to discuss the pressing issues in their communities, including mining, environmental destruction, pollution, and herders' protests, SMHRIC said.Tsogjil had used one of his WeChat groups to rally herding communities to a protest outside the Heshigten Banner government, calling for Sechenbaatar's release.Both writers are being held at the Heshigten Banner Detention Center.Earlier this month, ethnic Mongolian author Lhamjab A. Borjigin, 75, stood trial on charges of "separatism" and "sabotaging national unity" at the Shiliinhot Municipal People's Court.For his book China's Cultural Revolution, published in 2006, Lhamjab gathered oral testimonies of survivors of violence against ethnic Mongolians during the Cultural Revolution, a task that took him 20 years.The book accuses the ruling Chinese Communist Party of state-sponsored genocide in the region, detailing torture techniques and detentions in a brutal campaign that claimed the lives of at least 27,900 people and imprisoned and tortured 346,000.Ethnic Mongolians, who make up almost 20 percent of Inner Mongolia's population of 23 million, increasingly complain of widespread environmental destruction and unfair development policies in the region.Clashes between the authorities or Chinese state-backed mining or forestry companies and herding communities are common in the region, which borders the independent country of Mongolia.But those who complain about the loss of their grazing lands are frequently targeted for harassment, beatings, and detention by the authorities.Load-Date: April 27, 2019End of Document

Her visit was cut back to one day following the March 15 shootings that killed 50 people.Ardern said she still wanted to "visit Beijing at this time to underline the importance that we place on our relationship with China. It is one of our most important and far reaching relationships, a point I've made in my public speeches over the past year."Following the meeting, the two leaders oversaw the signing of agreements on avoiding double taxation, agriculture, financial dialogue and science and research.Ardern met later in the day with Chinese president and head of the ruling Communist Party Xi Jinping, who also expressed his condolences and said both countries must "adhere to mutual trust, the principle of mutual benefit and continue to develop the spirit of striving to be first.""We will continue to enrich the meaning of China-New Zealand comprehensive strategic partnerships, push forward the relationship between the two countries even further, and better serve the people of China and New Zealand," Xi said.The cordial tone comes after months of tensions between the sides, during which official visits and exchanges were delayed or postponed.The determination by New Zealand's spy agency that Huawei's equipment posed a "significant network security risk" sparked deep indignation in China, where the company is considered a national champion.New Zealand has been caught in the fray as the U.S. cautions allies against partnering with Huawei over national security concerns. The country is part of the "Five Eyes" security alliance along with the U.S., Britain, Canada and Australia.The agency's move brought condemnations in China's state media and indications of economic retaliation. China is a key customer for its dairy and other agricultural products. New Zealand's government says two-way trade between the sides more than tripled in the 10 years since a free trade agreement between the sides came into force in 2008.China is New Zealand's biggest trading partner, with $19 billion in commerce between them last year, as well as a key source of tourists and foreign students.Ardern said last month that no final decision has been made on whether Huawei equipment can be used in the country's slated 5G network.Human Rights Watch had called on Ardern to raise concerns about reported Chinese government abuses of Muslims during her visit, although it wasn't clear if she planned to do so. The group said Ardern "spoke forcefully in defense of Muslims' rights" after the Christchurch attacks and should do so again in Beijing.___This story has been corrected to show that the China-New Zealand free trade agreement started in 2008.Load-Date: April 2, 2019End of Document

Analysts: China Isn't Targeting Apple In Trade WarBenzinga.comMay 30, 2019 Thursday 3:05 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Accretive Capital LLC d/b/a Benzinga All Rights ReservedLength: 438 wordsByline: Wayne DugganBodyApple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has taken a beating in the month of May on concerns a breakdown in U.S. trade relations with China could leave Apple exposed to a potential boycott in China. Two analyst said Thursday Apple s seems to have steered clear of trade war disruption up to this point, but it's still caught in the middle of a high-risk situation.Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan reiterated his Buy rating and $230 price target for Apple.Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty reiterated her Overweight rating, but lowered her price target from $240 to $231.iPhone Usage SteadyThe U.S. Commerce department blacklisted Huawei this month, a move that caused plenty of Apple investors to worry that China could do the same for Apple in retaliation. Mohan said if China targets Apple, it could be inflicting more harm on itself than America. Bank of America estimates more than 2 million Chinese workers are employed in the Apple supply chain, making it difficult target for the Chinese government.In addition, Mohan said a survey of more than 194,000 consumers around the globe indicates there has been no decline in intent to buy iPhone s. The number of respondents indicating they intend their next smartphone purchase to be an iPhone has remained steady at around 30 percent through May. In China specifically, that percentage dipped from 32 percent in March to 26 percent in April, but has rebounded to 29 percent in May.Mohan said App Store sales in China are actually on the rise.Informal Ban, PerhapsHuberty said it s unclear whether or not Apple can get its devices exempt from the latest round of U.S. tariffs. However, she said it s unlikely China will target iPhones given they are currently produced inside China. More likely in our view is that the government could place an informal ban on purchasing certain products as it has done in the past for parts of the market (such as for government officials several years ago), which could have a negative impact on iPhone demand,  Huberty wrote in a note.She said even if the government doesn t formally ban iPhones, Chinese consumers may also step in and boycott on their own.Price ActionApple's stock traded marginally higher at $177.92 per share on Thursday.Related Links:Citi Cuts Apple Price Target, iPhone Estimates On China ConcernsAnalyst: Huawei Blacklist Is $400M Risk For GoogleLatest Ratings for AAPLDateFirmActionFromToMay 2019MaintainsOverweightMay 2019MaintainsOverweightMay 2019MaintainsBuyView More Analyst Ratings for AAPL           View the Latest Analyst Ratings© 2019 Benzinga.com.

STOLEN SECRETS SAVEDStates News ServiceJune 6, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 546 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the FBI:FBI Investigators Thwarted Transfer of Trade Secrets to ChinaThe laptop, thumb drives, cell phones, and other items confiscated from Wengfeng Lu during his 2012 arrest as he tried to board a plane to China with stolen trade secrets.Wenfeng Lu was seemingly living the American dreama comfortable life in Irvine, California, with his family and a career in medical device research and development.Yet Lu's secret goal was to use trade secrets stolen from his employer to strike it rich in his native China. However, thanks to an FBI investigation, his plan was thwarted, and Lu is now serving a 27-month prison sentence.Lu worked for several different U.S. companies, all of which developed high-tech medical equipment, such as clot retrieval tools and balloon-guide catheters. In each job, Lu signed a non-disclosure agreement for his research and development work.Despite signing the confidentiality agreement, Lu routinely did data dumps from his various medical research employers for about three years until his arrest in 2012. Lu transferred all of the data he could get his hands on to a personal laptop. Many of the hundreds of documents Lu stole had nothing to do with his own research; he took as much information as he could access, including proprietary information.He had access to so many files, not just for his own projects, and he downloaded files for a variety of different projects and took them home and to China, said Special Agent Gina Kwon, who investigated this case out of the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office.One of Lu's former employers noticed the unusual activity on their systems and reported the results of their internal investigation to the FBI. Investigators quickly proceeded to build their case and arrested Lu, just before he boarded a plane to China with the files.These cases are important for the economic prosperity of our country.Gina Kwon, special agent, FBI Los AngelesThe investigative team learned that Lu had planned to create and run his own medical device manufacturing company in China using the stolen technology and Chinese government funding. He had even applied for Chinese patents using technology stolen from the American companies. (China's government creates policies that disadvantage American businesses, and hacking against American companies and interests is a common tactic.)Lu wanted his own business, and he thought there was a great market in China for this technology, Kwon said.Kwon said the American company's quick response to the unusual activity on their systems was key to the successful investigation. That's why the FBI works closely with private sector companies to build relationships and promote information sharing. Kwon encouraged the victim companies in this caseand all companies who have trade secretsto compartmentalize access to files so each employee only has access to what is needed for his or her job.These cases are important for the economic prosperity of our country, Kwon said. China and others are doing what they can to cut corners by stealing technology from American companies. It's detrimental to U.S companies because they've spent years and money to develop the technology, and it undercuts their ability to sell it competitively.Load-Date: June 6, 2019End of Document

Chinese regulators slap Ford's joint venture with $23.6 million fineCNN WireJune 5, 2019 Wednesday 8:42 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 394 wordsByline: By Sherisse Pham, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Chinese regulators have fined Ford's main joint venture in the country for violating antitrust laws. China's State Administration for Market Regulation slapped Changan Ford with a 162.8 million yuan ($23.6 million) fine for setting minimum resale prices on its cars in the city of Chongqing, according to a statement posted on the regulator's website on Wednesday. The fine amounts to 4% of the company's sales in Chongqing last year. Ford owns 50% of the joint venture, with the rest controlled by its local partner, state-owned carmaker Changan Automobile. Changan Ford's actions deprived downstream dealers of pricing autonomy, restricted competition and damaged the legitimate interests of consumers, the regulator said. Ford said it "respects" the market regulator's decision. "Changan Ford has taken corrective action in its regional sales management together with its dealers," a Ford spokesperson said in a statement. "As an ethical company, Ford is committed to complying with local laws and regulations wherever we do business," the spokesperson added. The move on a storied American carmaker comes at a tense time in US-China relations. The escalating trade war between the two countries and tit-for-tat punitive actions have sent shivers through the global economy and rattled investors. After Washington barred US companies from supplying critical software and components to Chinese tech giant Huawei, Beijing announced it was establishing its own blacklist for foreign companies. Earlier this week the Chinese government said it's investigating FedEx after Huawei said the delivery company diverted to the United States two packages intended for the company's offices in China.The penalty also comes as Ford is looking to make up lost ground in China. The carmaker announced in April that it plans to launch more than 30 new Ford and Lincoln vehicles in China over the next three years as it tries to reverse a decline in sales in the world's biggest auto market.China is Ford's second biggest market after the United States. But like other carmakers it is feeling the effects of China's slumping auto industry --- Ford's sales in the country plunged by nearly 40% in 2018 compared to the previous year.Serenitie Wang contributed to this report.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, May 15th. Your top stories right now, 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.We have breaking news this morning, escalating tensions with Iran reaching a new level. The U.S. ordering non-emergency embassy staff to leave Iraq immediately.Ramping up tensions with China, President Trump reportedly eyeing an executive order which would lay the groundwork to ban all Huawei technology in the U.S., the details coming up.Markets this morning are trading lower, take a look. We are expecting a weaker opening at the start of the trading this morning with the Dow Futures currently down 91 points, a third of a percent. S&P Futures down nine and the NASDAQ Futures down 26.This despite a pretty good rally at the close yesterday, stocks finished up in the triple digits. 207 points at the close on the Dow Industrials, that was almost one percent. S&P was up 22-1/2, and the NASDAQ was up 87, better than one percent higher yesterday.In Europe this morning, European indices are lower across the board, although it is a fractional move. FT-100 down six points, CAC Quarante down 30 points, and the DAX Index in Germany down 85.In Asia overnight, gains across the board, taking a cue from Wall Street. Best performer, check it out, China. Shanghai Composite up 1.9 percent.Facebook restricting live streaming. Details on the new rules as the company faces pressure over terrorist content.And look at the state of the consumer this morning. We are awaiting earnings from Macy's and then later this hour, we will get the April retail sales report. April retail sales expected to be up this morning by two- tenths of one percent. Those numbers coming out in about 29 minutes.Macy shares are up nine percent. The numbers are just hitting the screen, earnings beat expectations, at $0.44 a share versus an estimate of $0.33, revenue also looking good with stock up almost nine percent.Let's get right to Ashley Webster with more on the Macy's quarter right now.ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes, hi, Maria. Good morning to you, Maria. Listen, the adjusted EPS earnings per share as you just said $0.44 beats the estimate by $0.11. The revenue coming in right where it's expected about 5-1/2 billion, so you can call that flat, that is slightly down year-over-year. The same-store sales numbers are up on the owned their stores by 0.6, owned and licensed stores up 0.7 percent. So not exactly going gang busters but there again not slipping.Don't forget, Macy's came off a very disappointing holiday season at the end of December there. And so far the first quarter of this year, the company saying we're off to a solid start. The company says it hopes to have more than a billion dollars' worth of sales online for the full year. Also, confirming its guidance from early on the year for the full outlook comp sales flat up maybe one percent.So, no downward revisions, pretty much as we expected as the guidance came in earlier this year. And, as you can see, the stock coming up nicely up seven percent. Macy's I guess, really spending a lot of money on redoing their stores, also trying to save money, some cost saving. But also as so many other all other stores for that matter really putting a lot of money into the digital presence. Macy's believes they can turn the corner and as I say, generate more than a billion dollars' worth of sales in the digital world, Maria.BARTIROMO: All right, Ashley, big move in the stock that's for sure. We'll wait on retail sales to see how the consumer did in the month of April. Ashley Webster, thank you.We want to turn to U.S.-Iran tensions. The U.S. ordering all nonemergency embassy staff to -- in Iraq to leave. Blake Burman with the latest right now at the White House. Blake, good morning to you.BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you as well. That's right, nonemergency personnel have been told to leave the embassy in Baghdad, Iraq. And also another U.S. diplomatic facility in that country or Beale. The State Department says those employees, those individuals should get out of Iraq as soon as possible using commercial transportation, and avoid U.S. facilities inside that country until they're able to go. That order comes amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iraq, neighbor to the East Iran as the U.S. is concerned that militia allied with Iran could target American citizens and troops inside Iraq.However, that threat assessment is in dispute. As a top British army general earlier this week said, an increased fear is unfounded.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAJ. GEN. CHRISTOPHER GHIKA, BRITISH ARMY: There's been no increased threat from Iranian that forces in Iraq and Syria. There are a substantial number of militia groups in Iraq and Syria. And we don't see any increased threat from many of them at this stage.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: A U.S. military spokesperson though pushed back on those comments, responding this way, saying quote, recent comments run counter to the identified credible threats available to intelligence from the U.S. and allies regarding Iranian back forces in that region.Meantime, back here at the White House yesterday, President Trump was asked about a report that said the White House, had been presented with an option that included sending 120,000 U.S. troops to the Middle East to counter Iran. The commander in chief responded by saying, quote, hopefully we're not going to have a plan for that and if we did, we'd send a hell of a lot more troops than that. That possibility from the president yesterday, Maria.BARTIROMO: You know, it's interesting Blake, because, Iran has been at this war with us for what, 40 years now, I mean this is not any different behavior than in the past. So, why are we talking about this ramp-up today?BURMAN: Well, you've got this threat assessment Maria, from the U.S. in which they say there is a real fear that U.S. citizens, U.S. troops inside Iran are potentially being targeted by these groups that are allied with Iran. And we've seen a lot of other moves leading up to this. You've had the USS Abraham Lincoln go in to the region as well. There has been that attack on the - on the Saudi oil tankers that some have been pointing the finger at Iran.So, you've got this heightened tension in the region but now an increased posture, I guess you could say or maybe not that, but more so a reaction with the U.S. telling individuals to get out of that country who do not need to be there.BARTIROMO: Yes, and it's not like we've ever had a moderate leader in Iran also something else to mention. Blake, thank you. We will be watching this situation that is obviously very tenuous.Joining me right now to talk more about that and other things, is former senior adviser to president George W. Bush, Fox News contributor Karl Rove. Karl, good to see you. Thank you so much for joining us. Your reaction --KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.BARTIROMO: -- to this tension across the world, first Iran.ROVE: Yes, well, prudent measures by the United States. They obviously are acting on some intelligence that lead them to send them the Abraham Lincoln Strike group to the region. We know that the Iranian allied Houthis in Yemen have been attacking Saudi oil facilities using sophisticated drones that can only if come in to existence with the help of Iran.So, and there is a substantial Iranian influence among Shia militias inside Iraq. So, prudent measures keep the -- keep the temperature low but be prudent to do the things that are necessary to protect American interests and American troops and American allies.BARTIROMO: I mean, exactly. I mean, you know, in Iraq what do they kill? 600 plus soldiers during the Iraq war.ROVE: More than -- more than, we shaped the explosives.BARTIROMO: And was there any pushback? I mean, you know, did we hit -- did we we hit back hard enough or the Europeans, did they negotiate with him? So, I mean, we're at a similar point that we've been in past history is the point. It's not like --ROVE: Yes, look, we've been here before, that's why you take the measures that you take, and you send the signal that if they -- if they want to -- if they want to play rough like that, there will be a price to be paid. And the Iranians are in a vulnerable position. Their economy cannot a stand a conflict in the region. And so you have the hard liners repressing for every advantage they could seek against the west and its allies.But on the other hand, they've got people inside that government who are probably sensible enough to realize that the economy is on the ragged edge and the -- and a conflict in the region would put them -- put them in deep, deep trouble with their own people. There's a restive population that does not like what the Mullahs are doing.BARTIROMO: Yes, I'm just looking at the international law backs the Trump Golan policy. An op-ed in the Journal today by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, also want to look at a number of op-eds this morning about dealing with Beijing. China's economy, showing signs of slowdown, factory production retail sales below expectations at the month of April.Karl, what's your take here? The president is getting ready to sign an order banning Chinese telecom giant Huawei from the United States. We know that Huawei is state sponsored and is an infrastructure set up throughout Africa as well as Europe, and its espionage going right back to the Chinese government.ROVE: Yes, look, over 80 countries in world have test in or deployment agreements with Huawei. And in the United States are large number of rural -- small rural telephone companies that use Huawei equipment because it's subsidized. And some of these agreements that the Chinese are getting for deployment. In one case they gave, 30 years zero interest. And then they give heavily subsidized equipment which costs less than that comes from say Samsung (INAUDIBLE) and Nokia or Cisco all because it's subsidized by the state.And yes, there is a Chinese law that requires Chinese companies to cooperate with and supply intelligence to the government. So, this is a smart move by the administration. It's going to have consequences, obviously, the administration is fighting this battle all around the world. They've got to stick which is you need to ban Huawei for security reasons, they need to have a carry that allows people to understand there's an alternative to Iran upon cheap Chinese money and subsidized Chinese equipment.BARTIROMO: Yes, by you know what, when Secretary Pompeo came back from that European trip and he joined me here in the studio, it was clear that the Europeans were pushing back. You've got Italy trying to do -- to try and to do partnerships with Huawei. You've got others like in Germany pushing back on dismantling an infrastructure system that frankly was cheap and that was the whole point. China says to all this countries across the world, don't worry, we've got your back. We'll set up your infrastructure system, and at the time, not recognizing that this is all espionage and it is in their best interests not to take this free stuff.ROVE: What's interesting is the Chinese are running out of money with the bull -- the Belt and Road initiative. So on some of this Huawei deals, what their attempting to do is to say, the Huawei will provide some of the financing but you also have to get some of the financing from international agencies. And there's another weak point for the Chinese, the United States needs to be very tough on this international agencies that are coming in with companion funding for this Huawei deals.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, most people agree that the president was right to push back obviously on China. The president spoke in Louisiana yesterday, Karl. He weighed in on the growing 2020 Democratic field, got to get your take on this, watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I got boot-edge edge. I got them all. I got Beto. Beto's falling fast, what the hell happened? Remember about four weeks ago he said, I was made for this. He was made for it, he was made to fall like a rock. What happened to him?But he's trying to restart his campaign, that generally doesn't work out too well. I don't know what the hell happened to Biden, what happened to him? I'm looking, I said, that doesn't look like the guy I knew. What happened to him? And Bernie, you know, Bernie is crazy -- Bernie is crazy(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: It's the president, your reaction, Karl?ROVE: Well, entertaining. But be careful you are going to get one of them, and better to be prepared to deal with them on their vision, and their values, and their wrong answers for America. I'm not certain it's best for the president to be sort of mocking as a pundit his potential opponents. I think it's -- he's got a very valuable asset, it's his voice, it's his mega phone, it's his microphone, and better to be using those. That's the message out of the event yesterday in Louisiana. The message could have been my America is -- we're now selling energy into the world because we become energy independent because of the policies that I pursued. But I got that message got overrun by -- you know, mocking his potential Democratic opponents. I bet it was a lot of fun but I'm not certain it was the best use of the time at that day.BARTIROMO: It's a very good point. Who do you think right now is in the lead to take on President Trump, who could -- who could beat President Trump in your view?ROVE: Well, we don't know, because we got several geological ages to go before to then. I'm going to write about this tomorrow on my Wall Street Journal.BARTIROMO: Good.ROVE: As soon as I leave here, I'm going to the computer and I'm going to be pounding away but I'm writing on the current state of the Democratic contest.Before Biden got in, there was a lot of -- you know, sort of the conventional wisdom was, he was a disaster, he wasn't going to going anywhere. So I wrote in my column in the Wall Street Journal saying, he's an undervalued stock maybe Joe can do it. And he's had a stronger start to his campaign than even I thought.But I also want to make the point now that-- you know, just because he's now -- he's moved up dramatically in the polls, he has a substantial lead in the national polls over Bernie Sanders, this contest however is far from over. And I'm going to talk about a couple instances in the past that demonstrate how viable -- how volatile this can be.BARTIROMO: He certainly has sucking up a lot of the cash.ROVE: Yes, absolutely.BARTIROMO: Karl, we look forward to your op-ed tomorrow. Thanks so much.ROVE: You bet, thank you.BARTIROMO: Karl Rove, joining us there.Coming up, all eyes on retail as we await April retail sales number due out in about 15 minutes. They come in better than expected earnings from Macy's. And ahead of Wal-Mart's report tomorrow. Macy stock is soaring this morning. We will have the number and analysis.And then Facebook restrictions, how the company is taking action against controversial content with a new live streaming policy. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Retail earnings in focus this morning. Take a look at Macy's stock up three percent right now but it hadn't been as high as eight percent earlier, beating on the bottom line in terms of earnings as we saw earlier this morning. Gerri Willis on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange looking at that and the broader markets. Gerri, good morning.GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Hey, that's right. Good morning, Maria. 44 cents versus 33 cents is a sound beat for Macy's. This was largely on higher same-store sales of 0.7 percent. Good news they also confirmed their full year guidance. You're going to see them open higher today as much as three percent. Alibaba also reporting actually, the stock is higher, adjusted earnings of $1.28 on revenue of 13.9 billion.So they say their growth in e-commerce and the cloud are strong. You can see they're up 1.2 percent. They topped revenue expectations after two consecutive misses. Wal-Mart out tomorrow, that's going to be important as we think about what's going on with the consumer. They are expected to bring a $1.27 on the bottom line, 137.7 billion on the top. Boeing meanwhile, big story in the Wall Street Journal.They knew -- this is what the Wall Street Journal is saying, knew about the cockpit safety alert. Knew about the problem with the cockpit safety alert before telling the FAA for 12 months. They knew about this problem for a year and they only fessed up after the second Max accident in Ethiopia. So big headline on Boeing. You're going to expect to see that stock trade lower today. Maria, back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Gerri. Thank you so much. Gerri Willis on Wall Street. Coming up. April retail sales due out in about 10 minutes. Economists expecting an increase of two-tenths of a percent. We are bringing you the numbers as soon as it hits the tape. And then Facebook fights back this morning in its new live streaming policy taking aim at controversial content. What's behind the new rules when we come back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Facebook is tightening its live streaming rules. The social media giant announcing a one strike policy voving to temporarily restrict users who break company guidelines. This move is in response to the live streaming of the Christ Church massacre in New Zealand. Joining me right now is Elevation Partners cofounder, managing director, and author of Zucked: Waking up to the Facebook Catastrophe, Roger McNamee. A long time and early investor in Facebook who's become over the last two years, you know, two years much more active and cautious on this company. Great to see you, Roger.ROGER MCNAMEE, FOUNDER, ELEVATION PARTNERS: Maria, it's always great to see you.BARTIROMO: Thank so much for joining us. So what about this tightening of the rules at Facebook? Is this enough -- does this address your concerns?MCNAMEE: It does not. What I love and I really -- I really support Mark in his engagement in the issues. He really does understand there is no place to hide any longer. But they are doing classic public relations of conceding things that don't matter, that wouldn't actually change the outcome to try to protect the business model that's really what is at the heart of the problem.BARTIROMO: But what are they going to do? I mean, how -- that is the business model, right?MCINTYRE: I mean, the business model is dependent on getting people's engagement and by promoting the stuff people engage with, you're naturally going to be promoting hate speech, you're going to promote disinformation, you're going to promote conspiracy theories. And they make a lot of money because of promoting that stuff. So what they want to do is find a way to make the P.R. problem go away without actually having to get rid of the content that causes the problem in the first place.And in this case, you know, the notion that people are going to be able to police this get it done before any harm is done is ridiculous. You have to find a way to take away the incentive. It's all about, you know, status is what people are looking for. And so these extremists, these terrorists are looking to use Facebook to get status by promoting their act of terror online. So it's the fact that you can do it that is the problem.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, the bigger issue I guess is this company has an enormous amount of power, more so within a lot of people understood, same with Google. This is why Chris Hughes, one of the founders of the company writes a piece in the New York Times last week, they got a lot of play, a lot of conversation about it that it's time to break up Facebook.MCINTYRE: Well, Chris makes an absolutely essential point about the power situation because Facebook and Google are not elected and yet they have more impact on our democracy than anything has ever had in the past. They have more impact on our public health, on our privacy and frankly on the economy. And the core issue here is what are the best ways to handle that? And I want to use antitrust to in order to create opportunity for competitive models to happen.I want to get back to entrepreneurship. You know, you and I have known each other a longtime when Silicon Valley was about small companions doing amazing new things. And now we're totally dependent on these monopolists but the other thing you have to do is go after that business model. We have to get these companies out of the world. They're basically using surveillance and purchasing data and trading data to get to know everything about us.They make these digital voodoo dolls of each and every one of us. We have no idea how much data they have, we have no idea what they're doing with it and we are so dependent on these products without realizing that they're manipulating our behavior. And that has to stop, it's just -- it's not American, it's -- that's kind of the Chinese way of doing things and I just don't want to see us going down that path.BARTIROMO: What have you heard back, you know, in response to criticism from the company? You wrote a whole book about it, Zucked. It's been getting incredible play since you published it.MCNAMEE: I give Mark a lot of credit because he is engaging in the conversation but he's got really good P.R. handlers who are saying to him, Mark, make this little concession here, it will go away. Make that little concession there, it will go away. And fortunately, the flow of news have been so intense that people have not been satisfied with the little moves that they've made. But unlike Google at least they're in the conversation.BARTIROMO: Yes. That's true.MCNAMEE: Google trying to pretend, hey, none of this has anything to do with us.BARTIROMO: You're absolutely right.MCNAMEE: Which is complete nonsense.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCNAMEE: And so I look at this as, you know, in their shoes, probably a lot of CEOs would handle the same way they're doing it. But I want them to sit there and realize, this succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. This is an opportunity for Mark to be hero of his own story.BARTIROMO: Yes. And just to be clear, even though you have been sort of cautious and negative and speaking out about the issues around the company, you really haven't sold much stock. I mean --(CROSSTALK)MCNAMEE: Yes. The critical thing -- I continue to have -- it's continuously by far my largest position. And the key thing is, I don't think this is about the people. I am not critical of Mark, I'm not critical of Sheryl or of Larry, Sergey --BARTIROMO: About the business model.MCNAMEE: It's about the business model, it's about the culture and it's about this notion that somehow they're entitled to essentially convert everybody's human experience into data and then use that to manage our lives because we all go to them for information. What we don't realize is they're using their control of the menu to control the choices available to us and that's not a good thing.BARTIROMO: We talk a lot about China and how China is, you know, tracking its citizens, facial technology, they've got, you know, all this data on everybody. The closest thing to China in this country --MCNAMEE: Is Google and then Facebook. And my point is they say you can't regulate us because we have to compete with China. I go, why do we want to compete with China in behavioral manipulation? We don't. We want to apply A.I. and all this technology to all the things you can do to make humanity better off.BARTIROMO: What's the fear around A.I.?MCNAMEE: Well, the legitimate fears are coming in two different areas. One is that, you train Artificial Intelligence with data from the real world. So if you're not really careful, you reproduce all the problems of the real world without a human being to go and complain to. So, if you sit there and think about this we've had huge issues in corporations for recruiting with resume applications that retain the real world biases against women, against older people.BARTIROMO: -- bias right in there.MCNAMEE: Exactly. And my point is you have to really careful and it's doable. The other problem with A.I. is that you -- they're almost inscrutable, it's almost impossible to tell until you do something when you start at the beginning what's going to coming out at the end and so, you sit there and say, well, we can get an A.I. to drive a car. And I'm sitting there and going, hang on.BARTIROMO: Hang on.MCNAMEE: Driving cars with humans on the road is really complicated. And we cannot count on these things to get it right without an awful lot of tests.BARTIROMO: I don't think we're going to see a fully autonomous driverless car on road for a decade. I know what Elon Musk is saying. I'm not buying it. I'm not.MCNAMEE: I hope we don't.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCNAMEE: I mean, if we do it will be very, very dangerous.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about Microsoft. The company is sounding the alarms this morning, warning of a monster computer bug that could be used as cyberweapon. What do you know about this and how do these problems keep popping up?MCNAMEE: Well, the issue you have with Microsoft and frankly with all the gigantic web platforms is they are so huge and they have so much out there that inevitably things fall through the cracks. Microsoft has been patching and upgrading Windows forever and this bug is about older versions of Windows. And do you know the sad part? That means government agencies and corporations that don't upgrade regularly are the ones who are going to be victimized by this, what's in the worst possible places.And now that everybody knows the bug is there, there is a real risk with super important that anyone who has those old versions of Windows, upgrade immediately. Put the patch in place and, you know, the thing with computer technology is it is far more risky than we've allowed for and we have to budget both the expense and the energy to keep these things current and protected.BARTIROMO: We've reported on this a lot because Steve Ballmer came on the show and told me and confirmed to me that 90 percent of the companies in China use the Microsoft operating system, one percent pay for it.MCNAMEE: Exactly.BARTIROMO: It's a -- it's a -- it's a loss of $10 billion a year for Microsoft. When it comes to China I.P. theft, you know, this is the big issue in terms of --MCNAMEE: It is a huge issue.BARTIROMO: The President is pushing back using, you know, I just want to point out that April retail sales, worse than expected. It was down two- tenths of a percent. We were expecting retail sales to be up two-tenths of a percent. So this China fight is one thing that people are talking about whether or not it's going to impact the economy, we don't know. But April retail sales down two-tenths of a percent for the month. That is a worse- than expected number and markets are down this morning. They were already down going into it, but the big issue here, the President using tariffs, the real elephant in the room, as you know, is the I.P. theft, the forced transfer of technology.MCNAMEE: Oh, and in my mind, it's not just I.P. theft. The forward looking risk is the notion that they bring their behavioral manipulation, their what they call the social credit application into other countries around the world, including the United States and I don't think we want to allow that. So, I believe that having a better reciprocal relationship with China requires holding to a much higher standard on intellectual property.BARTIROMO: Hmm.MCNAMEE: And realistically, we have built our economy around buying stuff from China. We need to get back to making a lot more stuff here. We need to get back to investing more, consuming less.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCNAMEE: I don't know that the country is emotionally prepared to consume less, but if you're worried about China, that's got to be a big part of the answer.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCNAMEE: And -- because right now, you go into a retail store, what is it, like in a Walmart, like 90 percent of what's there is made in China?BARTIROMO: Do you think China's economy gets impacted more than the U.S. economy from this fight?MCNAMEE: It does, but we both get hurt.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCNAMEE: And it's -- and it's needless.BARTIROMO: Again, the retail sales are down, two-tenths of a percent versus an estimate of up two-tenths of a percent. X AUTOS, they were up one-tenth of a percent versus an estimate of up seven-tenths of a percent, not a good number this morning on retail sales. Roger, it's great to see you.MCNAMEE: Maria, always a pleasure.BARTIROMO: Thank you. Roger McNamee joining us there. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is, Wednesday, May 15th. Your top stories right now 8:35 a.m. on the East Coast. Breaking news this morning, retail sales for the month of April down two-tenths of one percent. The estimate was for a gain of two-tenths of a percent. A disappointing number here. Futures were lower going into the number. They have worsened after the number. The Dow Futures right now indicating a decline at the start of trading of 142 points, that's one-half of one percent. S&P 500 down 16-1/2, NASDAQ down 45 points, two-thirds of one percent.Joining us right now is MacroMavens President, Stephanie Pomboy with reaction. Good to see you, Stephanie.STEPHANIE POMBOY, PRESIDENT, MACROMAVENS: Good morning. Good to see you.BARTIROMO: Not a good month of April.POMBOY: No, I would say so. Actually, I thought if anything, the number would surprise on the upside. I mean we had a strong employment report in April. We had the market returning to record highs, seasonally, the bar for April is much lower in terms of the adjustment hurdle that the data has --BARTIROMO: What do you happened here?POMBOY: That's wonky a thing, so --BARTIROMO: What do you think happened here?POMBOY: Well, I think the fact that it disappointed really speaks to the longer-term underlying weakness that we're seeing, you know, as we've talked about many times before, the fed, when it started raising rates in December 2015, that had an immediate impact on households. We didn't notice it in the financial community because corporate borrowing costs continue to move lower. Government, you know, treasury yields continue to move lower, even in the face of a fed tightening. But it was a slow and steady drain on households who saw their interest expense move up, and it hasn't been fully offset, I guess, by the increase in wage inflation.So, you're still seeing some pressure on households and that's reflected in, like, delinquency rates, you know, the credit card delinquency rates continue to move higher along with autos and student loans. So, there's been distress building there which is why I felt like we'd have the sort of short-term bounce in the economy, but longer term, those factors would begin to weigh on. What I think is really important about this disappointing number is how it dovetails with the whole tariff issue now because --BARTIROMO: Yes, this was before the tariffs went into effect.POMBOY: Exactly, and I guess, you know, the sort of glib reaction to the tariff thing is, oh, well, consumers are have going to pay those increased prices. I'm not so sure. You look at these numbers, what company is going to be able to pass along higher prices to their consumers?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: And I think the vast majority, and correct me if I'm wrong, of this $200 billion tranche where we now have officially 25 percent tariffs on those goods, I think a large percentage, if not the majority, is intermediate goods. So, it's goods used in manufacturing. So what do they do? They don't pass on the higher costs, they cut jobs.POMBOY: Yes. Well, this is an issue that's not new. I mean if you look at the interplay between the CPI, which is the Consumer Price Index, and the PPI, which gets into the input cost, we have had issue with input cost going up faster than consumer prices for a long time. In fact, 20 over the last 24 months, the PPI has been faster than the CPI, which implies some real margin pressure for companies and obviously, these retail sales number this morning suggests that's not going to disappear, it might actually be intensifying and then you layer on top the tariffs.ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Stephanie, what do you think the number of small businesses in the United States that are affected by the tariffs and have to pay extra? I mean you'll give you an example, my cousin, Auggie is an auto glass installer, he's getting annihilated by the tariffs. There's only certain auto glass that can be purchased from China and he's paying and he cannot pass it on to the end consumers. So, how many of those are out there, you think?POMBOY: Well, I guess it -- it's hard to quantify. I mean it really depends on specific industries, but clearly, that's going to be a major issue in terms of the employment side. You know, and you did see --SCARAMUCCI: To put pressure on jobs because the small businesses really do create the jobs.POMBOY: Absolutely, and we did see though yesterday, the NFIB, small business array, which was better for the month. Now, again, that's before this whole tariff thing went into effect, but I'm surprised given what you're talking about that they haven't been a little bit more pressured by all the trade talk up until now.BARTIROMO: What's your estimate in terms of how much growth the tariff situation takes out of annual economic growth?POMBOY: well, I mean I guess there is the one percent of GDP is exports to China, so that's a, you know, in the scheme of things, it seems fairly minor, but obviously, there are ripple effects that are much broader than that. And I guess what I really wrestle with is more the psychological effect here of, you know, if you're a businessman, and you see this trade war going on and tariffs coming on, how do you move forward? You know, do you adjust your capex plans? So, you know, do you decide to put a hold on hiring, so it can have a much more material effect than just --BARTIROMO: You just have an estimate. OK. Than a fractional estimate.MCDOWELL: Can I -- can I ask you really quickly? Alice Rivlin passed away. She's the founding person in the Congressional Budget Office, worked in Office and Management Budget like tip of our hats to her.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.MCDOWELL: And Godspeed, right? I mean in terms of strong women, kind of lead, you know, really leading in finance, and economics, I -- she's really an incredible person.POMBOY: Yes.BARTIROMO: Alice Rivlin.POMBOY: I echo that sentiment.MCDOWELL: Yes.BARTIROMO: Thank you. Thank you so much.POMBOY: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Stephanie Pomboy there. As we have been talking, market has been worsening. Dow Futures down 162 points, you got the S&P down 18, and the NASDAQ down 49. We'll take a break then. Brewing competition, one Chinese coffee giant could pose a major threat to Starbucks. Stuart Varney weighing in on that. Then a stock exchange for startups, I'll speak with the CEO of the Silicon Valley's newest stock exchange giving competitors a run for their money, we will take a look at the West Coast Stock Exchange. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A Chinese coffee giant posing some real challenge to Starbucks. Joining me now, host of "VARNEY & CO." Stuart Varney. This is a great story, Stu.STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I think so.BARTIROMO: Yes.VARNEY: I think Luckin goes public on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, of this week, I think they are a real challenge to Starbucks, certainly in China. For a start, Luckin sells coffee for under a buck per cup, OK? At Starbucks, it's roughly four dollars, so they got a price advantage. Secondly, they're selling some flavors of coffee which are very popular in China. How about coffee and cream cheese? Yes, that is apparently a popular flavor. You won't get in it Starbucks, you get it in Luckin. Luckin will accept no cash whatsoever, so it's a futuristic kind of company.You can play on your phone, that's it. You just flash your phone and you get your coffee paid for. And they've got three different kinds of delivery of the coffee, you can go to a pickup store, literally pick it up, you can go to a store and sit back relax and chat with your friends, or you can have it delivered to home or office. I think that's a very competitive business model. And when they get this money on Friday form the IPO, which they're going to do here, I think they'll use that money to expand rapidly in China.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.VARNEY: They have 2,400 stores there already, they're going to double that number at least, and I think that's real competition for Starbucks.BARTIROMO: Yes, it sure is. And for a long time, China was encouraging Starbucks to operate in China, learn everything they can from Starbucks.VARNEY: Right.BARTIROMO: Get as much information about Americans, how they do it, and then come up with their own.VARNEY: And I think they'll gain from the nationalistic feeling in China at the moment --BARTIROMO: Yes.VARNEY: -- in this trade fight with America, so I think that's going to be a very interesting IPO in a string of very interesting IPOs.BARTIROMO: Yes. This is a great story that you pinpoint, Stu.VARNEY: Sure.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. I know you'll have more on it in about 10 minutes. We'll see you at the top of the hour.VARNEY: You will.BARTIROMO: "VARNEY & CO." begins 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Join Stuart coming up. But first, Silicon Valley's brand-new stock exchange. I'll speak with its CEO who is betting big against its East Coast rivals, wait until you hear this.Then cracking down on tech, San Francisco becomes the first major U.S. city to ban facial recognition surveillance. We'll talk about it. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. San Francisco now the first U.S. city to ban facial recognition technology. Officials there in San Fran saying that they have a responsibility to regulate the excesses of tech. Critics argue the facial recognition is necessary for public safety. We're talking about that this morning with the panel and Cheryl Casone joining us this morning.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes.BARTIROMO: Cheryl, great to see you.CASONE: Great to see you. And, you know, this is in San Francisco. They felt that they are the leading city in tech, but Silicon Valley and San Francisco, two geologically different places, we should add here, but they're worried about police using this in the cases of criminals. They say that there's -- the opponents in San Francisco say that this is an overreach by authorities.My concern so much isn't with the law. I think it's a good way to catch criminals like they did last year. My concern is with identity theft. if your face, if your eye scans, if all that becomes out there and that is hacked into, that is where your identity and everything that's in your life can be actually be used, your medical records, your bank accounts, everything in your life, and I think that's what they need to be more concerned about, but this is more about civil liberties in San Francisco.BARTIROMO: Yes. I think that's a really good point that you bring up, and I bet you it's also because of the immigration stance on the -- in this administration. San Francisco does not want them to be able to point out who the illegals are in the community.CASONE: Correct.BARTIROMO: But, you know, there's this implicit bias, the facial recognition is only as good as what you put in the computer, so there's also that also risk of people being wrongly accused if the -- if there's a bias within the technology.CASONE: If there's a bias. And remember that as facial recognition is on our phones now and more and more Americans use it because, look, it is easy, it is convenient, and technology's not going to stop, but at the same time, that limit between government, to your point about the City of San Francisco, a sanctuary city --BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.CASONE: -- and the overreach of authorities, that's going to be weighed against, Apple not wanting sometimes to give a phone over in a criminal investigation --MCDOWELL: I just look at --CASONE: -- like we saw in Los Angeles.MCDOWELL: I live there and I look at the city and say, "This is what they're concerned with?"ERIN ELMORE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Right.MCDOWELL: Meantime, there is human feces from the bay to the ocean --ELMORE: Needles.MCDOWELL: -- all the way down the peninsula, like the quality of life in that city is really horrific.BARTIROMO: Yes. Tucker Carlson's been doing a good job of showing it all this well.ELMORE: CASONE: Yes.BARTIROMO: The homelessness as well. What a story. We'll keep. Cheryl, great to have you on to talk about this. Dagen, Anthony, Erin, great show. Thank you so much for being here.MCDOWELL: Yes.BARTIROMO: Have a great day, everybody. "VARNEY & CO." begins right now. Stuart, take it away.VARNEY: All right. Good morning, Maria.Load-Date: May 15, 2019End of Document

DO IT BETTER/The trade War and MexicoCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 14, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 502 wordsBody       20 years ago Mexico was not easy: China was about to enter the World Trade Organization and this, coupled with its cheap labor, led many companies, some of which were located in Mexico, to move their operations there. The story is different today. The trade war between China and the United States has opened up important opportunities for Mexico. Since last year, we are already the main trading partner of the United States, a place that formerly occupied China. Compared to us imports of 2017 with those of 2018 it is easy to see how, in areas where the Asian giant fell Mexico grew. Leather products, fertilizers, textiles, automobiles, metal and aluminum products are just examples of this phenomenon. The rise in tariffs occurs in a context where wages in China are no longer low, and the growing mistrust with the US has aggravated the risk of intellectual property in producing there. All this re-positioned Mexico as an attractive option. What companies are moving to Mexico? A little bit of everything. Fuling Global, for example, is a company that makes paper and straw rates for restaurants in the United States and, after the paper tariff, changed its operations from the city of Wenling, China, to Monterrey, also saving the cost of transportation. The same story has been repeated with flagship companies like Hasbro, which manufactures toys, or GoPro, which manufactures cameras and high-resolution video. In this trade war, Mexico also becomes an attractive destination for Chinese investment that will seek to enter key sectors such as telecommunications or infrastructure, and countries that are strategically located or allied to their enemy. The commercial war on issues like technology is at a delicate time. Just look at what just happened with Huawei, a company that, being considered an arm of the Chinese government, will not sell you software, hardware or licenses from key vendors like Google, Intel and Qualcomm. In the face of these conflicts, Mexico will have to understand what its main interests are while learning to negotiate. The conflict between these two countries will not soon be over, so if Mexico manages to improve some key variables and give certainty and confidence, it can take better advantage of the opportunity. This trade war will change the map of the productive chains of many industries. Taking advantage of this will also require Mexican leaders with vision. In the political and diplomatic sphere to this administration it will take time to learn the art of dealing with Trump, whose main goal is the re-election, and with an authoritarian government like the Chinese, who does not account for anyone. There are no recipes, everything will be trial and error. But the only truth is that, despite the diplomatic difficulties of the last few weeks, the situation is still smiling on us. In the medium term, in the trade war between the United States and China, everyone loses, except perhaps Mexico... If you play it right.  veronicaebaz@gmail.com       Load-Date: June 14, 2019End of Document

Why tariff war threatens Beijing's global economic ambitionsAssociated Press InternationalMay 13, 2019 Monday 3:41 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 1036 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - China's intensified tariff war with the Trump administration is threatening Beijing's ambition to transform itself into the dominant player in global technology.The United States is a vital customer and source of technology for Chinese makers of electronics, medical equipment and other high-tech exports - industries that the ruling Communist Party sees as the heart of its economic future.Yet to the Trump administration, they're a threat to America's industrial leadership.Beijing managed to keep Chinese economic growth steady in the most recent quarter despite a drop in exports to the United States. It did so by boosting government spending and bank lending. But China's technology exporters suffered huge sales drops of up to 40 percent, which ate into profits that pay for technology research.The tariff war is compounding the pain felt by many Chinese companies. They are already enduring stiffened resistance in the United States and Europe to Chinese acquisitions of technology through joint ventures with foreign companies or, with financing by state-run banks, outright purchases.China might now have to take the "tougher route" of developing more of its own technology, with less access to foreign partners and know-how, said Rajiv Biswas, chief Asia economist for IHS Markit."It may be a slower path," Biswas said.The government and companies are pouring billions of dollars into research. Huawei, the telecom equipment giant and China's first global tech brand, spent $15 billion last year - more than Apple Inc.All of this has helped make China an emerging heavyweight in telecoms, artificial intelligence and other fields. Yet the United States, Europe, Japan and other governments complain that Beijing has done so in part by stealing technology or pressuring foreign companies to hand over trade secrets.Washington is pushing Beijing to roll back plans for a government-led creation of global competitors in robotics, electric cars, artificial intelligence and an array of emerging technologies. Beijing's trading partners argue that such plans violate its commitments to further open its vast consumer and business markets.The struggle compounds the challenges for President Xi Jinping's government by threatening to delay or disrupt its economic plans. China's leaders are reluctant to yield; they need higher-tech industries to keep incomes rising. Many producers of textiles, shoes and toys have already migrated to Vietnam, Cambodia and other lower-cost economies.China's ruling Communist Party responded to an economic downturn last year by stepping up spending and lending. That effort reversed a campaign to curb reliance on debt, which had soared so high that rating agencies had downgraded China's credit rating for government borrowing.Abroad, Xi has been forced to overhaul his multibillion-dollar "Belt and Road" initiative to build railways and other infrastructure. In response to complaints that some countries are left with too much debt, the government has written off some loans and renegotiated contracts.The tariff war was sparked by years of yawning U.S. trade deficits with China and by complaints - by the Trump administration and many independent trade experts - that Beijing was engaging in predatory and illicit practices, including the theft of technology. The first U.S. penalties targeted high-tech Chinese goods that American officials said benefited from improper support from Beijing.Its impact spread as President Donald Trump extended tariff increases to Chinese exporters of handbags, furniture and other goods. Those higher import taxes heightened the threat of job losses - a political risk for an unelected party that derives its claim to power in no small part from having managed three decades of explosive economic growth.On the surface at least, the impact of Friday's U.S. tariff hike "is relatively modest," Brian Coulton, chief economist for Fitch Ratings, said in a report. But if Trump proceeds with his threat to extend 25% tariffs to all imports from China, that "would be a much more material threat to China's growth outlook," Coulton said."Renewed weakening in China would rekindle financial market concerns about global growth risks," he said.Xi's personal standing has been hurt by slowing growth and by last year's decision to eliminate term limits for his office as president, said Zhang Lifang, an independent political commentator in Beijing."I think these two things are very stressful for him, both economically and politically," Zhang said.The United States and Europe have been increasing the cost and complexity of Chinese acquisition of foreign technology or blocking it outright. In October, the European Union tentatively approved the trade bloc's first rules on foreign investments in sensitive sectors. That step followed criticism of Chinese purchases of European technology vendors that are considered vital national assets, including German robot maker Kuka. Chinese buyers have also acquired Sweden's Volvo Cars, Swiss agri-tech supplier Syngenta and IBM Corp.'s low-end server business.In the United States, Trump vetoed the 2017 purchase of a chipmaker, Lattice Semiconductor, that was financed by a Chinese government fund.Foreign manufacturers of consumer electronics and other goods already are shifting investments to Southeast Asia to cut costs, thereby hurting demand for Chinese parts suppliers and sapping revenue they would use to develop technology."Boardrooms of multinationals, including possibly Chinese companies, might decide they need to have more manufacturing capability outside China to reduce this risk," Biswas said .That shift, accelerated by the pressure from U.S. tariffs, promises a potential windfall for other Asian economies.Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen has suggested that the U.S.-China tariff war might help her government woo back manufacturers who had moved to the mainland in search of lower costs."Our goal is to speed up Taiwanese business people's coming back to rebuild a high added-value supply chain and encourage industries to transform and upgrade themselves," Tsai said.___AP videojournalists Fu Ting in Beijing and Taijing Wu in Taipei contributed to this report.Load-Date: May 13, 2019End of Document

Break with Google truncates Huawei to have the best selling smartphonesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 20, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 844 wordsBody Hong Kong (CNN Business)  Google is restricting Huawei's access to its operating system and Android apps after the Trump administration put the Chinese technology firm on the blacklist.  The decision is a hard blow for Huawei whose goal is to be the main brand of smartphones by the end of 2020.  The Trump administration banned last week for US companies to sell products to Huawei without the approval of the US government in a significant escalation of the trade dispute with China.  "We are complying with the order and reviewing the implications," a Google spokesperson said Monday.  Huawei, the second largest smartphone sales in the world, depends on a series of Google services for its devices, including the Android operating system and the Google Play app store.  The Silicon Valley giant will suspend much of that access according to several reports after Washington placed Huawei on a list of foreign companies that are thought to undermine US national security or have foreign policy interests. Companies on the list are prohibited from receiving components and software unless their business is licensed.  Existing Huawei phones will not be affected  Huawei will only be able to use the public version of Android and will not have access to Google apps and services. The news was reported for the first time by Reuters.  Google said that consumers who already have Huawei smartphones will not be very affected by now.  We recommend:  "Google Play and the security protections of Google Play Protect will continue to work on existing Huawei devices," the spokesman added without providing further details.  The ban jeopardizes Huawei's supply chain and could delay the implementation of 5G services around the world. But the most immediate problem for Huawei is what the decision implies for the future sales of their smartphones.  Most of Google's popular products, such as Gmail, YouTube and Google Maps are banned in China, where Huawei offers local alternatives such as WeChat from Tencent and Baidu Maps. But the company is deeply dependent on other countries outside of China.  Approximately half of its smartphone sales last year were outside China, according to researchers Canalys and IDC.  Huawei said it is "examining the implications of US actions for consumers," adding that it will continue to provide "security updates and after-sales services" for all existing smartphones and tablets, including its low-cost brand Honor.  China's response: "Wait to see"  The Chinese technology company said it has spent at least three years working on its own operating system.  "Huawei has been generating an alternative operating system if necessary," said Huawei spokesman Glenn Schloss. "We would like to continue operating in the ecosystems of Microsoft and Google," he added.  Huawei licenses Microsoft's operating system for its laptops and tablets. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Beijing has repeatedly criticized the US campaign against Huawei, calling the addition of the company to the political decision blacklist.  "China supports Chinese companies that defend their legitimate rights in accordance with the law," Lu Kang, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, told a news conference on Monday.  "In terms of the measures that the Chinese companies or government will take, please wait and see," he said.  Eliminate Huawei out ofChina?  Being isolated from the Google ecosystem would be a huge blow to Huawei's ambitions to surpass Samsung as the world's leading producer of smartphones.  The consumer business that includes smartphones, laptops, tablets and wearable devices such as smart watches, was the main contributor to Huawei's profits last year. The division generated almost 50 billion dollars in 2018, which represents more than 45% of its revenues.  For millions of users outside of China, being isolated from Google apps and services "kills the attractiveness of a Huawei phone," said IDC analyst Bryan Ma.  Read also:  "It eliminates the utility of a Huawei phone outside China, leaving them dead in the water," he added.  Theoretically, Huawei can try to win over consumers with their competitive hardware and innovation, and then convince them to download Google apps after they buy the Huawei phone, said Nicole Peng, an analyst at Canalys.  But the evidence shows that "post-sale facilities are very complex for users, unless they know what they are doing," Peng said.  In addition, when customers discover that Huawei can not get the Google ecosystem on their phones "it will affect trust, they will question if there is something wrong with the device," he added.  Even if customers could download Google apps independently on Huawei phones, the phones would still not have access to the so-called Google Mobile Services.  Many third-party applications such as shared-travel platforms and food deliveries depend on services like Google Maps. Most of these apps may not be supported on Huawei devices, said IDC Ma.  Without that access, "the Huawei phone is a brick," he said. Load-Date: May 20, 2019End of Document

Senate Finance Subcommittee Issues Testimony From American Enterprise InstituteTargeted News ServiceJune 12, 2019 Wednesday 1:17 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2591 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Finance subcommittee on International Trade, Customs and Global Competitiveness issued the following testimony by Derek Scissors, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, at a hearing entitled "China's Belt and Road Initiative":"There are a number of easy myths to dispel about China's Belt and Road Initiative. It's worth trillions - false. China is buying up the participating countries - if so, only in self-defeating fashion. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is primarily about transportation - reasonable but still mostly wrong."Perhaps the most important mistake is that the BRI represents a growing Chinese footprint globally. It did in 2016, not now. More countries are joining the BRI in name but the extent of activity is shrinking. Moreover, inadequate foreign currency reserves means Beijing will be hard pressed to keep the BRI afloat as a global commercial effort. It is therefore likely to devolve toward a talk shop with substantial resources assigned only to a small set of priority countries."The first implication for American policy of this likely BRI trajectory is: do not overreact. The second is to identify the much smaller group of countries China will favor going to forward. Our interests are very different than the PRC's and the BRI does not appear to call for any substantial American response on economic grounds (only).Facts On The BRI's Past and Present"Data on the BRI are drawn from the American Enterprise Institute's China Global Investment Tracker, the only publically available compilation of Chinese investment and construction globally.1 The Tracker presently includes over 3000 transactions compiled from 2005-2018, each valued at $95 million or more. It does not capture the lending which usually supports the investment and construction transactions."What countries are actually in the BRI and which subset of projects should be counted are open questions, as Beijing has deliberately left the BRI ill-defined. "BRI projects are only the good ones" is not far off from the Chinese position. When the initiative was launched in 2013, it was said to include 64 countries. More have been added, most famously Italy. In statistical notes, the Ministry of Commerce never uses even the original 64, the number instead bizarrely varying between 49 and 55 or not mentioned at all.2"The Tracker's view of the BRI is based on the official Chinese government website, using all projects in all countries profiled.3 The intention is to get the largest numbers possible, numbers which can only overstate the impact of the BRI to date, yet still turn out to be on the small side."At time of writing, 137 countries were profiled on the BRI site."From 2014 to 2018, total Chinese investment in all BRI countries was $190 billion. Again, this is a deliberately high estimate. At this rate, it will take until 2040 for investment to reach the $1 trillion goal often bandied about - if this is a new Marshall Plan, it's a slow one. It's also not especially vital to the PRC. Sizing it as aggressively as possible, the BRI comprised less than 30 percent of total investment and less than combined Chinese investment in the US, Australia, and United Kingdom over this period."Investment is not the main economic activity in the BRI, construction is. Chinese construction activity in the full set of BRI countries was worth twice as much, at $388 billion for 2014-8."(While construction is heavily financed by Chinese loans, it does not involve any ownership of assets and therefore does not qualify as investment. It is properly categorized as part of services trade.) The construction figures are impressive but, at this pace, it would still take 50 years for the BRI to be the $6-trillion program some anticipate.4"What is being built and, to a lesser extent, bought? Road-, rail-, and port-building win the most attention but are nosed out by power plant construction. In investment, energy dominates."By country, the investment pattern within the BRI reflects that of Chinese investment in all countries: greater foreign wealth draws more Chinese money. Tiny Singapore leads by a substantial margin because it is rich and there is money to be made there. Construction goes first to heavily populated developing economies, which naturally have the most available projects.The BRI's Future"What the BRI has been to now is often mildly exaggerated, where it is headed is in some cases greatly exaggerated. Investment volume and growth peaked in 2015. Though construction transactions are publicized more gradually and 2018 figures are certainly not final, volume and growth looks to have peaked in 2016. Rather than building toward global transformation, the BRI may have already seen its most dynamic days."For the first half of 2019, all results are of course incomplete for investment and nowhere close to complete for construction. But Chinese investment around the world appears to have dropped again, after dropping sharply in the second half of 2018. The reason is plunging investment by state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which had until last autumn unfailingly outspent private Chinese enterprises. For roughly eight months, major state investors have either reported drastically less global investment for some reason or actually cut their spending."While that is a global trend, it is telling for the BRI. In 2014-8, SOEs accounted for about 73 percent of BRI investment. They accounted for about 96 percent of construction, which is utterly dominated by giants such as State Construction Engineering and PowerChina and their many subsidiaries. The BRI is a program of SOEs. Private companies avoid BRI construction because there's no financial return to often-difficult projects in what are mostly poorer countries. The same is true to a lesser extent for investment."It is no surprise, then, that the official BRI investment tally for January through April 2019 was tallied for just 50 countries and stood at just $4.6 billion.5 No on-year growth was given, which is Chinese for "it's declining and we don't want to say that." If SOEs have stopped disclosing some BRI activities, it obviously harms transparency and raises questions about Beijing's commitment. If SOEs have stopped investing, the questions become pointed: the PRC is a reliable partner, until it needs a break?"The SOE pause has weight because it can be traced back to serious problems in Chinese external finance. When Xi Jinping launched the BRI in September 2013, China's foreign exchange reserves were valued at $3.66 trillion.6 They rose to $3.99 trillion in June 2014, then began falling, standing at $3.09 trillion at the end of April 2019. There is also a smaller amount of foreign currency held in the state banking system which appears to have fallen more steeply. The"BRI was launched under conditions of not only abundant but also fast-rising reserves. They are still abundant but the trend has reversed."Reserves are what make the BRI go. While China and others fuss over the yuan becoming a globally used currency, the share of the yuan in global transactions is about two percent, with most of those in Hong Kong. For global reserve holdings, the yuan is about as important as the Canadian dollar.7 BRI governments and local businesses want dollars or other hard currency from Beijing, hard currency which it increasingly cannot spare. Unless the foreign exchange pattern of the past five years is flipped, the BRI as a global program will slowly starve to death."Adding a bit more pressure, if only a bit, is internal financial failure. The PRC pushed domestic outstanding credit - an aggregate debt measure -- from $6.5 trillion in 2008 to $33.2 trillion in 2018, mocking all claims of recent economic success.8 But this is not money used for the BRI."To protect fragile banks, Beijing still employs a closed capital account, which keeps domestic and foreign funds separate (and money from freely leaving the country). A secondary impact: weak growth from heavy debt gradually undermines the BRI by making it politically sensitive.US Policy On the BRI"The first question for American policy-makers is a surprise but follows directly from current conditions: what is it worth to the US to kill the BRI? In most situations, for instance with regard to intellectual property, the US does not have the ability to halt Chinese actions outright. With the BRI, we effectively do."Balance of payments weakness since 2014 has made the PRC extremely dependent on sales to the US. The PRC's cumulative goods and services surplus with the US from 1999 through 2018 was close to $4.6 trillion, more than its foreign exchange holdings at their peak.9 Moreover, from June 2014 to April 2019, when China's reserves dropped $900 billion, it still ran a $1.5-trillion goods and services surplus with the US. Without that, Beijing cannot avoid a balance of payments crisis, much less fund a global BRI."Enter the trade dispute. Available 2019 data show goods imports from the PRC falling $17 billion from January to March.10 The US has since hiked from 10 to 25 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports, pending exclusions, and a tariff of unknown rate is possible on $300 billion more. Neither action is yet reflected in trade or reserves. Nearly-across-the-board US tariffs, perhaps half 25 percent and half 10 percent, would cost Beijing at least $150 billion in hard currency annually, a loss the PRC can afford for a while but the BRI cannot."The BRI presently depends on American consumers buying Chinese products and can be paralyzed for an extended period just by making those products more expensive. Such actions of course have costs for the US, though they are not especially large (unless combined with 25- percent across-the-board tariffs on Mexico). Is the BRI a sufficient threat on its own to justify fairly minor sanctions against China? Not on the commercial side."With regard to frequently cited "debt traps," Beijing can no longer afford the billions in hard currency needed to spring a trap. The clearest illustration: there turns out to be nothing Venezuela can provide worth what China has risked. A deeper answer involves assets the PRC might acquire for debt forgiveness. In most cases, there are no commercially valuable assets available, hence the initial involvement of heavily subsidized SOEs instead of profit-motivated multinationals. In Sri Lanka, for example, the obvious pieces for China to gain are infrastructure projects for which there is little supporting demand.11"The idea behind debt traps, however, is relevant more broadly: what does Beijing gain from the BRI to justify devoting (increasingly) precious resources? The PRC faces rising labor and land costs, making its exports particularly less competitive in lower-income countries that dominate the BRI. Better transport and logistics can boost demand there. The stress on energy reinforces China's interest in commodities extraction and shipment, from Russia and other oil suppliers primarily and metal ore suppliers such as Vietnam and Chile secondarily."The US should care little about either exports to poor BRI countries or competitive commodities extraction. American exports skew heavily to NAFTA partners and Europe. Net American oil and oil products imports in the first quarter of 2019 were less than 10% of those in the first quarter of 2009 and metals imports have never been sizable.12 It makes no sense for the US to mirror Chinese economic priorities, much less dubious actions like subsidizing power plant construction in Laos."This discussion is limited to economic issues and security concerns may be much sharper."Economics can inform those concerns, as well. China cannot fund a truly global BRI and odds are better that financial constraints will tighten rather than loosen. Beijing will inevitably focus on what it sees as the most important countries. On economic grounds, these are the richer countries in Southeast Asia for export markets and the Arab world for oil. American policy should anticipate where China's gaze will finally land and evaluate to what extent this very select set of countries calls for a US response. The BRI as a whole has become a red herring."* * *Footnotes:1 American Enterprise Institute and Heritage Foundation, "China Global Investment Tracker," http://www.aei.org/china-global-investment-tracker/.2 Belt and Road Portal, "China's non-financial ODI in B&#38;R countries rose to 3.76 billion dollars in Q1," April 17, 2019, https://eng.yidaiyilu.gov.cn/qwyw/rdxw/86102.htm and Ministry of Commerce, People's Republic of China, "Investment and Cooperation with Countries along Belt and Road Routes in January-October of 2018," November 23, 2018,            http://english.mofcom.gov.cn/article/statistic/foreigntradecooperation/201812/20181202815840.shtml.3 Belt and Road Portal, International Cooperation Profiles, https://eng.yidaiyilu.gov.cn/info/iList.jsp?cat_id=10076.4 Lihuan Zhou, et al., "Moving the Green Belt and Road Initiative: From Words to Actions," World Resources Institute and Boston University Global Development Policy Center working paper, October 2018, https://www.bu.edu/gdp/files/2018/11/GDP-and-WRI-BRI-MovingtheGreenbelt.pdf.5 "China's non-financial ODI up 3.3 pct in first four months", Xinhua, May 16, 2019, http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-05/16/c_138063770.htm.6 Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, "President Xi Jinping Delivers Important Speech and Proposes to Build a Silk Road Economic Belt with Central Asian Countries," September 7, 2013, https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/topics_665678/xjpfwzysiesgjtfhshzzfh_665686/t1076334.shtml and State Administration of Foreign Exchange, "Data and Statistics,"            https://www.safe.gov.cn/en/DataandStatistics/index.html (accessed June 2, 2019).7 China Global Television Network, "Share of Chinese RMB in global payments rose to 3-year high in Jan.," March 1, 2019, https://news.cgtn.com/news/3d3d414d3449444d33457a6333566d54/index.html and International Monetary Fund, "Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves,            https://data.imf.org/?sk=E6A5F467-C14B- 4AA8-9F6D-5A09EC4E62A4 (updated March 29, 2019).8 The equivalent US rise was a disturbing but considerably smaller $17.4 trillion.

Thank you so much and happy Friday to you. Good morning, everyone. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Friday, April 5th. Jobs Day, your top stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Taking the blame, a stunning admission from the CEO of Boeing. He is now acknowledging for the first time that the company is responsible for the two deadly crashes of its 737 Max Jet. We have the very latest this morning. Jobs in America, the March Jobs Report is out in 2-1/2 hours, 8:30 a.m. Eastern. What to expect and what it says about the economy right now. And, "Make a deal," that's what a New York judge told Tesla CEO Elon Musk yesterday and the Securities and Exchange Commission at the hearing. Musk's reaction, details on Tesla's new in-car videogames as well all coming up. Dividing assets, Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos finalized their divorce. But Jeff Bezos will keep the controlling stake in Amazon stock. We will have the billion dollar details on that settlement. MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.All right. Markets right now look like this. We got futures indicating a higher opening for the broader averages this morning. Take a look, Dow Industrials up 27 points. The S&P is up 4-1/2, and the NASDAQ up 16 points right now. We are waiting on any news out of U.S.-China trade talks in Washington this morning. As well, we've got the Jobs Report out as you just heard, that typically is a market mover. So, we'll wait for any news out of the China story. Secretary Pompeo will be in the studio this morning, giving us an update on that and really delving into what's happening within the negotiations and China's behavior in particular. We'll talk with the Secretary about all of that.Meanwhile, we're going to top it off with Boeing this morning. A stunning admission yesterday by the CEO, Dennis Muilenburg. He admitted mistakes and offered condolences to 717 Max crash victims' families in a video statement. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DENNIS MUILENBURG, CEO, BOEING: These tragedies continue to weigh heavily on our hearts and minds. And we extend our sympathies to the loved ones of the passengers and crew onboard Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. With the release of the preliminary report of the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accident investigation, it's apparent that in both flights, the maneuvering characteristics augmentation system, known as MCAS, activated in response to erroneous angle of attack information. As pilots have told us, erroneous activation of the MCAS function can add to what is already a high workload environment. It's our responsibility to eliminate this risk. We own it, and we know how to do it.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is a member of the Senate Subcommittee on Aviation and Space, Senator Shelley Moore Capito and it is great to see you, Senator.SEN. SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO (R-WV), THE SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE ON AVIATION AND SPACE MEMBER: Good morning. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for being here. Your reaction to what took place in Boeing now. We're actually hearing the CEO take responsibility for this. What happens now?CAPITO: Well, I think we need to find out why these planes were still flying with these anomalies, very deadly anomaly in the --in the -- in the technical space, the computer space of the plane. We had a hearing just last week with FAA to question them as to why the planes flew a little bit longer, the American planes flew a little bit longer than some all around the world. I think there's a lot to look at here. And the training space, is there a different training for African or European pilots than there are for American pilots?BARTIROMO: Oh, wow.CAPITO: I just think that there's just a whole lot of unanswered questions.BARTIROMO: And, I mean, given the fact that he is now taking responsibility for this, you would expect lawsuits are going to just flood in into Boeing.CAPITO: I would imagine.BARTIROMO: Yes.CAPITO: I mean I would imagine, so yes.BARTIROMO: We'll watch that and we'll certainly watch the stock's performance this morning as well. Meanwhile the President is headed to the Southern Border later this morning.CAPITO: Uh-hmm.BARTIROMO: The President urging Mexico to enforce its immigration laws or face potential economic penalties. Here's what the President said yesterday.CAPITO: All right.BARTIROMO: I'd love to get your reaction.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They have the strongest immigration laws, as strong as there is anywhere in the world. They can do it if they want to do it. They've never really wanted to do it for many, many years. And we've told them, if you don't do that, we're going to close the border. But before we close the border, we'll put the tariffs on the cars. I don't think we'll ever have to close the border because the penalty of tariffs on cars coming in to the United States from Mexico, at 25 percent will be massive.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: You know, the President using whatever levers he can --CAPITO: Right.BARTIROMO: -- to get Mexico to move. You are chairing a hearing on Thursday with the Department of Homeland Security, Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, regarding the Homeland Security's 2020 budget. Talk to us about that. First, your reaction to what's taking place at the border right now.CAPITO: Well, let's look at the March numbers. The President's going to release these today, over a hundred thousand people just in the -- in the March month. Fifty-three percent of these are families. Nine thousand of these are unaccompanied minors. These numbers are staggering and they're growing every -- exponentially every month. In February, it was -- it was in the 70,000's, so, you know, we got a real problem, a serious problem here.And we need Mexico's help. We need the other countries to help cooperate because we're not able to stop it where we are, 93,000 of those that came over last month came over away from the ports of entry. So, they're coming in, in areas in Texas and California that have no barriers.BARTIROMO: And anybody who goes to the border can attest to the fact that this is actually a crisis.CAPITO: Right.BARTIROMO: And it is getting worse. Your colleagues on the Left, what are you hearing from them when they're actually seeing the picture? I mean is it that they just do not want to admit that the President is correct on this issue?CAPITO: I think they don't want to admit that the President is correct. I think that the numbers speak for themselves.BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly.CAPITO: And you can tell that the coyotes and other -- and cartels that are encouraging this on the other side, see how vulnerable we are in terms of the discussion that here is in the -- in the Senate.BARTIROMO: Yes.CAPITO: But also the -- just the amount of families that are coming. We've got immigration loopholes that we've got to close. And we're not getting much cooperation.BARTIROMO: And I know people have figured out that if you're a family, you're getting treated better, they won't separate you and you'll --CAPITO: They can only hold you for 20 days.BARTIROMO: They can only hold you for 20 days so everyone's a family.CAPITO: Right.BARTIROMO: And it's not necessarily true. Let me ask you this before you go, how do you balance and how should the President balance, trying to hold Mexico's feet to the fire --CAPITO: Uh-hmm.BARTIROMO: -- in terms of doing something to aid this problem, but at the same time trying to get this USMCA confirmed. I mean a lot of Democrats have come on this program and said, "I'm not going to sign for that. I'm not going to vote for this as it is." What's your take on where USMCA goes?CAPITO: Well, I think he's got to get it up in front of the Congress because I think the uncertainty that we have right now with not having it fully confirmed and fully discussed on -- in congress is leaving a gap, a question. I personally will support this. I think that the President, when he campaigned, said he was going to rework NAFTA, he did, and he has.BARTIROMO: Are there areas that you think could be improved to placate or to, you know, agree with some of your colleagues on the left?CAPITO: You know, obviously cars is a big issue. We hear a lot from the automakers because of so much of the production is south of our border. We also have a lot of trade in the automobile space with Canada, but --BARTIROMO: But he's talking about putting a 25 percent tariff?CAPITO: Yes, that troubles me because I think, you know, we're at sort of a tenuous part here with the USMCA and I think we need to get it across the finish line.BARTIROMO: All right. Senator, it's great to have you on the program.CAPITO: Thank you so much.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Senator Shelley Moore Capito there. Meanwhile this, Elon Musk versus the Securities and Exchange Commission. A federal judge gave both sides a deadline yesterday to make a deal. Dagen McDowell on that. Good morning, Dagen.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Let me quickly sum it up, all of you knuckleheads have two weeks to come to a deal. That is essentially what the U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan told both the Securities and Exchange Commission and Elon Musk yesterday that they have got two weeks to craft a compromise to avoid the need to determine whether the Tesla CEO did in fact violate a court order, violate that settlement made with the SEC about his communications on social media. But the judge was a little bit hard on the SEC showing some kind of disappointment in the hearing. Let's take a look at Elon Musk's suit and tie he wore yesterday in court.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ELON MUSK, CEO, TESLA: I have great respect for the judges -- the justice system. I think the judges -- American systems are outstanding.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Elon, do you feel the --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Does it make you feel very loved here?MUSK: You bet.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Not only was there the usual press scrum in Lower Manhattan, but there were autograph seekers there as well for Elon Musk. I love this quote from the judge, told the parties to their reasonableness pants on, that's a mouthful. The SEC's asked and it's requested the court to spell out a series of escalating fines that would result if Elon Musk was found in contempt and later again violates the 2018 settlement deal. The stock was down off its lows of the day, but the stock was down more than eight percent yesterday, but that was on those deliveries in the first quarter coming up short.These are courtroom sketches of Elon Musk. Apparently, he was thorough in his (INAUDIBLE) quite a bit in the courtroom. Tesla shares are up in premarket trading today. Not what they lost yesterday, I have this. This was the best outcome for Elon Musk quite frankly.BARTIROMO: Yes. Right. He did. All right, Dagen. Thank you. We will see you in a bit on that. Meanwhile, Carlos Ghosn is staying behind bars in Tokyo. Cheryl Casone with the details there. Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Well, Maria, yes, Tokyo court has approved the re-arrest, excuse me, of Carlos Ghosn saying that the former Nissan Chairman can be held until at least April 14 without the possibility of bail. Ghosn was taken into custody during a dawn raid yesterday on new allegations of financial misconduct. And, of course, as you were us telling us yesterday on the show, the rate happened just as you were going to interview him. Ghosn has denied any wrongdoing.Well, now to Europe. British Prime Minister Theresa May asking the E.U. for another delay to leave the coalition. May telling European Council President Donald Tusk that she needs until June 30th to get a deal through parliament. Meanwhile, get this, Tusk reportedly is offering Britain a flexible 12-month extension on this one.And then staying with Britain, almost a father himself, Prince Harry probably is winning over a lot of parents with this. The Prince is now suggesting that the popular online videogame, Fortnite, be banned because it's too addictive. Now Harry criticized the excessive use of social media and gaming. He says they're more addictive than drugs and alcohol. Considering, Maria, how popular Fortnite is, good luck with that one.BARTIROMO: Yes.CASONE: But he's suggesting it anyway.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl. Thank you.CASONE: You bet.BARTIROMO: Quick break right here. And then closing in on a deal, President Trump says the U.S. and China are nearing a historic trade deal, though there are no plans for a summit just yet. He says the deal is not ready yet. Then making it official, Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos finalizing their divorce. How the couple divided their billion dollar plus empire, what it means for Amazon stock coming up, stay with us.BARTIROMO: We've got a big program this morning coming up. My first on FOX interview with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo this morning, join us for that. As well as my exclusive interview this morning with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. Former Senior Advisor to the Clintons, and Stagwell Group President and Managing Partner, Mark Penn, is here. We got a big show.And of course it is Jobs Day. We will get the jobs' numbers out and that typically is a market mover. We will tell you all about the estimates coming up. Meanwhile there is this, U.S.-China trade talks ongoing. President Trump says that the two sides are close to a historic deal. They are not ready to announce a summit yet. The President says there's deal yet. He's hoping to finalize a deal within the next four weeks, which will cover all the major issues, he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: They very much want to make a deal. We'll see what happens. It's going to be a good deal. It's going to be a good -- it's going to be a great deal. Technology, intellectual property theft, everything is covered. There's not a thing that's not covered. We could've made a quickie, but we're in a very good position. Our economy is way up. China's not way up and we're -- can either make a very good deal or we're not going to make a deal at all.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining the conversation this morning is the CEO of Rosecliff, Managing Partner, Mike Murphy, along with President of Professional Division at EmployBridge, Joanie Courtney, great to see you.JOANIE COURTNEY, PRESIDENT, EMPLOYBRIDGE: Great to be here.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us this morning.MIKE MURPHY, CEO, ROSECLIFF VENTURES: Good morning. Happy to be here.BARTIROMO: Yes. A lot to talk about. Dagen reported the Musk story yesterday. That was a big wow.MURPHY: Yes. And markets almost set all-time highs again. So, really interesting. Market's kind of looking past all the headlines, I think.BARTIROMO: And then there's the President nominating, making a pick for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors seat announcing plans to nominate former presidential candidate, Herman Cain. Cain has been in -- critical of the Federal Reserve, you know. He said in February that any potential appointment could not be considered a slam dunk because there's too much Trump hate out there. What -- what's your take on that?MURPHY: It's true. You know, there is a lot of it out there, but I think the Fed's getting a lot of slack right now -- getting a lot of flak right now for the job they've done over the last six months. But I think we'll get past that. I think the Fed needs to do a better job of not roiling the markets with comments that they're making.BARTIROMO: Yes, because they were on autopilot at the end of the year Joanie. And yet the economy is doing well, but not as well as the Fed was suggesting last year.COURTNEY: Yes. And, you know, the Fed is always paying attention, of course, to this Jobs Report, which is something they're not only looking at the big number, but they really pay attention to the wages and labor participation. But they have gotten a lot of slack, that maybe they raised rates too quick, or that, you know, and you've heard President Trump really speak to that. So, I think it's an interesting pick for a nomination.BARTIROMO: So what are you -- what are you expecting out of the Jobs Report this morning? What's your characterization of the economy right now in terms of jobs?COURTNEY: You know, the job market is still very strong. So, there's still 7.6 million job openings. So, February was a big surprise and people said it was such a weak job report. February really wasn't a weak job report, the headline number was weak, the 20,000. There's a lot of other good news in that report. I do think we could look at a revision today to February, so that's going to be very interesting to see. I also think we'll see a pretty decent number. If there is a lower number, my suspicion is that it's still about a skills gap. And maybe employers are being a bit caution, you know, cautious with hiring due to trade or uncertainty. But there's a demand out there, that's for sure. There is definitely a demand for skilled talent.BARTIROMO: Yes, we definitely have a skillset.MCDOWELL: Before we move on to Herman Cain and then Stephen Moore also, being put up by President Trump for the Federal Reserve. President Trump keeps railing on Jay Powell and the monetary policy despite the very rapid pivot of earlier this year based on the Fed. These are critics. So, he continues to rail on the -- rail against the Fed and Jay Powell said these are two critics that he's trying to put on the Federal Reserve Board. They will both be bruising confirmation battles. There's financial issues that had come out for Steve Moore. There were -- denied by Herman Cain, but sexual harassment allegations against him when he was running for the Republican nomination. So, again, very unusual picks. Critics of the Federal Reserve in the past, but he's -- this is a big fight that he is getting ready to wage.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: In terms of getting these guys on the Federal Reserve.BARTIROMO: He's not afraid to.MURPHY: No.MCDOWELL: No, he's not.COURTNEY: Not afraid of confrontation.BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE) fight, yes. Not at all. The China trade talks. Of course a deal would be a positive for the markets. The President is making sure, I guess, cross every t and dot the i's in terms of the I.P. theft and the force transfer of technology. Can he do it?MURPHY: I think he can, and I think he is. And I think, you know, to hear it yesterday where I want to include I.P. theft, I think it just makes -- if you -- rather than trying to criticize, if you take a step back and say so he wants to make sure China's not stealing United States intellectual property.BARTIROMO: Which they have been doing for decades.MURPHY: How could you have -- I mean that seems like a pretty good starting point or something that has to be on the plan. So, I think he will get it done. I think it's very close.BARTIROMO: And if he doesn't, it's not going to be a deal.MCDOWELL: I don't know what he's talking about, by the way. By the way, with the tariffs on cars coming out of Mexico, I don't --I have no idea man where that came from, but he does -- he has tariff as they said.BARTIROMO: Look, look, he's trying to come up with whatever lever he can to put the Mexico officials on notice, that he needs help with the order.MCDOWELL: And delay closing the border, which I think was the reason that he said that.BARTIROMO: I think he's backpedalling on that one.MCDOWELL: Yes.BARTIROMO: Yes. A lot of criticism on that. And huge impact to the economy.MCDOWELL: Right. Exactly.BARTIROMO: We're going to take a short break. When we come back, we'll be covering the very latest on the March Jobs Report this morning. We got full coverage beginning at 8:00 a.m. Eastern, all hands on deck, so do join us for that. But first, dividing assets, Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos finalizing their divorce, splitting up the billion dollar plus Empire. We've got the numbers for you coming up next.And then the New York Jets reveal new uniforms for 2019, but the Twitter universe not reacting kindly. This morning, we will show you what the reaction is and the uniforms coming up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, the divorce is final. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, agreeing to a settlement that divides their shares of Amazon. Under the agreement, Jeff will own 12 percent of Amazon stop valued at $170 billion. MacKenzie will own four percent value at $35 billion making her the third richest woman in the world. So, she'll keep a quarter of the overall stock that they own currently.In addition, Jeff Bezos will keep voting power on MacKenzie stock and will retain full ownership of The Washington Post and Blue Origin. MacKenzie said in a statement yesterday that she is going to be talking about this in the future and that she is happy to hold just a quarter of his stocks.Joining us right now is Trial Attorney, Misty Marris, rather, pardon me, to talk more about that. And Misty, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.MISTY MARRIS, TRIAL ATTORNEY: Thank you for having me.BARTIROMO: Your reaction to the details here?MARRIS: Look, I think that this is a lightning speed settlement, when you're talking about the astronomer amount of assets that were in play.BARTIROMO: Yes.MARRIS: That tells me that there was great painstaking to make sure stock holders are not going to film nervous. Nothing makes a stockholder more leery, then the prospect of litigation that could go on for years and years and years. Especially after we saw these tweets about how, you know, they had happy marriage. And everyone's happy to move forward, that is certainly part of the intent here, to make sure stockholders are feeling good about the company.BARTIROMO: Yes. What did you think about it?MURPHY: But I guess the settlement though gives -- it's fair enough. I mean there's plenty of money there, you could ask for another billion --MCDOWELL: Wait a minute.MURPHY: -- or another 10 grand.MCDOWELL: Half. I want half.BARTIROMO: I don't know. I --MCDOWELL: I quote Eddie Murphy, half.MARRIS: You make a great point though because she has all of the legal arguments to get half under these circumstances.BARTIROMO: She said she (INAUDIBLE)MURPHY: I'll take an eighth. I'm on the other side of Dagen. I'll get -- I'll take an eighth.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: She's happy to take a quarter, but we're joking about it, but why is she taking a quarter and not half?MARRIS: I think that that's because she had all of the legal arguments to take up. There was no prenup. They're in Washington State, which is a community property, which means ultimately, if she wanted to go to court, she would be entitled to half the asset. So, the only reason that you're not going to go for that is because you want to split perhaps amicably and again I think it's in both of their interest that Amazon isn't negatively impacted by this.BARTIROMO: Yes. And he's going to -- he's going to keep 75 percent of this stock. You're right, it's all about what -- he probably convinced her, "Well, look, we don't want a massive market selloff.MARRIS: Right. Absolutely. And he's retaining voting power so it's not different for the investors. Right? So everything is going to be pretty much the same for them, he's just giving up a certain percentage of his of his stock.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: We don't know how the properties are being split up, but I don't think they own $35 billion in (AUDIO GAP) her, which would double her value of the stake in the company. And she also had a role in the company when it was being founded.BARTIROMO: And that's why.MCDOWELL: So, it's --BARTIROMO: She had every argument to go for more if she wanted to.MARRIS: Yes. But I think it's also the family, too. I mean they were very strong about they're going into this co-parenting together.MCDOWELL: Yes.BARTIROMO: Yes, you're right.MARRIS: So, yes. It's a (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: Children shouldn't suffer. Misty Marris, thank you so much.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Friday, April 5th, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.It's job's Friday, jobs in America, the March jobs report out in 8:00 a.m. Eastern, two hours from now, the very latest on what it shows about the economy right now, and will it move markets? We are all over it. Ahead of the numbers, Futures have a firmer tone this morning.We're looking at a rally at the start of trading, Dow Industrials up about 30 points right now, S&P 500 up 4, and the NASDAQ up 15 points, a quarter of a percent. Yesterday, the market was up, Dow Industrials up 166-1/2 points, fueled by advances in trade-sensitive stocks from Dow and Boeing.The S&P added just under six points, but the NASDAQ gave back a bit, down three points at the close, yesterday.In Europe this morning, take a look at the indices, we've got the European markets mixed, FT 100 is up about 11 points, CAC Quarante is up 12, but the DAX Index in Germany down 7, this morning.Shares mostly higher in Asia, overnight, U.S.-China trade talks in Washington, making progress, as a result, you did see some firmness. Japan, the big winner, Nikkei Average up just a fraction, but Chinese markets in Shanghai -- the Shanghai and the Hong Kong, Hang Seng Index closed, overnight.Deadline missed, Chicago, ready to take action after actor Jussie Smollett missed a deadline to pay for the cost of the investigation, into the alleged assault on the actor, the city's next step, coming up, and major jewelry stores closing their doors, more on Kay, Zales and Jared, this morning.Plus, the New York Jets' new look, the team reveals it's 2019 uniforms and Twitter had a very quick response, as you'd expect, we're going to bring it to you.First this, though, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in Washington, this week, meeting with President Trump, the two discussing NATO funding, the Russian threat, and the rise of China on the global stage.I sat down with Secretary Stoltenberg to talk about these issues and more, and we began with his historic address to Congress, as NATO marks 70 years, this week.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)JENS STOLTENBERG, SECRETARY GENERAL, NATO: Well, NATO is, by far, the longest lasting alliance in history, but also the most successful alliance in history because we have been able to preserve peace and safeguard freedom for 70 years.This is, of course, great importance for Europe, but it's also important for the United States, because through NATO, the United States has more friends and more allies than any other power.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The President of the United States certainly noted in a somewhat more of a combative way that many NATO members are not paying their fair share. Since the President voiced his concern, have you seen a big change?STOLTENBERG: What we have seen is that the clear message from President Trump on defense spending on burden sharing is having a real impact because all NATO allies have now started to invest more. European allies in Canada have added since 2016, $41 billion extra to the defense budget. And by the end of next year, this figure will rise to $100 billion. So, this is making NATO stronger.BARTIROMO: And, of course, at the very beginning, the creation of NATO, it was really to shield against aggression, aggressive nations, in particular, the Soviet Union. So, assess for us, Russia, because we have a situation now, where many people believe that Russia is trying to replace the United States as the main outside force within the Middle East.And of course, is doing deals in European nations and many times being questioned in terms of its loyalty to the globe, in terms of alliances. How do you see Russia today?STOLTENBERG: NATO has to deal with a more assertive Russia, because you have seen that Russia has heavily invested in more than military equipment, including nuclear weapons. They have used military force against neighbors, Georgia and Ukraine.They are increasing their presence in the Middle East, and they're also using cyber and what we call hybrid tactics to try to meddle into our democratic processes.All of this is of great concern and therefore, NATO has implemented the biggest reinforcements our (INAUDIBLE) defense since the end of the Cold War, with higher end forces, with combat ready troops in the Eastern part of the alliance.And also, modernizing the whole command structure how NATO is working because we need to be able to respond and to -- and to maintain credible deterrence and defense when we see a more assertive Russia.BARTIROMO: Yes, which is why the President has questioned the arrangement where Germany is getting, for example, gas, from Russia. Shouldn't Germany be looking toward a NATO member, an alliance partner, like the United States, for such a purchase?STOLTENBERG: NATO allies realize that energy price has security implications and therefore, we welcome that allies are attempting to diversify their supplies of energy. We are seeing some allies really making progress, for instance, Poland and Lithuania.The issue of the new pipeline from Russia is an issue which divides NATO allies. And NATO is not an energy institution, so we don't make decisions on concrete projects like that. The most important thing is that we see that allies are stepping up and Germany is part of that.Germany leads one of our battle groups in the Eastern part of the alliance, in Lithuania, and Germany is also increasing defense spending as response to ever more demanding security environment that (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: Well, I'm glad you mentioned that, Germany increasing defense spending. Because the defense increases in NATO defense increases will total close to $100 billion by the end of 2019. Yet, Germany is now forecasting a reduction in their defense budget.Are you comfortable with that and that other Germany -- and those other members will meet that two percent target?STOLTENBERG: I expect that all allies, including Germany, make, you know, make good on the promise we all made together, and that is to increase defense spending, improve burden sharing within the alliance. Germany has started to increase.We have seen health increases in the last years, and also the proposed budget for next year, for 2020, has an increase in German defense spending or implies increased defense spending in Germany. But I expect them to do more.And this has been one of the main issues that has been discussed at our foreign ministerial meeting in Washington, this week. All allies need to make good on their promises, invest more, and that also -- that's also the case for Germany.BARTIROMO: What about missile defense systems and military equipment, for example, your position on Turkey, given the fact that it's acquiring the Russian's S-400 missile defense system? If there were a confrontation between NATO and Russia, is it not likely that Russia would deny Turkey the necessary spare parts to sustain that S-400 system?STOLTENBERG: The S-400 system will not, in any way, be part of the integrated NATO air and missile defense system. That's not possible to integrate into our system. Second, NATO provide support for Turkey. We augment their air defenses with patriot batteries and also, an Italian- French systems anti deployed by Italy and Turkey.So, we already provide support to Turkey when it comes to air defense, but we also recognize that the issue of S-400 is an issue that creates divisions, especially between Turkey and the United States. And we support efforts to try to find a solution.And NATO is a platform for allies to meet and to sit down, and to address issues like, for instance, the S-400 procurement.BARTIROMO: Secretary Mike Pompeo just back, recently, from Europe, talking about the China threat, in particular, Huawei, where many nations there, including Poland, have the Huawei infrastructure which has been said to be really an espionage platform for the Chinese government. What are your thoughts on the threat of the rising China situation?STOLTENBERG: China is a rising power with a growing economy, investing heavily in new military capabilities, and we're also seeing that China is coming closer to Europe, to NATO allies, in Europe, in cyberspace, in the arctic, in the Mediterranean.And several NATO allies have expressed concerns about also Huawei and Chinese investments in critical infrastructure. And we take these concerns very seriously, and that's also the reason why NATO allies had to address the security implications of the rise of China.At the same time, we believe there's a potential for also a partnership with China, and our military and Chinese military and NATO military have met and have looked into ways also to work together.BARTIROMO: Explain the threat of Huawei. Assess the situation for us, because, you know, the European nations have pushed back. Certainly, you see what's taking place in Italy, for one, also Poland said look, we -- you know, we are worried about Huawei.And yet, Germany is talking about the fact that they can't dismantle the Huawei infrastructure and build another one. It's too expensive. What is the specific threat around Huawei?STOLTENBERG: This has traditionally been an issue, which has been related to economy, to trade, to investments, which is not a NATO responsibility. At the same time, we all understand that infrastructure -- investments and infrastructure can also have security implications, and therefore, NATO has developed some guidelines for the resilience of critical infrastructure.And now, NATO says those guidelines also, which I say when it comes to investments in, for instance, 5G networks. So, this is an issue which is important for all NATO allies. And we also discussed it with the European Union.BARTIROMO: When I spoke with Secretary Pompeo recently, he said look, if the Europeans continue to use the Huawei infrastructure, we will have to share less information with them. That was quite telling if the U.S. is going to hold back on key information with allies. Do you agree that's the right move?STOLTENBERG: Well, that's one of the examples of the concerns that allies have expressed, and the United States has been very clear on this issue, but as I said, this is not an issue which is discussed among NATO allies and also within the European Union.And this is an ongoing discussion based on the concerns which several nations have expressed related to these kinds of new technologies.BARTIROMO: Mr. Secretary, you had a meeting with the President, this past week. Can you tell us about it? Are these the priorities that you discussed with the President?STOLTENBERG: It was a useful and good meeting with President Trump. We discussed a wide range of issues, especially the importance of burden- sharing, making NATO a fair alliance, where allies invest more in defense. And I told them about their progress, $100 billion that will come into the defense budgets of European allies and Canada.And, of course, I also told him about the need to do even more. We also discussed Afghanistan and the importance of trying not to create the conditions for a peaceful negotiated solution, but also making sure that Afghanistan doesn't, once again, become a safe haven for international terrorists.That was the reason why I went into Afghanistan, preventing that country from being a kind of a launch pad for new attacks against United States or the NATO allies. And then also, of course, Russia, Russia is now in violation of the INF treaty, a treaty that has banned all intermediate range weapons, Russia violates that by deploying new missiles. And this is of great concern for all NATO allies.BARTIROMO: So, what is the answer to this? How do you fight back? This has come up several times, and yet Russia is moving on its way and moving forward with its own plans.STOLTENBERG: Our answer is what we call a dual track approach, and that is strong deterrence, strong defense combined with dialogue. We have to show Russia that if they want to confront us, we are ready and we are united and we are firm.But at the same time, we are open for dialogue with Russia. Russia is our neighbor, Russia's here to stay. We need to strive for a better relationship with Russia, but we also need to engage with Russia or to talk to Russia on issues like arms-control.BARTIROMO: Mr. Secretary, it's good to see you, thanks so much for joining us today.STOLTENBERG: Thank you so much for having me.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: All right, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg there. Tune in at 7:00 a.m. Eastern this morning, for my first on FOX interview with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. He is going to join us, give us an update on China and the border, as well.Coming up, giving up on malls, more Kay, Zales and Jared jewelry stores closed. Plus, the New York Jets celebrating a new look for the new season, fans, not so much, the online backlash, right after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Headlines across America this morning. The Chicago Tribune reporting, Chicago says it's prepared to sue after an "Empire" actor, Jussie Smollett, missed the deadline to repay $130,000. This the city is demanding Smollett pay the cost of police overtime hours during its investigation of his alleged hate crime. A statement from the city says, it will pursue the full measure of damages allowed by the city law and the prosecutor who dropped the charges is also that calling for her to step down.The Miami Herald this morning says: "A study confirms what everybody in Miami already knew, you are never leaving your parents' house. Miami finishing second in a magnify money study on the list of cities where adults between 25 and 40 -- 40, still live at home. Riverside, California -- number one.The New York Post this morning writes this: "Twitter had a lot to say about the Jets' new uniform." The team unveiled their new uniforms yesterday, three colors are called Gotham Green, Spotlight White and Stealth Black. Reaction was mixed online. Some said that they looked like high school jerseys. That's in the New York Post this morning. Mike Murphy, your thoughts?MURPHY: I think the jets have a lot of things to worry about besides their uniform. They look fine to me. Let's get a couple of wins; let's get (INAUDIBLE) out there, throwing some touchdown passes. It's been a long time for jet fans. Uniforms is the least of my concern.BARTIROMO: Yes, but the Twitter-verse comments on everything, Dagen.MCDOWELL: In racing, green is bad luck, so maybe that's their problem.(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Maybe, they just feel like they needed a change, you know.BARTIROMO: They're not going to change their colors.MCDOWELL: I want to mention the thing -- the story from Miami about people living at home. You know, it's a large Latino community, very faith-based. And so, these are the kinds of families that we also grew up in. So, it's no weird. Miami is amazing, one. Why would anybody ever leave? Two. And it's -- you just stay at home and you take care of one another.BARTIROMO: I lived at home for a longtime.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's a really good point, Dagen.BARTIROMO: I'm not bothered by it. And I love living at home.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I would love if my kids stayed longer. I know they're -- you know, anxious to even go to college, but I can't even think about them moving out of the house.MCDOWELL: My dad gave me $20.00 and told me to get out. So, look what happened with me. But now, they were like, come back --BARTIROMO: Exactly.MCDOWELL: They need --BARTIROMO: And now, you want to go back.MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly.BARTIROMO: All right, coming up, retail slowdown. Kay, Zales and Jared among the major jewelers closing their doors. We'll tell you what's behind that, next. And then, the superhero for everybody else.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: His name, is Captain Sparkle fingers.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, it's not! That's not my name.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: "Shazam" hits theaters this weekend. More from the box office in your weekend box office. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The owner of Kay Jewelers, Zales and Jared, closing more stores. Cheryl Casone with the details now. Cheryl, good morning.CASONE: Good morning again, Maria. Well, Signet Jewelers is closing 150 stores. And so, the company reported a drop in same-store sales in its latest quarter. That is after more than 260 locations were shattered as part of Signet's three-year plan to reduce the number of stores by out 13 percent. Most of this round of closings happening after the 2019 holiday season.Well, is Sears planning to open its first batch of smaller store next month. They're going to focusing on appliances, mattresses and home services. The first three stores were called Sears Home and Life -- they're going to open on Memorial Day weekend in Alaska, Louisiana and Kansas. These stores a fraction of the size of the traditional Sears. The company emerged from bankruptcy in February.Then, there is this. We've got (INAUDIBLE) a scream at the movies this weekend. Warner Bros. -- very kid friendly, "Shazam", opens up today. It's part of Warner Bros. D.C. Universe of films. The studio anticipates 45-50 million for Shazam's debut. Analyst anticipated the same. If you're not into horror, well, how about this? "Pet Sematary" is back. Plenty of scary moment in this one. The Paramount movie, of course, a remake of the 1989 original adaptation of a Stephen King classic novel. The studio expecting about $20 million for that one this weekend. So, I don't know about you, but the kids in the 70s -- whoever might be in the room -- I remember "Shazam" the T.V. show, when they were children.BARTIROMO: Yes.MURPHY: I'll be at "Shazam" at some point this weekend.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: With all the kids taking them to the movies. I do think it's interesting that we're seeing, you know, more of these closings right, with retail on -- and you know, not -- you know, people saying this: are we going into a recession? Are we not -- I think we're seeing more and more businesses take action just to prepare themselves with what's happening? Obviously, sales are down, their business is moving to e- commerce. But when you look at this, you can see that there's some preparations for you --MCDOWELL: You know what, it's online, these are Cynthia Rybakoff earrings. They're not very expensive, and I always wanted to give a shout out to her. She's amazing.BARTIROMO: They're beautiful.MURHPY: People are now comfortable ordering jewelry online. So, tough for the Ks of the world.BARTIROMO: Like Dagen's earrings.MCDOWELL: Right.BARTIROMO: That are sparkling all morning.

Part of the US China trade truce is already drawing bipartisan criticism from Republican senatorsBusiness Insider USJune 29, 2019 Saturday 02:53 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 532 wordsByline: mjay@businessinsider.com,  (Marley Jay)Highlight: The US-China trade truce looks complicated as President Trump's bid to soften sanctions on Chinese tech company Huawei draws criticism in the Senate.BodyREUTERS/Jorge Silva/File photo• An important part of the newly announced US-China trade truce might already be in trouble in the Senate.• President Donald Trump says US companies can continue selling products to Chinese tech giant Huawei, which appeared to contradict a Commerce Department rule that says they can't make those sales without a government license.• Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republicans Marco Rubio both said they oppose Trump's announcement, and Rubio said a large majority of the Senate would support a law backing up the Huawei ban.  • Visit Business Insider's home page for more stories.The trade war truce between the US and China might be running into trouble as members of the Senate criticize a crucial part of the deal.A major part of the trade dispute is the Trump administration's decision to bar US companies from selling goods to Chinese tech giant Huawei. On Saturday Trump said sales to Huawei can continue, although he also suggested it wouldn't be removed from the blacklist yet as negotiations continued.Several members of the US Senate said Trump shouldn't undo the ban. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that removing the ban would "dramatically undercut our ability to change China's unfair trades practices."Republican Marco Rubio went further, saying that undoing the sanctions entirely would be a "colossal mistake." In another tweet, he said that the Senate could pass a bill in support of those restrictions. Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1144979771073454080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw If President Trump has in fact bargained away the recent restrictions on #Huawei, then we will have to get those restrictions put back in place through legislation. And it will pass with a large veto proof majority. Republican Cory Gardner of Colorado also said national security was more important than sales to Huawei. The Trump administration reportedly believes that the Chinese government uses Huawei's equipment for spying purposes, an allegation Huawei denies. In May, Trump signed an executive order blocking US companies from doing business with Huawei.Despite the national security aspects of the issue, it immediately became part of the trade war.

US blacklists 5 Chinese groups working in supercomputingAssociated Press Financial WireJune 22, 2019 Saturday 12:24 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: WASHINGTON DATELINELength: 719 wordsByline: By PAUL WISEMAN and FRANK BAJAK, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - The United States is blacklisting five Chinese organizations involved in supercomputing with military-related applications, citing national security as justification for denying its Asian geopolitical rival access to critical U.S. technology.The move Friday by the U.S. Commerce Department could complicate talks next week between President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, aimed at de-escalating a trade dispute between the world's two biggest economies.The five blacklisted organizations placed on the so-called Entity List includes supercomputer maker Sugon, which is heavily dependent on U.S. suppliers including chipmakers Intel, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.The other four are the Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology and three Sugon affiliates. The Commerce Department called their activities "contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States."Sugon and the Wuxi Jiangnan Institute, which the U.S. said is owned by a Chinese army research institute, are involved in China's push to develop next-generation "exascale" high performance computing to assist with military modernization. The technology involved supports such military-related tasks as running nuclear simulations, calculating missile trajectories and hypersonic algorithms, said Paul Triolo, technology analyst with the global risk-assessing Eurasia Group."This is all about the race to exascale computing, which China has designated as a major priority," he said, adding that companies such as Sugon have received major government backing.Of particular concern to China hawks in the Trump administration, Triolo added, is Sugon's move to develop a next-generation processor of its own. It licensed one generation of AMD technology as part of a 2016 joint venture in which a Sugon subsidiary has an ownership stake.An AMD spokesperson said the company was reviewing the order "to determine next steps related to our joint ventures."In recent years, U.S. and Chinese companies have been alternating as leading producers of the world's fastest supercomputers. Sugon had 63 of the top 500 in the most recent rankings .The blacklist effectively bars U.S. firms from selling technology to the Chinese organizations without government approval. Last month, Commerce last month added telecommunications giant Huawei to it, heightening tensions with Beijing .This is not the first time the U.S. has placed on the Entity List a Chinese organization involved in supercomputer development with military uses. In 2015 it added China's National University of Defense Technology to the Entity List."The U.S. is gradually squeezing off access to US technology for major elements of China's next generation supercomputing," said Triolo. The long-running campaign isn't directly related to Trump's current trade war with China.Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports and is preparing to target another $300 billion, extending the import taxes to virtually everything China ships to the United States. China has retaliated with tariffs on U.S. products.Talks to resolve the dispute broke off last month. But Trump and Xi are scheduled to meet next week at the Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan, to get the negotiations back on track."Adding more Chinese companies to the U.S. bad guys list may be seen as a way to ramp up the pressure on China," said Amanda DeBusk, a partner at Dechert LLP and the former Commerce Department assistant secretary for export enforcement. "However, the Chinese may see this as ill-timed bullying. They cannot be seen as making concessions to the United States, so this may have the effect of hurting any chances for trade agreement."The administration appeared to be sending mixed signals ahead of the summit.In what looked like a goodwill gesture to Beijing, Vice President Mike Pence postponed a speech planned for Monday at a Washington think tank at which he was expected to criticize China's communist regime.Asia specialist Tami Overby, senior director at the McLarty Associates consultancy, said that "it seems odd" that the Trump administration would delay Pence's speech and then turn around and expand its tech blacklist.___Bajak reported from Boston.

NATO MEMBERS RISK LOSING US INTEL OVER CHINA TECHStates News ServiceApril 4, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 537 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):Jeff SeldinSome European countries could soon find themselves cut off from U.S. intelligence and other critical information if they continue to cultivate relationships with Chinese technology firms.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued the warning Thursday, following a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Washington."We've done our risk analysis," Pompeo said. "We have now shared that with our NATO partners, with countries all around the world. We've made clear that if the risk exceeds the threshold for the United States, we simply won't be able to share that information any longer."U.S. defense and intelligence officials have warned repeatedly in recent years of a growing threat that information shared over Chinese-built networks or Chinese-made devices could be stolen or copied and shared with the Chinese government.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gestures while speaking during a news conference at the U.S. State Department in Washington, April 4, 2019.More recently, concerns have focused on China's Huawei and ZTE, which have been offering to build advanced, high-speed 5G for mobile devices across Europe.A report issued earlier this week by the U.S. Defense Innovation Board, which advises the Pentagon, raised the possibility Huawei already is building so-called "backdoors," or security vulnerabilities, into its software and products."Many of these seem to be related to requirements from the Chinese intelligence community pressuring companies to exfiltrate information about domestic users," the report said, citing the example of Xiongmai, a Chinese security camera maker that was using Huawei code to allow unauthorized access to millions of cameras.While some European countries have acknowledged U.S. concerns, the European Union has rejected calls for a blanket ban on Huawei, in particular.NATO responseAs for NATO, some officials, including Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, have called for more consultations and have suggested the need for a more nuanced response, given there are currently few alternatives in Europe to Huawei's 5G technology."We're just in the preliminary stages," NATO analyst and consultant Benedetta Berti said earlier this week in Washington."We need to take stock of our critical vulnerabilities, of the impact of external investments on our critical infrastructure," she said. "We will come to a common strategic understanding."U.S. urgencyBut U.S. officials are pushing for greater urgency."It is as important for NATO as it is for us," State Department Director of Policy Planning Kiron Skinner told reporters this week. "How European countries address China's involvement across all of their sectors is central to American security," he added."When a nation shows up and offers you goods that are well below market, one ought to ask what else is at play," Pompeo said Thursday, calling the offers from Chinese technology companies "literally too good to be true.""There is undoubtedly the risk that NATO or the United States will not be able to share information in the same way it could if there were not Chinese systems inside of those networks, inside of those capabilities," he said.Load-Date: April 5, 2019End of Document

Mahathir urges US to talk with China, accept its greatnessAssociated Press InternationalMay 30, 2019 Thursday 10:23 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 507 wordsByline: By HARUKA NUGA, Associated PressDateline: TOKYO BodyTOKYO (AP) - Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Thursday called for talks to resolve the ongoing trade dispute between Washington and Beijing and urged the world to accept China's technological prowess.The U.S. cannot expect to always be at the top in technology, and countries need to talk to deal with a powerful China, Mahathir said at a conference in Tokyo. He also appeared to side with Chinese telecom giant Huawei, which the U.S. has put on a blacklist."We try to make use of their technology as much as possible," Mahathir told the Future of Asia conference, noting that Huawei has achieved a "tremendous advance over American technology.""We have to accept that the U.S. cannot forever be the supreme nation in the world that can have the best technology in the world," he said.For months, the world's two biggest economies have been locked in a standoff over trade balances and technology, including allegations that China uses unfair tactics, such as stealing trade secrets.The Trump administration has imposed 25% tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports and is planning to tax another $300 billion in imports that have so far been spared. It escalated the stakes this month by effectively barring U.S. companies from supplying Huawei with computer chips, software and other components without government approval.Mahathir's comments drew praise from China's foreign ministry, which said it hoped all countries would listen carefully to the prime minister's advice and "seek opportunities of mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation.""All developing countries, including China and Malaysia, surely have the right to develop their capabilities and improve their technological progress," ministry spokesman Lu Kang said at his daily briefing. "In fact, against the backdrop of economic globalization today, mutual development and common progress through mutually beneficial cooperation can open up more room for development for all countries."Lu added that U.S. has provided no evidence that Huawei is a tool of the Chinese government."The U.S. has been sidestepping the issue that everyone is most concerned about all along, that is, whether it can present evidence," he said.In his comments Thursday, Mahathir stressed that nations with differing ideologies must be able to get along."It is worth it to talk to each other and stop this confrontation," he said. He warned that conflict between the U.S. and China would only lead to "greater destruction.""We want to see reasonable, responsible countries sit down around a table and discuss problems. How do we deal with China, a strong China which is very rich because China has got money," he said.Mahathir arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday and leaves Friday.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has meetings with Mahathir and leaders of six other Asian nations this week, part of his administration's policy of courting Europe, the U.S. and other nations in part to counter China's growing global influence.___Follow Haruka Nuga on Twitter https://twitter.com/HarukaNugaLoad-Date: May 31, 2019End of Document

China buys a lot of oil from Iran and does not like the new US sanctionsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 24, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 560 wordsBody NEW YORK (CNN) - China is resisting the US decision to expand its crackdown on Iranian oil exports, compounding the uncertainty in the global oil market.  On Monday, the Chinese government criticized Trump's announcement that China is one of the main importers of Iranian oil, along with India.  "China opposes unilateral sanctions and the so-called 'long arm' jurisdictions that the United States imposes," said Chinese Foreign Minister Geng Shuang at a press conference on Monday, April 22. "Our cooperation with Iran is open, transparent, legal and legitimate, therefore it must be respected," he added.  Exemptions to sanctions were granted to China and seven other countries in 2018 and expire on May 2.  China was not the only country that challenged the most recent decision of the Trump government.  "Turkey rejects sanctions and unilateral impositions on how we interact with neighbors," Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Twitter on Monday.  The sanctions would have considerable consequences for those two countries in particular. Analysts say China and Turkey will have a harder time reducing their Iranian oil supplies, particularly in such a short time.  "I think China and Turkey will be the two most worrisome and will be the most disturbed by this action," said Tom Kloza, global director of Energy Analysis at the Oil Price Information Service. He said the US measure is "very disruptive."  "I did not think that this would become zero tolerance so soon," he added.  Mike Pompeo, US Secretary of State, said Monday that countries that continue to buy crude from Iran after the May deadline would have to face the consequences.  "We made it very clear that if they do not stick to this, there will be sanctions," he said.  Nevertheless, analysts say it is unlikely that China will stop importing Iranian oil altogether.  "We are debating whether China will cease its imports or not, we are inclined not to," Matt Sallee, portfolio manager at Tortoise, an energy investment company, told CNN.  On the other hand, India did not immediately respond to the US announcement on Monday. Iran is India's third-largest supplier of crude, after Iraq and Saudi Arabia.  India's oil ministry did not respond immediately to requests for comments. However, the Indian government said that "we do not recognize unilateral sanctions, but only United Nations sanctions."  That country also has "alternative sources" to replace its Iranian oil supply, according to the Press Trust of India news agency.  After the US government decided it would not renew sanctions exemptions, oil prices in the United States rose by almost 3% on Monday. Brent crude, the world benchmark, also rose by 3.4% and reached $ 74 a barrel for the first time since early November.  The increase is likely to continue because the Iranian supply cut adds to other persistent problems with other suppliers such as Venezuela and Libya.  Monday's announcement "takes the oil markets to a much tighter territory for the rest of the year," said Shin Kim, director of Supply and Production Analysis at the S & P Global Platts energy research firm.  "Excess market capacity will be used to a large extent to cover Iran," Kim said, adding that the increase in global supply risks means that "oil prices will be higher."  Matt Egan, from CNN Business, contributed with thisreportage. Load-Date: April 24, 2019End of Document

According to the CIA, the deaths were around 800, but for the Chinese Red Cross they amounted to 2,600, while the number of injured ranged between 7,000 and 10,000.  Advertising       Load-Date: May 15, 2019End of Document

In total, they were found to have trafficked 63 kilograms (139 pounds) of methamphetamine.The American and Mexican citizens received either a suspended death sentence or life imprisonment. The statement noted all defendants could appeal the verdict within 10 days.In January, Canadian national Robert Lloyd Schellenberg was also given a death sentence after a rapid retrial, a move which plunged relations between Canada and China to a new low.The sentences come as two other Canadian men -- ex-diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor -- remain in detention in China on suspicion of espionage.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has called for the immediate release of both men, describing their detentions as "arbitrary."The cases have previously been interpreted in Canada as retaliation for the country's decision to arrest Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Chinese tech giant Huawei. Meng was taken into custody on December 1, 2018, in Vancouver on behalf of the United States on charges of working to evade Iran sanctions.The Chinese government has repeatedly protested Meng's detention, saying the arrest was political."Both Canada and the US abused their bilateral extradition treaty and took forced actions on a Chinese citizen. This severely infringed a Chinese citizen's legitimate rights," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said in March.Meng is currently under house arrest in Vancouver and is facing extradition to the US. TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Alibaba Plans Stock Split Amid Hong Kong IPO ReportsThe Deal PipelineJune 17, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 The Deal, L.L.C. All Rights ReservedLength: 471 wordsByline: by Paul WhitfieldBodyAlibaba Group Holdings Ltd. (BABA) has announced a planned one-for-eight share split, a move that is likely a precursor to a widely-rumored initial public offering on the Hong Kong stock exchange.The Chinese e-commerce giant on Monday, June 17, posted a filing outlining move, which it said "will increase the number of shares available for issuance at a lower per-share price, and the Board of Directors believes that this will increase flexibility in the Company's capital raising activities, including the issuance of new shares."The split, which has the backing of the company's board, will increase the number of Alibaba's ordinary shares from 4 billion to 32 billion. It will be put to a vote at the company's annual general meeting in Hong Kong on July 15 and, if approved, will take place before the end of July 2020 at the latest.Alibaba was last week reported to have already filed for an IPO in Hong Kong, using a confidential exchange application. The share split would smooth the way for that sale by making Alibaba stock more affordable on a per share basis and by increasing its liquidity.The company could raise as much a $20 billion through a new share sale, further bolstering the about $28 billion of cash on its balance sheet at the end of March. Cash from the sale might be used for new acquisitions and investments, or to repurchase Alibaba shares held by Softbank Group Corp.Softbank, which owns about 26% of Alibaba, is looking for cash to help finance a new $100 billion tech fund. It said, earlier this month, that it had made an $11.1 billion pre-tax profit on the disposal of some of Alibaba stock, after settling part of a forward contract sales agreement struck in 2016 with WRH LLC and Mandatory Exchangeable Trust.A Hong Kong sale would also serve to diversify Alibaba's shareholder base by providing greater access to Chinese investors, while also strengthening ties with the Chinese government at a time when political relations between Washington and Beijing have been strained to breaking point.The Hong Kong exchange has attracted a growing list of Chinese and China-focused technology companies since relaxing its listing rules in 2018 to enable the issuance of preference shares that allow founders to retain control of their companies.Alibaba, in 2014, opted for an initial IPO on the New York Stock Exchange, partly because of its more accommodating regulations, raising a record $21.8 billion. American Depository Shares in the company were listed at $68 each in that IPO and last traded on Friday, June 14, at $158.10.The company is reported to have tapped China International Capital Corp Ltd. and Credit Suisse Group AG to manage the Hong Kong share sale. Alibaba has so far declined to comment on its plans for an IPO, or even the existence of those plans.DEAL SIZE$ 10-50 BillionLoad-Date: June 21, 2019End of Document

Origin Agritech announces investment agreement with government investor to establish biotech commercialization joint venture.PR NewswireJune 5, 2019 Wednesday 11:42 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1058 wordsDateline: BEIJING, June 5, 2019 BodyPR Newswire Origin Agritech Ltd. (NASDAQ: SEED) (the "Company" or "Origin"), an agriculture technology and rural e-commerce company, today announced that the Company entered into a Cooperation Framework Agreement with Beijing Changping Technology Innodevelop Group (BC-TID) to form a new joint venture to focus on the commercialization of genetically modified (GM) corn seed technologies.Under this agreement, Origin and BC-TID will establish the new entity with approximately equal partnership. The Company will contribute the Origin Life Science Center building in Beijing and two biotech corn traits to the new joint venture, and BC-TID will fund the joint venture with a total of RMB204 million. The two biotech traits are the glyphosate tolerance (Gt) trait and the double stacked traits of insect resistance (Bt) and Gt genes. These two traits have completed multi-year production tests, and we have submitted the application for the final stage of biosafety approval in April to China's Ministry of Agriculture.Origin started its corn seed biotechnology research about 15 years ago and has developed several corn seed biotech traits in cooperation with Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Over the years, Origin has built strong intellectual properties with numerous patents and patent applications. More importantly, the Company has entered into commercialization agreements with multinational and local corn seed companies to license these two traits after several years of joint development programs with these corn seed companies. When GM corn seed technologies are approved for commercialization in China, these license agreements are expected to generate significant revenues and earnings for the Company. The Chinese government has announced previously that GM corn seed technology would be commercialized during the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, which ends in 2020.BC-TID is wholly owned by the local government of Changping District in Beijing and was setup as an industrial investment platform.

Chinese Used-Car Platform Lands Warburg, TPGThe Deal PipelineMay 29, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 The Deal, L.L.C. All Rights ReservedLength: 439 wordsByline: by Bill MeagherBodyUxin Ltd., a Chinese company focused on the sale of used cars via an online platform, is raising $230 million and has investors such as TPG Capital LP and Warburg Pincus LLC along for the ride.The transaction, which was announced May 28 after the market closed, calls for the company to sell 5-year convertible notes that pay 3.75% per year. The notes convert into common shares at $1.03 apiece and can be converted after 180 days.Shares closed at $2.46 on May 28, and traded up slightly at $2.51 on Nasdaq May 29. The transaction is expected to close next month.Uxin is the largest online used car dealer in China. The company brings consumers and dealers together to buy and sell vehicles in a network that includes 1,300 service centers in more than 400 cities.Besides TPG Capital and Warburg, another investor is 58.com Inc., the China-based online advertising platform. Each of the three investors are entitled to a seat on the board of directors because of their investments, though the company did not reveal how much each had invested.Uxin also announced a strategic cooperation agreement with 58.com in the areas that include traffic and inventory acquisition, used-car inspections, big data analysis and SaaS."There is huge potential in China's used car sector," Julian Cheng, managing direct and co-head of China investment at Warburg Pincus, said in a statement. "Warburg Pincus will continue to support Uxin's growth strategy, as we remain confident in the company's vision and capability to create long-term value."Chang Sun, managing partner of TPG China, said, "We are very pleased to participate in this round of financing for Uxin and continue to support the development of its innovative cross-regional business. We believe Uxin will increase its market share and further expand its leadership in China's used car market through its highly efficient one-stop service model."The company said it plans to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, but its focus will continue to grow and enhance its cross-regional sales and service platform.Uxin has tapped the private-investment-in-public-equity market on one other occasion. The Beijing-based company raised $175 million via two convertible debt transactions on July 2, 2018. CITIC Capital Holdings Limited purchased $100 million convertible notes and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited bought $75 million in notes. Both investors have ties to the Chinese government.The company's most recent financial filing shows it has a cash balance of $116.7 million, a net loss for 2018 of $224.1 million on revenues of $483 million.DEAL SIZE$ 250-500 MillionLoad-Date: June 3, 2019End of Document

Panama begins meat export to China with 200-tonne shipmentCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 23, 2019 SundayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 385 wordsBodyPanama on Saturday began the export of beef to China with a shipment of 200 tonnes, a step considered "historic" by the Central American country, which sees in the Asian giant a market favorite for this and other products such as fruits, fish and coffee ."I celebrate this new chapter in Panama's livestock history, where for the first time, Panamanian meat is exported to the Chinese market," President Juan Carlos Varela wrote on his Twitter account, Juan Carlos Varela, who two years ago established diplomatic relations with the Chinese government to the detriment of Taiwan.Although China has been a major trading partner of Panama for decades, the establishment in June 2017 of diplomatic relations gave a renewed boost to the bilateral agenda including the economic aspect.Panama has said it intends to "significantly" increase exports to the Chinese market, which totaled $42.6 million in 2017 according to available official data.In this context, the Chinese Customs Authority gave the green light last April to several Panamanian companies to export beef, pineapple and cobia, while in the coming weeks it will approve the entry of shrimp, chicken, pork and dairy, among other products."What a few years ago was a promise to the Panamanian people, today is a reality. The first 200 tons of Panamanian meat depart for the Rep. Popular China bringing the country brand back #PanamáExporta to the world's largest market," Agripecuario Minister of Development, Eduardo Carles, wrote on his Twitter account.President Varela, who will hand over the post on July 1st to social democrat Laurentino Cortizo, said weeks ago as he commemorated the second anniversary of relations with China, that that decision was "strategic, correct and focused on the best interests Panama."China already had an important presence in Panama before the establishment of relations, as it is the first supplier of the Colon Free Zone, the largest on the continent, and the third user of the interoceanic canal, through which 6% of world trade passes.However, since the new relationships, Chinese companies have been awarded billionaire contracts, such as a cruise terminal or the fourth bridge over the Panama Canal, although the investment rain of the Asian giant that the Panamanian entrepreneur expects hasn't started to fall.Load-Date: June 23, 2019End of Document

AFTER ALLEGATIONS OF SPYING, AFRICAN UNION RENEWS HUAWEI ALLIANCEStates News ServiceJune 6, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 957 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):Salem SolomonThe accusations were explosive: For five years, the Chinese government had spied on communications at the African Union. Every night, data streamed from computers at the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to unknown locations controlled by China, anonymous sources at the AU told reporters with the Financial Times and Le Monde, a French newspaper.The breach represented "what appears to be one of the longest-running thefts of confidential government data that we know about," Danielle Cave, a senior analyst at The Australian Strategic Policy Institute, wrote last July.At the center of the controversy was Huawei, the Chinese technology giant with close ties to the Communist Party that had supplied the equipment, configured the servers and trained the staff at the African Union.Now, AU leaders have decided to solidify ties with the Chinese tech company at a time of intensifying international criticism.'Back doors'When accusations of Chinese spying emerged in early 2018, Moussa Faki, the chairperson of the AU Commission, and Hailemariam Desalegn, Ethiopia's former prime minister, categorically denied the allegations, as did Chinese officials.Huawei called the assertions "completely unsubstantiated" and said they "vehemently reject" any claims of impropriety.Exactly what information had been compromised, and why the Chinese government would find it valuable, remain unclear.But the charges fit into a broader pattern of criticism against Huawei.In 2012, the U.S. House Intelligence Committee labeled Huawei a national security threat and warned it had stolen intellectual property and could be spying on Americans through "back doors" that allow unauthorized access to sensitive data.Pressure on the company intensified last month, when the U.S. Commerce Department placed Huawei on its "Entity List," restricting trade with U.S. partners, after President Donald Trump issued an Executive Order effectively blocking the company from operating in the United States.New dealWith criticisms mounting around the globe, Huawei reasserted itself last week when it signed a deal with the African Union to expand partnerships around a range of technologies, from broadband and "cloud" computing to 5G and artificial intelligence.Thomas Kwesi Quartey, the AU Commission's deputy chairperson, and Philippe Wang, Huawei's vice president for North Africa, signed the memorandum of understanding last week at the AU headquarters itself a goodwill gift from China to Africa in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.The agreement is a show of solidarity at a critical time in Huawei's history and a potential wedge between Africa and the United States at a moment of growing antagonism between the world's largest economies.It also expands Huawei's foothold in a market with significant potential for growth in the years ahead, just 36% of Africans had reliable internet access as of March.Old tiesHuawei first entered Africa in the late 1990s, when it helped build cellular networks in dozens of countries. Experts estimate Huawei constructed the majority of Africa's cellular infrastructure, impacting multiple sectors along the way, from education and banking to health and government.The communications networks Huawei has built, usually with loans financed by the Chinese government, aren't as visible as massive infrastructure projects like bridges and railways. But their impact is at least as far-reaching."On the technological front, China is unmatched in Africa," Antoaneta Roussi, a journalist based in East Africa, wrote recently in Nature magazine. "The country's telecommunications giant Huawei has built half of the 4G networks on the continent and most of the 2G and 3G."The company has also taken the lead in developing the continent's 5G capabilities, beginning in Johannesburg, South Africa, where Huawei helped launch a next-generation network in February. With data transfer speeds at least 100 times greater than 4G, 5G technology greatly improves upon existing cellular systems.Huawei may not offer superior technology, but it has been willing to engage with African nations when Western companies haven't, W. Gyude Moore, a visiting fellow at the Center for Global Development and the former minister of public works in Liberia, recently wrote.And they've done so at steeply discounted prices. The Chinese government has subsidized information technology (IT) infrastructure throughout Africa, making it more affordable and more available.Over the years, ties between Africa and Huawei have only strengthened.In 2012, Huawei built a desktop "cloud" project for the African Union to help the organization communicate and conduct its business more effectively (( )).In 2015, AU leaders and Huawei executives signed a memorandum of understanding to deepen and expand their partnership.This year's renewal marks the most ambitious agreement to date.HeadwindsBut the competitive and political landscapes have become more complex.U.S. tech giants Google and Microsoft have launched new research and development initiatives across Africa to recruit local talent and build cutting-edge technologies.Meanwhile, heightening tensions between China and the United States could push African nations into choices over whom they partner with, even as interest in African investment increases and more strategic partnerships present themselves.And worries over security aren't likely to wane, with growing concerns that emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning could become tools of repression in the hands of authoritarian regimes, concerns raised by groups like Human Rights Watch and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.Load-Date: June 6, 2019End of Document

US indicts two people in China over hacksCNN WireMay 10, 2019 Friday 12:41 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 308 wordsByline: By Kevin Collier, CNN BusinessDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  The US Justice Department has charged two people in China over their alleged role in a high-profile hacking campaign that started in 2014 and stole reams of people's personal information from multiple companies.Only one of four companies identified as victims in the indictment, the insurance company Anthem, is named. At the time, Anthem's hack was one of the largest of its kind, with nearly 80 million people's information, including birthdays and Social Security Numbers, leaked. The other companies were identified as being in the technology, basic materials and communication services industries.A number of companies were hacked in the months before and after the Anthem hack, including other insurance companies such as Community Health Systems, as well as the federal Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The latter attack exposed sensitive personal information of about 21.5 million government workers.The Justice Department doesn't accuse either person --- Fujie Wang and someone identified only as John Doe --- of working for Chinese intelligence services.Cybersecurity experts have long speculated that the campaign against Anthem and others had ties to Chinese intelligence, and was perpetrated by the same actors that hacked OPM. In September, National Security Advisor John Bolton indicated the OPM hack was the work of the Chinese government.The United States generally only seeks to charge hackers who work for foreign intelligence services when their activities breach norms the US would like others to follow, such as the use of reckless ransomware and interfering with elections. With China, charges have mostly been against government hackers accused of stealing American trade secrets to give to Chinese businesses.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Senate Judiciary Committee Issues Testimony From DHS Director KrebsTargeted News ServiceMay 14, 2019 Tuesday 9:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3305 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Judiciary Committee issued the following testimony by Christopher Krebs, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency within the Homeland Security Department, at a hearing entitled "5G: National Security Concerns, Intellectual Property Issues, and the Impact on Competition and Innovation":"Thanks to Congress's leadership and passage of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-278), we are now even better poised to further the maturation of the organization to best reflect our essential mission and role in safeguarding and securing infrastructure from cyber threats."My testimony today will focus on the deployment of 5th Generation (5G) wireless telecommunications networks. Advances in 5G technology, the Internet of Things, and other emerging technologies are driving significant transformation in how we communicate, operate our critical infrastructure, and conduct economic activity. 5G is the next generation of networks that will enhance the bandwidth, capacity, and reliability of mobile communications. 5G was launched on a limited-basis in the United States and South Korea at the end of 2018, and more countries are rolling it out this year. According to the Global System for Mobile Alliance (GSMA), 5.1 billion people, or 67 percent of the global populations, is subscribed to mobile services. It is expected that 5G networks will cover 2.7 billion people, or 40 percent of the global population, by 2025."The first generation of wireless telecommunications networks in the United States was deployed in 1982, and its capabilities were limited to basic voice communications. Later generations added capabilities like text, picture, and multimedia messaging; Global Positioning System (GPS) location, video conferencing, and multi-media streaming. 5G networks will support greater bandwidth, capacity for tens of billions of sensor and smart devices that make up the Internet of Things (IoT), and ultra-low latency necessary for highly-reliable, critical communications. According to GSMA, between 2018 and 2025, the number of global IoT connections will triple to 25 billion. Autonomous vehicles, critical manufacturing, medical doctors practicing remote surgery, and a smart electric grid represent a small fraction of the technologies and economic activity that 5G will support. Separately, multiple studies have indicated that 5G networks will enable applications to drive significant technological advances and add $1.2 trillion and three million jobs to the U.S. economy. With advancing technologies, comes increased risk to the Nation's infrastructure.Understanding the Threat"Cyber threats remain one of the most significant strategic risks for the United States, threatening our national security, economic prosperity, and public health and safety. We have seen advanced persistent threat actors, including hackers, cyber criminals, and nation-states, increase the frequency and sophistication of their attacks. In a 2018 report, Foreign Economic Espionage in Cyberspace, the U.S.'s National Counterintelligence and Security Center stated, "We anticipate that China, Russia, and Iran will remain aggressive and capable collectors of sensitive U.S. economic information and technologies, particularly in cyberspace." Our adversaries have been developing and using advanced cyber capabilities in attempts to undermine critical infrastructure, target our livelihoods and innovation, steal our national security secrets, and threaten our democratic institutions."During his annual Worldwide Threat Assessment testimony before Congress this January, the Director of National Intelligence stated, "China presents a persistent cyber espionage threat and a growing attack threat to our core military and critical infrastructure systems. China remains the most active strategic competitor responsible for cyber espionage against the US Government, corporations, and allies." The Director further stated, "We are also concerned about the potential for Chinese intelligence and security services to use Chinese information technology firms as routine and systemic espionage platforms against the United States and allies." This assessment is consistent with the fact that Chinese laws on national security and cybersecurity provide the Chinese government with a legal basis to compel technology companies operating in China to cooperate with Chinese security services."The concern regarding the growing presence of Chinese telecom equipment is particularly acute in the Radio Access Network (RAN) portion of the network where there are a limited number of RAN equipment suppliers. There are four main purveyors of 5G RAN technology globally, none of which are considered United States-based, and the largest of which is Chinese-based. If Chinese manufacturers, who receive significant state support, continue to gain market share, there will be growing concern about the long-term viability of the existing supply chain for 5G and successor technologies."Risks to mobile communications generally include such activities as call interception and monitoring, user location tracking, attackers seeking financial gain through banking fraud, social engineering, ransomware, identity theft, or theft of the device, services, or any sensitive data. Integrating 5G into current wireless networks may convey existing vulnerabilities and impact 5G network security. Data on 5G networks will flow through interconnected cellular towers, small cells, and mobile devices that may provide malicious actors additional vectors to intercept, manipulate, or destroy critical data. Malicious actors could also introduce device vulnerabilities into the 5G supply chain to compromise unsecured wireless systems and exfiltrate critical infrastructure data.Roles and Responsibilities"CISA, our government partners, and the private sector are all engaging in a more strategic and unified approach towards improving our nation's overall defensive posture against malicious cyber activity. In May of 2018, the Department published the DHS Cybersecurity Strategy, outlining a strategic framework to execute our cybersecurity responsibilities during the next five years. The National Cyber Strategy, released in September 2018, reiterates the criticality of collaboration and strengthens the government's commitment to work in partnership with industry to combat cyber threats and secure our critical infrastructure. Together, the National Cyber Strategy and DHS Cybersecurity Strategy guide CISA's efforts."CISA works across government and critical infrastructure industry partnerships to lead the national effort to safeguard and secure cyberspace. We share timely and actionable classified and unclassified information as well as provide training and technical assistance. Our work enhances cyber threat information sharing between and among governments and businesses across the globe to stop cyber incidents before they occur and quickly recover when they do. By bringing together the intelligence community, law enforcement, the Department of Defense, Sector-Specific Agencies, all levels of government, the private sector, international partners, and the public, we are enabling collective defense against cybersecurity risks, improving our incident response capabilities, enhancing information sharing of best practices and cyber threats, strengthening our resilience, and facilitating safety."In addition to our cross-sector leadership role, CISA is the Sector-Specific Agency for numerous sectors, notably the Information Technology and Communications Sectors. In this role, we work with a range of stakeholders to address both short-term and longer-term challenges regarding risks to telecommunications networks, including 5G security. These stakeholders include the Department of Justice, Department of Commerce, Department of Defense, Federal Communications Commission, General Services Administration, the intelligence community, and the private sector.Supply Chain Risks"Section 889 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (P.L. 115-232) generally prohibits federal agencies from procuring or extending a contract to obtain any equipment, system, or services, or enter into a contract with an entity that uses any equipment, system, or service, that uses telecommunications equipment produced by Huawei Technologies Company or ZTE Corporation; video surveillance and telecommunications equipment produced by Hytera Communications Corporation, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Company, or Dahua Technology Company; or telecommunications or video surveillance equipment or services produced or provided by an entity that the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Director of the National Intelligence or the Director of the FBI, reasonably believes to beowned or controlled by, or otherwise connected to, the government of the People's Republic of China. The interagency is working to implement the requirements of the act."The Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Council is developing acquisition regulations. Once those regulations are published, all executive agencies will be required to follow them. With the passage of the Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-390), the Federal Acquisition Security Council provides a dedicated interagency body to take action on information and communications technology (ICT) supply chain matters for federal acquisitions, inclusive of 5G technologies. CISA is an active participant on the Council, and is working through this and other mechanisms to assist with implementation of the upcoming statutory requirements. The Council will be able to recommend that the Secretaries of Homeland Security and Defense, and the Director of National Intelligence, issue government-wide "removal orders" and "exclusion orders" to address supply chain risks, when necessary."Additionally, CISA, through the National Risk Management Center, established the Information and Communication Technology Supply Chain Risk Management Task Force as a public-private partnership jointly chaired by CISA and the chairs of the IT and Communications Sector Coordinating Councils. The Task Force is working to identify and manage risks to the global ICT supply chain, to include the challenges 5G technology presents. One of the lines of effort of the Task Force is the identification of processes and criteria for risk-based evaluation of ICT suppliers, products, and services.DHS Advisory Councils"CISA is working through the Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) structure to engage with private sector stakeholders, especially the Communications and Information Technology Sector Coordinating Councils and the Enduring Security Framework Operations Working Group to collaborate on the risk posed by 5G technologies."CISA operates the Communications Sector Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC), a partnership of 11 federal agencies and over 60 private sector communications and information technology companies. Some of these companies maintain a permanent presence in CISA's operations center. Through the Communications ISAC, government and industry exchange vulnerability, threat, intrusion, and anomaly information. CISA also uses this mechanism to maintain situational awareness regarding the evolution of 5G standards and carrier 5G plans."The President's National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC), created in 1982, provides industry-based analyses and recommendations to the President and the Executive Branch regarding policy and enhancements to national security and emergency preparedness (NS/EP) telecommunications. It is composed of up to 30 presidentially appointed senior executives who represent various elements of the telecommunications industry. NSTAC is supported by the Secretary of Homeland Security, who is the Executive Agent."NSTAC has reviewed 5G security issues, including when it finalized its NSTAC Report to the President on Emerging Technologies Strategic Vision on July 14, 2017. The report included recommendations on how the government can adapt to "unprecedented growth and transformation in the technology ecosystem over the next decade," including 5G technology, which the NSTAC identified as a near-term transformative technology."The NSTAC is currently examining technology capabilities that are critical to NS/EP functions in the evolving ICT ecosystem. On April 2, 2019, the NSTAC submitted a letter to the President outlining the first phase of its study to identify the technologies within the ICT ecosystem that are most critical to the Government's NS/EP functions, which include 5G, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence."During the second phase of this study, the NSTAC plans to examine how certain dependencies, market limitations, and supply chain risks began, using the deployment of 5G technologies as a case study. The NSTAC will formulate recommendations for the recommended national innovation NS/EP ICT strategy. This strategy will ensure that the United States is more resilient, has access to trusted technology to support its NS/EP mission, and leads in the development and use of ICT technology."In 1991, at the direction of the NSTAC, the Network Security Information Exchanges (NSIE) were established. Industry and government coordinate through the NSIEs to voluntarily share sensitive information on threats to operations, administration, maintenance, and provisioning of systems supporting telecommunications infrastructure. Government NSIE members include Federal agencies that useNS/EP communications services, represent law enforcement, or have information related to network security threats and vulnerabilities. Industry representatives include subject-matter experts engaged in prevention, detection, and/or investigation of communications software penetrations. In January 2018, the NSIE facilitated a discussion on 5G technology.International Engagement"CISA regularly engages with international partners on a range of cyber and communications risks including the Usual 5, or the cyber centers from the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand; the International Watch and Warning Network, which includes 15 countries; and many other bilateral relationships. The NSIE holds biennial multilateral NSIE (MNSIE) meetings with its members. The MNSIE is a global partnership between NSIEs from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In September 2018, the MNSIE was hosted by the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Center, and a number of pressing topics were discussed, including 5G technology."Over the last year, 5G security and associated supply chain risk management topics have come up frequently with international partners during both senior and working level engagements. With Five Eye partners, these discussions include both information sharing, strategic alignment on policy approaches where appropriate, and identification of opportunities for collaboration."Many international partners share concerns broadly on 5G security. Some have effectively banned the use of Huawei equipment in their 5G networks. Others continue internal efforts to formally review the security impact of 5G technology, to include the potential risks of using hardware or software in 5G networks built by companies from certain countries."National security must be a primary consideration in technological and infrastructure development of 5G technologies. As certain firms of concern, such as Huawei and ZTE, have a significant share of the market for 5G products and associated network devices, efforts to build 5G infrastructure potentially introduces major risks to national security. Security concerns must be considered in any policy action that would promote infrastructure development underpinning telecommunications or cyber ecosystem."One consistent critical challenge is the lack of comparably priced alternative products from domestic and trusted partner nations, due in large part to the heavy state support that Chinese firms receive. Market incentives are needed to stimulate market growth for trusted suppliers, both to compete internationally and provide viable, cost-competitive alternatives domestically. A fundamental shift in market dynamics is needed to incentivize and cultivate suppliers from trusted sources, otherwise U.S. technological and infrastructure development efforts in 5G will be impeded by lack of viable, trusted alternatives."Our efforts to cultivate 'trusted foundries' for 5G technologies must proceed in partnership with 'like-minded' countries. Risk could be mitigated in a more effective manner if coordinated in an international effort of like-minded countries to drive the dynamics that could move the market. This avails 'trusted foundries' with more flexibility and counters the narrative that the U.S. seeks to mimic China's predatory industrial policy approach that seeks to tilt global markets towards domestically manufactured ICT devices.Research and Development"The next age of digital transformation depends on the success of the United States' national and global 5G build out. Significant research remains to be done in this area as well as hardening of the 5G network protocols, which are currently in early development. On April 22, 2019, DHS's Science and Technology Directorate and CISA announced an effort to improve the security and resilience of critical mobile communications networks. This solicitation established a research and development project for innovative approaches and technologies to protect legacy, current, and 5G mobile network communications services and equipment against all threats and vulnerabilities."The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and the United Nations' International Telecommunications Union (ITU) lead the global 5G specification development initiatives. CISA currently works with industry, including nationwide U.S. wireless carriers, in preparing technical specification to ensure NS/EP personnel will have priority communications services on 5G networks."DHS's Study on Mobile Device Security, which was required by the Cybersecurity Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-113), identified risks to mobile devices and communications and identified opportunities to make progress on security. The study also called for government-funded research and development and for cooperative agreements with private-sector entities such as mobile network operators and associations, and enhanced U.S. government participation in development of consensus-based voluntary mobile security standards and best practices.Conclusion"In the face of increasingly sophisticated threats, CISA employees stand on the front lines of the Federal Government's efforts to defend our Nation's federal networks and critical infrastructure. The threat environment is complex and dynamic with interdependencies that add to the challenge. As new risks emerge, we must better integrate cyber and physical risk in order to effectively secure the Nation. CISA contributes unique expertise and capabilities around cyber-physical risk and cross-sector critical infrastructure interdependencies."I recognize and appreciate this Committee's strong support and diligence as it works to understand this emerging risk and identify additional authorities and resources needed to address it head on. We at CISA are committed to working with Congress to ensure our efforts cultivate a safer, more secure, and resilient Homeland through our efforts to defend today and secure tomorrow."Thank you for the opportunity to appear before the Committee today, and I look forward to your questions."[TheHill]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6729285 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: May 15, 2019End of Document

The tensions have been mounting for nearly a year a half, starting with carriers pulling out of deals to provide Huawei phones and escalating to full-blown trade bans and the unprecedented revocation of Huawei s Android license. All the while, the US has sought the extradition of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei, on fraud charges.The primary source of the controversy, however, is the long-held belief from lawmakers and the US intelligence community that Huawei acts on behalf of the Chinese government, undermining US national security and posing cybersecurity and privacy risks for American and UK customers. With Huawei cut out of Google s official Android licensing program, the company s future hangs in the balance, creating uncertainty about the future of Chinese businesses amid President Donald Trump s trade war and raising serious questions about Huawei s role in the Windows and 5G ecosystems going forward.Tags: See Campaign:https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634046/huawei-donald-trump-us-trade-war-china-android-google-ban-5g-futureContact Information:Nick StattTags:,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            Wire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: May 28, 2019End of Document

China threatens to blacklist foreign companies after Huawei banCNN WireMay 31, 2019 Friday 2:47 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 527 wordsByline: By Julia Horowitz and Steven Jiang, CNN BusinessDateline: LONDON (CNN Business) BodyLONDON (CNN Business) --  Beijing is preparing a blacklist for foreign companies as trade tensions with the United States continue to escalate.The Chinese government is working to establish an "unreliable entity list" which would include foreign companies, individuals and organizations, according to a statement Friday from China's Commerce Ministry.Companies that violate market rules will be added to the list, according to the statement. Other targets include firms that block supplies to Chinese companies for "non-commercial reasons" or otherwise damage their interests. The exact details of the plan will be announced soon, the statement added. The move to establish a blacklist comes after the United States hit Huawei with an export ban, effectively barring US companies from doing business with the smartphone and telecom equipment maker.The Trump administration claims that Huawei equipment can be used by China for spying. Huawei has repeatedly denied that it poses a risk, saying the restrictions are an attempt to put it out of business.Jude Blanchette, a senior adviser at the risk consultancy Crumpton Group, said that American companies are responding to the blacklist threat by going into "triage" mode."Your reaction is not going to be, 'This is no big deal,'" said Blanchette, who added that US businesses are already assessing the probability that they'll be targeted by Beijing. Huawei fightThe US campaign against Huawei, one of China's most powerful tech companies, reached new heights earlier this month when the Trump administration added it to a list of companies said to undermine American interests. That forced crucial suppliers like Google and ARM Holdings to cut ties with the Chinese company, while top carriers in the United Kingdom and Japan delayed the launch of Huawei smartphones.Now China's blacklist could target those same companies, penalizing them for complying with the US ban."They have not identified which companies this means but I'm sure, knowing the Chinese as I do, that they will do counterpart targeting matching the US," said Harry Broadman, a former US trade negotiator. He added: "Clearly their buttons have been pressed, with the way we're dealing with Huawei." For Huawei, which had aimed to become the top smartphone brand globally by the end of 2020, the ban could pose an existential threat.Huawei bought $70 billion worth of components and parts last year from 13,000 suppliers. Of that, about $11 billion was spent on products from US businesses including Qualcomm, Broadcom and Microsoft.Analysts had predicted that China could target US businesses as a result of the Huawei ban. Trust between the United States and China is running low as new rounds of tit-for-tat tariffs go into effect.China has always had a range of powerful tools that it could use to target foreign firms, said Nicholas Consonery, director at consultancy Rhodium Group."The point is we are now in an environment where retaliatory steps against US entities operating in China is becoming more probable," he said.Brian Fung contributed reporting.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Terry Gou moves closer to run for Taiwan presidentAssociated Press InternationalMay 13, 2019 Monday 10:37 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 403 wordsDateline: TAIPEI, Taiwan BodyTAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) - Terry Gou, head of the world's largest contract assembler of consumer electronics, stepped closer to running for president of Taiwan on Monday by announcing that he would not accept a vice presidential slot on the ticket of the opposition Nationalist Party.Gou is chairman of Foxconn, which assembles electronic products such as Apple's iPhones. He would bring a strongly pro-business and China-friendly platform to what is expected to be a crowded field for next year's presidential election.Gou, who ranks among Taiwan's richest people with a fortune estimated by Forbes at $7.8 billion, says the Nationalists should hold debates to select their candidate.Incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen has been hampered by low public approval ratings and a diplomatic embargo imposed by China, which claims the island as its own territory."I am not a suitable candidate for a vice president, because I am used to making decisions," Gou told reporters.Gou's candidacy would be the first for a Taiwan business mogul and may appeal to Taiwanese dissatisfied with stagnating incomes who want a different, more business-oriented style of leadership.However, Gou is likely to face criticism from China skeptics in Taiwan over Foxconn's 12 factories in nine Chinese cities and his close ties to the Chinese government.Gou, the 68-year-old son of a police officer who moved to Taiwan after the Communist takeover of the mainland in 1949, began his career in plastics before branching out into electronics and later mobile phones.China claims sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan and has threatened to take it by force if it deems it necessary. More than 80% of Taiwanese oppose unification with China, the island government's Mainland Affairs Council said in January.Despite that, the Nationalists favor closer ties with Beijing, largely as a way of recharging the island's high-tech economy through access to China's massive economy.Gou has a reputation at Foxconn for a strongly authoritarian leadership style and strictly controlling employees.Foxconn announced in 2017, to much fanfare, that it planned to invest $10 billion in the U.S. state of Wisconsin and hire 13,000 people to build an LCD factory that could make screens for televisions and a variety of other devices.After waffling earlier this year on its intentions, Gou recommitted to the project in February after a meeting with President Donald Trump.Load-Date: May 14, 2019End of Document

It looks like the US has abandoned any pretense that its war on Huawei is totally unrelated to the China trade talksBusiness Insider USJune 10, 2019 Monday 05:24 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 542 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Isobel Asher Hamilton)Highlight: US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said President Donald Trump would be willing to do 'certain things' on Huawei if China backs down in trade talks.Body• US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday that if China backs down in trade talks with the US, the president would consider easing up on Huawei.• Previously, Donald Trump's economic team were at pains to separate the Huawei issue from the ongoing trade negotiations.• Trump himself has said Huawei could be included in a trade deal even though he considers that the firm poses a national security risk.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.The Trump administration seems to have abandoned any pretense that its war on Huawei is completely unrelated to the trade talks with China.Trump's economic team were at pains to separate the issue from the ongoing trade negotiations following the arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in December.That gameplan now seems to have been all but dropped, however, after Steven Mnuchin doubled down on interventions from Donald Trump on the Huawei issue.In an interview with Reuters, the Treasury Secretary dropped a heavy hint that America's blacklisting of Huawei was a bargaining chip in the trade war with China."I think what the president is saying is, if we move forward on trade, that perhaps he'll be willing to do certain things on Huawei if he gets comfort from China on that and certain guarantees," Mnuchin said.He added, however, that there are "national security issues" relating to Huawei. The US government maintains that Huawei poses a threat, claiming it can be used as a proxy by the Chinese government to spy. Huawei denies this.Mnuchin's comments follow President Trump suggesting that Huawei could form part of a trade deal, even though the US does not trust the company.Read more: Here are all the big companies that have cut ties with Huawei, dealing the Chinese tech giant a crushing blow"Huawei is something that's very dangerous. You look at what they've done from a security standpoint, from a military standpoint, it's very dangerous," Trump said in May."So, it's possible that Huawei even would be included in some kind of a trade deal. If we made a deal, I could imagine Huawei being possibly included in some form of, or some part of a trade deal."Since the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the US has turned the screw on Huawei.The Department of Commerce blacklisted the firm last month, placing it on an "entity list" meaning American companies have to seek government permission before doing business with Huawei. The company was then given a 90-day grace period to help the transition.Several major US companies quickly distanced themselves from Huawei, including Google, Intel, and Qualcomm. Google is reportedly lobbying Capitol Hill to exempt itself from the ban.NOW WATCH: Facebook's scandals weren't enough for people to stop using it.

Trump signs order setting stage to ban Huawei from U.S.Politico.comMay 15, 2019 Wednesday 8:04 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1690 wordsByline: egeller@politico.com,  (Eric Geller)BodyPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order laying the groundwork to block Chinese telecommunications companies like Huawei from selling equipment in the U.S., a move aimed at neutralizing Beijing's ability to compromise next-generation wireless networks and U.S. computer systems.The order prohibits the purchase or use of any communications technology produced by entities controlled by "a foreign adversary" and likely to create an "undue risk of sabotage" of U.S. communications systems or "catastrophic effects" to U.S. infrastructure.The Commerce Department has 150 days to produce rules that can identify "particular countries or persons" as foreign adversaries. Those rules are almost certain to name China, Huawei, or both."Foreign adversaries are increasingly creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in information and communications technology and services," Trump said in his executive order, "in order to commit malicious cyber-enabled actions, including economic and industrial espionage against the United States and its people."The order is sure to raise Beijing's ire at a time when the world's two largest economies are struggling to resolve a market-shaking trade war. The directive also comes as the Justice Department seeks the extradition from Canada of a Huawei executive charged with violating sanctions on Iran.Trump's long-awaited executive order invokes the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and declares a national emergency to empower the government to block the purchase of technology linked to foreign adversaries.The order declares that "the unrestricted acquisition or use" of such technology "augments the ability of foreign adversaries to create and exploit vulnerabilities" in U.S. infrastructure "and thereby constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States."Commerce on Wednesday took a separate but related action that would effectively prohibit U.S. companies from doing business with Huawei by adding it to the so-called "entity list." The administration took a similar action against ZTE, another Chinese telecom firm, for apparent violations of U.S. sanctions on Iran, but Trump reversed the decision and slapped the company with a huge fine instead.As POLITICO reported in February, the White House initially planned for Trump to sign the order that month before a major wireless industry conference in Barcelona. The move would have buttressed the Trump administration's argument that U.S. allies should not let Chinese firms build and operate the 5G networks that will soon power cellphones and the growing ecosystem of internet-connected devices.The order was delayed, however, after Trump indicated his displeasure with it and after he extended the deadline for trade negotiations with Beijing. Administration officials did not want the order to disrupt the trade talks, sources said.But the apparent breakdown of those talks this week opened the door for the executive order, according to a former Trump transition official who requested anonymity to speak candidly."The Administration has no qualms about poking the Chinese this week compared to the weeks and months prior," this person said.While the order comes amid warnings about Huawei enabling Chinese spying through 5G networks, it is written in a neutral way that is meant to give Commerce flexibility to name any adversaries it identifies - and to insulate the U.S. from Chinese criticisms."The executive order is company and country-agnostic," a senior administration official told reporters during a briefing.Huawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In addition to the Commerce-led process of identifying foreign adversaries and promulgating rules to block purchases, the order requires the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to assess threats from dangerous technology and produce an initial report on them within 40 days. It also requires DHS to produce annual reports on communications technology that presents security vulnerabilities, with the first report coming within 80 days.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement that the order was part of Trump's commitment to combating "foreign adversaries who are actively and increasingly creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in information and communications technology infrastructure and services in the United States."Trump's allies in Congress cheered the order and urged Commerce to blacklist Chinese firms."Chinese components remain a Trojan horse for telecommunications infrastructure around the globe," Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said in a statement, "and the Department of Commerce should deny their adoption entirely."The order authorizing a telecom ban is the latest salvo in a broad campaign to combat what U.S. officials call China's unfair and disruptive practices. While Trump's trade war has dominated the headlines, his administration has been pursuing a parallel campaign to disrupt Chinese cyber espionage, which since the early 2000s has led to staggering amounts of intellectual property theft and the most devastating counterintelligence breach in U.S. history, the hacking of more than 20 million people's highly sensitive background documents from the Office of Personnel Management.Most of the government's law enforcement actions have focused on trade-secrets theft. In December, the Justice Department brought indictments against two Chinese hackers on charges of running a decadelong economic espionage campaign. Chinese operatives allegedly stole hundreds of gigabytes of data from U.S. businesses and government agencies during that campaign.But Wednesday's executive order, which languished for months after passing an interagency review, responds to a different concern.The directive is part of a government-wide effort to grapple with the threats that foreign governments pose to the U.S. "supply chain," the massive, convoluted and often opaque web of firms that produce goods and services for American companies and government agencies.As globalization transformed how and where companies made their products, it created new security risks as governments struggled to identify the sources of components used in sensitive technology. And the increasing awareness of these vulnerabilities has opened new fronts in how the government approaches cybersecurity.In the wake of embarrassing data breaches, government agencies have focused on simple solutions like multi-factor authentication - which requires a temporary code in addition to a standard password to access an account - and diligent patching of software flaws. But experts say that until the government can fully map out who is producing its hardware and software, there remains a more pernicious risk of stealthy technological tampering by advanced adversaries like China and Russia.As a result, securing the U.S. supply chain has become a top priority for the federal government in recent years. Complementary activities are underway at the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the telecom agency NTIA and the technical standards agency NIST. And a law signed in December created a multi-agency council to consider proposals to ban risky technology from government networks.New procurement rules will apply tighter cybersecurity standards to contractors in an effort to close vulnerabilities in that part of the government's acquisition process. Regulators are working on a rule to ban Huawei and ZTE products from government networks; a similar rule targeting the Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab took effect in July. And a House panel is considering how best to prevent vulnerable telecom equipment from reaching rural communities, some of which host U.S. military bases.Lawmakers have introduced a steady stream of legislation to address telecommunications security, and committees have occasionally held hearings on the issue, including one on Tuesday in the Senate Judiciary Committee.The U.S. has also tried to kneecap Huawei and ZTE beyond its borders. Officials have urged allies to end contracts with the telecom firms and strip the companies' technology from their networks. The campaign has accelerated in recent years as countries move closer to rolling out 5G technology, which is designed in such a way that infiltration poses greater risks than with current 4G infrastructure.American diplomats have played hardball on the issue, warning allies that using Huawei will jeopardize their intelligence-sharing partnerships.The strategy has yielded results in countries like Japan, Australia and New Zealand, but some of the U.S.'s closest allies, including Britain, Canada and Germany, remain unconvinced.Huawei and ZTE have consistently denied helping the Chinese government spy on their customers, and U.S. officials have offered no public evidence of such behavior, though they argue that doing so is unnecessary because the risks are clear-cut.The goal of Trump's new executive order is to "move the needle" on countries' purchasing choices, a source close to the administration told POLITICO in February.The U.S. delegation at the Barcelona wireless conference, led by officials like Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai, emphasized this message to foreign counterparts and telecom executives."Contracts are going out now," said the source close to the administration. "Extra stigma could change the situation out in the countries on this major decision."Paul Triolo, who leads the Eurasia Group's geotechnology practice, said the order "is significant primarily as a signal to European allies that the U.S. is serious about putting in place a legal structure to formally exclude vendors from its 5G network.""Supporters of the U.S. position are clinking champagne glasses today in European capitals," he said, "as the EO will give them ammunition to continue to press governments and carriers to adopt a tougher line on Huawei in the coming months."Adam Behsudi contributed to this report. Article originally published on POLITICO MagazineLoad-Date: May 16, 2019End of Document

Apple's profit will drop by almost 30% if China bans its products, Goldman Sachs estimates (AAPL)Business Insider USMay 22, 2019 Wednesday 02:21 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 533 wordsByline: areddy@businessinsider.com,  (Arjun Reddy)Highlight: An all-out ban on Apple products in China could strip the iPhone giant of $15 billion in profits this year, Goldman Sachs analysts estimate.BodyCNBC• An all-out ban on Apple products in China could wipe out almost 30% of Apple's profits, Goldman Sachs analysts estimate.• The report comes as the market anticipates a further escalation of the ongoing US-China trade dispute.• Apple shares fell nearly 2% on Wednesday.• Watch Apple trade live.Apple's profits would plunge by almost 30% if China enacts a total ban on the company's products, according to Goldman Sachs. The dollar amount would be a reduction in net income by over $15 billion annually.According to Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall, China represents 17% of Apple's revenues, but 29% of the company's profits due to the high-margin products sold there. Given the product mix, Goldman assumes Apple has a 45% gross margin.Wednesday's report comes on the heels of increasing trade tension between the United States and China. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump raised tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports after negotiations failed to secure a deal. Further, Trump noted there was potential to raise tariffs on an additional $325 billion of goods should no deal be reached.And this week, the president laid the foundation for a ban on the Chinese telecom company Huawei sourcing components from US firms such as Google and Qualcomm. These actions led to significant stock-market volatility, with tech stocks dropping on news of the ban and            later stabilizing after it was announced the ban would be delayed. A response is expected from the Chinese government, potentially further rattling markets."Investors have been asking us about Apple's financial exposure to China given the possibility of a ban on Apple's products there in retaliation for the US license requirements for Huawei that were announced last Friday," wrote Hall in the research note.Beyond the trade dispute, Apple is facing significant headwinds in China with demand for its phones falling alongside increased competition from cheaper smartphone makers such as Huawei and Xiaomi. In January,            Apple issued its first sales warning in more than a decade, citing a sharp and unexpected drop in iPhone sales in China.In the Goldman report, Hall also noted there were additional risks for Apple should the trade dispute escalate further. Most notable, is that most of the company's iPhone production facilities are located in China. "Should China restrict iPhone production in any way we do not believe the company would be able to shift much iPhone volume outside of China on short notice, though actions that would push Apple production outside of China could have negative implications for the China tech ecosystem as well as for local employment," the report said.Apple was down nearly 2% on Wednesday, but still up 16% this year.Markets InsiderNOW WATCH: Warren Buffett, the third-richest person in the world, is also one of the most frugal billionaires.

China Paper and Paperboard Import Report 2019-2023GlobeNewswireApril 1, 2019 Monday 9:22 AM PTCopyright 2019 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: RESEARCH ANALYSIS AND REPORTSLength: 1173 wordsBodyDublin, April  01, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The     "Research Report on Paper and Paperboard Import in China, 2019-2023"   report has been added to     ResearchAndMarkets.com's  offering.        According to this analysis, with the development of China's economy and the improvement of living standards, the per capita consumption of paper and paperboard shows an upward trend. Meanwhile, China's net annual population growth is between 8 million and 10 million, which leads to an increasing demand for paper and paperboard in China and promotes the development of China's papermaking industry.However, the papermaking industry is dependent on forest resources which are scarce in China. As China tightens its environmental protection policies and the forest coverage rate decreases, the fiber materials for papermaking are in increasingly short supply. Besides, the labor costs in the Chinese manufacturing sector keeps rising. Therefore, China needs to import a large quantity of paper and paperboard to cover the shortage of domestic capacity. The Chinese government has set no administrative barriers against paper and paperboard import, e.g. making paper and paperboard exclusive to state-owned enterprises, or introducing import quota administration for paper and paperboard. But import tariffs vary greatly among China's paper and paperboard imports. For instance, the MFN rate and general rate on the commodity that has the heaviest tax burden is respectively 35% and 100%. The import tariffs on newsprint, kraft paper, etc. are lower with the lowest MFN rate being 2%. According to this analysis, the import volume of paper and paperboard in China is rising in recent years. It reached 6.27 million tons in 2018, increasing by 122.30% as compared to 2014. And the import value reached USD 5.53 billion, increasing by 54% as compared to 2014. The reasons for the growing paper and paperboard imports mainly include: (1) The price of imported paper and paperboard is lower than that of domestic counterparts; and (2) the quality of imported paper and paperboard is better than that of domestic counterparts. But market trends vary greatly among China's paper and paperboard imports. Overall, product segments that have great price differences with domestic counterpart see faster growth. For example, with the development of Intermedia, the sales volume of newspaper, magazines and other print media is decreasing in China, which brings down the demand for newsprint. However, the import volume of newsprint in China grew by 860% from 2014 to 2018 because the price of imported newsprint was far lower than that of domestic newsprint. In recent years, the demand for liner board keeps rising with the rapid development of the e-commerce and logistics industries. As the import price differed little from the domestic market price, the import volume of liner board in China grew by only 65.10% from 2013 to 2017. The researcher expects that the demand for paper and paperboard imports in China will continue to grow from 2019 to 2023. The major driving forces include the lower average price of imports than domestic counterparts and the sluggish growth in domestic production of paper and paperboard resulting from the shortage of raw materials and the upward costs of labor, land, energy resources and other production factors.Topics Covered:• Economic and policy environment of paper and paperboard import in China• Paper and paperboard import in China• Major sources of China's paper and paperboard imports• Analysis of average import price of paper and paperboard in China• Major driving forces for paper and paperboard import in China from 2019 to 2023• Forecast on paper and paperboard import in China from 2019 to 2023Key Topics Covered:          1 Overview of Paper and Paperboard Industry1.1 Definitions of Paper and Paperboard1.2 Classification of Paper and Paperboard1.3 Analysis on Industry Chain of Paper and Paperboard2 Development Environment of China's Paper and Paperboard Industry2.1 Economic Environment2.2 Policy Environment3 Analysis on Supply of and Demand for Paper and Paperboard in China3.1 Analysis on Supply of Paper and Paperboard in China3.2 Analysis of Demand for Paper and Paperboard in China4 Analysis of Paper and Paperboard Import in China4.1 Scale of Paper and Paperboard Import in China4.2 Analysis on Average Import Price of Paper and Paperboard in China4.3 Analysis of China's Reliance on Paper and Paperboard Imports4.4 Analysis of China's Paper and Paperboard Imports by Type5 Analysis of Liner Board Import in China5.1 Import Volume of Liner Board in China5.2 Production Volume of Liner Board in China5.3 Analysis on China's Reliance on Liner Board Imports5.4 Import Price of Liner Board in China5.5 Comparison of Prices of Domestic and Imported Liner Board6 Analysis of Fluting Paper Import in China6.1 Scale of Fluting Paper Import in China6.2 Analysis on Import Price of Fluting Paper in China6.3 Analysis on Production Volume of Fluting Paper in China6.4 Analysis of China's Reliance on Fluting Paper Imports7 Import of Uncoated Printing and Writing Paper in China7.1 Analysis on Import Volume of Uncoated Printing and Writing Paper in China7.2 Analysis on Production Volume of Uncoated Printing and Writing Paper in China7.3 Analysis of China's Reliance on Imports of Uncoated Printing and Writing Paper8 Analysis of White Board Import in China8.1 Analysis on Import Volume of White Board in China8.2 Analysis on Average Import Price of White Board in China8.3 Comparison of Prices of Domestic and Imported White Board8.4 Analysis on Production Volume of White Board in China8.5 Analysis of China's Reliance on White Board Imports9 Analysis of Newsprint Import in China9.1 Analysis on Scale of Newsprint Import in China9.2 Analysis of Import Price of Newsprint in China9.3 Analysis of Production Volume of Newsprint in China9.4 Analysis of China's Reliance on Newsprint Imports10 Analysis of Wrapping Paper Import in China10.1 Analysis on Import Volume of Wrapping Paper in China10.2 Analysis on Production Volume of Wrapping Paper in China10.3 Analysis on Consumption Volume of Wrapping Paper in China10.4 Analysis of China's Reliance on Wrapping Paper Imports11 Forecast on Trends of Paper and Paperboard Import in China11.1 Factors Influencing Development of Paper and Paperboard Import in China11.2 Forecast on Paper and Paperboard Import in China, 2019-202311.3 Forecast on Demand for Paper and Paperboard Imports in China, 2019-2023For more information         about this  report  visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/mwwg3v/china_paper_and?w=12         Research and Markets also offers Custom Research services providing focused, comprehensive and tailored research.      CONTACT: ResearchAndMarkets.com          Laura Wood, Senior Press Manager          press@researchandmarkets.com          For E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470          For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630          For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900 Related Topics: Pulp and Paper Load-Date: April 2, 2019End of Document

The court's verdict and Meng's sentencing will be announced at a later date.Meng disappeared after he left Interpol headquarters in France and took a flight back to China in late September 2018. His wife, Grace, said at the time that the last contact she received from him was a text message saying to wait for his call, followed minutes later by a knife emoji.As his case drew rising global attention, the Chinese government acknowledged in October that Meng had been detained for alleged corruption."(Meng) insisted on taking the wrong path and had only himself to blame (for his downfall)," the country's top law enforcement official, Zhao Kezhi, was quoted as saying in a statement.Shortly after Beijing announced Meng's arrest, Interpol said it had received and accepted his resignation with "immediate effect."Meng was the first Chinese official to lead the international policing body and his appointment three years ago in 2016 was greeted enthusiastically by the country's state media. He retained the title of vice-minister of public security while at Interpol.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Game For Peace is essentially a skinned version of PUBG Mobile with a patriotic setting and less bloodshed. Instead of dying in a pool of blood when eliminated from the game, for example, players get up and wave goodbye.                                                                                                                   Svend Joscelyne@SvendJoscelyne                                                                                                                     They changed PUBG Mobile in China to comply with stricter game violence laws.

In 2017, for example, Tencent's last smash hit mobile game, the fantasy MOBA Honor of Kings, limited children under 12 to one hour of daily play, and children aged 12 to 18 to two hours.            Analysts have worried that these restrictions will crimp revenue for companies like Tencent, particularly with its rebrand of Game For Peace. But these latest figures suggest the company has managed to retain its audience. The $146 million combined monthly revenue of Game for Peace and PUBG Mobile now exceeds the $125 million collected by Honor of Kings over that same period.            Tags:              See Campaign: https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/11/18660985/pubg-mobile-monthly-revenue-players-highest-grossing-mobile-game       Contact Information:       James Vincent       Tags:       ,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            Wire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: June 20, 2019End of Document

PETER SHOR WINS 2018 MICIUS QUANTUM PRIZEStates News ServiceApril 26, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 699 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. BodyThe following information was released by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT):Shor awarded the $150,000 prize, named after a fifth-century B.C. Chinese scientist, for his groundbreaking theoretical work in the field of quantum computation.Sandi Miller | Department of MathematicsPeter Shor, the Morss Professor of Applied Mathematics at MIT, has received the 2018 Micius Quantum Prize, which is awarded within the field of quantum computation.Shor was nominated for his groundbreaking theoretical work on the factoring algorithm and quantum error correction. Shor, who received his PhD in applied mathematics from MIT in 1985 under the direction of Tom Leighton, is known for his work on quantum computation. Shor's algorithm is a groundbreaking integer-factoring algorithm that he developed in the mid-1990s, which proves a quantum computer can calculate the prime factors of a large number exponentially faster than a classical computer."Peter Shor's quantum algorithms, starting from his factoring algorithm known as Shor's algorithm has revolutionized the field of quantum computing," says Michel Goemans, department head and professor of mathematics. "One could even say that the field would never have taken off without his deep and significant contributions to it."The algorithm is designed to use a quantum computer to quickly break through the RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adelman) encryption algorithm, which is based on the difficulty of prime factorization, a major concern for the security of classical computing systems. Shor also introduced quantum error-correcting codes and fault-tolerant quantum computation to protect quantum states against decoherence and noise.He will receive 1 million Chinese yuan (about $150,000) as part of his award, which he expects to put toward his continued research into quantum cryptography and quantum information theory. One idea: "I'm thinking about how quantum information relates to black holes," he says.More importantly, says Shor, the Micius Quantum Prize "will draw a lot of attention to the field.""It's an exciting time," he says. "The U.S. government and the Chinese government are putting a lot of money into quantum computing. Experimentalists are starting to build quantum computers that are reaching the point where they can't be simulated by digital computers. People are building very small prototypes, as experiments to see how big quantum computers will behave."Shor has received many other awards for his quantum computing research, including the Dirac Medal of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics, the IEEE Eric E. Sumner Award, for Outstanding Contributions to Communications Technology, and the Nevanlinna Prize. He also is affiliated with the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and the Center for Theoretical Physics.The Micius Quantum Prize recognizes significant science advances ranging from early conceptual contributions to recent experimental breakthroughs in the field of quantum communications, quantum simulation, quantum computation, and quantum metrology. Funded by private entrepreneurs, the Micius Quantum Foundation was named after the fifth-century B.C. Chinese scientist who is also known as Mozi who used a pinhole to discover that light travels in straight lines, and who wrote an earlier version of what later became Newton's first law of motion.Other 2018 Micius laureates are Juan Ignacio Cirac, David Deutsch, and Peter Zoller, for their theoretical work on quantum algorithms and physical architectures of quantum computers and simulators; and Rainer Blatt and David Wineland, for experiments that demonstrated fundamental elements of quantum computing with trapped ions.The 2019 Micius Quantum Prizes were also announced within the field of quantum communication: Charles Bennett, Gilles Brassard, Artur Ekert, and Stephen Wiesner, for their inventions of quantum cryptography, and Jian-Wei Pan and Anton Zeilinger for experiments that enabled practically secure and large-scale quantum communications.The award ceremony for 2018 and 2019 prizes will be held on Sept. 20, during the International Conference on Emerging Quantum Technologies in Hefei, China.Load-Date: April 27, 2019End of Document

This information is contained in documents prepared between 2009 and 2011, consulted by Bloomberg. The same kind of flaws were detected by Vodafone on other networks.  Vodafone asked Huawei to remove these features from the home routers in 2011 and received assurances from the vendor that these faults had been resolved. However, further testing showed otherwise, according to the documents.  The faults detected consisted of the existence of backdoors, which allow you to bypass security and access a computer or encrypted data. Although they are common in some equipment so that technicians can access them, they can also be exploited by outside invaders.  These revelations come at a time when Huawei has been under fire, with accusations coming mainly from the United States. Trump's management has warned that equipment provided by Huawei may be used by the Chinese government for espionage purposes, especially after passage of a law in China that requires companies to cooperate with the government if requested. Chinese technology has denied the allegations. Load-Date: April 30, 2019End of Document

Huawei, the Chinese tech giant embroiled in controversy, just overtook Apple to become the second-largest smartphone maker (AAPL)Business Insider USMay 3, 2019 Friday 03:16 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1189 wordsByline: leadicicco@businessinsider.com,  (Lisa Eadicicco)Highlight: Huawei has ousted Apple as the second-largest smartphone maker when it comes to quarterly shipments and market share in Q1 2019, a report said.BodyLLUIS GENE/AFP/Getty Image• Huaweihas surpassed            Apple to become the No. 2 smartphone vendor worldwide, according to a new report.• Huawei is thriving as global smartphone sales are continuing to decline.• The company's success comes as it combats accusations of espionage, among other controversies.  • Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.The Chinese electronics giant Huawei has surpassed Apple to become the No. 2 smartphone vendor worldwide, according to statistics from the International Data Corp. (IDC).The milestone comes as smartphone sales are declining globally and Huawei faces ongoing scrutiny regarding the security of its devices and accusations of fraud. Huawei was the only smartphone maker in the top three that saw an increase in shipments in the first quarter of 2019. The company saw year-over-year growth of 50.3% in the first quarter and claimed 19% of the worldwide market share, IDC reported. That puts the company in a strong position to eventually overtake Samsung as the top smartphone vendor and places it ahead of Apple. Smartphone shipments dropped by 30.2% for Apple in the first quarter of 2019 compared with the same period one year ago, IDC reported.Apple holds 11.7% of the worldwide market share as of the first quarter of 2019, while Huawei now claims 19%. That represents a significant change from the first quarter of 2018, when Apple accounted for 15.7% of the worldwide smartphone market share and Huawei claimed just 11.8%.  Samsung saw its volumes drop by 8.1% in the first quarter of 2019, although it still holds the top spot with 23.1% of the global smartphone market.Huawei soars as rivals struggleApple and Samsung aren't the only major companies experiencing the repercussions of a slowing smartphone market. Google said in its recent earnings report that sales of its Pixel smartphone are falling, and LG's mobile division recently            reported first quarter sales of $1.34 billion, down from $2.01 billion in the            same quarter last year. Huawei in March posted record financial results for 2018, with its revenue surpassing $100 billion for the first time, representing a $19.5% year-over-year increase. Its consumer business, which includes smartphones, grew by 45.1% year-on-year in 2018. Part of Huawei's success can be attributed to its wide-ranging product portfolio, which includes both high-end phones, such as its Mate and P lines, and lower-end devices under its Honor offshoot brand. The company's premium models also created a strong brand affiliation for these cheaper products, IDC said.Apple, meanwhile, struggled to keep up with rivals despite its trade-in programs and price cuts in China, particularly as competitors are readying new models with 5G connectivity and foldable designs, IDC said.Read more: Apple is expected to launch 3 new iPhones this year - here's everything we know so farBut market share and smartphone sales aren't the only metrics by which to measure success. Although Huawei claims more of the worldwide smartphone market than Apple, the iPhone maker generated about $266 billion in annual revenue in its 2018 fiscal year, which is more than double Huawei's 2018 revenue.Apple is now shifting its strategy to focus on other product areas, such as services, to offset slowing iPhone sales. Revenue from its services division hit an all-time high of $11.5 billion, the company said in its recent earnings report, and it plans to release a new paid TV service and a gaming service to further boost that product segment. Huawei's ongoing controversiesStill, Huawei's business is booming, even as it faces more scrutiny than ever before around the globe.Earlier this year, US government officials appeared at the Mobile World Congress conference in Barcelona to lobby its European allies not to use Huawei's equipment in their networks. The move came as a result of the ongoing suspicions about whether the company's technologies provide a backdoor for the Chinese government.Huawei has denied these claims, both in its press conference at Mobile World Congress and more recently in its earnings statement."The easiest way to bring down a fortress is to attack it from within," Guo Ping, Huawei's rotating chairman, wrote in the press release. "And the easiest way to reinforce it is from outside. Moving forward, we will do everything we can to shake off outside distractions, improve management, and make progress toward our strategic goals."The Chinese tech behemoth was also indicted on charges related to fraud and trade-secrets conspiracy earlier this year, to which            it pleaded not guilty.Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer, is also awaiting extradition to the US in connection with fraud charges. The Supreme Court of British Columbia in Vancouver has set a date of May 8 for her hearing.Smartphone sales slow as prices increaseHuawei's success comes amid a global decline in the smartphone market.IDC reported that smartphone sales in the first quarter of 2019 were down by 6.6% year-over-year, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of decline. The first year shipments didn't grow was 2017, the former Kleiner Perkins partner May Meeker said in her Internet Trends report in 2018. Smartphone sales boomed between 2011 and 2016, with 2013 proving to be a landmark year as sales of smartphones surpassed feature phones for the first time. But while smartphone adoption has grown, consumers have stopped upgrading their phones as often, especially as smartphones have become increasingly expensive. Read more: Apple says products like the Apple Watch and AirPods are doing so well, its wearables business is as big as a Fortune 200 companyApple's top-of-the-line iPhone XS Max starts at $1,099, while its smaller iPhone XS starts at $999, and the least expensive latest-generation iPhone, the iPhone XR, starts at $750. In 2016, the company's flagship iPhone 7 was priced at $649.Samsung has followed a similar trajectory. The company announced four versions of its flagship Galaxy S10 in February, which range in price from $750 to $1,300, while the Galaxy S7 from 2016 started at $669.99. New smartphone models in recent years have introduced incremental upgrades, making it difficult to convince consumers to pay $1,000 to upgrade to the latest version.Apple is expected to release three iPhones in September, which will reportedly feature new capabilities, such as reverse wireless charging and a triple-lens camera for the high-end model. But Ryan Reith from IDC believes that Huawei is likely to keep its second-place spot this year. "This new ranking of Samsung, Huawei, and Apple is very likely what we'll see when 2019 is all said and done," he wrote. NOW WATCH: Disney Plus is set to have more than 500 movies and 7,500 TV shows.

Continue reading US spy chiefs used classified info to warn tech execs about doing business with ChinaUS intelligence chiefs have been briefing Silicon Valley tech execs about the possible dangers of doing business in China, according to a report from theFinancial Times.The briefings include warnings about the threat of cyber attacks and the theft of intellectual property, and have been held with groups including tech companies, universities, and venture capitalists in California and Washington.The meetings are the latest example of the US government's increasingly combative stance towards China. In a statement given to the FT, Republican senator Marco Rubio   one of the politicians who organized the briefings   outlined the rationale behind them. It's important that US companies, universities, and trade organizations understand fully that threat.  The Chinese government and Communist party pose the greatest long-term threat to US economic and national security,  said Mr Rubio.  It's important that US companies, universities, and trade organizations understand fully that threat. Those giving the briefings include high-level figures in the US intelligence community such as Dan Coats, director of national intelligence. The meetings also reportedly include the sharing of classified information   an unusual level of disclosure.The FT reports that the briefings began last October. Since then, the trade war between the US and China has escalated dramatically. The most significant intervention came last week, with the White House announcing that US companies will be blocked from buying telecommunications equipment from certain foreign companies including China's Huawei.The Trump administration says this ban is necessary to counter the threat of surveillance and spying from Chinese-made equipment. But the ban is likely to have a big affect on consumers around the world, especially with the news that Google will no longer be able to supply the full version of its Android mobile operating system to Huawei.Tags:  See Campaign:            https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18632236/us-spy-chiefs-brief-silicon-valley-tech-execs-danger-business-chinaContact Information:James VincentTags:,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            Wire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: May 30, 2019End of Document

China Is Closing the Innovation Gap With the U.S.USNEWS.comApril 9, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: CIVIC; Best Countries; Vol.; No.Length: 475 wordsByline: Sintia RaduHighlight: More than 30 indicators show the Asian country has made tremendous progress in the past decade against the United States.BodyChina is slowly but surely closing the innovation gap with the United States, with the country advancing fast in several innovation categories against the U.S., according to a new            report from the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, or ITIF, a nonprofit public policy think tank based in Washington, D.C. that focuses on technology research. The report looked at 36 indicators related to basic research, research and development (R&D), venture capital or education. [READ:World's Most Innovative Countries by Perception]"(I)n an average of all the indicators, China has cut the gap to the United States by a factor of 1.5 from the base year to the most recent year," say the authors of the report. "For example, had China been 80 percent behind the United States a decade or so ago, it would be just 50 percent behind in the most recent year." Among the study's major findings: -- R&D spending: In 2007 China invested $129 billion investment in R&D, 33 percent less than the United States. By 2017, America's research and development expenditures had grown at a 2 percent annual rate, while China reported a 13.1 percent growth.-- China's basic research expenditure relative to the U.S. doubled between 2007 and 2017 but still lags far behind the reported American figures.-- The Chinese government spends more on R&D as a share of its gross domestic product than the United States, going from spending 84 percent of what the U.S. was reporting in 2007, to spending 1.2 times more than the U.S. in 2017.-- The private sector spends more on R&D in China than in the U.S., but the gap is slowly closing. However, Chinese universities still conduct substantially less research than their American counterparts.-- More than half of the top Chinese companies are now counted among the top 2,500 world innovator's list put together by the European Commission, compared to only 2 percent of them in 2007.-- As a share of its population, China produces almost 50 percent more computer science and engineering degrees than the U.S. The report notes that Hong Kong, an autonomous territory in China that is a global financial center, was included in calculating indicators for China. The report's authors also note the implications of China's innovation progress for other countries. As the other Asian tiger economies of Japan and            South Korea moved from being "copiers to innovators," they took market share away from companies in the U.S. and Europe. Given the size of China's economy, the world's second-largest with projections to eventually overtake the U.S., the Asian giant's rise in innovation will have greater global impact. Sintia Radu covers international affairs and technology for U.S. News & World Report.

Iran, Trade Expected to be Top Issues During G20 Summit; Waymo, Uber and G.M. Plan Autonomous Service by Year's End; Arby's Introduces Vegetables Made of Meat; Some New York Counties Refusing to Provide Licenses to Illegal ImmigrantsMORNINGS WITH MARIA MORNINGS WITH MARIA 7:00 AM ESTJune 27, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; FinancialLength: 7517 wordsByline: Maria Bartiromo, Dagen McDowell, Cheryl Casone, Liz Peek, Juan WilliamsGuests: Siraj Hashmi, Michael Kantrowitz, Paul Bremer, Michael P. KearnsBodyMARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, June 27th. Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Breaking news this morning, trade terms, President Xi-Jinping is expected to insist that President Trump lift the Huawei ban as part of U.S. Trade deal. That's according to the "Wall Street Journal" this morning. The "Journal" has all of the terms that Xi-Jinping is going to present to the President. We've got those, coming up.This morning, I'm going to be speaking with the chief security officer of Huawei Technologies, Andy Purdy is joining us live in the 8:00 a.m. hour.Ahead of the G-20 meeting, futures showing the Dow Industrials are lower, although off of the lows of the morning, down 25 points on the Dow Industrials. The S&P is up 5.75. And the Nasdaq up 22 points right now.Boeing is a big drag on the market following a new software issue for the 737 Max. that stock is down 5 percent right now.Yesterday the market was mixed really little changed. Take a look at the numbers at 4:00 on Wall Street when the Dow Industrials were down 11 points. The S&P 500 was down 3. And the Nasdaq was up 25 points at the close yesterday.In Europe this morning, markets are mixed. FT 100 down 25, CAC 40 in Paris down 11. And the Dax index in Germany up about 7 points.In Asia overnight there was some optimism over a deal. The Hang Seng index was up 1.5 percent. Shanghai Composite was up two-thirds of a percent and the Nikkei average in Japan, up better than 1 percent.Well, the border crisis continues, the Senate passed its border bill and that rejecting the House bill. This as some court clerks are refusing to grant driver's license to illegal immigrants. One of the clerks joins us live this morning. Of course, Governor Cuomo wants all illegals to be able to get driver's licenses.Then Arby's takes a shot at meatless burgers. The fast food chain has a vegetable, a vegetable which is actually made of meat.All those stories coming up this Thursday morning. And joining me to break it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the "Washington Examiner" commentary writer and editor Siraj Hashmi and Fox News contributor, columnist for the Hill Liz Peek.Great to see everybody this morning.LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Doesn't that seem backwards? Just when everybody else making meet out of vegetables.SIRAJ HASHMI, COMMENTARY WRITER, "WASHINGTON EXAMINER": Maybe I'll go vegan now. That's not a bad idea knowing that there's a vegetable made of meat.PEEK: A burger that looks like a carrot -- I like it.BARTIROMO: Take that, Beyond Meat.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:: This is my attempt at 7:02 in the morning to not be humorless.BARTIROMO: Let's talk about the issues of the day -- Dagen.MCDOWELL: Yes. So many issues.BARTIROMO: So the "Wall Street Journal" comes out with a list of must-dos according to China. Xi-Jinping is going to present the President with terms when they meet on Saturday and the terms include lift the ban on Huawei, lift all the trade tariffs and --PEEK: And don't insist on more export.BARTIROMO: Don't insist on us buying anything additional.PEEK: That seems like a non-friendly beginning point, I have to say. I don't get it. I mean look, if Xi-Jinping is trying to come into this with a real strong position, as Trump is trying to do, perhaps, but I must say that the Asian markets obviously felt that there was a more conciliatory atmosphere in the air and we're optimistic. This sure doesn't sound like that.BARTIROMO: It sure feels like we're back to square one.PEEK: Yes.BARTIROMO: As you said earlier Dagen.HASHMI: Could Xi Jinping possibly be playing Donald Trump at his own game, you know, where in The Art of the Deal, Trump says that you come in with just an outlandish negotiation or outlandish demand and you try to get them to walk back at least to the point that you want them to compromise on.BARTIROMO: I don't think President Trump is going to walk back on any of this.MCDOWELL: Well, I'll point out that Don Peebles -- I think this was even maybe before the election or right after the election -- he pointed out that as a New York real estate negotiator and developer, that you -- when you negotiate you're sitting at the table and you just stand up and leave the room.And so there is some -- maybe some method to what seems like a little bit of madness here with this Chinese proposal. But again, there's this scene in "Veep" where Selena Meyer (ph) is preparing to meet with the head of China and you say unacceptable and walk out of the room. This will play out in real life.PEEK: Except -- except they already walked out of the room. That's kind of what --MCDOWELL: No, I'm talking about Trump does that.PEEK:MCDOWELL: I don't know.BARTIROMO: But it's true. The Chinese already reneged.PEEK: And by the way, Trump did that in North Korea. But boy, I think people would be pretty -- the markets would go into freefall.HASHMI: It was a good thing when Trump walked away.PEEK: I totally agree. I think that's right.HASHMI: Something that maybe Obama would have done, if Obama was in this position, China would probably get the better end of the deal. You probably wouldn't see tariffs imposed on them like President Trump did.BARTIROMO: And by the way, if Huawei keeps saying we don't answer to the Chinese government, we're not associated with the People's Liberation Army, then why is the Chinese government so interested in getting the ban lifted.I'll be speaking this morning with Andy Purdy, exclusive interview with the chief security officer of Huawei, here this morning, Andy Purdy as China is insisting that the Huawei ban be lifted as well as the punitive tariffs removed as part of any trade truce, according to the "Wall Street Journal" this morning with the breaking news of the morning that initially moved markets lower. We were off the lows right now.Meanwhile, there's the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls looking to stand out during the debate last night. It was the first debate. The second one is tonight.Last night the ten traded jabs on the economy, taxes, healthcare. Kristina Partsinevolos with the details now. She's in Miami this morning. Kristina -- Good morning to you.KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: good morning - - Maria. And like you mentioned you had ten Democrats that took to the stage and clashed over various topics in a fight to push the President out of the White Houser. They spoke in the building right behind me from topics, starting off the night against the wealthy, attacks on corporations and then they continued on to talk about the economy, taxes, and healthcare. Listen to this recap.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BETO O'ROURKE (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This economy has got to work for everyone. And right now we know that it isn't. I would support a tax rate and a tax code that is fair to everyone. Tax capital at the same rate --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: 70 percent.O'ROURKE: -- that you tax ordinary income. Take that corporate tax rate up to 28 percent.This economy is not working for average Americans.SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There are a lot of politicians who say oh, it's just not possible, we just can't do it, have a lot of political reasons for this.What they're really telling you is they just won't fight for it. Well, healthcare is a basic human right.(END VIDEO CLIP)PARTSINEVELOS: Overall, it's a very, very diverse group. But you're pretty much hearing mostly singing the same hymn if I can say that. And so what we saw, various groups but overall you were talking prior to the break about who spoke the longest. It was actually Senator Cory Booker, almost 11 minutes, followed by Beto O'Rourke and then Elizabeth Warren coming in at nine minutes.Tonight though there's going to be a lot of anticipation because you've got some popular faces -- Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders as well as Mayor Pete and you can see just over my shoulder here as of early, 5:00 a.m. this morning, you had Joe Biden supporters here with their signage so it's going to be exciting. And we'll be here covering it in Miami.Back to you -- Maria.BARTIROMO: All right. Kristina -- thanks so much. Kristina Partsinevolos this morning.2020 Democratic hopeful Elizabeth Warren taking aim at the economy last night. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WARREN: Who is this economy really working for? It's doing great for thinner and thinner slice at the top. If you're a great -- giant drug company. This is not really great for people who are trying to get a prescription filled.It's doing great for people who want to invest in private prisons, just not for the African-Americans and Latin (INAUDIBLE) families who are torn apart and lives are destroyed and whose communities are ruined.It's doing great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere, just not for the rest of us who are watching climate change bear down upon us.When you've got a government, when you've got an economy that does great for those with money, and isn't doing great for everyone else -- that is corruption pure and simple. We need to call it out. We need to attack it head-on. And we need to make structural change in our government, in our economy, and in our country.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is "THE FIVE" co-host Juan Williams. Juan -- good to see you this morning.JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Good morning.BARTIROMO: What was your reaction?WILLIAMS: I thought it was a very good debate for the Democrats.I thought that Elizabeth Warren clearly set the tone and was really the giant on the stage there. As you can see, that was her opening statement, Maria and I think it set the tone for the night. Everybody was reacting to her on that level.Second -- I think that Julian Castro had a terrific night. I think when he --MCDOWELL: Jessica Tarlov called that, by the way, yesterday on "OUTNUMBERED" -- so I give her a shout-out for that.BARTIROMO: She said he was going to --WILLIAMS: Yes. I said that on "THE FIVE". I just think that he, again, is -- people don't know him. Last night, one of the primary functions was to introduce these candidates to the American people and I think a lot of people were surprised at how competent and strong he could be. I think especially when he spoke about the immigration system and said he was -- I think lots of people thought hey who is this guy.And then when he spoke about abortion rights and said it's not just about rights and freedoms, it's about justice. Again, that's the kind of power I think people hadn't seen. So I think he had a very good night.I think Booker was pretty strong as you just heard. He spoke a lot. And I was surprised at how much opportunity he had to speak and how he cleared a lane for himself in terms of talking about things like guns and talking about the need, again, to go back to Elizabeth Warren, to make an economy that works for all communities in the country.MCDOWELL: I'm going to hit you back on something.WILLIAMS: Sure.MCDOWELL: So last fall you were sitting on this show and I said Medicare for all abolishes private insurance, and it gets rid of Medicare as we know it and you shook your head at me and said no, no, no, no, no.Last night Elizabeth Warren raised her hand and said I believe in getting rid of private insurance for people. She is going to be held to that. Could it hurt her?WILLIAMS: Of course it could hurt her because I think -- anticipating the response I would get from this group this morning, it's like hey people who have their private insurance and who like their private insurance are, of course, going to feel threatened if you say I'm going to take that away and I'm going to provide you with Medicare for all.Now, last night you heard the response coming from the Democrats which is this will drive down all the costs so that people who have private insurance will have better coverage and cheaper coverage potentially. I imagine that the argument would be the total cost and what it would do some of our pharmaceutical industries, whether or not -- and you heard this by the way from former Congressman DeLay who said hey some hospitals say they can't afford to stay open.BARTIROMO: It's more than that. It's the decision-making is being transferred from the individual to the government. I have -- my sister-in- law's sister is still waiting for an operation in Europe because it's the government that's going to decide when she gets that MRI, when she gets that operation.WILLIAMS: Right.BARTIROMO: It's more than just -- and that's significant enough, doing away with 180 million people's insurance.WILLIAMS: I think that the contrary point is that we have in this country people who don't have either healthcare or sufficient and adequate healthcare -- Maria. And so I think lots of people in this country who are not in our class here this morning would say hey, wait a second, I don't know what's going on with Maria's cousin over in Europe but right here in America there are people who don't get any attention. I can't even get a visit with a doctor.PEEK: So the other point of view is to fix what's broken about Obamacare and make it better but not take a 100 plus million people off of healthcare.MCDOWELL: And that's Joe Biden's opening. I expect to hear a great deal about that, about him standing by President Obama's plan and just trying to fix it.WILLIAMS: I think that's the Democratic position. Now the contrary position I think this is stronger -- remember, one of the things that you have to keep in mind with the debate last night, the audience is a Democratic audience and it's almost like an Iowa audience.MCDOWELL: You got one person clapping for Tulsi Gabbard's service. You could hear the loan two hands smacking together for that.BARTIROMO: I thought she did really well.WILLIAMS: I thought she stood again. I thought she had her moment especially when she made the point about Afghanistan. Because she's a veteran. So she had some power and voice there.BARTIROMO: Well, she hurt Tim Ryan in that exchange.WILLIAMS: Because I think Tim Ryan, who is on the, you know, appropriations committee in House, said you know, we have to stay engaged and she said engaged for what, which is a sentiment lots of Americans across political lines had when you look at something like Afghanistan. And then he stepped in it when he confused the Taliban and al-Qaeda.HASHMI: Juan -- at the end of the day, what do you think is going to be the central message from Democrats going into the general election? Will it be healthcare like they ran on in 2018. Are they just going to run on Trump bad.WILLIAMS: No, in fact, I was a little surprised. I did not think, given my conversations with Democratic strategists, that Trump would be a focus. But I thought there would be more Trump talk, bashing, last night. There was very little.I think that's why the President tweeted boring because it wasn't about him. It wasn't about him. What is this, what's going on in American politics, we're not talking Trump.MCDOWELL: They talked about Mitch McConnell or Cocaine Mitch, his nickname, as much as they talked about Trump.BARTIROMO: They talked a lot about him.WILLIAMS: Yes.PEEK: Juan. Elizabeth Warren's opening statement was in response to the question, 71 percent of Americans say the economy's working well for them right now. So how can she really talk about how it's a thinner and thinner slice of the people who are benefiting from this economy. I just don't think that's true.BARTIROMO: Yes. Somebody forgot to tell her that every single income was actually lowered in the tax cut plan, the income tax. Every single income level.PEEK: Right. Wages are rising faster.(CROSSTALKING)WILLIAMS: Right. (INAUDIBLE) it was disproportionately the case that the people who benefited were the upper income people and especially the people on Wall Street. So I think this is such -- almost universal sentiment among Democrats is that the economy has to work for people who are sitting at the dining room table trying to pay bills and right now it's not.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Juan -- good to see you. Thank you so much.WILLIAMS: Good morning.BARTIROMO: Coming up Boeing shares are plummeting this morning, another software problem found in the 737 Max. It's off of the lows, down two and a third percent right now. Details when we come right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Boeing shares are lower this morning. Cheryl Casone with the details now and headlines.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Talking about this already. You know, this is a Dow component -- Maria. The Federal Aviation Administration has found a flaw that could push the plane's nose down automatically. Fixing the problem likely going to delay the 737's return to service to late summer, following two deadly crashes. Boeing says it agrees with the FAA and they are working to address the problem.But as you can see in the pre-market. The stock is down more than 1.5 percent. It is certainly adding pressure to the Dow Jones Industrial average in the premarket.Well, the Dominican Republic's tourism industry is taking a massive hit as the country deals with the deaths of at least 12 American tourists. Trips booked to the island have dropped by about 75 percent for the month of July and August compared to the same period last year. Other Caribbean nations are benefiting from this -- Jamaica, the Bahamas and Aruba have all seen an increase in bookings for this month.Well, new details on the injuries sustained by a 2-year-old child struck by a foul ball last month at Minute Maid Park in Houston. An attorney for the little girl's family says that she suffered a skull fracture and subdural bleeding, bruising and swelling.That's the player's reaction, by the way, that hit the ball. He was visibly upset by this. The little girl we just found out had a seizure after the injuries. She was hit on the head by a line drive during a game against the Astros. This was on May 29. She was sitting in the lap of a relative. More ball clubs are looking to extend protective netting to further protect fans during the game. So sad.All right. Well, the U.S. economy folks may be booming but achieving the American dream is becoming much harder. According to a new survey from Freddie Mac, only 24 percent of renters said it was extremely likely they would ever own a home. That is down 11 percentage points from four years ago. 82 percent of those renters said that it's more affordable to rent than to buy and that's up sharply from February of last year. And those are your headlines.Even with interest rates this low. And they've been going lower the last couple weeks, but I don't know.BARTIROMO: Yes. All right. Cheryl -- thank you so much.Coming up we are watching interest rates, what the President told me yesterday about what he would like the central bank to do, that's coming up next.And then of course, markets are moving ahead of this meeting between the President and President Xi-Jinping. We are all over that.Starbucks meanwhile with new flavors, the colorful drinks making their debut. We've got that as well, after this break.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Futures this morning are mixed, take a look. Dow futures down 9 points, S&P futures up 5.25 and the Nasdaq up 22.25. As we've been telling you, the "Wall Street Journal" out with a list of terms that apparently Xi- Jinping is going to be presenting to President Trump this Saturday, as the way to get a deal done.And those terms include lifting the ban on Huawei, lifting all tariffs, as well as the punitive tariffs, be lifted as part of any trade truce. We're talking about that this morning.During my exclusive interview with the President yesterday he said he still wants a cut in interest rates despite a strong economic backdrop.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The economy is doing as well as it is. Hey we're at a 51-year- low on unemployment, 3.1 percent growth in the first quarter. Why do we need interest rates to go lower? Why do we need a cut in rates if things are going so well, Mr. President?DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, one thing. We have a lot of debt. I want to get it out. I want to pay it off. We have a lot of debt. But what we really have is we're going to stay even with these people.So not only are we raising -- I've had nine interest rate hikes. Obama had nothing. He had cheap money. So my economy is far better than Obama's economy. Obama's economy was ready to crash. You couldn't do anything. The rules and regulations which I've gotten rid off, I have great rules and regulations but they're reasonable. Obama, under Obama, you couldn't do anything.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And of course that board of futures was yesterday when I was talking with the President that was up 90 points. This morning a very different story.Joining us right now is Michael Kantrowitz of Cornerstone Macro. Michael - - it's good to see you. Thanks so much for being here.MICHAEL KANTROWITZ, CORNERSTONE MACRO: Thank you -- Maria.BARTIROMO: And the President said when talking about a rate cut, we want to get in level with everybody else. He's talking about Europe. Mario Draghi, you know, suggesting that more stimulus is coming, sent the euro lower and makes it real competitive. That's what he's talking about. Do you think we're going to see a rate cut?KANTROWITZ: Yes. It seems the Fed needs to cut rates or at least the market's trying to get the Fed to cut rates. It seems we're probably going to get something less than 50 basis points which the market seems to want. It does seem that Powell and Bollard suggest we're going to see a rate cut sooner than later.BARTIROMO: And you've been expecting things to really slow down. I'm looking at your most recent note where you're telling clients to buckle up for a bad earnings season. We're in the doorstep of the second quarter earnings season. What are you expecting?KANTROWITZ: Yes. We've been seeing global leading indicators now decline for 18 months and leading indicators lead coincident indicators like earnings. And the chart in my report shows how the next couple of earnings seasons, Q2 and Q3 as they get reported were likely to see fewer and fewer companies beat analysts estimates.A year and a half ago. we had two thirds of companies beating estimates last quarter. It was about 50. I'm expecting fewer than half to beat in the next quarter and even less than that in the subsequent quarter following that.PEEK: What do you think that means for the job market?KANTROWITZ: The jobs are also slowing. We have seen leading indicators in the U.S. also declining. It's not just Europe and emerging markets that have been weak and so profits tend to lead job growth and profit growth has been weakening.We think profit growth will be weaker than the street is currently expecting. The Street is still currently expecting 3 percent to 4 percent growth this year and 11 percent growth next year and that's where we think the Street is way too high. But job growth is likely to weaken on the back of weaker profit growth.I think we're also going to see fewer buybacks, less cap ex, less M&A eventually as well. So the liquidity for the Fed may by the lack of liquidity -- the removal of liquidity for the businesses investing and hiring.MCDOWELL: That was really my question -- would a rate cut by the Federal Reserve really stabilize the economy, prevent it from getting worse?KANTROWITZ: I would say that outside of a crisis environment where we've got like an LTCM problem in 1998, or where interest rates are the problem, like the 70s and 80s, it's going to be hard for the fed to cut rates only once and stabilize the economy. They really never have. Usually when the fed is cutting rates, the economy continues to slow for at least another year, which is why you've never seen only one rate cut or only two rate cuts. Usually the feds are cutting rates 200 -- 300 basis points.MCDOWELL: so you're saying we could have an economy that's slowing into the election year.KANTROWITZ: Possibly. We think, though, that leading indicators of the economy, while they've been slowing for about a year and-a-half in the U.S. and now you're starting to see that show up in data like industrial production, job growth and profits, we do think leading indicators could pick up early next year and start to show the signs of some green chutes of a recovery by the time we get later into the year and the election.BARTIROMO: So this morning we've got Boeing taking a hit, news that the FAA found more software issues for the 737 max jet, 2 and a quarter percent -- that's going to impact the broader market. And I like the question that you ask in your note. Your recent report -- you say how long can the market remain resilient as the data continues to weaken.So you look at the impact Boeing has on the market today, let's talk about the impact to all of this that you're talking about it's going to have on the broader market. Is any of this priced in? Do you think market sells off.KANTROWITZ: We do think in the second half the market will sell off. So the overall broad market -- the S&P (INAUDIBLE) index, the Dow Jones Industrials index has really been side ways for about a year and-a-half. We've tried to get back to new highs. We get there and then we kind of have some kind of issue that pulls us back.And so in the beginning of 2018 it was really cyclical stocks that got us to those new highs. And then throughout 2019 this year, it was growth stocks that got us back to the new highs. And as of a few weeks ago, it was really defensive stocks, utilities and REITs that kept us at these new highs.So the rotation within the market has been from value to growth to defense over the last year and-a-half. And that's kept the market resilient. But underneath the surface it's been I think grown weaker than the index suggests.HASHMI: Michael -- do you think it's safe to say that the market and the economy as a whole has peaked.KANTROWITZ: In the near term, we do think it is a fact that leading indicator have peaked. It is a fact that coincident data in terms of the second derivative have peaked. The market does definitely show the telltale signs of a peak, at least -- or potential correction coming up in the second half.BARTIROMO: And just to be clear, you and your colleagues, you're not expecting a China deal right now.KANTROWITZ: No. Andy Le Perrier (ph) our policy analyst at Cornerstone Macro does not believe that we will see a deal until the election.PEEK: What if there were one? Would that change your perspective significantly?KANTROWITZ: If there was a deal that removed a lot of the tariffs that have been put in place, that would certainly help sentiment and I think in the near term, certainly help the market. But at the end of the day, we still think we have to digest the full effect of the tightening cycle we just had from the Fed and that's probably going to stay with us for about another six to nine months.BARTIROMO: When does the Fed cut rates do you think? Later this year?KANTROWITZ: It seems the Fed is setting up -- setting up the market for a cut coming soon, sooner than later -- sooner than later.(CROSSTALK)KANTROWITZ: And I think if they do start to cut rates and if the data does not pick up, we're likely to see many more cuts down the road.BARTIROMO: But if you see a cut in rates, does that send markets higher, does that help what otherwise could have been a selloff for stocks?KANTROWITZ: We don't think so. Periods when the market has gone up when the Fed has been easing had been periods like the early '80s and the early '90s and even 70's where interest rates were really high and they were a problem. So by the Fed cutting rates or rates falling in general, that helped the market. Today we don't have a high rates problem. We have a growth problem which can't be turned around with one or two rate cuts.MCDOWELL: I think when the Federal Reserve cut rates it was in early 2001 in January, it was a surprise cut after the NASDAQ had already peaked. The NASDAQ had its best one day performance ever in one day, it was a double digit gain in one day and it then right after that continued this crash.KANTROWITZ: Yes.BARTIROMO: So is there anywhere to hide, Michael? Real quick before you go, I mean, you're painting a picture of a slowing economy, potentially market selloff as a result of that, no help from the Fed even if we were to see a cut, anywhere to hide? I mean, anything -- what do you recommend?KANTROWITZ: We've been recommending a more defensive posture for investors and that's being even extended now into gold prices, we're seeing break out, even Bitcoin. The investors are looking for things that are not cyclically sensitive to the economy, and that are not sensitive to the trade or even the Fed. So we've been recommending utilities, healthcare, staples, real estate, gold. It's really a defensive assets and we think investors want to park their money there for about another six to nine months and then we do expect to see things improve early next year.BARTIROMO: All right, Michael, great insights. Thanks so much.KANTROWITZ: You bet.BARTIROMO: Michael Kantrowitz from Cornerstone Macro this morning.Coming up, President Trump is at the G20 summit, what he's being asked ahead of the crucial trade meeting with China's president, next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, June 27th.We have breaking news this morning on trade terms, President Xi Jinping will insist that President Trump lift the Huawei ban as part of any U.S.- China trade deal. This is according to the Wall Street Journal this morning. The Journal has a list of the terms that the Chinese want the president to agree to and we will bring them to you right now.The president is in Japan, he arrived earlier this morning for the G20 summit. There he is getting off of Air Force One. He's currently having dinner with Scott Morrison the Prime Minister of Australia where the president talked about U.S. allies.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think I can say very easily that we've been very good to our allies. We work with our allies. We take care of our allies. We generally speaking, I've inherited massive trade deficits with our allies. And we even help our allies militarily, so --(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Coming up this morning, I'll be speaking with Huawei Technology's chief security officer, Andy Purdy. That is in the next hour. Join us for that special interview.Futures this morning are down, but they are -- well, we are looking like we are trading down once again, toward the lows, Dow Futures down 30 points, S&P Futures are up three points and the NASDAQ Futures are up 15.Remember, Boeing is part of the Dow, and that's one of the reasons that the Dow was down 28 points. Take a look at the stock this morning. Boeing's new software issue driving that stock down 2-1/3 percent. Taking about a hundred points off of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. So without Boeing, we would actually see a rally in the Dow Industrials this morning. There is another software glitch found in the 737.Yesterday, markets were mixed. Take a look at the Dow Industrials, down 11 points, S&P down three, and the NASDAQ yesterday up 25 when all was said and done. Remember in the morning hours, there was a rally underway on a false report about the U.S. and China being close when in fact they're not close at all.The FT-100 right now is down 29 points, the CAC Quarante in Paris is down 15 and the DAX Index in Germany is up six points.In Asia overnight, markets rally then the U.S.-China trade optimism report. And as you can see, the Shanghai Composite was up two-thirds of a percent, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was up almost 1-1/2 percent.Border crisis meanwhile, some court clerks are refusing to grant driver's licenses to illegal immigrants. One of the clerks is with us this morning, live.Starbucks losing money overseas. This as the coffee giant introduces new drinks for the summertime. We will tell you about that.And Arby's takes a shot at meatless burgers. Check this out, the fast food chain has a vegetable but it's really made of meat. It looks like a vegetable. Make you feel better about yourself, I guess.Breaking news this last half an hour, President Trump arriving in Japan for the G20 summit. And China President Xi Jinping is going to be armed with terms for the president before they agree to any deal. In fact, Xi Jinping is expected to insist that President Trump lift the ban on Huawei as part of a U.S.-China trade deal, this is according to the Wall Street Journal this morning. The Journal also reports that Xi Jinping is going to say to do away with all of the punitive tariffs and do not insist that the Chinese buy excessive -- number of goods from the United States.Now, there are crucial meetings on trades taking center stage. But Iran tensions are sure to be another main topic of the summit this weekend. Yesterday in an exclusive interview, I spoke with President Trump about the recent tensions and the threat from Iran.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Are we going to have a war with Iran, Mr. President?TRUMP: Well, I hope we don't. But we're in a very strong position if we have something should happen, we're in a very strong position. It wouldn't last very long, I can tell you that.BARTIROMO: The sanctions are enough in your view to fight back on Iran's provocations?TRUMP: Well, the sanction is a very biding. When I took over, Iran was a terror. We had 18 to 14 to 18 sites of confliction. Iran was behind every one of them. Look at what -- they were going to take over the Middle East and they were going to make it really very, very bad.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is the former presidential envoy to Iraq, former National Commissioner (ph) on Terrorism Chairman and former ambassador to the Netherlands, Paul Bremer. Sir, good to have you on the program this morning. Thanks so much for joining me.PAUL BREMER, FORMER CHAIRMAN, NATIONAL COMMISSION ON TERRORISM: Nice to be with you, Maria.BARTIROMO: So what is your reaction to what we've seen from Iran these last couple of weeks and what do you think the U.S.'s response should be?BREMER: Well, let's start by recognizing, the Persians have been at the game of empire for thousands of years. They know a thing or two about their location and their geography. And I think if I were in their shoes, I would be confused by what the American policy is on two key points. The question of regime change and the question that you asked the president about the use of military force. I think they have a right to be somewhat confused about what our policy really is. And that's potentially dangerous.BARTIROMO: Do you mean because we pulled out of the Iran deal?BREMER: No, the key problem is the president has said that we don't seek regime change. The Secretary of State has said he wants Iran to be a normal country and we're ready for what secretary called unconditional talks, but then he listed 12 conditions. Only three of which related to the Iran nuclear deal. Nine others effectively said to the Iranians we want you to change your regime. So, there's a real question about that.Then, on the use of force, the president after the turnaround last week about whether we would hit or not hit the radar site that brought down our drone, sent out a tweet saying if Iran attacks anything American, anything, not any Americans, anything American, our response will be overwhelming even to obliteration. That suggests a willingness to use force and in effect to go to war. Then he -- his Secretary of Defense said, just a day later, we are not going to war with Iran. Which means is it off the table then? Is military response off the table despite what the president said?So, you know, in a war, there's something to be said for spreading confusion in the enemy camp. But if you're trying to avoid a war, in diplomacy, a certain degree of precision and clarity is needed and I don't think we're certainly not any way in the public domain, we're not being very clear.BARTIROMO: Right.PEEK: Ambassador, question for you. Thank you for joining us this morning. What do you think should be the off-ramp for Iran? In other words, we have to give them some way to get back to the negotiating table which is not a total humiliation or repudiation of the JCPOA or whatever past agreements we've had. What do you think could be a path forward?BREMER: Well, I rather optimistically as it turned out thought that the president's decision not to carry out the attack might have been a signal to the Iranians that there was an off-ramp and one could hope that there are back channeled communications going on right now between the Swiss that represent us in Tehran or between the Omanis who have traditionally been a very good third party area.But with the sanctioning of the Supreme Leader and the -- and the Iranian Foreign Minister, I'm not sure that we've offered any off-ramps at this point. It's very different -- and this is -- I mean, this is how unintentional wars get started. When you're not being very clear, at least in private, as to what the red lines really are.HASHMI: Ambassador, do you think President Trump has done a pretty decent job of at least holding some of the hoax in his administration like Secretary Pompeo and National Security adviser John Bolton at bay here?BREMER: Well, I don't find it very profitable to speculate on the internal debates within the administration. And I don't think the Iranians do either. I think the Iranians will pay attention to the kind of confusing messages that I refer to both on the question of regime change and on the question of the use of force.And you know, it was 150 years ago tomorrow that basically century of war descended on Europe when the Europeans were unable to deal with a minor crisis, which was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, exactly at a 150 years ago tomorrow. This is a dangerous thing to be -- a dangerous situation to find ourselves in. Now, again, --BARTIROMO: So, you'd like to see more clarity -- you'd like to see clarity on regime change as -- and what the U.S. administration wants, as well as the potential for military force? Obviously they're not going to spell out what they may or may not do on military force but I understand your point on the regime change.BREMER: Yes, I think there needs to be more clarity at a minimum in whatever we're saying privately to the Iranians, and we have channels. We have channels through the Europeans, the Japanese, he'll be seeing, Abe. Abe was just in Tehran. He got stiffed because he brought a message that the president wanted to have a communication with Ayatollah Khomeini and Khomeini publicly while Abe was sitting there, saying I'm not interested in having a conversation with Trump. But we have -- he has channels that he can exploit while he's in Osaka, if that's something he wants to do.BARTIROMO: Ambassador, thank you. Great insights from you and we appreciate you joining us this morning.BREMER: Nice to be with you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Paul Bremer joining us there. Coming up, Uber is under pressure this morning, drivers organizing north of the border. We've got those details.And then Arby's taking on the meatless trend. That company flipping vegan meat on its head. Wait until you see this. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, Uber drivers in Canada are banning together to protect their livelihood. Cheryl Casone with the details now, Cheryl.CASONE: Yes, so hundreds of Uber drivers in Toronto have signed up with the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. They operate in about Canada and the United States, we should say. The drivers are demanding a minimum wage and end of the ratings system and better working conditions.Uber along with Waymo and G.M. do plan to release we should add here fleets of autonomous cars in many cities across the United States by the end of this year. Waymo is also making some of its self-driving minivans for Uber rival Lyft. The rides are going to be restricted to an area near Phoenix, Arizona where Waymo has been testing those self-driving vehicles.Well, business may be strong for Starbucks in the U.S., but it's a different in the U.K. Starbucks posted an annual loss of about $22 million in the year ending September 2018 reversing a profit from a year ago. The company is taking a charge for renegotiating leases and closing unprofitable stores. Well, it is sunnier days for Starbucks here in the U.S. where some colorful new drinks are making their debut for the Dog Days of Summer. Look for three new teas and iced espresso drink coming this week. The teas are going to be available all year long. There is Starbucks, up 0.02 percent in the premarket.All right, this is my favorite story, Maria. First there was fake meat. Now Arby's is taking it one step further. The company has created fake vegetables, they're calling them Megetables. First up is the Marrot, there it is. It's a carrot but it's actually made of meat. The Marrot contains all the vitamins found in raw carrot, it looks like a raw carrot but it actually is not a carrot. The company says it's still testing the Marrot and it's not sure when or if it will be available. Because I'm sure people are going to be lining up to order that. Those are your headlines.BARTIROMO: Why?CASONE: Exactly. Yuck.BARTIROMO: Thanks, Cheryl.CASONE: That's all I've got, sorry.BARTIROMO: So, driver's license for illegals, coming up, the controversial plan to give illegal immigrants driver's licenses. Why my next guest is refusing to compromise with that law. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Driver's license for illegal immigrants. Clerks in some New York counties are taking a stand against the state's controversial new law, set to go into effect in December.Joining me right now is one of them, Erie County Clerk Michael P. Kearns. Michael, it's great to have you on the program this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.MICHAEL P. KEARNS, CLERK, ERIE COUNTY: Good morning.BARTIROMO: So, Governor Cuomo said that he would like illegals to be able to drive. What do you think is behind that law, first off?KEARNS: Probably more voters. But for me, my opposition is dealing with the conflict with federal law. Right now, this creates an obstacle for our federal law enforcement to do their jobs, to prevent illegals from being here. It prevents conflict for the clerks. It puts them in a precarious situation because do we file state law or federal law?And look at yesterday, the other day, we had an Orleans county bus by ICE that took some illegal aliens that were working on the firm and they had false documents. They were in federal court yesterday. So, I've met with my attorneys and we're going to challenge this law in court.BARTIROMO: I mean, just to be clear, in many cases all you need is a driver's license to vote.KEARNS: All you need is a driver's license to vote especially in New York state, with the Motor Voter law. Not only will it create fraud, there's a possibility to even purchase firearms. So these are things that we're looking at when we're looking at safety and security and not even talking about how this going to impact our local auto bureaus where with real I.D. after we're attacked in 9/11, we had unprecedent number of people renewing their license and it's a less stringent standard for those who are here illegally other than our citizens who are here obviously illegally.HASHMI: Michael, Siraj here, quick question with respect to this particular issue. Do you see any parallels with respect to, say, the Kim Davis issue when she refused to basically honor the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling that basically allowing gay couples to marry? Do you think there's going to be any sort of backlash like that?KEARNS: Well, I think it's a different case. Not only myself, there are other clerks throughout the state of New York that are not going to comply with the law. We're basing our argument on law and that's the difference in that. That was a religious opinion on her part. We're going into federal court. We're preparing our paperwork and we're going on the rule of law.Remember, in New York State now they have to be notified, ICE has to be notified and that illegal alien gets a three-day notification if there's a judicial warrant pulled out against them. And that's something that an average citizen, a united citizen doesn't get. So, this is all about the rule of law.BARTIROMO: Yes, I know, I think you make great points, Michael. I hope you'll come back to give us an update on where this stands. Thanks so much for joining us.KEARNS: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Michael Kearns. Still ahead, my exclusive interview with the chief security officer of Huawei, Andy Purdy, next hour, right here.Load-Date: June 27, 2019End of Document

Trump vs. Huawei: the empire strikes backCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 24, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1004 wordsBody You buy a luxury or compact vehicle and the next day finds out by the means that the manufacturer will no longer have spare parts or maintenance. After the initial shock, you will most likely seek to get rid of that car as soon as possible and never buy that brand again. That is the perception of the millions of users of Huawei devices, that is the intention of the United States government to include said Chinese manufacturer in the black list of the Department of Commerce of the American Union. But what does not kill, strengthens.  President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order declaring a national emergency! ensure and protect from foreign threats and adversaries the supply chain of information and communication technologies and services. Let's recognize Trump's strategic vision of digital networks for the immediate future of the US and global economy. The US Department of Justice accuses Huawei, "the largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment," of bank fraud, electronic fraud and trade relations with Iran.  Now the sale or transfer of US technology to Huawei requires a license issued by the Department of Industry and Security of the Department of Commerce, that is, the manufacturers and / or developers of US technology can not provide (by effect of the Executive Order) equipment, solutions or technological services to the Chinese consortium.  Google was the first to suspend the transfer of software, hardware and services to Huawei. (Qualcomm, Intel and other companies and operators joined the ban). That means that future devices of the Chinese manufacturer will lack the Android operating system, popular Google applications and their updates.  According to the Justice Department statement, "the government investigation is ongoing," that is, there is still no sentence. Huawei has also been accused by the US of spying for the Chinese government via telecommunications networks, in alleged compliance with China's State Security Law, which requires companies and individuals in that country to "provide assistance with related work." with the security of the State. "  For this second accusation, the US has not provided any evidence that there are really risks of cybersecurity, back doors or Huawei espionage actions through their teams in favor of the Chinese regime. The US has put pressure on several countries so that future deployments of 5G networks do not include hardware or software from the Chinese supplier, "for security reasons". Without evidence, several nations have folded to Trump's mandate, but others like Germany or France have resisted and proposed alternatives to "manage cybersecurity risk."  According to Counterpoint, as of March 2019, 17% of smartphones in the world were Huawei, second only to Samsung (21%) and above Apple (12%). A year earlier, the Chinese manufacturer's market share was 11% (and 5% in the first quarter of 2015), positioning itself as the fastest growing manufacturer and, therefore, as a threat to its competitors . In the Chinese smartphone market, Huawei is the undisputed leader with 29% (1Q19). In Europe it occupies the second position with 26% market share. In Latin America, Huawei enjoys 13.2% market share, behind Samsung (36.6%) and Motorola (14.9%) (3Q18).  These figures reveal the immense disproportion of Google's decision to restrict its software and apps to Huawei. A reverse reading suggests that the Executive Order does not measure Huawei's security risks but the size and colossal power of Internet companies such as Google. The measure seeks to exclude Huawei and the users of its gadgets from the digital ecosystem supported by mobile operating systems. Atbetter, with Huawei will be born a third operating system (HongMeng OS?) behind Apple's Android and iOS, important for the Huawei market share but not for its influence or social roots. There is Tizen, the other Samsung operating system that failed, but that glimpsed the risk of dependence on Android.  Trump's Executive Order, unintentionally, placed the reflectors on Google as "owner" of the global digital switch, capable of disconnecting, shutting down and expelling millions of users of systems, applications and services, when what is spoken at the level of public policies is digital inclusion. We are facing one of the attacks on the right of access to the most enormous ICTs due to its global reach.  The philosophy of Huawei, both in consumer devices and in computer systems and telecommunications networks, is summarized in one sentence: "the same but cheaper". This commercial strategy is the result of a "socialist market economy" or "socialism with Chinese characteristics" that promotes accelerated growth. The President of China, Xi Jinping, proclaimed in 2013 the "Chinese Dream" and set a short-term goal to achieve that in 2021 the Chinese society live at least modestly well-off.  International organizations, governments of the world, regulators, universities and research centers and large technology companies (especially an innovative and avant-garde Sillicon Valley) should not allow the empire to make decisions and affect the digital life of millions of people. people with irreversible effects, without evidence and without firm sentences. The US has previously lied, for example, to justify the second invasion of Iraq in 2003, due to alleged weapons of mass destruction that were never found nor its existence demonstrated. Do you believe Trump?  The accusations against Huawei should serve to implement a global collaboration framework that allows creating and sharing cybersecurity standards for future 5G networks. Also, the Chinese government has already delayed in suppressing that fragment of its Law of State Security that forces to collaborate with the communist regime: it is affecting its own companies. Later we will know if this attack kills or strengthens Huawei, and if the war that already started is between countries or between Internet territories to create a new (des) digital order. Twitter : @beltmondi Load-Date: May 24, 2019End of Document

China's LGBT community excited by Pete Buttigieg's presidential runCNN.comApril 15, 2019 Monday 11:57 AM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 808 wordsByline: By Steven Jiang, CNNDateline: Beijing BodyWith the official launch of his presidential campaign Sunday, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, is pitching to become the first openly gay US President in history.That prospect -- albeit still a long shot -- is attracting the growing attention of LGBT communities around the world, including in China where experts and activists say sexual minorities face persistent discrimination as well as periodic government crackdowns.There has been no coverage of Buttigieg on China's strictly controlled state media, but some LGBT community leaders are following the Democratic hopeful, whose unexpected rise in the past weeks has dominated US political news, in overseas media."I know he's 37 years old, once the youngest mayor in America, an Afghanistan war veteran and a Harvard graduate," said Xiaogang Wei, a leading LGBT rights advocate in China who heads the Beijing Gender Health Education Institute."Any openly gay world leader is good news in terms of raising LGBT visibility," he added. "But a gay US President would bring so much global visibility and that would be a very positive development for LGBT communities around the world."LGBT censorshipHomosexuality is not illegal in China and the authorities removed it from the official list of mental disorders in 2001. But in recent years, the Communist government under President Xi Jinping has taken an increasingly hardline stance on LGBT rights, banning portrayal of same-sex relationships on television and online.In March, most mentions of homosexuality were removed from "Bohemian Rhapsody," the award-winning biopic of British rock band Queen's frontman Freddie Mercury, prior to its release in China.Among the clips that were removed were scenes of men kissing and the word "gay" for the Chinese audience.While expressing their excitement over Buttigieg's candidacy, activists in China say there is a scarcity of Chinese-language information on him. The Chinese social media posts on Buttigieg that do exist appear to have so far drawn largely admiring and supportive reactions, mixed with occasional homophobic comments."When the US legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, it triggered an outpouring of discussions and soul-searching on LGBT rights in China for weeks," said Hua Zile, founder of the "Voice of China LGBT," a social media page with more than a million followers on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter."If (Buttigieg) gets elected, it would undoubtedly have a very positive effect on us," he said, adding his site would like to translate and share more articles on the candidate.'Imagine Xi having to meet Buttigieg'Buttigieg has not shied away from talking about this sexuality, recounting his struggles to come out, highlighting his marriage to high school teacher Chasten Glezman, and feuding with conservative US Vice President Mike Pence on the relationship between one's religious faith and stance on LGBT rights.But the young mayor has stressed that he is not running for any one group, quipping in an interview last week: "If I thought to myself just in terms of identity lines, it'd be a pretty lonely place, because I'm the only Maltese-American Episcopalian gay veteran that I know."Some of Buttigieg's Chinese fans, however, wish to see the spotlight on his sexuality stay on so that China's leaders would eventually be forced to face up to a topic that they have long shunned publicly."Imagine Xi having to meet Buttigieg and his husband," said Billy Zhao, a gay Chinese millennial who has lived in Washington on and off for the past eight years.At least two openly gay Western leaders -- the prime ministers of Iceland and Luxembourg -- have visited China in the past decade, but their same-sex spouses were nowhere to be mentioned in state media reports."Most Chinese people, especially those from my parents' and grandparents' generations, are still very ignorant of homosexuality," said Zhao, an energy consultant. "I think Americans electing a gay President would have a great impact on their mentality, with all the news coverage opening a conversation on the subject."Zhao has been sending his friends in China links to videos of Buttigieg's interviews and speeches, only to see his effort thwarted by the fact that YouTube has long been blocked by the Beijing government.Some Chinese advocates for LGBT rights have also noticed Buttigieg's lack of specific policy positions, a growing complaint from his US critics as he quickly gains name recognition and rises in polls."I still don't know much about his governing philosophy," said Wei, the Beijing activist. "I want to find out how he plans to engage civil societies in the rest of the world and make the US a role model.""Being a gay President could be a double-edged sword," he cautioned.

14 seconds of undercover footage reveals the shadowy, sinister reality of China's 21st-century police stateBusiness Insider USJune 27, 2019 Thursday 01:26 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 930 wordsByline: ama@businessinsider.com,  (Alexandra Ma)Highlight: China is severely cracking down the Uighurs, a Muslim ethnic minority in the country's west. Beijing claims they are national-security threats.BodyT. Wang / VICE News Tonight• Xinjiang, a frontier region in China's west, is the most oppressed area in China.• Authorities in the region are spying on and arbitrarily arresting people from the Muslim Uighur minority population and, in many cases, torturing and detaining them in prison-like camps.• VICE News published eerie undercover footage of eight Uighur men being marched down to a local police station. Its documentary on Xinjiang publishes Thursday night.• Watch the clip below.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.Eight young men, wearing dark clothing, are marching in complete silence down a busy city street.They are striding almost in unison toward a police station, where they will likely face hours of intense questioning and risk being sent away to what's called a "re-education camp." People who get sent there are locked away, with no idea of when they might get out.This is the scene in VICE News's new documentary on the western Chinese region of Xinjiang, the most oppressed in the country. This particular scene - which takes up 14 chilling seconds in the 30-minute documentary - was taken by two undercover reporters around 12:30 a.m. in Hotan, a bustling town in southwestern Xinjiang.The men were marched for around four minutes, according to VICE News. Watch a clip of the moment below.Youtube Embed: //www.youtube.com/embed/p-VIGznQB14 Width: 560px Height: 315px We know the danger that the men in the video face not because we know their names, or can see their faces, but because they are Uighurs - the majority-Muslim ethnic minority currently under unprecedented scrutiny and surveillance by the Chinese government.Read more: This map shows a trillion-dollar reason why China is oppressing more than a million MuslimsIsobel Yeung, the VICE News correspondent who posed as a travel blogger to capture the video, tweeted that visiting Xinjiang was the "hardest, most harrowing story" she has ever worked on.Kevin Frayer/Getty ImagesThough Beijing has cracked down on Uighur activity since 2009, when a series of ethnic riots took place across the country, it only recently started ramping up its high-tech surveillance operation, and handing out sterner punishments to the people.This 21st-century police state involves installing close to one million facial recognition cameras across the region, making Uighurs download spyware on their phones, and holding at least one million Uighurs in prison-like detention centers.Former detainees have described having to sing patriotic songs in order to get food, and being both physically and mentally tortured.Read more: What it's like inside the internment camps China uses to oppress its Muslim minority, according to people who've been thereBen Blanchard/ReutersBeijing characterizes all Uighurs as terrorists, and has routinely tried to stoke Islamophobia and cite national security concerns to justify its actions in the region.Authorities have imposed a variety of oppressive laws in the region, including asking tech companies to block and report the transfer of any content that might seem unsavory to the regime.It has also been reported that authorities have arrested people for refusing to drink alcohol or            setting their watch two hours behind Beijing Standard Time to            adhere to natural daylight hours in Xinjiang.Read more: China uses an intrusive surveillance app to track its Muslim minority, with technology that could be exported to the rest of the world. Here's how it works.Reuters/PoolUighurs - who refer to Xinjiang as East Turkestan - believe that China is trying to eradicate their culture. Beijing says it is unifying the Chinese nation.Authorities in the region have also started detaining Uighurs even if they haven't committed a crime. They say it's to prevent them from doing so.Zhang Zhisheng, a top official at the Xinjiang Foreign Affairs Office, told the BBC in a recent interview: "Some people, before they commit murder, already show they're capable of killing. Should we wait for them to commit the crime? Or should we prevent it from happening?"OZAN KOSE/AFP/Getty ImagesThe plight of the Uighurs has captured international attention, with The New York Times having featured a story about Xinjiang above the fold of its front page at least once over the past year.The US has criticized China over its human rights record in Xinjiang, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo particularly vocal.But the White House has so far ignored repeated calls by several Democratic and Republican members of Congress to impose sanctions on human-rights offenders in Xinjiang.Muslim-majority countries, such as Pakistan, have also refused to speak out against the Uighur atrocities. Many analysts say it's because they don't want to incur Beijing's wrath, and lose out on their beneficial economic relationship with China.Read more: A wave of Islamic countries started to stand up to China over its persecution of its Muslim minority. But then they all got spooked.Watch a trailer to the VICE News documentary below.
