'South Park' Fires Back at China After Series Ban: 'F*ck the Chinese Government'Indiewire TVOctober 10, 2019Copyright 2019 Penske Media Corporation All Rights ReservedLength: 483 wordsBodyThe battle between "South Park" and            China escalated October 9 with the airing of the            Comedy Central series' landmark 300th episode. The episode "SHOTS!!!" was the third installment of "South Park" Season 23 and the first installment of the show to air after the series was            banned in China. The previous episode, "Band in China,"            featured criticisms of Chinese labor camps and of Hollywood's dependency on China, leading the Chinese government to wipe "South Park" episodes from the internet and and any mention of the show off popular social media websites."South Park" co-creator Trey Parker wrote and directed "SHOTS!!" and reacted to the show's China ban with a blunt attack: "Fuck the Chinese government." The insult was said by Randy, who in the previous episode traveled to China in order to expand his weed business. Randy looks past human rights atrocities in order to maintain his business relationship with China, forcing his business partner Towelie to step forward and make him cut ties with China. Towelie forces Randy to disown China, prompting him to yell, "Fuck the Chinese government.""Band in China" featured two storylines that led to China banning "South Park." One story followed a Hollywood producer trying to make a biopic about Stan's metal band. The group members are told not to mention the Dalai Lama, homosexuality, or Winnie the Pooh so that the movie can make more money in China and not be censored or banned by the Chinese government. "We live in a time when the only movies that us American kids go see are the ones that are approved by China," Stan is heard saying during the episode.Randy's weed business is the subject of the second storyline. As he's traveling to China, Randy spots NBA players, Marvel superheroes, Google executives, and Disney princesses all on the same plane. Randy is caught with weed after he lands in China and is sent to a Chinese labor camp. Winnie the Pooh is spotted as a prisoner here. China has often censored "Winnie the Pooh" in the past because some people compare Chinese president Xi Jinping to the character.China reacted to the "South Park" episode by scrubbing the show from existence. "South Park" does not air on Chinese television, but pirated versions of episodes have regularly circulated online. Clearly "South Park" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone aren't backing down to the ban so easily, and neither is Comedy Central. The official "South Park" Twitter account posted a gif of the "fuck the Chinese government" moment right after the episode aired.#SouthPark300           #BannedInChina           pic.twitter.com/OdWLA2yzSS- South Park (@SouthPark) October 10, 2019More from IndieWire'South Park' Removed From Chinese Internet After Critical 'Band in China' Episode           'The Daily Show' Behind the Scenes: Trevor Noah Tells Democrats to 'Get Their Sh-t Together'Load-Date: October 10, 2019End of Document

How the NBA Represents the Chinese Government's Threat to Global DemocracyThe Wesleyan Argus: Wesleyan UniversityOctober 11, 2019 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 912 wordsByline: Jack Leger, Opinion EditorBodyLast week, Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted out a message in support of the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. For a little context, the Houston Rockets are enormously popular in China, thanks to the efforts of the most famous Chinese basketball player ever, Yao Ming. The relationship between the National Basketball Association and China extends past the Rockets, as the league has a reported $1.5 billion streaming deal with Chinese social media company Tencent. The company released a statement in the past week saying it will no longer stream Rockets games, despite the popularity of the team in China. The Chinese government promptly ordered the removal of posters promoting the Nets preseason game, looking to erase any symbol of what they characterize as "American interference."The response from the NBA higher-ups and members of the Rockets organization has been disgraceful in the social justice sense. The owner of the Rockets, Tilman Fertitta, issued a statement saying that Morey does not speak for the organization, claiming the Rockets organization is not a political one. This argument holds little weight, given Fertitta's public appearances endorsing President Trump. NBA commissioner Adam Silver, on the other hand, faced a major dilemma as the NBA's boss. Should he support the freedom of speech of one of his employees, or should he bow to the pressure of an authoritarian state in exchange for the billions generated by the league's presence in China? The answer initially seemed to be the latter. With billions of dollars at stake, Silver's NBA put out a pathetic press release, apologizing for offending customers in China and saying Morey does not represent the league-and the league's Mandarin translation of the tweet, posted on Chinese social media site Weibo, was far more critical of Morey and more apologetic towards the Chinese government. Silver later walked back on the comment, but only after American backlash.American political responses across the spectrum have supported Morey's right to express his opinions. He received supportive tweets from Republican Senator Ted Cruz and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, both of whom criticized the NBA for suppressing the free speech of an American citizen. President Trump also weighed in, lashing out at Warriors coach Steve Kerr and Spurs coach Gregg Popovich for staying silent when asked questions about the conflict. For Kerr, who coaches the Warriors, one of the most popular teams in China, any comment on the protests could further damage the NBA's brand. However, Trump correctly points out that the same players and coaches who criticize him daily have refused to speak out over free speech issues in another country. I'm not blind to the realities of doing business in China under the Chinese Communist Party. For years, companies have self-censored in order to maintain a presence in an enormous and growing Chinese middle-class market. One example is Google, which came under fire for building a search engine that would allow third parties (like Chinese censorship teams) to block information flow to Chinese citizens. Facebook is supposedly pursuing a similar strategy, in the hope of obtaining access to an enormous market. Businesses are not the only ones who will let themselves be pushed around by the Chinese government in exchange for access. Tiffany and Co. came under fire for a tweet that allegedly supported injured Hong Kong protestors, one which the company ended up deleting. The Chinese government was also angered by the actions of Apple, which released an app that allowed Hong Kong protestors to track the movements of police in the city. An article by a state newspaper denounced the "poisonous app" and claimed it betrayed the feelings of Chinese people. Academics have reported harassment for publishing papers critical of the Communist Party, and have withheld these papers for fear of losing visa access to the country. As South Park's twitter eloquently states, "You gotta lower your ideals of freedom if you wanna suck on the warm teat of China." Finally, ESPN issued a warning to employees about discussing the politics in China and told them to focus on the "sports" aspect of the issue. This corporate surrender to the Chinese government is an embarrassment to the United States. These issues surrounding business and access to China are going nowhere. There was a time when Western observers thought bringing free markets to China would bring democracy as well. However, Beijing has shown its ability to embrace capitalism and the growth that comes with it, while finding creative ways to use technology to monitor its citizens and force them into quasi-concentration camps. The regime even exports this digital surveillance technology, aiding authoritarian regimes across the world.For the time being, the West needs to treat the Chinese government as the authoritarian regime that it is. This means not allowing its restrictive freedom of speech laws to carry over to the United States, simply because the NBA fears for its bottom line. This means American businesses need to grow a spine and assert themselves in dealing with the Chinese government and not give in to censorship demands. The Chinese Communist Party is the greatest geopolitical threat to liberal democracy in the world, and it is unfortunate to see the NBA shrink in the face of this problem.Jack Leger is a member of 2021 can be reached at jleger@wesleyan.eduLoad-Date: October 11, 2019End of Document

YANG | Chinese People Are Allies, Not Enemies, in Fight Against Chinese GovernmentCornell Daily Sun: Cornell UniversitySeptember 10, 2019 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 890 wordsBodyThe Sun's investigative report last semester on Cornell's lucrative, undisclosed links with the shadowy Chinese tech giant Huawei should ring alarms everywhere. Beyond what The Sun's editorial laid out, as a dissident Chinese, I am particularly bone-chilled by this news. My college, one of the few places in this foreign land that I see as a place of refuge, might very well be a lion's den.It is not an exaggeration to say that the Chinese government's influence reaches far above Cayuga's waters. This influence comes in many forms. Recently, keen journalistic attention has been put on an intercollegiate student organization called the "Chinese Students and Scholars Association," a Chinese embassy-connected student organization on campuses around America. CSSA has been accused of acting as a tool for the Chinese government to pressure Chinese students even on American land. Several CSSA members have complained about increasing insistence from the Chinese embassy that this non-profit organization - one that provides much-needed services to international Chinese students - act as a vehicle for ideological propaganda.Thankfully, concerned individuals and organizations both on and off campus have now caught on to the gravity of this situation. The Cornell Political Union, of which I am a member, invited three different speakers last school year relating to this issue. Authorities from the FBI and members of Congress have also started taking action. The problem of negligence is over.But regrettably, we have now landed ourselves in an entirely different problem: antagonizing the Chinese community to a level unseen in recent memory. A paranoiac aura of suspicion toward my community has been steadily building, affecting even Chinese Americans. Chinese cancer researchers are being widely purged from top institutions on suspicion of sharing classified information, despite the widespread practice of data sharing in most medical research. Ever since I landed in this country to pursue undergraduate studies, never did a piece of news strike more fear in me than a story from a year ago - revealing that Stephen Miller, a White House aid and immigration hawk, had suggested a complete ban on student visas for Chinese citizens. The Chinese government had always tried its best to convince its subjects that there is no distinction between the Party, the Motherland and the Chinese themselves, for foreign countries will see no difference. How ironic that America is doing the devil's work.From complete negligence to xenophobic paranoia, America goes from one extreme to the other, and it is Chinese people that are caught up in the middle, especially those like me who hold dissident views. Faced with genuine fear that this country may no longer be welcoming of Chinese students on one side - and constant suppression of my dissident speech, living under constant fear that my public acts will hurt relatives back home on the other - I am trapped between Scylla and Charybdis.Americans must realize that the first victim of this encroachment from the Chinese government on American campuses is always the Chinese students themselves. It was members of the CSSA, a majority of whom participated in the organization to serve the Chinese student community, that first exposed these scandals because of their dismay toward the Chinese embassy's desire to politicize their mission. When the University's ILR school rightfully terminated an exchange program on Chinese labor studies with Renmin University, I revealed to a Sun journalist that the majority of the Cornell Chinese community are either indifferent on the issue or actually broadly supportive of the action. The reason is obvious. As Chinese people, many of us sympathize with the labor activists back home who are currently being subjected to arbitrary detention and torture for fighting for the future of China, our future.Indeed, both from a moral and practical standpoint, if Cornell's administration and Americans want to effectively combat the Chinese government's creeping influence, it is essential to acknowledge Chinese people as their first ally. Alienating us will only push us further into the devil's embrace out of fear for our safety. With Chinese students being an integral component of the Cornell community, the administration should always remember that when they are protecting Cornellians from harm by the Communist Party, a key vulnerable group that desperately needs protection is Chinese students. Cornell should target the institutions that help foster the Chinese government's influence, while aiding Chinese students in establishing our independent organizations free from the Party's shadows. One idea is to limit the CSSA's ability to attract unlimited donations from the Chinese embassy so that other Chinese service organizations can compete with it on an equal playing field.In my junior year, a close friend jokingly told me that a Greek brother of his thought a very-informed and old-looking Chinese guy in his African politics class must be some Chinese agent. That "potential agent" happened to be me. I laughed along then. It is getting hard to laugh now.Weifeng Yang is a senior in the College of Arts and Sciences.

ROGERS: CYBERSECURITY IS NOT JUST TECHNOLOGY ISSUE, IT'S A GEOPOLITICAL ISSUEStates News ServiceOctober 24, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 2798 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security, Republicans :Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.), ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee, today delivered the keynote address at Cyberscoop's DC CyberTalks. His speech discussed the legislative landscape on cybersecurity issues, highlighting the threats China poses.On China:"We all know cybersecurity is not just a technology issue. It is a global, geopolitical issue. China, Russia, and other adversaries are seizing on our society's commitment to openness, free speech, and innovation. Rather than build a competitive advantage, they've decided to steal one. China openly touts its plan to become the world's premier power by brute force and outright theft...China is deliberately targeting emerging technology that has the potential to transform our society as part of its 'Made in China 2025' initiative. We clearly have a host of cybersecurity problems that need to be addressed to counter China, Russia, and other bad actors' geopolitical ambitions."On CISA:"One of the important moments in my career was when President Trump signed into law the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act...I believe that Director Chris Krebs is the right person to lead the agency and he is doing a great job. We couldn't have gotten a better person...I will make sure it is the one voice for all federal government agencies. What does concern me is that other departments and agencies are creating their own cybersecurity offices. We can't have multiple agencies undermining each other. Stovepiping isn't the solution. Congress created CISA to be the lead for the federal government and we need to ensure that happens."On the Federal Cyber-workforce:"Simply put, the government cannot compete with private sector pay and benefits. For instance, an entry level engineering salary at companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft starts above $150,000. A top-level Google engineer can make more than $600,000. There is no way the federal government can compete with these salaries. It's time we start talking about pay reform for government workers in the cybersphere. We can't address the multitude of problems I've outlined today if we don't have a topnotch cyber-workforce."Rogers full remarks, as prepared for delivery:It's important that government officials and industry promote cybersecurity awareness. From large business to mom-and-pop stores, everyone is at danger of a malicious cyberattack if they aren't aware of the latest efforts to harm them.I constantly worry that my local hardware store will be subject to an attack that forces them to close. I worry about a ransomware attack that shuts down my home county government of Calhoun, Alabama.With the proper awareness, we, as government and industry officials, can prevent many of these harmful attacks. I thank you all for helping in this effort. Yet, cybersecurity can't just be a once-a-year focus.We need to constantly educate the public on the dangers they face and reduce their vulnerabilities. Since cybersecurity isn't limited to the month of October, it has been a major focus of my efforts at the Committee.First, I want to acknowledge Rep. John Katko. He is the Ranking Member on the cyber subcommittee. He is doing tremendous work on the subcommittee and if you don't know him, you should.Rep. Katko and I have been focused on three major cyber issues at our Committee: CISA, critical infrastructure, and emerging technologies.One of the important moments in my career was when President Trump signed into law the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act.Centralizing the federal government's protection of critical infrastructure from physical and cyber threats into one office I believe will prove to be a wise decision.With all new government agencies, making sure CISA is stood up correctly is important to its success. That is why I have been working closely with DHS to ensure this happens.I believe that Director Chris Krebs is the right person to lead the agency and he is doing a great job. We couldn't have gotten a better person.While Director Krebs is working to stand up the agency and fulfill its mission, Congress also has a role to play in helping CISA. At this point, Congress and the executive branch should be doing everything we can to see that CISA is a well-oiled machine.Part of that is staying out of the way until we need to get involved. Since I believe in the mission of CISA, I want to make sure it has the resources it needs to be successful. I will make sure it has the appropriations and human capital necessary to be the leader to thwart nation-states and dangerous hackers.And I will make sure it is the one voice for all federal government agencies. What does concern me is that other departments and agencies are creating their own cybersecurity offices.We can't have multiple agencies undermining each other. Stovepiping isn't the solution.Congress created CISA to be the lead for the federal government and we need to ensure that happens. One issue that CISA is tackling right now is managing risks to our supply chain.This is also a topic we are exploring at the Committee. Just last week we had an informative hearing on the vulnerabilities of our supply chain. I'm pleased CISA created the DHS Supply Chain Risk Management Task Force last year.The task force is in the process of drawing up recommendations to identify and manage risk to the global information and communications technology supply chain.The Task Force released an interim report and is expected to announce its full recommendations next year. I look forward to reading that report and acting if necessary.Another issue that both the Committee and CISA believe are important to tackle is securing our critical infrastructure. As we saw in the September attacks on Saudi Arabia, attacks on critical infrastructure are key pillars for nation states and terrorist organizations in their efforts to promote their agendas.Our economy and way of life and economy run through our critical infrastructure every day. Congress and industry must do everything we can to secure our critical infrastructure and prevent deadly and costly attacks. Yet, there is no one-size-fits-all solution for industry.What works for chemical security may not work for pipeline security. I've taken the approach of looking at the critical infrastructure ecosystem and working to ensure its resiliency against attacks. The federal government can't do it alone. We need to work with industry to protect and harden this nation's critical infrastructure from physical and cyberattacks.Earlier this year, we passed an extension of the CFATS program. This is something we will have to deal with before it expires early next year. Our Committee passed a bill that I opposed. It sits in the Energy and Commerce Committee where it has little chance of moving in its current form. Senate Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson has his own views on CFATS.In other words, its DOA.And I know industry has its views on the program.By using CFATS as an example, you can see this is a complex issue that isn't easily solvable.But the good news is we all have the same goal to harden and protect all critical infrastructure from attack.I am ready to work with industry, my fellow Members of Congress, and the administration to ensure a Saudi-like attack does not occur on American soil. Emerging technologies present another daunting task.If technology advanced in a reasonably slow and understandable fashion, then we probably wouldn't be so concerned about attacks. But that's not how technology works. It advances in leaps-and-bounds, not baby steps.What is new and fast today, is obsolete and slow by next week. These emerging technologies rapidly outpace the conversation on cybersecurity.That makes securing technologies difficult. As I think about these technologies, I worry about our ability to prevent attacks.AI, machine learning, 5G networks, and quantum computing are all coming to fruition. They represent great strides in human ingenuity.But they also represent enormous security challenges. As industry and the federal government turn to these new developments, we must understand how they can be used against us.And this is not just a civilian issue, it's also effects the military. I sit on the Armed Services Committee and the military is exploring these technologies for both offensive and defense purposes.I know I've said this already today, but industry and the federal government must work together on these security issues we face as new technologies come online.But I implore you to not forget how these technologies affect the hardware stores and county offices in small town America.Fortune 500 companies have the resources to throw at cybersecurity, but most small businesses don't.One of my top priorities this year has been to address the federal cyber-workforce shortage.I'm not the first legislator to try to tackle this problem. We've seen proposals for pay reform, apprenticeships, and scholarships.One thing the House did do this year in the NDAA was to creates a "Cybersecurity Defense Academy." This pilot program will train veterans as cybersecurity personnel at DoD and I support its goal.Yet, this proposal like all others, does not address the core workforce problem: competitive salaries. Simply put, the government cannot compete with private sector pay and benefits. For instance, an entry level engineering salary at companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft starts above $150,000. A top-level Google engineer can make more than $600,000.There is no way the federal government can compete with these salaries.It's time we start talking about pay reform for government workers in the cybersphere. We can't address the multitude of problems I've outlined today if we don't have a topnotch cyber-workforce.We all know cybersecurity is not just a technology issue.It is a global, geopolitical issue.China, Russia, and other adversaries are seizing on our society's commitment to openness, free speech, and innovation.Rather than build a competitive advantage, they've decided to steal one. China openly touts its plan to become the world's premier power by brute force and outright theft.We clearly have a host of cybersecurity problems that need to be addressed to counter China's geopolitical ambitions. We have begun to take steps to address them across the government. And the Trump Administration is taking threats from China seriously.Entire sectors of our economy and nearly every part of our government is in China's crosshairs. Technology that can't be squeezed out of companies doing business in China is being deliberately poached from U.S. companies and universities.FBI Director Christopher Wray said earlier this year that the FBI is actively investigating 1,000 cases of attempted IP theft in the United States, mostly involving China. By using the world's rapid technological developments, the Communist party can control China like never before.Big data is powering "social credit" monitoring to shame those who don't support every party policy. Advances in machine learning are empowering the systematic extermination of the Uyghurs in western China. China is using facial recognition to detect ethnic minorities like the Uyghers and then systematically track them.Our open social media platforms are now weapons for Chinese messaging, monitoring, and intelligence operations. These cybersecurity concepts are the primary means of geopolitical competition in the 21st century.Intelligence officials have warned public and private entities about telecommunications companies Huawei and ZTE and their ties to the Chinese Communist Party Committees. These companies have been directed to conduct surveillance and turn over heaps of data to the Chinese government on Chinese citizens and foreigners alike.Beijing will use this power again and again. State-owned Chinese companies have systematically dominated manufacturing operations of critical components.They also offer Chinese intelligence services access to all levels of the supply chain. China is also exploiting higher-education institutions that produce cutting-edge technology and research.The Communist party is sending students and researchers to our institutions of higher education with a clear plan to steal U.S. research and engage in espionage.At a Midwestern medical school, a Chinese researcher was arrested for economic espionage after he stole a patented cancer research compound. He also tried to delete proprietary research on the compound off the university's computer server. If the Chinese government and its agents are willing to erase key cancer research, what else will they take?We've seen these so-called academics target military intelligence, export-restricted research data, and other classified information. We cannot turn a blind eye to China's growing exploitation of the open and collaborative nature of academic institutions.Last year the National Vetting Center was created to improve vetting on individuals seeking visa to work on high-value technologies in our country. We can do more to improve vetting of foreign students and scholars engaging in sensitive fields of study at U.S. institutions.China is also using technology and the size of its economy to export authoritarianism by attempting to censor speech abroad. These efforts were on full display earlier this month.We saw the NBA capitulate to China after Houston Rocket's general manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for the Hong Kong protests. In response to the tweet, the NBA issued press releases in both English and Chinese. In English, the league said it regretted that the tweet had offended people in China. In Chinese, the NBA said that it was "extremely disappointed" by Morey's "inappropriate" tweet.This isn't the first time we've seen American companies get swept up in Chinese censorship. In Apple's most recent iPhone software update, it removed the Hong Kong and Macau flag emojis in China. Apple has pulled apps from its store including one used by Hong Kong protestors to mark police locations and street closures.Search providers like Google and Microsoft admit that they serve sanitized results to users in China. I'm concerned these companies have missed the point of economic engagement with China. Opening up China was supposed to put the forces of freedom and individualism in the driver's seat.Instead, the Chinese government is using this openness to force outside companies to promote Chinese propaganda. We also must be concerned about the rise of wholly Chinese owned tech companies.If you're worried about what Facebook or Google is doing with your data, imagine what a platform under Beijing's thumb would do with it. For instance, the Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok has been downloaded more than 1 billion times. China is already using TikTok to push its own agenda. If a user searches for "Hong Kong" on TikTok, you'll find it conveniently ignores the ongoing protests.China will continue to use apps like these as another tool to bring censorship to our shores. Ultimately, China is advancing all these efforts with the goal of global supremacy.China is deliberately targeting emerging technology that has the potential to transform our society as part of its "Made in China 2025" initiative. We clearly have a host of cybersecurity problems that need to be addressed to counter China, Russia, and other bad actors' geopolitical ambitions.We have begun to take steps to address them across the government.The Trump Administration is taking threats from China seriously. I applaud the president's May executive order aimed at securing the information and communications technology supply chain.I look forward to reviewing the Department of Commerce's rules implementing this order in the coming weeks. The president is also using trade tools to try to extract concessions from China on these issues.While free trade and open markets are the ideal, the Chinese government deliberately undermines global markets at our expense. I encourage the president to continue to hold China's feet to the fire until they seriously reform how they do business.The cybersecurity challenges that I've outlined today span across borders, governments, and private entities. Collaboration and a "whole-of-society" approach is necessary to address the host of cyber-vulnerabilities our rivals present. It also requires bipartisan cooperation in Congress.I am ready and willing to partner with anyone who shares the desire to pushback against China and other adversaries, to protect not only America's place as an innovator and global leader, but the ideals of liberty, freedom and democracy.Load-Date: October 24, 2019End of Document

Good Friday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Friday, October 11th. Your top stories right now, 8:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.Global marks are higher this morning, on hopes of a deal with China. President Trump saying that the talks are going really well. China's top negotiator is headed to the White House today to meet with the president later today.Futures indicating a triple-digit move. Check this out. Dow Industrials right now, up 262 points, 1 percent, S&P is up 29 points, 1 percent, and the NASDAQ up better than 1 percent, 85 points higher after China trade hopes fueled the rally yesterday, as well. At 4:00 on Wall Street, the Dow was up 150 points yesterday, the S&P was up 18 and the NASDAQ was up 47.In Europe this morning, we've got a firmer tone there, as well, and there is news there, as well. FT-100 up 32. There are some renewed hopes of a Brexit deal after the U.K. and Irish prime ministers met. They said that there is a pathway to a deal. The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 65, and the DAX Index in Germany is up 250 points right now, better than 2 percent, in Germany.Hopes of a deal, also triggered a rally overnight, in Asia, take a look, best performer was Hong Kong, Hang Seng Index up 2-1/3 percent.Meanwhile, this, an Iranian oil tanker was hit by two missiles off the coast of Saudi Arabia, according to Iran. Oil prices are surging on the news, up 1.6 percent on light sweet crude.California power outages, meanwhile, some power is being restored this morning, but hundreds of thousands of people are still in the dark, we have the very latest in California, coming up this morning.All those stories coming up this Friday morning. And joining me to break it all down, FOX Business' Dagen McDowell, Farvahar Partners founder and CEO, Omeed Malik, and Tengler Wealth Management chief investment strategist, Nancy Tengler. Great to see you this morning.Have you seen the impact in California, of these power outages yet, Nancy, or have you been here in New York?NANCY TENGLER, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, TENGLER WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Yes. No, well, I've been in communication. It is -- it's third worldly, and --BARTIROMO: Wow.TENGLER: -- really difficult to wrap your brain around. I mean, some of the cities that are being shut off are not in high risk fire districts, they're close to the city of San Francisco, it makes no sense. I used to manage money for one of the largest firms in San Francisco, on the same street as PG&E. We never lost our power. So, there is an arbitrariness to this.BARTIROMO: Yes.OMEED MALIK, FOUNDER AND CEO, FARVAHAR PARTNERS: We have an office out there, and we lost internet yesterday --BARTIROMO: You did?MALIK: -- because of it, yes.TENGLER: How do you work?MALIK: So, I mean, it's a big problem, but also, we should start following the restructuring that's going on, as well, that's behind the story too. They're in bankruptcy. So, the bond holders are starting to fight, led by L.A. Capital, so let's see what happens. There are a lot more to see on this story.BARTIROMO: There's also -- there's also the story of just the cities, in general, I mean, look at L.A., look at San Francisco, in terms of the homelessness problem.MALIK: I was just out there. It's block-to-block without -- you can't go from a block without seeing it.TENGLER: Yes.BARTIROMO: Those people who are living in tents.MALIK: Absolutely, everywhere.TENGLER: Needles, human --BARTIROMO: Do you see the needles, as well, on the streets?MALIK: Yes. Think about the disparity. You're talking about some of the richest places, not only on this country, but on earth.BARTIROMO: That's really sad.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: But the -- but the issue is, this has been going on, literally, for decades. I lived in San Francisco for a year, during the first dot-com bubble.TENGLER: You're right, Dagen.MCDOWELL: It was a problem then, and they ignored it, and ignored it, and ignored it, and the problem is, the government -- the liberal -- left wing liberal government thinks that more money is the solution, and what you have happen, like, thrive New York.The effort here, in New York City, started by the mayor's wife. He spent roughly $850 million on mental health because mental health is a critical part of homelessness, the Mental Health Initiative. Literally, the mental health situation in New York has gotten worst, despite nearly a billion dollars being spent.BARTIROMO: So, you think all this is a direct result of policies, bad policy?MCDOWELL: It is -- it is bad policy. It is the deinstitutionalization of people who are mentally ill in this country, which has been going on in my entire lifetime, is part of the issue.BARTIROMO: All right. We've got to -- we're going to talk more about that, really important insights from all of you. Our top story this hour, though, is the U.S.-China trade optimism. President Trump says that the talks are going really well. He's expected to meet with China's top negotiator in Washington later today.Blake Burman is live at the White House this morning, with more on that. Good morning to you, Blake.BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you, as well, happy Friday. It is a second day of talks that are set to take place here later this morning, between the main players with the United States and China, Robert Lighthizer, Steven Mnuchin, and Liu He, as those three met for about seven consecutive hours yesterday, here in Washington, D.C.Just about 45 minutes into the negotiations, President Trump tweeted out that he would be meeting today, with the Chinese vice premier. That Oval Office sit down expected at about 2:45 this afternoon. In China, this morning, a spokesperson for the foreign ministry was asked how the talks went yesterday on day one.They would not specifically answer, but did say, "we hope that the U.S. and China will work together, and work in tandem, and promote positive progress on consultations based on mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit.Now, as the meetings were wrapping up yesterday, President Trump gave a rather warm read out of the negotiations.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So, we just completed a negotiation with China, we're doing very well, we're having another one tomorrow. I'm meeting with the vice premier over at the White House. And I think it's going really well, I will say. I think it's going really well, so we had a very, very good negotiation with China.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: China says that it has proposed a three-tier timeline starting January 1st, to increase the number of wholly foreign-owned enterprises. This could potentially alleviate some of the concerns the U.S. has, regarding I.P. theft and forced technology transfer.However, Maria, it's unclear how this proposal was received by the U.S. side. When you look, big picture here, heading into day two of two of these talks, Maria. The outstanding questions will be, will the tariffs be staved off, the tariffs that were expected to go into effect on Tuesday, will there be any sort of deal between the U.S. and China and, if so, what size --BARTIROMO: Yes.BURMAN: -- might that deal or those agreements --BARTIROMO: To head off that increase which is expected to take effect on the 15th, I believe. Blake, thank you. Blake Burman is at the White House. Joining us right now, is former RNC chair, former Mississippi governor and the founding partner of BGR Group, Haley Barbour. Governor, it's good to see you this morning, thanks so much for being here.HALEY BARBOUR, FORMER GOVERNOR OF MISSISSIPPI: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Coming to us from Washington today, what's your take on these talks with China? Where do you think this is going?BARBOUR: Well, you know, I've always said that things are going to proceed with China, slowly. They are not -- you know, look at their history, look at their view of the world, they are very unlikely to jump to this kind of quick deal on a great big -- on a great big bunch of issues.BARTIROMO: Yes.BARBOUR: So, I think it will be piecemeal, small progress, I do think the president is right, the Chinese have been cheating on their WTO obligations since 2001. The Bush administration, the Obama administration never tried to do anything about it. Trump is right to try to do something about it, but you've got to have patience when you try to deal with the Chinese.BARTIROMO: All right. Let's talk 2020 for a second, we had a new FOX News poll, shows that former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren are gaining support of more than half of the Democratic primary voters. Biden remains the frontrunner, 32 percent there, that's up 3 points since last month. Warren is up 6 points, she's now at 22 percent. Bernie Sanders is down one point.What's your take on the race, so far?BARBOUR: Well, that's a great big field, but it's narrowing. I think, it's no question that Biden has been hurt by all of this going on in Ukraine and revelations, frankly, that he made himself about, when he was vice president, and threatening the Ukrainian government if they didn't fire their prosecutor general.Elizabeth Warren, very own message for the Democratic left and, of course, it helped her that Bernie Sanders had a little heart problem.MALIK: Hi Governor, it's Omeed. Yes, with the race, it's very early days, a lot of game to be played. We remember that Howard Dean was leading John Kerry in 2004 at this time.BARTIROMO: Yes, good point.MALIK: Look what happened there. But I --MCDOWELL: That's the night Howard Dean sounds.MALIK: That was very scary, thanks for that.MCDOWELL: You're welcome.MALIK: You woke me up. So, with respect to China, on the policy of maximum pressure, Marco Rubio is proposing a law about divesting pensions that invest in China, and in addition, there are other proposals not letting Chinese companies list on our stock exchanges.I've been curious about our views on this as part of a maximum pressure effort on the Chinese, to try to get them to -- to get to the table and have a broader deal.BARBOUR: Well, I do think that -- if we're serious about trying to get something done, there is going to have to be maximum pressure, if you will, if you want to use that term. There has to be real pressure that they feel that makes a difference. And you see in their economy that their growth has slowed down.BARTIROMO: Yes.BARBOUR: They are feeling this, but, at the same time, it has negative effects on a lot of U.S. industries and agriculture. So, you know, this deal cuts both ways, but if not now, when? That's the real question.BARTIROMO: Well, what about this whistleblower controversy, Governor? The former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine scheduled to sit down for a transcribed interview later this morning. Now, we have this new report that the Ukraine whistleblower worked in the Obama administration, with then Vice President Joe Biden.It is turning into one of Washington's most contentious issues. What's your take on this impeachment inquiry?BARBOUR: Well, look, the Democrats decided long, long, long ago, that Donald Trump ought to be impeached, now they're trying to decide why. I mean, that's what all of this is about. They're looking for something that they can sell to the American people.If you -- if you look at what Vice President Biden said he did, and threatening the Ukrainian government withholding nearly a billion dollars, if I remember right, of U.S. aid, if they didn't fire their prosecutor general. Donald Trump and his administration did nothing vaguely close to that.And, you know, don't take my word for it, that's what the president of Ukraine says. That he didn't feel threatened, that it wasn't blackmail, that this was no pressure.So -- but I just think that this is going to continue, the Democrats are absolutely focused on this, if Ukraine went away tomorrow, it would be something else next week.BARTIROMO: Yes.BARBOUR: I am -- I'm a -- I'm a recovering lawyer, Maria. And I remember in the American jurisprudence system in English, that people who are accused have a right to confront their accuser.BARTIROMO: Right.BARBOUR: In this case, the whistleblower rules, apparently. You not only don't have the right to confront your accuser, you don't even have right to know who your accuser is.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's all in secret, Governor, I know. And that's why it's really lost a lot of credibility. It's all in secret. We don't know what anybody is saying. They want to impeach a president behind closed doors. Let me --BARBOUR: And they want to do it purely on hearsay.BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: Well, I want to --BARBOUR: The whistleblower apparently has told the inspector general, I don't know anything directly, but I've heard all these. It's like me saying, well, I watch CNN, and I've heard all these bad stuff about Trump.BARTIROMO: Yes. And I also want to know if the Democrats met with the whistleblower. I mean, it sounds awfully similar to Christine Blasey Ford, where I know that they met with her for 30 hours, before she testified, and brought charges against Brett Kavanaugh. Did Adam Schiff and his staff meet with the whistleblower to help him or her carve up this complaint?MCDOWELL: Some of the latest is, that the lawyers for this whistleblower don't want to have this individual testify in person or asking, that the whistleblower submit testimony in writing, instead of appearing in person. This is according to reporting in the Wall Street Journal today.And Newt Gingrich brought up the issue of Trump impeachment. Here is the article, I've printed it out yesterday, will Trump be impeached? It was written in Vanity Fair, November 14th, 2016. It was right after -- there was actually someone quoted on the record saying, well, they can impeach him because of the Trump University --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: -- if it's judged to be a fraud, so this is at play. But what the Democrats are clearly trying to do, is use the Ukraine issue, to open the door, to investigate anybody and everybody, related to this administration.BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: And again, the thought that they would try to bring impeachment charges related to obstruction of Congress. So, this White House, legally, is withholding information and -- so they're going to try to impeach him for blocking an impeachment proceeding that actually isn't an impeachment proceeding.BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: How insane is that?BARTIROMO: They got -- they got their guy. They've had their guy for a while now, took a couple of years, and they're just looking for the reason to impeach. They've got their guy, now, they've got to find the crime.Also, it's really unnerving to see Adam Schiff, the chairman of the Intel Committee, sit there at the podium, to kick off a hearing and make stuff up, right? He's got the transcript in front of him, but he decided to embellish and say -- and create this conversation that happened, that actually didn't happen. So, there's that, as well.BARBOUR: Yes. You know, I was not an English major, Maria, but parity, usually doesn't have anything to do with the facts.BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly. Governor, it's great to see you this morning, thanks so much.BARBOUR: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Haley Barbour joining us. Coming up, eye on oil this morning, prices are up, 1-1/2 percent, and reports an Iranian oil tanker was hit by two missiles off the coast of Saudi Arabia. We are bringing you the very latest developments, all morning long, on that story.Then, ready for takeoff, Boeing and Porsche joining forces to make a flying car, it is all-electric, wait until you see this, how you can get your hands on this, behind the wheel, next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. An Iranian oil tanker attacked in the Red Sea. Cheryl Casone with headlines now. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Well, Maria, Iranian officials are claiming that two missiles hit an oil tanker off the coast of Saudi Arabia. Iran state television says strike caused a leak and that's an oil spilling into the Red Sea. That leak is reportedly been stopped. Energy stocks heading higher on that news. Oil as well, ExxonMobil, Chevron and Schlumberger, all the stocks are higher in the premarket. Oil moving higher as well.In California, hundreds of thousands of PG&E customers are still in the dark. The utility cut power and areas that are vulnerable to wildfires. PG&E CEO apologized for poor communication and incorrect outage maps. He also said future power outages are likely. Governor Gavin Newsom slammed PG&E calling the situation "unacceptable." PG&E higher by half a percent in the premarket.Flying cars may be here sooner than we think. Boeing and Porsche are partnering to make an electric-flying vehicle. Earlier this year, Boeing tested an aerial car that could fit four people and fly up to 50 miles. Porsche saying it wants to become a leading brand for premium mobility which could mean moving into the third dimension of travel.And Georgia Mall. If you watch Stranger Things, you're going to like this story. The Georgia Mall that's in the last season of Stranger Things is actually up for sale. The whole mall. Now the price remains a mystery. The deal reportedly includes most of the Gwinnett Place Shopping Center. This is suburb of Duluth. The mall is crowded with people in Stranger Things but in real life, not so much. In fact, no one noticed that a body was left there for two weeks back in 2017. I know. But if you love the show, that story was for you. Even though the big monster kind of blew up the mall on the show. But anyway, besides that.BARTIROMO: Cheryl, thank you. We have breaking news right now. I want to bring you this Fox Business alert. President Obrado of Mexico telling House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a letter that he is confident that USMCA will pass. That's according to a report from Reuters this morning. He writes, Mexico is not seeking any changes to the deal and that the country is just waiting on others' approval.We are also expecting Canada to do the same and of course we are waiting for the speaker to bring the bell to the floor for a vote. We'll take a short break. When we come back. Shares of Apple are nearing an all-time high this morning. We tell you what's driving that stock. Up 1-1/4 percent right now. And then beer without the buzz. Brooklyn brewery gears up to launch its first ever non-alcoholic beer. How it's impacting business later this hour. Right here. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We're watching shares of Apple this morning nearing all-time high, up 1-1/4 percent. Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange looking at that and the border averages. Gerri?GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That's right. Good morning, Maria. Hey, looks like a happy Friday down here. We'll have to wait and see what trade headlines we get but so far so good. Let's start with Apple. Shares of Apple higher today as you can see up 1.24 percent. Wedbush, Dan Ives raising his price target to 265 from 245. This is ahead of Apple's launch of its video streaming service. He sees big potential here.Show stopping pricing is what he says in his note. They have an installed base of 900 million active users worldwide with those iPhones quickly. That closing 232.07, intro day 233.47. We'll be watching that all day. Meanwhile, Roku price target race from 107 to -- from 107 to 155 by RBC. The analysts saying one of the best positions to take share a very large under printed -- penetrated 70 billion T.V. market. Back to you.BARTIROMO: Gerri, thank you so much. Wow. What a move 7-1/2 percent. You are watching Apple as well, this is one of your largest holdings, right?TENGLER: Yes, yes, Maria. It is. We -- I spent half of my life defending this stock during periods of difficulty. Now, in 18, 19 multiple, we're net sellers of the stock. We've been taking some of our profits because we were buyers about four years ago. And I think you just have to come down and say, you know, the job of an investor is to sell to eager buyers.And so we're going to -- we're going to scale out of the stock overtime. We were buying last January when -- or this January when it got, you know, when they disappointed on earnings. Nobody want to own that stock and now we're going to sell it to the growth stock.BARTIROMO: Do you feel like -- obviously you must feel like much of the growth story has already been realized or you just made enough money that you don't want to be greed and you want get out or -- I mean, what's the growth story going forward?TENGLER: Well, the growth story services and now you've got an iPhone cycle, Dan Ives is one of the best on this stock on Wall Street. So, I pay attention to what he says but as an investor, my job is to make money for my clients and not to just round trip things.BARTIROMO: Yes.TENGLER: So we're not selling out wholesale but we are turning back on our holdings. We sold some last week, you know, we'll be selling again. It's our largest and we -- or forced to sell actually.BARTIROMO: Broader market is there. Arguments we made on me that you want to start scaling back and selling into these big rallies or do you think the growth story and the backdrop still remains strong?MALIK: Yes. I'm saying when I think the backdrop definitely remains strong especially if we do get a deal, I do think market is going to react very positively even though a piecemeal deal which is where it looks we're headed, you know, politically I don't agree with that but the markets are in a different state of mind. They just want to see a deal get done.They're desperate for it and we've seen over the last five or six months. They react to every piece of news. But broadly speaking, I think the indicators are still very positive about the American economy and by the way where else are you going to go?TANGLER: That's true too.BARTIROMO: Yes. All right. We'll take a break. When we come back, the China trade hopes feeling markets this morning. Futures set for triple- digit move at the start of trading.

Talks of picking this up morning, President Trump is expected to meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He at the White House later today. The president sounded optimistic last night and yesterday about the negotiations before he left for a campaign rally, watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We just completed a negotiation with China, we're doing very well, we're having another one tomorrow. I'm meeting with the vice premier over at the White House and I think it's going really well.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is the China Beige Book CEO, Leland Miller. Leland, great to see you. Thanks so much for being here.LELAND MILLER, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, BEIGE BOOK: Thank you.BARTIROMO: What's your characterization of this meeting and so far the talks between the U.S. and China?MILLER: Well, it's a totally different environment than what we saw back in August when everybody was mad at each other. You are seeing a lot of U.S.-China tension of the national security side of the relationship but in trade they have been able to put this in separate track, I think both sides are interested in moving forward. The president wants A.G. Buys and he want something more if he can get it. The Chinese want some tariff funds, they want some tariff pullbacks if they can get it. And I think we're moving closer and closer to getting that.BARTIROMO: But can the president do a deal without including some of those big ticket items that the U.S. wants like the theft of intellectual property?MILLER: I don't think so. I think what -- he could do a baby deal. He can -- he can get some A.G. purchases, he can get some forward momentum on this. But what the White House really wants is this perfect middle highway where they can actually pull back some of the tariffs, put them on a more sustainable trajectory. A lot of even hawks in the White House want to see tariffs pulled back to 250 billion.At the same time, they get some concessions on Chinese I.P. from the original made text, they get agricultural buys. So there is a middle way and the White House is going in that direction and we're going to see if they can get it.TENGLER: So, Leland, some of the -- rather we hear is that China is really slowing down in that we're in the much stronger position and we also know that sometimes the Chinese members are -- maybe somewhat suspect. And so, I'm wondering what your data collection is showing if it's matching what the government is putting forward?And then do you think that this transition of American companies may be moving supply chains away will continue?MILLER: No, this is exactly what we're seeing. You know, we actually saw a more resilient Chinese economy earlier in the year because there was a lot more credit provision into it and the Chinese were admitting but even with that credit provision and a return of shadow banking and record bond sales and quite high bank borrowing we still saw a third quarter that dropped almost across the board.Much weaker data, the weakest quarter we've seen. So the Chinese are under pressure particularly in this third quarter more than they have been any other part of the year. And I think from the other -- the other part of this is that -- is this is pushing, the tensions and relationship are pushing this schism in terms of supply change. So, the Chinese have lots of pressure from all different directions which is why they're more amenable to a deal than I think many people think.TENGLER: Interesting.MALIK: Yes. I guess -- Leland, thanks for your input. How scare are they of the potential for us to divest out of their companies within pensions and mutual funds and more over to they think it's realistically concern that we may prevent them from listing on our exchanges here? Those would be very punitive measures for us to take against them.And as you're probably aware right after financial crisis, there were these reverse mergers that their companies would come on to our stock exchanges, acquire them and then they were basically mostly frauds.MILLER: Right. This is a huge move but it includes an entire spectrum of moves we could be doing towards it. Now, the idea of forceful delisting, just ordering a Chinese company off the stock is not going to happen. What has been talked about is requiring Chinese companies to adhere to the same rules that American companies do adhere to. So Alibaba doesn't need to have its books looked at.TENGLER: Right.MILLER: Wal-Mart does. There are fairness issues at play here. There is also another thing which they're pushing very hard right now which is that there is government pension money that is going to be flowing as of next year into Chinese companies if the government pension system starts reflecting the MSCI which is moving towards China's inclusive index, they're looking very closely at that and whether they tweak it and make sure that money is not flowing from U.S. government workers to Chinese companies and ultimately to the POA.BARTIROMO: Are we going to see any impacts from this latest news from China now? China is saying, it is willing to remove those limits in terms of foreign ownership for financial services companies. How significant is that in your view?MILLER: I think it's a good first step. So, you know, we need to see this but the question is, not whether they're going to remove the limit. The question is whether U.S. companies, whether foreign companies can operate inside the Chinese economy without retribution, without non-tariff barriers, without un -- regulations that are -- that are just stymieing? Are they going to be able to operate in an entrenched environment where Chinese companies have market share in all the major sectors.BARTIROMO: Yes. But right now if you're an American company, J.P. Morgan, I mean, any bank you want to go into China you can't own 51 percent, right? You have to own 49 percent of a joint venture, does this change that?MILLER: It will change it. So 51 percent theoretically means you're in control of your business and will the Chinese really allow you to be in control of your business?BARTIROMO: You're skeptical.MILLER: I'm skeptical of this but even if you get the ownership change, the question is, can you compete against companies that have been entrenched there for two decades?BARTIROMO: The protests in Hong Kong, how much pressure is this putting on Xi Jinping? Hundreds have already flooded the streets this morning for another weekend pro-democracy demonstrations, then there's the NBA story. NBA staying silent, canceling all media availability following that controversial news conference yesterday. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRISTINA MACFARLANE, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Hi. Christina MacFarlane, CNN. The NBA has always been a league that prides itself on its player and its coaches being able to speak out openly about political and societal affairs. I just wonder after the events of this week, and the fallout we've seen, whether you would both feel differently about speaking out in that way in the future?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Excuse me. We're taking basketball questions only.MACFARLANE: It's a legitimate question. This is an event that happened this week during the NBA.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE)MACFARLANE: This particular question has not been answered. James.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Well, they apologized, should that CNN reporter now have canceled all media opportunities. This is going to have a wide ramifications. Isn't it?MILLER: I think this is a game changer. You know, you've seen the Chinese government put pressure on hotel chains and airlines and others for years but that didn't really erupt in a public anger, it was just an inconvenience for Americans reading the paper. They didn't like it. This is something different. This is becoming America issue which crossing the partisan divide. I think Chinese badly played their over -- played -- overplayed their hand at this point and I think the NBA is realizing this and that's why they're shutting down their people.BARTIROMO: Yes.MILLER: They want to hit reset, they want to come back, you know, figure out the way they should handle this and realize they need to be into more than just the business. They got to figure out the political sensitivities.BARTIROMO: But look at all these other companies that are getting bullied, Marriott has been bullied and some companies are rolling over. We had the story of the app. Companies pulling apps related to the Hong Kong protests from their app stores after pushback from the Chinese government. You know, Apple among them pulling back that app that was allowing people at Hong Kong to identifier where the police where.MCDOWELL: And Google has pulled the Hong Kong protest app as well after Apple didMILLER: Right. And I think the issue here is that, you know, everything is going to be questioned under free speech suppression line. So, Apple is going to get a lot of pushback by Americans, by Congress in terms of what they did there. Now, there's an open question, did it violate the technical rules that Apple has in terms of the app store? But the question -- the whole fact that we haven't been looking closer what rules are and what apps are getting kicked out because of this for clearly political sensitivities. This -- all of this needs to be reexamined. I think this is the -- just the beginning of the reexamination.MALIK: We don't have the regulatory regime in place to handle these issues right now. We need to codify them. In the NBA's case, they probably are under an antitrust he exemption. And that might need to be looked at if they continue to put China's values over Americans.BARTIROMO: This is a really important subject and I -- and I think what I hear you're saying is sure, the Chinese are going to relax these rules in terms of ownership but what happens when you get there, they're still going to be the bullying and the -- and pushing these companies to do it China's way even if app is in Hong Kong.TENGLER: Yes.MILLER: That's the problem. I mean, you know, this is -- this is going to be a question, you know, Congress has been looking for ways to get more involved in the U.S.-China relations for a whole. This may be a new era where Congress starts to really step its game in terms of U.S.-China relation.MCDOWELL: And every time I refer to Steve Kerr from now on I'm just going to say communist Steve Kerr --(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: -- change the subject, comrade because he tried to change the subject rather than asked about human rights abuses in the United States here in China and brought up people mowing people down with AR-15s.BARTIROMO: I mean, to equate America, the freest country on the planet to what's going on in China is really disgraceful. I agree with you. I mean, you know, you have concentration camps that are holding, you know, two, three million Uyghurs right now, you've got the tracking of citizens, you got massive human abuses in China to equate that to the U.S. the way he did is unbelievable.MCDOWELL: They control the internet. The Chinese people can't -- they do not have the freedoms that we do here in the United States and rather than standing up, again, it's always the irony as he has the ability to speak his mind because he is an American citizen. Because he comes from this country, because we protect that very speech but to do it to use your freedom of speech to basically blow back at the United States and to criticize the United States and our way of life and our values on foreign soil is just beyond the pale.BARTIROMO: It really is, it's disgraceful and this is really a debate and a fight over values. You know, China and the U.S., very different value system. Leland, it's great to get your insights.MILLER: My pleasure.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. Leland Miller joining us. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The leader of Ethiopia winning the Nobel Peace Prize. Cheryl Casone with headlines now. Cheryl?CASONE: Yes, Maria. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has been awarded this year's coveted award for his work to end two decades of conflict with neighboring Eritrea. The two countries feuding over border land causing financial and humanitarian issues there. Ahmed calls the award "A price given to Africa, given to Ethiopia." He was elected Prime Minister just last year.General Motors CEO Mary Barra looking to get striking workers back on the job hoping to jumpstart negotiations with the United Auto Workers Union. Barra met with the president of the UAW earlier this week. The strike is nearing the one-month mark. Despite that meeting though, the job action may not end for a while. Associated Press sending a letter to G.M. from the UAW's vice president which says he doesn't know how long it will take to come to terms. That is an issue.And the separate-ledged employees, G.M. had a global manufacturing. So the company's offer of the union would increase compensation for workers as well as create "a clear path to permanent employment for those temporary workers." G.M. is higher by almost 1-1/2 percent in the premarket. And there you go, Maria. Back over to you.BARTIROMO: All right. Thanks so much. We want to show you this picture here. Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin is arriving for these talks this morning with the -- with the Chinese officials. We are waiting for any details out of this important meeting and we know that President Trump will be meeting with Liu He, the chief negotiator from China at about 2:45 p.m. Eastern this afternoon.Of course, the meetings though are beginning eminently in Washington. We just saw Steven Mnuchin entered the building and we are waiting for the Chinese officials to enter as well as these high-level negotiations continue for day two today in Washington.We've been talking a lot about this story of course all week. It has dominated markets attention and our program as well. Take a look at some of the top moments from the program this week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Chinese businesses cutting ties with the Houston Rockets after its manager expressed support for Hong Kong' pro-democracy activists in a tweet.REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): He's got a large percentage of people standing up in Hong Kong every Saturday, peacefully protesting for the idea of freedom of speech. This is -- this is a defining moment. The Houston Rocket G.M. should be -- should be celebrated because he understands what America means.PALMER LUCKEY, FOUNDER, ANDURIL INDUSTRIES: We have big problem where the biggest technology companies in United States, say China is their biggest revenue growth opportunity. And a lot of the smaller tech companies see China as a huge investment opportunity. The Chinese money is going to flow into their company. And so they make decisions that are based on this. And often they'll say that they're doing things for one reason, and behind- the-scenes they're actually being influenced by this desire to work with the Chinese over American interests.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Chinese government, there.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, you just got your partner back.BARTIROMO: Caught your reaction.KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, that's cheeky and American. Good for South Park. Look, it's appalling to me what the NBA has done groveling in front of the Chinese. The idea -- with all due respect to Veronica, the idea that the Chinese people who love American basketball are going to change President Xi's mind. I think it's not accurate.BARTIROMO: You have been such as an incredible leader in this industry for 25 years that I know you with integrity and that's why the firm is trusted. Tell me how things have changed over this 25-year period.CHARLES SCHWAB, FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN, CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION: Well, First of all, I loved investing, I love people who love to invest. And I've always want to make it better easier and cheaper for people to invest and get more people into our democracy in terms of free market capitalism. And so we've done it.ANA BOTIN, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, BANCO SANTANDER: We are expecting lower rates means that the recovery could be more sustainable, you know, U.S. is at full employment. Basically the lowest unemployment ever for 50 years, so we see the U.S. consumer being very resilient and at the end of 70 percent will be --BARTIROMO: Your thoughts on the president and the White House saying look, we're not going to participate in this impeachment what some people are calling show as opposed to an impeachment inquiry.PETER SCHWEIZER, PRESIDENT, GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY INSTITUTE: If you're going to conduct an impeachment inquiry, you might as well have a vote on it and make it official having an unofficial so to speak impeachment inquiry doesn't make sense, so I think the position is completely reasonable on the part of the White House.NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think if you have week after week of the New York Times and the Washington Post and all the major networks giving their version of reality, it has an effect. Does it mean that Trump is going to lose the election? No. Does it mean he's going to be impeached? No.BARTIROMO: I scream, you scream, we all scream for the museum of ice cream. New York City's sweetest pop-up experience.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I used to dream about going into the ocean filled of sprinkles and I was like, why doesn't this exist as an adult? And so we made it for world to experience.BARTIROMO: The museum of ice cream is reportedly at $200 million. I mean, it's so successful, you've been dubbed the millennial Walt Disney.MARYELLIS BUNN, CEO AND FOUNDER, MUSEUM OF ICE CREAM: You look at that, you know, creating the next Disney for both millennials and gen Z and they're really looking towards experiences of our products.JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: You know, it's been a tough year for farmers. You're right during the crosshairs but they put something in the crosshairs, this is something called a corn cannon and what they do is you take one of those layers of corn, that doesn't get you much in commodity markets these days and then fire it, let's see. Ah, hey, I hit the pumpkin. Look at that.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Brooklyn brewery launching its first ever non- alcoholic beer. Kristina Partsinevelos is there in Brooklyn with the details on this unique brew. Good morning, Kristina.KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. Look at this, I'm surrounded by alcohol but what I'm holding in my hand is a non-alcoholic beer. This is a Brooklyn Brewery Special Effects hens the design on the cans over here. Right now we are in the brewery, this is all alcoholic beer like I mentioned, they make over a hundred kegs, large kegs I have been told.But the importance is the trend that we're starting to see towards non- alcoholic products. According to the Beer Institute, overall, beer sales have declined 2.5 percent which is quite drastically. So, you have a lot of companies that need to diversify. We spoke specifically to the CEO about this and about the demographics of his new customers. Listen in.ROBIN OTTAWAY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, BROOKLYN BREWERY: It's the younger people that can kind of see where this fits in their lives because maybe they don't have some of the preconceptions that older generations had about non-alcoholic beverages, so they're coming into our world with much more variety.(END VIDEO CLIP)PARTSINEVELOS: The CEO went on to say that the goal of this is to break the stigma and it's not -- we're not talking about the stigma only for pregnant people and those that are sober but also that just don't want to drink some alcohol. So they're launching this. Hoping it will do -- what's actually doing quite well, they launched in it Sweden and several countries over there. It's going to be launched here in the United States in eight states by November but it's on tap behind me.Then in January, they're going to have a massive rollout, about 30 states, so if you're wondering those at home, you know, I don't like beer or I'm concerned about how much is -- how many calories, how much it's going to cost, so this special effects can is 85 calories, so less than a can of beer. A six pack will cost you around 10 bucks. And this is something that we're starting to see more and more, Maria.The fact that people are tapping into different trends and one of the last questions, we did ask the CEO is would you ever consider going into, you know, the CBD products, the hemp type of alcohol, the spiked seltzer and you -- he said, you know, they can go in any direction as long as it stays true to the brand. So, for first time ever, I will try, we got to do it this live television and let you know.I did just brushed my teeth which is probably not -- oh, that's really what we want to happen on live television, just splatter on my face. And it's a hoppy lager. There you go, Maria. Back to you.BARTIROMO: So, does it taste good? You like it?PARTSINEVELOS: I -- so, yes, it actually -- it's a little bit lighter than what I expected but it definitely tastes like beer and I have it dripping down me right now but -- yes, I know, it taste like beer.BARTIROMO: Thank you.PARTSINEVELOS: Lighter though, a little bit lighter. Thank you.BARTIROMO: All right. Kristina Partsinevelos. We'll be right back with some final thoughts in this all-star panel.BARTIROMO: I want to show you more live pictures right here. Steve Mnuchin, treasury secretary, along with Liu He arriving for these trade talks right here. Bob Lighthizer, the trade representative as well. So this day two of talks is under way. As you can see there, just walking in. We know that Liu He is also going to meet with the president later today. That's happening at 2:45 p.m. Eastern.But we're going to be watching these meetings of course for any news that comes out of these meetings in Washington and we have these new pictures for you as the Chinese delegation has arrived for the trade talks for day two and we will keep a watch on for any details in terms of what happens next. Markets are rallying on this meeting, of course, and the idea that maybe things are going well.That's what the president said yesterday, after initial -- the initial meeting yesterday. Market is up 262 points but the markets have been following this like a bouncing ball, every comment that comes out, markets are trading on. We'll be right back. We want to keep looking at this, because this is the issue that's driving markets. But there are other issues as well. And you talked earlier about the potential for a slowdown. You're not seeing it, Nancy?TENGLER: Not at all.BARTIROMO: In terms of a recession.TENGLER: Right. Yes. We don't -- we don't see it. The hand-wringing has been over the ISM, the manufacturing and the non-manufacturing. And we just don't see that happening. Five times since this expansion began, non -- or manufacturing has fallen to the 50 or below level which is where we get contraction in the economy. And we think we're going to bounce off this and that you will average about 10 to 12 percent in stocks and that's not bad. As we were talking earlier, there's not a lot of other places to go. So (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: This is -- this is the broader backdrop from a story that is obviously being driven by the Chinese talks. Going into this week, Dagen, you know that the Chinese said that they wanted a smaller deal. They wanted to just focus on trade and not anything else. We had headlines today that the Chinese are willing to do away with their foreign ownership rules on financial services companies.That's the first industry that's going to get that. Up until now, you had to own 59 percent at best in terms of a -- having any ownership of your company in China.MCDOWELL: Right, but it's -- and also, recently clearings the approval of licenses for American firms to do business with Huawei, if that move is completed that would be a huge improvement in these talks. So that's clearly under discussion in the last couple of days.MALIK: This is a national security issue. We can't take that -- separate those two things. But my prediction is that we are going to get a small deal because this is bad for both countries and my hope is that some agreement will happen. But not lose sight of the bigger picture that this country is starting to talk about.BARTIROMO: How do you do that? The Chinese don't want any, you know, anything in there that gives consequences for theft of technology.MALIK: And to your point, that's a huge issue. Because even if they allow you to have some percentage ownership of a business there, what ends up happening is they basically might steal it.BARTIROMO: All right. Great show, everybody.MCDOWELL: And meantime, the NBA visit is a tire fire.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: Hasn't gone out.BARTIROMO: There you go. Have a great weekend, everybody. "VARNEY & COMPANY" begins right now. Stu, take it away.STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: And good morning, Maria. Good morning, everyone.Load-Date: October 11, 2019End of Document

Sen. Marco Rubio is asking the US government to investigate TikTok over claims it's censoring content that might upset ChinaBusiness Insider USOctober 9, 2019 Wednesday 06:00 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 786 wordsByline: pleskin@businessinsider.com,  (Paige Leskin)Highlight: This follows a recent report on internal documents showing TikTok instructed moderators to censor content likely to anger the Chinese government.BodyChip Somodevilla/Getty Images• Marco Rubio, the US senator from Florida, has asked the US government to investigate            TikTok, the globally popular            short-form video app owned by a Chinese company.• Rubio wrote on Twitter that there's "ample and growing evidence" that TikTok censors content "in line with China's communist government directives."• The Guardian reported last month on internal documents that show TikTok instructed moderators to censor content addressing political issues likely to anger the Chinese government.• A TikTok spokesperson told Business Insider that the Chinese government does not ask the social app to censor content, and does not have the jurisdiction to do so because TikTok does not operate in China - its Chinese version of the app is called Douyin.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.US Senator Marco Rubio is calling on the federal government to investigate the popular video-sharing app TikTok based on "ample and growing evidence" that it's censoring content at the request of China.Rubio posted Wednesday on Twitter to share his concerns about TikTok, the short-form video app            owned by the massive Chinese tech            company ByteDance.The senator's request comes just a couple weeks after The Guardian reported on TikTok internal documents that directed platform moderators to censor content that was likely to anger the Chinese government - namely, videos criticizing China's version of political policies and historical events, such as the            Tiananmen Square protests.Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1181909057755475968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw Have already formally asked Trump administration to fully enforce anti-boycott laws that prohibit any U.S. person-including U.S. subsidiaries of Chinese companies from complying with foreign boycotts seeking to coerce U.S. companies to conform with #China's government views.Read more: Internal documents showed TikTok censoring topics that would anger ChinaRubio said he was directing his request to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a federal investigative group housed under the US Department of Treasury that reviews national security implications of foreign investments into the U.S. The committee declined to comment on the matter, citing its policy not to discuss specific cases.The investment that Rubio is calling to be reviewed is ByteDance's acquisition of Musical.ly, a now-defunct US-born app that was incredibly similar to TikTok. ByteDance - a $75 billion company - bought Musical.ly back in November 2017 in a deal valued at $1 billion. It then shut down Musical.ly a year later in order to merge it with TikTok and launch the app in the US.TikTok, essentially, doesn't exist in China: Instead, ByteDance operates a similar app there called Douyin, while TikTok operates in international markets outside of the country.In response to Rubio's call to review TikTok, a TikTok spokesperson told Business Insider that the Chinese government does not request the platform censors content, and that it doesn't have the "jurisdiction" to do so since TikTok doesn't operate in China."TikTok US is localized, adheres to US laws, and stores all US user data in the US," the TikTok spokesperson said.

Banned in China: Why the Music Biz Should Be Watching NBA, 'South Park' Dramas (Guest Column)BillboardOctober 8, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Prometheus Global Media, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; TAGLength: 1217 wordsByline: Bill WerdeHighlight: If you're a basketball fan, you know the drama with China over an NBA executive's tweet that supported Hong Kong protestors has been center court. But if you think the music industry is sidelined in this discussion, you haven't been watching the ball.BodyIf you're a basketball fan, you know the drama with China over an NBA executive's tweet that supported Hong Kong protestors has been center court. But if you think the music industry is sidelined in this discussion, you haven't been watching the ball.To recap briefly, widely respected Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey sent a tweet last week sharing simply, "Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong." ( Here's some basic background on the protests that have been happening there.) China responded in fairly typical Chinese fashion. Chinese state-run television CCTV said it was suspending NBA broadcast arrangements for preseason games. And Tencent, which owns NBA digital streaming rights in China as part of a recently-announced, $1.5 billion, five-year partnership , also said it would "temporarily suspend" preseason broadcasts. After NBA president David Silver defended Morey's right to his opinion, CCTV issued this chilling statement, via Chinese social media platform Weibo: "We believe that any speech challenging a country's national sovereignty and social stability is not within the scope of freedom of speech." Mind you, this approach is not unusual for China, nor is it unusual for Tencent -- the majority shareholder of Tencent Music. The latter company is reportedly in late-stage discussions to acquire 10–20% of Universal Music Group, which currently controls roughly a third of the world's recorded music market. Tencent Music already has a 7.5% stake in Spotify. When China gets criticized, Tencent has proven it is a willing and effective axe man.The music industry has no choice but to work towards partnerships and relevancy in China, where more active support of copyright enforcement  beginning in 2017 has enabled the country to grow to the seventh biggest music market, according to            last year's annual IFPI rankings  -- all the way from 14 in 2015. I've been told by senior execs whose careers depend on getting this right that they expect China to crack the top five in the next year or two and potentially be the No. 1 global market in five years. But if executives think that progress will be free from soul-searching deals with the devil, the Morey fiasco should be a massive wake-up call. What will Universal do when Lady Gaga decides to share her thoughts on human rights violations in China and Tencent plays hardball? I took a dozen of my Bandier students to Beijing and Hong Kong in May (also to Seoul and Tokyo), and we sat with many of the most important and powerful people in the Chinese music businesses -- all of whom requested anonymity in exchange for honest insights, because, well... China. But two realities were eminently clear, regardless of who was doing the talking. The first reality is that Chinese businesses do what they are told when the government calls. An executive at one top company told us, "It isn't so much that the government officially bans anything. They talk to our government relations person and they say, 'We think it might be a good idea if...' and then we just know what to do."There are no shortage of recent, high-profile examples. Just a couple of months ago, all broadcasts and streams of the Taiwanese Golden Melody Awards -- widely recognized as the Chinese Grammys -- were abruptly severed  when a presenter voiced support for the Hong Kong protests. But it's not just political protests that get the kibosh. Last year, an official arm of the Chinese government issued a statement apparently            banning hip-hop culture and people with tattoos  from appearing on television. While my students and I were in China, several executives said that this was prompted by the television show Rap of China becoming too popular too quickly and pushing too many cultural boundaries.And as long as the U.S. president's "great and unmatched wisdom" has us poised to go to trade war with China, the music business should keep what happened with K-pop in 2016 top of mind. China imposed sanctions against South Korea for the latter nation's support of a U.S. missile defense system (THAAD). And streaming services got the "We think it might be a good idea" call. I have a 19-year-old friend from Asia who was an avid consumer of K-pop and Korean shows on Chinese media platforms. (Again, this person's identity must remain anonymous for fear of retribution.) My young friend was not aware of THAAD at the time. What she was aware of is that she went to bed having just watched her favorite K-pop programs and when she and her friends woke up the next day, it was as if K-pop had never existed. The shows were gone. No explanation -- just disappeared.We saw this draconian approach again this week when China banned South Park in response to an episode about Hollywood trying to please the Chinese government. China killed a lot more than Kenny -- all clips and episodes are gone from all streaming services and, if you search social media giant Weibo, you cannot find a comment about the show.Since THAAD, no Korean K-pop star has performed in China. The big K-pop conglomerates increasingly back K-pop acts with Chinese performers in order to participate in that market. Want to know why some of these Chinese K-pop stars were recently in the news? For publicly backing China against Hong Kong protesters.This is not unusual in the context of China, where the tour guide warned our students before visiting Tiananmen Square: "Do not talk about what happened  at Tiananmen Square." Don't like it? Then consider the second reality that was made abundantly clear to me and to students by top Chinese executives. There may be growing interest and an acknowledgement of the opportunity represented in working with partners from the West. But if those Western partners don't want to play by China's rules, they should just stay home. You're a hip-hop star with lots of tattoos and profane lyrics? You aren't going to work in China. And if you want to speak out against any action the government has taken or is taking? No one in the Chinese music business wants that headache or association.Keep in mind, part of the reason that China is such a giant, tempting market is that China's authoritarianism cuts both ways. Just two years ago, when China decided music services needed to support copyright, my friend in Asia had the exact same experience with pirated services she was using to stream K-pop as she did when her favorite TV shows disappeared amidst Korean sanctions. She just woke up one day and any trace of K-pop -- songs, artist profiles, anything -- had vanished from pirating sites. She is now a paying subscriber.China giveth. But China also taketh away, and they do it with a rapid-fire, below-the-belt precision that will create new and certainly queasy realities for Western partners -- especially those representing artists with a social conscience or political bent. Universal Music Group may be getting the price they want per share from Tencent. But are they thinking through the true costs of the partnership? Time almost certainly will tell.Bill Werde is the director of the Bandier  undergraduate music industry program  and the  graduate Audio Arts program  at the Newhouse School at Syracuse University.

Hong Kong Is Winning the Global Public-Opinion War With BeijingAtlantic OnlineSeptember 29, 2019 SundayCopyright 2019 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1767 wordsByline: Chris HortonBodyTAIPEI-Months of protests in Hong Kong have pitted residents of all ages and backgrounds against their police force, local government, and the Chinese Communist Party, and there is no question of who is less powerful.Yet in a parallel battle over international public opinion, it is Beijing and its minions that are outgunned. This weekend that mismatch was once again highlighted by the thousands of people in cities across Australia, Asia, Europe and North America coming out in support of Hong Kong, but also in a much broader sense, against the CCP. Here in Taipei alone, thousands of Taiwanese and Hong Kongers marched through the streets on a rainy Sunday, told by Denise Ho, one of the most visible faces among Hong Kong's unofficial diplomatic corps, that her home and theirs shared the same fight against Beijing.These latest worldwide, pro-Hong Kong rallies are the most recent iteration of what supporters of repressed groups in Xinjiang and Tibet, as well as those who back Taiwan's sovereignty, have all struggled to d Mobilize large communities internationally to denounce the Chinese Communist Party.The relative success of Hong Kong's protest movement is all the more significant because it's occurring alongside Beijing expanding its propaganda efforts globally, as state-owned outlets trumpet China's vision of the world in multiple languages. This global campaign is the biggest challenge to China's rulers by the territory since 1989, when, still a British colony, its residents took part in demonstrations in solidarity with protesters in Tiananmen Square, while also providing financial and material support.[Read: Hong Kong's protests have cemented its identity]From            Oslo to            Osaka,            Congress to            the United Nations,            Taiwan to            Twitter, Hong Kongers have taken their DIY approach to protest to a global audience. Celebrity supporters testify in high-profile settings; highly targeted, crowdfunded media campaigns aim to keep the issue in the spotlight; and viral videos, catchy slogans, and even a movement anthem and flag help magnify the message on social media.On September 17, a panel of witnesses including Ho and pro-democracy campaigner Joshua Wong testified before the Congressional-Executive Commission on China in Washington, the latest in a string of public appearances for the two activists around the globe. Ho has been especially active, shuttling back and forth between Hong Kong and elsewhere to promote her message of resisting Beijing to receptive crowds, especially in Taiwan.Earlier this month in Taipei, Ho spoke and performed at the            Asia installment of the Oslo Freedom Forum. Only days before, she had been in Melbourne, where she appeared in public with the Chinese dissident artist Badiucao, designer of the unofficial Hong Kong protest movement flag. In Taipei, Ho took the stage to a screaming crowd of hundreds of admirers, their phones raised to record her appeal to democratic Taiwan, whose way of life is also under threat from China. Describing the struggle of Hong Kongers, who cannot rely on their own government to counter China's narrative, Ho struck a pragmatic tone. "When the system fails us," she said to the attentive crowd, "we take things into our own hands."Wong, who rose to international fame as one of the leaders of the pro-democracy, Occupy-style Umbrella Movement of 2014, has also been busy on the diplomatic front. Prior to his congressional testimony, he stopped in            Germany, urging its government to cease exporting crowd-control weapons to Hong Kong and to put human rights in Hong Kong on the agenda in Berlin's trade talks with Beijing. (           China's government rebuked Germany after its foreign minister, Heiko Maas, met with Wong on September 10.)Wong's German visit came after he and fellow activists visited Taiwan, where he            implored the ruling party to pass an asylum law that would make it easier for Hong Kongers to seek refuge here, territory the CCP claims despite having never controlled it.Although neither Wong nor Ho has been appointed by the current protest movement to represent it abroad-a remarkable feat of the demonstrations is that they have been largely leaderless-the general consensus in Hong Kong seems to be that they are well-known names and faces who offer the advantage of signal-boosting.While in Taipei mid-month, Ho told me she thought of herself as a mediator or spokesperson for the movement at large. "I'm not seeing myself as a leader of any sort," she said. "I am, on the other hand, one of the participants of this movement: I have been on the streets with these people. I have been teargassed." She added that, as a "recognizable face," she saw herself "as a conduit that can bring stories of these people to the world."In July, Ho scored one of the first public-relations victories abroad for Hong Kong's protesters when, speaking at the United Nations in Geneva, she described growing police brutality against Hong Kongers and called on the UN to remove China from its Human Rights Council. During her remarks, she was interrupted twice by China's representative to the body on procedural grounds. More recently, while in Washington, Ho and Wong were joined by other activists and congressional leaders for the launch of the            Hong Kong Democracy Council, a D.C.-based lobbying group for the movement.[           Read: The death of democracy in Hong Kong]Ho and Wong are far from the only diplomats working on behalf of the movement. In June, a            crowdfunding drive raised hundreds of thousands of dollars from more than 20,000 donors, paying for full-page ads in more than 10 major international newspapers, urging the G20 summit in Osaka to raise Hong Kong's plight. How much impact the campaign had is unclear, but Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe did bring up Hong Kong's protests with the Chinese leader Xi Jinping when the two met on the sidelines of the summit. Another crowdfunded            ad campaign is under way, this time targeting papers on October 1 to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, a particularly sensitive date for the CCP. The campaign is not the only bit of rain to fall on the party's parade-Hong Kong's government announced on September 18 that it had            canceled the fireworks show planned for the anniversary.Unlike Xinjiang or Tibet, both of which the Communists forcibly took control of in the 1950s, Hong Kong was handed over peacefully by the British in 1997, following 150 years of colonial rule. At the heart of the agreement between London and Beijing was an arrangement whereby Hong Kong would maintain its separate political and economic system and enjoy "a high degree of autonomy," with Beijing handling national security and diplomacy.This "one country, two systems" arrangement has allowed Hong Kong to have a free internet, for example, whereas Beijing heavily restricts the web within China and even went so far as to either partially or completely            shut down the internet in Xinjiang-the size of western Europe-for 10 months.Today, many Hong Kongers worry that their internet access may go the way of China's, adding a sense of urgency to their attempts to use it to organize themselves and to reach the outside world in order to spread their message and counter Beijing's narrative. Twitter, in particular, has become an important virtual battleground for foreign hearts and minds.The Chinese authorities appear to agree. On September 3, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute published an            investigation into the methods used in a disinformation campaign aimed at Hong Kong that Twitter has attributed to Beijing, a first. "Efforts by the Chinese government to leverage Twitter to redirect and recast political developments in Hong Kong-both in terms of covert information operations and through its state media-highlight just how powerful Twitter is as a tool of statecraft," Danielle Cave, deputy director of the ASPI's International Cyber Policy Centre, told me.Hong Kong's protesters have also recognized the global influence of Twitter in the information domain and are themselves trying to use Twitter diplomacy to share breaking developments and to connect with journalists, Cave noted. This includes providing images and videos of events on the ground, often in real time, and generating new hashtags, including ones that highlight violent incidents and police brutality. (The protesters' tool of choice for coordinating rallies has thus far been the encrypted messaging app Telegram, but that can't match Twitter's global reach or public-broadcasting capabilities, nor does it have the ear of global stakeholders that the protesters seek to engage.)Hong Kongers have, so far, proved a nimble David to China's clumsy Goliath. But the CCP does occasionally score points. Donald Trump, for example, parroted the Chinese government's line on the Hong Kong protests when he called them "           riots" in early August, a characterization that many viewed as a win for Beijing.In other incidents, however, the tendency of Chinese nationalism to backfire on the foreign stage has hampered the Communist cause. Among these incidents are            violent Chinese-student reactions to pro-Hong Kong demonstrations at Australian universities, with the Chinese embassy expressing support for the students' actions on social media afterward. Debate in Australia regarding the ability of China to control public speech there has since intensified. Elsewhere, Montreal's Pride parade excluded Hong Kong participants after receiving threats from "pro-Communists." At the parade, many onlookers were aghast when, during the moment of silence for those who have died from HIV/AIDS,            Chinese participants sang their national anthem."The most basic weakness of the external communications of the Chinese party-state is the fact that foreign audiences, and their values and interests, are never truly considered," David Bandurski, co-director of the China Media Project, told me. "Sure, the messages are directed at foreigners, but the language is still the internal and insular language of the party-state."In this sense, Bandurski said, these propaganda efforts are not really external at all."Try as it might to raise the volume on China's singular, restrained voice, the party-state is still talking to itself, or shouting at its own wall," Bandurski said. "The louder that voice becomes, the more uncompromising and aggressive it sounds."Load-Date: September 30, 2019End of Document

US BLACKLISTS 28 CHINESE ENTITIES CITING RIGHTS ABUSES IN XINJIANGStates News ServiceOctober 8, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1277 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:The U.S. Department of Commerce has blacklisted 28 governmental or commercial entities from China it said are implicated in rights abuses against Uyghurs and other ethnic Muslim minorities in the country's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR).The XUAR's Public Security Bureau, 19 government entities, and eight commercial entities were blacklisted for "activities contrary to the foreign policy interests of the United States," the Department of Commerce said in an announcement on Monday, citing their involvement in "China's campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance.""The U.S. Government and Department of Commerce cannot and will not tolerate the brutal suppression of ethnic minorities within China," said Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross."This action will ensure that our technologies, fostered in an environment of individual liberty and free enterprise, are not used to repress defenseless minority populations."Among the companies added to the Department of Commerce's Entity List were Hikvision and Dahua Technologyglobal leaders in video surveillance products who employ more than 34,000 and 16,000 employees worldwide.Other companies included voice recognition software maker iFlytek; artificial intelligence firms SenseTime, Yitu Technologies, and Megvii; Xiamen Meiya Pico Information Co., which specializes in forensic data analysis; and nanotechnology company Yixin Science and Technology.The blacklisting will block the ability of the companies to obtain U.S.-produced components and could limit their access to Western markets, potentially dealing a blow to China's bid to become a leading exporter of surveillance technology.Also on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced visa restrictions on Chinese officials "who are believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, the detention and abuse of Uighurs, Kazakhs, or other members of Muslim minority groups" in the XUAR."The United States calls on the People's Republic of China to immediately end its campaign of repression in Xinjiang, release all those arbitrarily detained, and cease efforts to coerce members of Chinese Muslim minority groups residing abroad to return to China to face an uncertain fate," Pompeo said in a statement.After the announcement of visa restrictions, Pompeo noted in a tweet that "China has forcibly detained over one million Muslims in a brutal, systematic campaign to erase religion and culture in Xinjiang."Mass incarcerations in the XUAR, as well as other policies seen to violate the rights of Uyghurs and other Muslims, have led to increasing calls by the international community to hold Beijing accountable for its actions in the region.Authorities are believed to have held more than 1.5 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities accused of harboring "strong religious views" and "politically incorrect" ideas in a vast network of internment camps in the XUAR since April 2017.While Beijing initially denied the existence of the camps, China this year changed tack and began describing the facilities as "boarding schools" that provide vocational training for Uyghurs, discourage radicalization, and help protect the country from terrorism.Reporting by RFA's Uyghur Service and other media organizations, however, has shown that those in the camps are detained against their will and subjected to political indoctrination, routinely face rough treatment at the hands of their overseers, and endure poor diets and unhygienic conditions in the often overcrowded facilities.RFA has also documented a significant deployment of surveillance technology in the XUAR and other parts of China in recent years that the central government has used to compile a database of information on its citizens and track their movements in a bid to predict potential crimes or social unrest in real time.Blacklist reactionsThe Department of Commerce's announcement comes days ahead of meetings planned between Chinese and American officials in Washington to resolve a trade war that has led to the leveling of tariffs on billions of dollars of products and other restrictions on investment.Speaking to reporters at a regular press briefing in Beijing on Tuesday, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Geng Shuang said that the Department of Commerce's decision to blacklist the entities "seriously violates the basic norms governing international relations, interferes in China's internal affairs and undermines China's interests."Geng demanded that the U.S. withdraw its decision and rejected accusations of rights abuses in the XUAR, which he called "made-up pretexts for [U.S.] interference," adding that policies in the region are aimed at eradicating "extremism and terrorism."The Uyghur exile community welcomed the Department of Commerce's announcement on Tuesday, with Nury Turkel, a lawyer and chairman of the Washington-based Uyghur Human Rights Project, calling it a "long overdue designation that will potentially change the behavior of the Chinese government.""Chinese tech giants and government entities should be held to account for aiding and abetting in systematic and deliberate attempts to destroy Uyghurs' ethno-national identity and existence as a distinct nation," he told RFA's Uyghur Service.Sophie Richardson, the China director at New York-based Human Rights Watch, called the blacklisting a "significant move by the Trump administration in response to gross human rights violations in Xinjiang," and expressed hope that it would bring pressure to bear on Beijing."We certainly hope the message that's conveyed to other governments ... is that measures like sanctions are necessary and appropriate," she said."[We hope] they will draw a line in one of China's most egregious human rights violations of the last decade and say, 'This is unacceptable behaviorwe're going to pull levers that can potentially affect the behavior of officials and companies in the region to try to end the human rights crisis.'"Departure from US policyU.S. author and commentator Gordon G. Chang told RFA that the blacklisting signaled "a major departure of long-held American policy" towards China.""The Chinese have to see that, across the U.S. political spectrum, Beijing is viewed as a maligned actor, and this is a reversal of four decades of U.S. engagement with China," he said."Chinese officials have to be especially worried that they've not only lost the support of the United States, the United States is now treating them like an enemy ... We're now treating them like they're treating us."The new additions to the Entity List join the Chinese telecom giant Huawei, which the Trump administration blacklisted in May this year, citing national security concerns, and five Chinese entities that lead China's development of high-performance computing, added a month later.The U.S. Senate last month unanimously passed the first legislation by any nation in response to human rights abuses against ethnic Uyghurs in the XUAR, which would authorize regular monitoring of the situation by various government bodies.The bipartisan Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, introduced by Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Bob Menendez of New Jersey, would appoint a special State Department coordinator on the XUAR and require regular reports on the region's internment camps, surveillance network and security threats posed by an ongoing crackdown on the Uyghur peopleif ratified by the House of Representatives.Reported by Alim Seytoff and Mamatjan Juma for RFA's Uyghur Service.

I think it gives them more incentive. The deal itself, Maria, the best part of the first phase, actually, is the intellectual property segment.It pretty much replicates the original chapter we had back in the May document, that the Chinese reneged on, so that's good news. They have forced technology transfer. We get a good started on that. The enforcement mechanism, you're right, that's the price, the key, the centerpiece of anything. There is a strong enforcement mechanism in there that would serve on all three phases.So, let's see what happens. We're on the glided path to Chile, and the meeting of the two presidents, mid-November, and the plan there is to have an agreement. So, see what happens.BARTIROMO: Is the U.S. going to have to hold off on the tariff increases, the next round of tariffs which were set for December, in order to see this deal, get signed?NAVARRO: I don't -- look, we held off on the October tariffs. So, we are going to go from 25 to 30 percent. Let's see what happens, one of the President's favorite expressions. I think it's clear, Maria, that the tariffs are our best defense against the theft of our technology, but also the best insurance policy, have the Chinese come in good faith in the negotiating table.So, let's see what happens. We have the best negotiators in the world, President Trump and Bob Lighthizer.BARTIROMO: Yes.NAVARRO: So, I'm feeling good about that. And I'm feeling bullish today, I mean, you got Brexit --BARTIROMO: Yes.NAVARRO: -- you got the Turkey thing, don't forget, that was the -- that's really important.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, I'm going to get to that.NAVARRO: We got earnings --BARTIROMO: I'm just trying to understand --NAVARRO: -- we got all the stuff.BARTIROMO: -- what the U.S. got out of this phase one, because, right after I feel like, you know, it was announced that we had phase one of a deal, there were reports that Beijing was saying we're not going to sign this, at APEC, unless we know that those increases and more tariffs, that were set to go into effect later this year in December, are taken off the table.NAVARRO: So, I think it's more, to ignore the posturing and just look at what's on the table.BARTIROMO: OK.NAVARRO: And what's on the table is enforcement, intellectual property, forced technology transfer, currency manipulation, and this is big, particularly for the people watching your show, on Wall Street. Full financial market access into China without joint ventures, so that's good news for the insurance and banking stocks, credit cards.So -- I mean, look, this is a robust phase one package. Let's see what happens. You always have to be skeptical. I know Dagen is always skeptical about these things and rightly so. But let's see what happens. I mean, there is something good in place now. I think China has gotten the message that they need to play fair with the rest of the world.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean --NAVARRO: Donald Trump's the guy that's making them do that.BARTIROMO: The last time you had a deal, was back in April and May, and the Chinese reneged because the hard-liners --NAVARRO: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- when, you know, the negotiator went back to China, the hard liners said no, no, no, we are not doing this at all. So, do you have any -- do you have any sense of what the hard-liners are saying in China today, after the visit?NAVARRO: So, the Lighthizer rule, all negotiations behind closed doors. Lighthizer is engaged fully with the Chinese, both at the principal and deputy's level, and I think those discussions are what matter, not what appears, neither the People's Daily or the American Press.BARTIROMO: So you think it's all posturing?NAVARRO: So, let's stay focused on the price here.BARTIROMO: You think it's all posturing then? All right.NAVARRO: Yes.BARTIROMO: We'll be watching that.NAVARRO: Of course.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about the General Motors strike, Peter, it stretches on.NAVARRO: Sure.BARTIROMO: United Auto Workers staying off the job, as they get ready to vote on a proposed contract, which will give higher pay to full-time workers, better terms for temporary ones, if this deal goes through. Three G.M. plants including the one in Lordstown, Ohio would close. Tell us where we stand on this from where you sit, and --NAVARRO: Sure.BARTIROMO: -- how does this connect to the USMCA situation which we are all waiting for?NAVARRO: Sure, let's unpack this a little bit. I mean, the G.M. deal is a great deal. I think the UAW president, Gary Jones, did a great job in the negotiations. You got wages, you got no added health care costs, temporary workers closed, there's an end to the profit-sharing cap, which is really good.So, there's also a big investment component. This is important, particularly for the Lordstown issue. There's $9 billion that G.M. is putting on the table, that will create over 10,000 jobs. They are keeping Detroit-Hamtramck open, that's a big plant to make electric trucks.And there's synergy with Lordstown because there's going to be a joint venture plant right on the Lordstown factory perimeter that's going to be building batteries for G.M.'s electric move, so this is -- this is a great deal. The disappointment, for me, is the fact that the workers aren't back to work today, tending ratification, that was a bit of a curveball.I think an unforced error because it hurts both the company and the workers and it's not clear to me why that happened. But the workers -- UAW workers, should love this. President Trump loves the auto industry. He's pledged to make sure that autos are built here, in America, with U.S. content, so he's fully behind this industry.BARTIROMO: Yes.NAVARRO: So --BARTIROMO: He definitely -- he loves the auto sector, but he also loves tariffs, right? Is he going to put tariffs on European autos, coming into this country, increase tariffs?NAVARRO: That's a decision to be made in a while, and I'll come back and talk about that at that time. But let's stay focused on the G.M. prize here, great deal for the UAW workers. The ratification could come as early, as October 25th, and we get folks back to work. This has been costly. It's been --BARTIROMO: Yes.NAVARRO: -- a month long strike. It's been a good example of good labor management, negotiations --BARTIROMO: Yes.NAVARRO: -- there were tough negotiations, but in the end, there's a deal, I think, that's great for both sides, that gets us a good future.BARTIROMO: Yes. Hopefully --NAVARRO: But --BARTIROMO: -- they get back to work soon, for sure.NAVARRO: -- it's over $1 billion in profits lost, and over a half a billion dollars in wages, lost, to workers and tax --BARTIROMO: Yes.NAVARRO: -- revenues lost. Industrial production yesterday, I'm sure you covered that, that was down 0.4 percent, and that was virtually all the G.M. strikes., so --BARTIROMO: I want to -- I want to ask you about the USMCA wages in a second, Peter, but let me ask you this, because these tariffs on European goods went into effect today, as a result of obviously, the Airbus subsidies and the --NAVARRO: Sure.BARTIROMO: -- WTO ruling, are we going to see retaliation from Europe? What kind of a retaliation are you expecting?NAVARRO: The Airbus tariffs that was a result of more than a decade-long suit that President Trump brought to fruition in Trump time. It's important to get Airbus to stop subsidizing so we can have our own air industry here. They can't retaliate under the rules of the World Trade Organization.Let me say it one more time, they cannot retaliate under the rules of the World Trade Organization, so don't let anybody today, wave that flag.BARTIROMO: OK.NAVARRO: This is not going to happen.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about USMCA, how are you feeling -- I mean, there seems to be some positive talk from some lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, in terms of whether or not Nancy Pelosi brings the USMCA bill, to the floor, and explain to us the mechanisms in that USMCA, in terms of what U.S. workers will make versus workers in Mexico.NAVARRO: Let's be clear, this USMCA deal in the near-term is more important than the China deal, it's twice the trade, five times the exports. I'm very concerned, right now, about Nancy Pelosi's bringing this to the floor. They seem -- the Democrats seem totally distracted by their own circus, and they're not taking care of the American people. They're not legislating at all.But having said that, I also have fate in Ambassador Lighthizer, he's working very closely with labor interests, as well as folks on Capitol Hill, to ensure that we have a strong enforcement. Remember --BARTIROMO: Right.NAVARRO: -- Maria, the whole point of the USMCA, from the manufacturing point of view, is to keep our auto industry here and our workers protected. So there's very strong provisions in there, in terms of domestic content, wage and environmental issues. It's a -- the USMCA -- President Trump did his job. It's a great deal. Nancy Pelosi needs to do her job.BARTIROMO: So --NAVARRO: That's just it.BARTIROMO: And you think it will come to the floor --NAVARRO: Full stop.BARTIROMO: -- before Thanksgiving?NAVARRO: It has to. It should have come to the floor. It should come to the floor by the end of this month.BARTIROMO: End of this month.NAVARRO: Maria --BARTIROMO: All right. We're two weeks away, Peter.NAVARRO: -- this should kick to the floor in two days -- two days, if Nancy Pelosi wanted to do it. So, let's get it done.BARTIROMO: We'll be watching.NAVARRO: Trump time.BARTIROMO: You got two weeks left in the month, we'll see if she brings it to the floor in the next two weeks. Peter, it's always a pleasure to talk with you. Thank you so much.NAVARRO: My pleasure, Maria.BARTIROMO: Peter Navarro joining us there, in Washington. We have a FOX Business alert right now, Turkish president, Erdogan, says that he has informed President Trump, in a phone call, about launching an incursion on Syria, one day before it happened. He also says the offensive will continue if the truce agreement is not fully implemented by the end of the ceasefire.You're looking at a live picture of smoke in Syria. We will have more developments on this, as it comes in. But, of course, we knew this already, because Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed it when I asked him if, in fact, the Turkish president did tell President Trump that he was going in to Syria.Joining the conversation this morning, Warby Parker co-founders, Neil Blumenthal and David Gilboa here, we're discussing frame fitting, augmented reality, and the state of retail this morning.

Mexican police locating one of 'El Chapo' Guzman's son. Cheryl Casone with headlines now. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: This is something, Maria -- good morning again, and this gunfight between police and suspected cartel members paralyzed the capital of Mexico's Sinaloa State, after security forces found Ovidio Guzman Lopez inside of a home there. Well, he's wanted in the U.S. on drug trafficking charges. Mexican officials say they later released him, claiming it was to protect lives. OK.Well, a federal judge has summoned drug company executives to a Cleveland courtroom today to discuss the possible settlement with representatives of states and talents hit hard by the opioid epidemic. They're working to reach a last-minute agreement to resolve thousands of lawsuits before the start of the first trial, which is on Monday, actually. The judge could settle more than 2500 cases, that could be worth more than $22 billion in total.And then, there is this, Charles Schwab wants to attract more young investors. To make it happen, The Wall Street Journal reports that they're going to allow customers to buy and sell fractions of shares. The program follow Schwab's recent move to eliminate trading commissions. Shares of Charles Schwab are down about five percent so far for the year. I used to be excited about stock splits. Whoa, what did I know at the time?BARTIROMO: Interesting idea.CASONE: Yes.BARTIROMO: Thanks, Cheryl. Coming up, the changing face of eyewear. We'll be speaking with the cofounders of the booming eyewear business Warby Parker. They share their secrets to success amid trying times for retailers. Plus, how they're using augmented reality to fit your frames, next.And then, start your engines, we're taking you live to Bentley's all-new Flying Spur right here on the Fox Plaza. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Eyeglasses and A.R. -- eyewear brand Warby Parker using augmented reality to help customers find the perfect pair of glasses without having physically trying them on using the iPhone's TrueDepth Camera technology. Warby Parker now offering the virtual try-on tool, where users can virtually see how different glasses will look using color, texture, and size. Joining us right now are the founders, Warby Parker cofounder and co-CEOs Neil Blumenthal and David Gilboa. Great to see you guys, thank you so much for joining us.NEIL BLUMENTHAL, COFOUNDER, WARBY PARKER: Thanks for having us.BARTIROMO: You know, I feel like since you started the company, there's been a buzz around Warby Parker. Why do you think that is? What's so great about Warby Parker?DAVID GILBOA, COFOUNDER, WARBY PARKER: Yes. So, we started the company in 2010 out of our apartments when we were in school and now we're nine and a half years later, we have over 2,000 employees, we have over 100 stores. And I think more than anything, we've just focused on delivering great value to customers. So, taking a product that normally costs a few hundred dollars and offering it starting at $95.00, including prescription lenses and trying to make the purchase process as easy as possible, whether people want to order online, or in one of our stores.BARTIROMO: How fantastic that you started in your apartment.BLUMENTHAL: Yes, it's wild. In those first early days, we were featured in Vogue and GQ and the company took off like a rocket ship. We hit our first year sales targets in three weeks, sold out of our top 15 styles in four weeks. We would literally have to cut class because we'd have to respond to customer emails and process orders.BARTIROMO: What a great story.MCDOWELL: What about the growth in the actual store locations?BLUMENTHAL: So, our store economics have been great. And here, you know, we started online only. That was really just to build direct relationships with customers and to cut out the middleman to charge $95.00 instead of 400. What we found in those early days, because we have this home try-on where we ship people five pairs of glasses, they can try it on. If there's a pair they want, then we put in the prescription lenses, we bring in and out of inventory, and people started calling up and saying, Hey, can we come to your office to try on glasses? Like, you can come to our apartment.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: That's great!BLUMENTHAL: So we found that they literally come --MCDOWELL: Do people really come to the apartment?BLUMENTHAL: -- they would come in. We'd put the glasses on the dining room table, we would put out our laptop, and people would check out through our Web site. And that had a starting to learn how to do sort of physical retail. So then, we did pop-up stores and we start to open up proper permanent stores. We thought maybe we would have 25 flagships across the country. Yes, now we have 107, and we'll open over 30 this year.FREEMAN: And are these actual prescription glasses or display models that you're wearing right now?GILBOA: Mine are real. I've been wearing glasses since I was 12 years old. But we tell everyone that glasses are great fashion accessory, whether you need a prescription or not.BLUMENTHAL: He's laughing at me.(LAUGHTER)FREEMAN: So, I'm wondering -- oh, because yours are real, too, or not really?BLUMENTHAL: Yes, these are -- these are advertised. Actually, I did find out that I have a slight prescription, so I'm going to have to update these.(LAUGHTER)FREEMAN: So, I'm wondering, were you as a customer, did this idea grow out of you were trying to buy sort of fashionable looking stuff online, but couldn't find it, or you had frustrating experiences with the existing online options?GILBOA: Yes. So, we really started the business to solve our own problems. I'd lost a pair of glasses, that cost me $700. And that just didn't make sense to me. It's technology that's been around for 800 years. And you can buy an iPhone for less than what it costs you to buy a new pair of glasses, and that just didn't make any sense. And so, as we started looking into it, we realized that there was nothing in the -- in the cost of goods that justified these high prices and that if we could create our own brand and sell direct to consumer starting online and then through our own stores, we could cut out all the middlemen, all the unnecessary markups, and pass those savings back onto consumers.BARTIROMO: And now, you're rolling out these extended sizes collection. You recently rolled out this collection. Tell us about that. You're offering customers different sizes of glasses, ranging from extra narrow to extra wide.BLUMENTHAL: You know, one of the things that we found is that shopping for glasses is often really difficult. You walk into an optical shop, sometimes that person's not even happy you walked in, the glasses are in a glass display, or behind the counter, out of reach, all locked up, so we just want to make it easy. Whether it's in our stores where the glasses are at eye level, you can grab them, we have full-length mirrors. And we have a really wide selection now. So, with extended sizing and actually introducing sizing like extra narrow, narrow, medium wide and extra wide, we can serve a wider range of people because we want to provide vision to everyone.MCDOWELL: And that's the thing that you don't -- that until now, you really didn't get with service from an eyeglasses store. My head is the size of like a Ford F-250.FREEMAN: Really?MCDOWELL: So, I need really big -- I need a much bigger glasses. And I can't tell you how many times because I've worn lenses -- I'm legally blind since I was 12. And you go in and they want to give you a pair of glasses like I know that's not going to look right. I know that's not going to look right. And it really is incredible shopping experience that you guys have created.BARTIROMO: It's a great idea. Did you start the company with your own money? How did you raise the money and tell us how you really got started? I mean, obviously it took off like a rocket ship.GILBOA: Yes, so we bootstrapped the business. So, Neil and I and our two other cofounders, Jeff and Andy (ph). We took kind of our life savings from working for a few years before business school, and we bootstrapped the business, launched off our apartments.BLUMENTHAL: With $120,000.BARTIROMO: $120,000? Wow. So, you needed that money for, what, just to hire people, to get -- to get the product?BLUMENTHAL: Initial -- yes, inventory of frames, a Web site, and actually a fashion publicist because we knew we were launching a lifestyle brand. But what was great about glasses is that the biggest part of the cost of goods sold, the lenses was -- in the early days was variable costs. So, we didn't have to pay for those until orders came in.BARTIROMO: Do you produce in America? Where are you producing?BLUMENTHAL: We set up an optical lab about an hour outside of New York City in Sloatsburg where we cut the lenses, insert them into the frames. The frames we produce in Italy, Japan, and China.BARTIROMO: OK. So, have you been hit by the tariffs? Are you seeing an impact from these tariffs?GILBOA: We are. So, as Neil mentioned, we have a global supply chain. And so, some of our suppliers are in China. And so, the tariffs are impacting us. And we're having conversations with those suppliers and thinking about kind of what our supply chains should look like strategically over the next few years.We were just talking about this a second ago, James, right? I mean, in terms of how hard it would be to take the production out of China and go somewhere else. Where would you go?GILBOA: Absolutely. You know, the vast majority of glasses that are produced globally are made in China. And there's a lot of expertise. And it just kind of industrial centers that would be really hard to move over a short period of time and so ...MCDOWELL: Well, could you ultimately move it back here in the United States? Is that upon -- is that something you much discussed?BARTIROMO: Or is it much (INAUDIBLE)(CROSSTALK)BLUMENTHAL: So, we are doing what we can do. We've been doing here like that optical lab work, that manufacturing that we're doing, but the entire optical industry is very dependent on China and all the component pieces. So, it's not just the final assembly, but the core wire, the hinges, the screws, the raw materials. So, moving that is not something that can be done in short order.MCDOWELL: What has China taken -- I don't mean to digress, but have they really taken business away from Japan because a lot of the high-end eyewear for years was made in Japan?GILBOA: Yes, they took a lot from Japan and Italy.MCDOWELL: Right.FREEMAN: The -- I'm wondering that Augmented Reality, is this proprietary technology or is this kind of widely used where you're going to have to fight it out with competitors who are kind of copying your model now?GILBOA: So, we developed our own virtual try on so you can download our iPhone app and virtually try on any glasses that we offer in our collection. And this is the first of its kind, true to scale, virtual try on that -- so you can see exactly how glasses will fit not only the right width, but where they'll actually sit on your face. And we used Apple's true depth camera and where we take 30,000 points on your face and then use AR kit to display those glasses using a proprietary algorithm. And so, that's something that we developed in-house and it's been really popular with our customers.BARTIROMO: That is very cool. We're just looking at the video and how you can do it right where with your phone. Real quick, before you go, you're going to take this company public?BLUMENTHAL: Eventually. You know, we look at an IPO, really as a financing event, and we've been growing quickly. We're now profitable. We don't need cash at the moment. We're certainly building the muscle memory to continue to grow ambitiously but consistently year after year after year, whether we're private or public.BARTIROMO: Congratulations.MCDOWELL: How much are you paying yourselves? You want to tell us? No.BLUMENTHAL: Not the crazy amount that we've been seeing, that it's -- we're joking. We got to talk to our board.BARTIROMO: Yes. Exactly. Gentleman, congratulations. A great story.BLUMENTHAL: Thank you so much.GILBOA: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Happy to hear. Thank you so much. Neil, David, thank you. Neil Blumenthal and David Gilboa. Coming up, China versus the NBA.

We're getting a sneak peek at the car month before anybody gets to drive it out of the showroom. We've got the car on the Fox Plaza and we're going to go down there momentarily.But first top, our story this half an hour, China versus the NBA. Commissioner Adam Silver saying that the league will not even consider China's call to fire the Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey over his Hong Kong tweet.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DARYL MOREY, COMMISSIONER, NBA: I didn't think at that time, while we were saying we were -- we regretted upsetting our fans, but also at the same time supporting Daryl Morey's right to express himself, right to tweet. Obviously, we made clear that we're being asked to fire him by the Chinese Government. We said there's no the chance that's happening.There's no chance we'll even discipline him. We want to make sure that everyone understood we were supporting free expression and also making clear that Chinese people, again, less about the government but our Chinese fans understood that create -- providing a platform for freedom of expression is different than adjudicating a particular point of view.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Silver added that the controversy is causing the league huge financial losses. Joining me right now us the editor of Barron's and host of Barron's roundtable on FOX Business, Jack Otter, along with the Wall Street Journal editor-at-large and host of He The Wall Street Journal At Large on FOX Business, Gerry Baker. Gentlemen, it's always a pleasure.JACK OTTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Great to be here. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Good to see you. So what's your reaction to all this coming out of the NBA? Gerry.GERRY BAKER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Well, you know, I mean Adam Silver is clearly trying to clean up what is a terrible mess that they've got themselves into. And as it happens, the Chinese call to fire Daryl Morey, of course, actually, in a funny way actually helps him because, you know, they got themselves into this mess by offering that terrible, terrible kind of lame semi apology after Daryl Morey issues his initial tweets expressing solidarity with the people of Hong Kong.The NBA came out as, you know, kind of almost sort of sounded like apologetic for it. They've been quite rightly lambasted for it. I mean LeBron James this week made matters even worse with him saying --BARTIROMO: But this one --BAKER: -- you know, that Daryl Morey needed more education. So actually, for the Chinese to oversee the call for Daryl Morey to be fired, I don't even know whether NBA can fire a General Manager of a team anyway, so they're getting some of sort of damage limitation here, but the damage to the NBA's reputation as well as to his financial position in China is terrible.BARTIROMO: I'm just -- I'm glad that Adam Silver pushed back because I feel too many companies are rolling over. Let's not forget what Xi Jinping said last month and that was about -- when talking about the Hong Kong protests, President Xi Jinping says, "Any attempts to cause division in China will end in crushed bodies and shattered bones," just so that we understand who we're -- who's on the other side of this trade deal.OTTER: So I would say that they got it wrong at first, but, you know, if you think about what the NBA is trying to do, they're a business, they are focused on the bottom line. This is their biggest growth market so when faced with this crisis in the heat of the moment, I think they made the wrong call. They wanted the side of money instead of morals or American values, whatever you want to call.I think in time, they improved that response, and as long as they stay with the same response, I'm happy about them.BAKER: I think -- I think what's so damaging, though, and so appalling frankly about the NBA is the hypocrisy. They don't stint from criticizing President Trump, making observations about American politics, saying things about, you know, Black Lives Matter, all this kind of stuff, all -- the players, the coaches. Steve Kerr's particularly vocal on all of these topics, but when it comes to China, a genuine human rights abuser which locks up tens of millions of its people, which is clamping down on any attempt to introduce Democracy anywhere around the world.It's like oh, we can't comment, we don't get involved in politics. It's so hypocritical. They're very happy to criticize the United States and everything it stands for, but as Jack says, because there's dollar signs involved, they don't want to say a word about a --BARTIROMO: Yes.BAKER: -- about a communist government like China.BARTIROMO: South Park has done a really good job on this, pushing back by the way. I really -- I admire what South Park is doing, and you're right, I mean, you know, the idea that companies have wanted their products in front of 1.4 billion people, you know, for so long, they forgot to protect their products.BAKER: Right.BARTIROMO: And China -- you know, so do you believe that we will see a deal between China and the U.S. then, Gerry?BAKER: I think it's very likely sometime next year. Look, I think the President really -- I mean it depends a little bit on the strength of the economy. If the economy remains very strong as it is now, I don't think there's -- the President will feel a pressing need.BARTIROMO: Yes.BAKER: But he's up for reelection next year. There's no question it's uncertainty about China, id depressing, you know, as good as the market has been, is putting a bit of a lid on the market and I think --BARTIROMO: All right. So uncertainty.BAKER: I think it will be a tremendous boost for him if -- for the market and ultimately for him and for his reelection prospects if you were able to get a deal in the next --BARTIROMO: So I know you both have fantastic shows tonight. Jack, you are talking about the streaming wars in Barron's this weekend.OTTER: Yes. Our cover story coming tonight, tomorrow morning on streaming. It is such a complicated world out there. The good news is that there's so much competition among content providers. I mean Netflix obviously was the leader, but now you got Pluto and Peacock and Disney+ coming out very soon.BARTIROMO: Yes.OTTER: So viewers can get content pretty cheap, the problem is it's not as easy as it used to be. You just don't go to your cable provided and get it all in. You've got to pick and choose among these. So you can get a deal but you're going to have to work out to get it, but and a lot of winners and losers in the stock market.BARTIROMO: So real quick, we got a big Friday night, all of us. This, tonight on Wall -- on "MARIA BARTIROMO WALL STREET," I will have Barry Diller, just stay tuned tonight for Fox Business special Friday night coverage kicking off with Wall Street 9:00 p.m. Eastern, followed by Wall Street Journal At Large. Gerry Baker, what you got coming up tonight, Gerry?BAKER: John Kasich, the former government of Ohio, who is a -- remains a - - I think it's fair to say, continues to have political ambition, so he's fallen out rather badly with the Republican Party with Donald Trump.BARTIROMO: He still wants to run for president?BAKER: Buddy -- I'm sure he wants to run for president. They -- what is it? John McCain famously said the only cure for presidential ambition is embalming fluid. And that certainly applies -- I suspect that applies to John Kasich.BARTIROMO: And then at 10:00, don't miss Barron's roundtable. Don't miss a moment of it. What do you got real quick?OTTER: The CEO of Waze and also Bill Nygren, a great value investors had some tough times, but he's going to come back.BARTIROMO: I'm glad you have the CEO of Waze. We had him a couple of weeks ago and --OTTER: He was good on your show, yes.BARTIROMO: -- it's such an interesting story.OTTER: Yes.BARTIROMO: Great. Guys, I'll see you tonight.BAKER: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Fox Business, don't miss our special coverage. First though, next up, Alec Baldwin is under fire again for defending recently jailed actress Felicity Huffman. Stuart Varney has a thing or two to say about that.Then the battle of the brews, Anheuser-Busch accusing rival MillerCoors of stealing its secret beer recipes, got all the details there. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. So Alec Baldwin is defending the recently jailed actress Felicity Huffman. Joining us now, the host of "VARNEY & CO." Stuart Varney to weigh in. Good morning, Stu.STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Maria -- good morning, Maria. Hold on a second. I want to put the Felicity Huffman argument on one side completely.BARTIROMO: OK.VARNEY: Just focus on this couple of lines from Alec Baldwin. Listen to this, "The demonization of wealth in this country is mind-blowing." This is Alec Baldwin.BARTIROMO: Wow.VARNEY: He says, "Now, all success is scrutinized merely to succeed, especially financially, invites scrutiny, judgment, abuse." This is Alec Baldwin who's making a very valid point about the nature of our political culture today. He's right, success is demonized. Success is attacked. Forget the Felicity Huffman angle for a second, what he's saying is absolutely accurate.I don't, for one moment, expect Hollywood to turn around and suddenly love President Trump and love capitalism and free markets, that's not going to happen. They're Trump haters and always will be, but he's come up with a moment of truth from, of all people, Alec Baldwin. How about that?BARTIROMO: Wow. You know, I ran into somebody the other day and it was an area where there was a lot of wealthy people and she said to me, Maria, please don't tell anybody. You know how I feel about Trump, but if it's Elizabeth Warren versus Donald Trump, I'll have to vote for Donald Trump.VARNEY: Yes. Great. Great. Great.BARTIROMO: I wonder what Alec Baldwin would do.VARNEY: I wonder. I wonder. Oh, before we go, I'm very jealous of your Bentley that you've got parked outside.BARTIROMO: Oh, yes. Well, you'll have to come and visit. I'm going to go check out the wheels in a second, Stu.VARNEY: You got it.BARTIROMO: I'll see you in 10 minutes.VARNEY: You will.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Reminder, "VARNEY & CO." begins top of the hour 9:00 a.m. Eastern. Join Stuart. He's got a big show this morning. But first, the battle over beer, Anheuser-Busch accusing Molson Coors of stealing its recipe. Gerri Willis on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange looking at those stocks. Gerri.GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey, that's right, Maria. So these stocks' kind of flat, the beer stock's flat, not bubbly this morning after Anheuser-Busch accusing Molson of stealing its beer secrets in a lawsuit. This all started last year when Molson sued Anheuser, arguing that their ad falsely suggested that Miller Lite and Coors Light contain corn syrup, ouch.Now Anheuser claims that a Miller Coors employee obtained the secret recipe for a Bud Light from an Anheuser-Bush employee. Lots going on there. Snap shares higher this morning. Bank of America raising their rating to buy from neutral and the price target, 218, this is largely on -- better news on the ad spend front.And AT&T in talks with activist investor Elliott Management. This is going to happen more quickly than you might anticipate under discussion, a selloff of assets, improvement of margins, and maybe changes to the board. Guys, back to you.MCDOWELL: Gerri, thank you so much for that. Gerri Willis of the New York Stock Exchange. Still ahead, start your engines, MORNINGS WITH MARIA takes a live look at Bentley's all-new Flying Spur right here live on the Fox Plaza coming up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Sports Sedan meets luxury limousine Bentley. Introducing the all-new 2020 Flying Spur, delivering agility, modern refinement, and all-wheel steering, a first for Bentley.

So let's start with the design very quickly.BARTIROMO: OK. The design. Yes.GEORGES: So you can see the proportion of the car creating such a stronger presence, exquisite presence on the road.BARTIROMO: Yes.GEORGES: We have pushed the front wheel accent by five inches.BARTIROMO: Wow.GEORGES: There's a very short overhang which gives distance on the -- on the road. And the lines are very sharp and precise, and this can only be achieved with our new technology, which is called Superform Aluminium.BARTIROMO: Fantastic. OK.GEORGES: So this is a (INAUDIBLE) and most exquisite line you have in the industry.BARTIROMO: Certainly.GEORGES: It's not (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: Let's look -- shall we look inside?GEORGES: OK.BARTIROMO: OK, Christophe. Do you want to -- I'll go -- I'll go around and let me get in the driver's seat.GEORGES: Yes. Yes.BARTIROMO: Tell me about this car inside, Christophe. Wow, gorgeous. Look at this.GEORGES: So now you (INAUDIBLE) if I can steal this headline was that speed has never felt so good.BARTIROMO: Yes.GEORGES: I know you can understand it. Just few word about the speed, this is the fastest sedan in the world.BARTIROMO: How fast does this go?GEORGES: Two hundred and seven miles an hour, so it's even faster than most--BARTIROMO: Two hundred and seven miles an hour? Wow.GEORGES: Yes, even faster than most of the super cars.BARTIROMO: Yes. OK.GEORGES: But it is achievable speed because of all technological we have in the car. So before I go into detail of the interior, which is absolutely exquisite, let's give -- let me give you some example of what --BARTIROMO: Yes, tell me. I'm taking this picture for my followers so that they could see this. They're going to want to see the inside.GEORGES: Of the technology, so --BARTIROMO: Getting this shot, right? Yes, go ahead.GEORGES: Yes. In terms of usable speed, we have technology like Active Wheel drive that are -- from the -- from the -- from the rear to the front according to road conditions.BARTIROMO: Right.GEORGES: We have rear wheel steering (INAUDIBLE) turn much quicker in the -- in the corner and much better as well as torque -- active torque distribution.BARTIROMO: OK. Yes.GEORGES: So when you brake --BARTIROMO: Wait --GEORGES: This is kind of cool, while the rear inside wheel is braking, which makes the car turn faster.BARTIROMO: Amazing. This is really --GEORGES: And it --BARTIROMO: Now I want to look at the backseat before we have to go, Christophe.GEORGES: So let's -- oh, yes.BARTIROMO: Real quick because you said --GEORGES: So very quick --BARTIROMO: -- that there are real special things in the backseat.GEORGES: When you look at all (INAUDIBLE) in the car, the door panel, this is the first time --BARTIROMO: Nice.GEORGES: -- we use a 3D wood. So if you look at the door panel.BARTIROMO: OK. Gorgeous.GEORGES: (INAUDIBLE) 3D wood.BARTIROMO: And you've got these T.V. screens so you can basically do all your work from right here.GEORGES: Yes, you can enjoy driving, you can be sitting in the back and working.BARTIROMO: Yes.GEORGES: But look at all the details --BARTIROMO: Christophe, how much is this car right now?GEORGES: 214,600 to be precise.BARTIROMO: OK.

'South Park' Escalates Criticism of Chinese Government in Latest EpisodeStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeOctober 12, 2019 SaturdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: CULTURE; Pg. 1Length: 464 wordsByline: Julia GonzalesBodyLast week's South Park criticized the Chinese government for censorship and mocked Hollywood's acquiescence to the nation, which got the show banned in China but led to it being screened on the streets of Hong Kong.The episode is also rife with criticism of Hollywood, depicting Randy Marsh on a plane full of Marvel characters owned by Disney. In a work camp, he meets Winnie the Pooh, who, the show explains, was banned after Chinese social media users pointed out his resemblance to Mr. Xi. Comparing the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, Xi Jinping to a certain beloved honey-loving Disney character and calling out the National Basketball Association for their compliance to Chinese censorship, the mock apology certainly delivered hard hitting subtle jabs. Pooh Bear, first seen in a Chinese prison, is assassinated later in the episode by Randy Marsh at the behest of China, after a student makes the comparison.Eventually the boys tire of the ordeal."They have tried to do it in such a way that they can make as much money as possible by having access to the China market, but not become so embarrassed by the backlash at home", said Stanley Rosen, a political science professor at the University of Southern California. Movie studios, especially, have worked to ensure that their scripts aren't at odds with state censors, lest they lose billions in potential business.Nike 'Jesus Shoes' filled with holy water sell for $3KThe brand recently released a customized Nike Air Max 97 shoe that has holy water built into the soles, according to Cosmopolitan. A shoe company says you can walk on water in their sneakers, and they aren't technically wrong.China has banned Western entertainment in the past. Moviegoers in China bought an estimated $8.87 billion in movie tickets past year, according to box office analysts. And while information onSouth Park was still available on a few video streaming sites, episodes could not be played.The statement mocked the NBA's apology to China after the Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted on Friday (and then deleted) an image with the slogan "Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong" in solidarity with the Hong Kong protesters. The league has spent the better part of this week trying to mend fences with its partners in China while at the sam time claiming that it supported the free speech rights of its owners and players, a position that has seemingly satisfied nobody. "It's not worth living in a world where China controls my country's art", he added. One of subplots of the the new scene, titled "SHOTS!", spun around the expression, "Screw the Chinese government".The tweet that set off the alleged ban was a "South Park" post about its 300th episode. Long live the great Communist Party of China'.Load-Date: October 14, 2019End of Document

China's Higher-Ed Ambitions Are at Odds With Its Tightening Grip on Academic FreedomThe Chronicle of Higher Education September 24, 2019  TuesdayCopyright 2019 The Chronicle of Higher Education All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL; NewsLength: 1822 wordsByline: Karin FischerBodyABSTRACTA new report by Scholars at Risk details tactics to silence and intimidate students and professors, as well as a climate of surveillance and self-censorship.FULL TEXTEven as China seeks to elevate its universities to among the world's best, its Communist government has asserted ever-tightening control of higher education, imposing a more ideological curriculum, cracking down on dissident students and scholars, and trampling on academic freedom.A new report from the Scholars at Risk Network, an international group that protects scholars and supports academic freedom worldwide, depicts the contradiction between China's global aspirations and its rising authoritarianism. "While China continues to stoke its ambitions for developing more world-class universities," the authors write, "respect for academic freedom and other human rights essential to quality higher education lags behind, leaving scholars and students at risk, and the country's goals in the balance."Recent attention has focused on the impact of Chinese nationalism on American and other Western universities, with warnings of academic espionage and Chinese spies, and the report examines those pressures on institutions and individuals working in China and with Chinese partners. But it also shines a light on the effect of threats to academic freedom on Chinese higher education itself, detailing tactics to silence and intimidate students and professors and a climate of surveillance and self-censorship.Over the past 70 years of Communist Party control, Chinese higher education has gone through cycles of engagement and openness followed by periods of repression and more-assertive government control: The shuttering of universities during the Cultural Revolution was followed by great investment in science and research in the 1970s and '80s; after the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown came a boom in Chinese students studying overseas.However, many China experts see the period covered by Scholars at Risk - from late 2012, when President Xi Jinping took office, through the present day - as different, a new normal. "I don't see this as part of a cycle," said Andrew J. Nathan, a professor of Chinese politics at Columbia University. "This feels long term, and we're at risk of it undermining Chinese scholarship."Just months after Xi came to power, a government directive barred the discussion of seven controversial subjects from college classrooms, including press freedom, judicial independence, and the historic mistakes of the Communist Party. To ensure that professors and students toed the line, authorities increased classroom surveillance through high-tech methods like closed-circuit cameras and low-tech means like student informants. The Scholars at Risk report quotes a professor who was about to make a sensitive comment and stopped short. "I have to be careful because I don't want to cause trouble," he said, and pointed at a classroom camera.While many lecturers may have self-censored, the report details a number of cases in which professors were reprimanded or even fired for expressing controversial views, in and out of the classroom. Zhao Si-yun, deputy head of the School of Literature at the Zhejiang University of Media and Communications, was disciplined for remarks he made at a freshman-welcoming ceremony in 2018, in which he criticized the Chinese school system for failing to nurture students' creativity and innovation. This year, Tsinghua University suspended Xu Zhangrun, an internationally prominent constitutional-law scholar, for a series of essays he published that were critical of Communist Party leadership.When Peking University fired Xia Yeliang as an economics professor, officials said it was for poor teaching, but emails later suggested that he had been dismissed because of his political activism. Now, said Xia, who was fired in 2013, "they just come out and say that you're teaching bad ideas."The report notes that academics who are members of China's ethnic minority groups may be especially vulnerable. Rahile Dawut, an ethnographer and professor at Xinjiang University, went missing in December 2017 and is thought to be in a re-education camp for Uighurs, a Muslim minority. Ilham Tohti, a writer and economist, is serving a life sentence in prison after advocating for the Uighurs' peaceful resistance to Chinese policies.Expressing political views can also land students in hot water. Student activists campaigning for better labor conditions for factory workers, for example, were arrested, and the police confiscated their phones and computers.To control the spread of potentially sensitive ideas, the government has barred publications by certain scholars in China and even sought to censor foreign academic publishers. Several publishers, including Cambridge University Press and Springer Nature, blocked access within China to hundreds of journal articles at the government's request. (Cambridge later lifted the restrictions.)Even as the Chinese government has sought to suppress certain subjects, it has elevated others. Some 40 universities now host centers on Xi Jinping Thought, the report says, and there are government grants available for research related to the political doctrine espoused by the Chinese president. Teng Biao, a legal scholar, told Scholars at Risk researchers that some academics may be "neglecting or declining" to take on projects on other, touchier topics. "Scholars know there are taboos that should not be touched," Teng said, "and this is why the academic quality" of research is so low.Because higher education is seen as furthering nationalistic aims, even Chinese academics who don't engage in sensitive research can feel caught in the middle, said Yangyang Cheng, a postdoctoral researcher at Cornell University and a frequent writer on science and her native China. "Scientists as a profession are not supposed to pledge allegiance to the state," Cheng said. "We are not soldiers. Our work is not dictated by our ethnicity or our citizenship."The government actions don't just affect Chinese students and scholars, the report notes. Travel and visa restrictions have prevented Chinese academics from leaving the country and foreign researchers from visiting. (The U.S. government has also tightened visa rules for students and researchers from China.) Chinese universities have become less willing to sponsor international scholars doing research in areas deemed sensitive, and so those who want to do on-the-ground work may avoid such subjects.Academics who do go to China may find their access to certain research limited. A survey of 500 scholars who study China found that one in four had been denied access to archival material in the past decade.If the current environment has affected the decisions of individual researchers, by and large, it has so far not had an impact on the partnerships American and other foreign universities have at the institutional level in China. There are more than 1,000 Sino-foreign educational partnerships at the undergraduate level, including nine full joint-venture campuses. Scholars at Risk, however, identifies a handful of instances in which foreign universities have reconsidered plans or terminated existing programs in China.Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, for example, canceled two exchange programs with Renmin University last year after reports that the Chinese institution had punished student activists. In 2016 the University of Notre Dame abandoned plans to open a joint liberal-arts college with Zhejiang University. And the University of Groningen, in the Netherlands, called off plans for a China campus just two months after the project was announced, in the fall of 2017. Students and faculty members at the Dutch university had protested Chinese restrictions on academic freedom.The long arm of the Chinese government extends beyond national borders. The report documents incidents when, through formal government intervention or informal student protest, China has sought to silence unfavorable opinions on foreign campuses. In 2017 the Chinese-student association at the University of California at San Diego protested the decision to invite the Dalai Lama to be the commencement speaker. Though the university went ahead with the speech, the Chinese government later canceled state-funded academic exchanges with UCSD. More recently, Chinese students at McMaster University, in Canada, disrupted a lecture by a Uighur activist, allegedly after consulting with the Chinese Embassy.Chinese students and scholars studying and working abroad may also be subject to restrictions on critical speech. The Scholars at Risk report includes the story of a Chinese student at an American university who was detained by security officials when she returned home after graduation. The officials seemed aware of email and social-media accounts she had used anonymously to post critical views, leading the student to suspect her friends were informing on her.Is the evidence cataloged by Scholars at Risk an argument that American colleges should disengage from China? Not so, said Robert Quinn, the group's founder and executive director. "We need to expand beyond the false binary of stay or go."Instead, the report offers a series of recommendations for academics, foreign universities, and others who work in China or with Chinese students and scholars. (It also includes recommendations for those in China.) Among them: advocate for the academic freedom of Chinese students and researchers, both in China and abroad; ensure that partnerships with Chinese universities include safeguards for academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and other core educational values; and demand that academic freedom be factored in to international higher-education rankings."To be a world-class university, you have got to have the widest notion of academic freedom," Quinn said. "I don't think that should be debatable."Even as the Chinese government seeks to limit dissent in academe, it has invested in its universities, increased international engagement, and tried to burnish the reputation of its higher-education system. Its universities, as the report notes, are "both a point of national pride and an essential element of China's continuing development and international competitiveness."Could the muffling of critical thought hamper those ambitions? Not so far. In the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, released this month, Tsinghua and Peking ranked Nos. 23 and No. 24.Clarification (9/24/2019, 1:50 p.m.): Yangyang Cheng was identified as a researcher at Fermilab; she is based at Fermilab but is a postdoctoral researcher for Cornell.

I researched Uighur society in China for 8 years and watched how technology opened new opportunities - then became a trapThe Conversation - United StatesSeptember 18, 2019 Wednesday 12:35 PM ESTCopyright 2019 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights ReservedLength: 1552 wordsByline: Darren Byler, Lecturer in Anthropology, University of WashingtonHighlight: An anthropologist who interviewed Uighurs in China found different ways in which Chinese authorities used checkpoints, social media and smartphones to identify, categorize and control this group.BodyThe Uighurs, a Muslim minority ethnic group of around 12 million in northwest China, are            required by the police to carry their smartphones and IDs listing their ethnicity.As they pass through one of the thousands of newly built digital media and face surveillance checkpoints located at jurisdictional boundaries, entrances to religious spaces and transportation hubs, the image on their ID is matched to their face.If they try to pass without these items, a digital device scanner alerts the police. But even complying with the rules won't necessarily keep them out of trouble. During random spot-checks the police at times demand that an individual hands over their unlocked phone which the police then examine manually or plug into a scanner.  I did ethnographic research with Han and Uighur migrants for more than 24 months between 2011 and 2018 in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, in northwest China. During this period, I was affiliated with the Xinjiang Arts Institute. My position allowed me to interview            hundreds of Han and Uighur people.  I read and speak both Uighur and Chinese so I was able to communicate with people in their own language.When I first began my research in the region, smartphone use was not that tightly controlled by the police. But by 2018 it had became common knowledge among my Uighur interviewees that if they did not carry their phone with them or failed to produce it they could be detained. The Uighur internetThe Uighur majority areas on the border of Central Asia only became a fully integrated part of China in the 2000s. They were effectively colonized when millions of non-Muslim Han settlers            moved into their community in the 1990s and 2000s to extract natural resources such as oil and natural gas. Earlier they lived much more autonomously in desert oasis towns and villages much like the Uzbeks in Uzbekistan, a group that shares a similar history and language as the Uighurs.In 2011, the Chinese government built 3-G networks in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.  Cheap            smartphones soon became available in local markets of this region and Uighurs            began to use the new social media app WeChat.WeChat, which is owned by the Chinese company Tencent, was put into general use across the whole country in 2012 after Facebook and Twitter            were banned in 2009.  Smartphones became a common feature of daily life for millions of Uighur villagers. At the time, the way Uighurs used them was unique. In other parts of China, the Chinese language was used in social media communication. Uighur uses Arabic script - radically different from the character based Chinese - and acted as a form of coded speech that state censors couldn't understand.When I began my research project,  I was interested in the way online culture produced forms of Islamic, Chinese and Western identity and the way it brought people of different ethnicities together.I found that Uighurs used smartphones differently than other internet users. On traditional internet sites that required text-based communication, Uighur web users faced tighter forms of censorship  since state authorities viewed them as potential terrorists. They were viewed this way since Uighurs had long protested the way their            briefly independent nation had been            subsumed by China and their religious practices were restricted,            lashing out violently at times. Using WeChat on smartphones gave Uighurs the ability to circulate short audio messages, videos and images. Beginning in 2012 this allowed Uighurs to develop semi-autonomous forums in Uighur spoken language. Initially Chinese state authorities did not have the technical capabilities to monitor and control Uighur oral speech or Uighur text embedded in images as memes. They could turn the Uighur internet on and off, but they could not fully regulate what Uighurs said because they spoke in another language.   Based on hundreds of interviews and my own observations Uighurs            used these forums           to discuss cultural knowledge, political events and economic opportunities outside their local communities. Over the course of only a few years, online Islamic teachers based in the region and elsewhere in the Islamic world, in places like Turkey and Uzbekistan, became influential throughout Uighur social media. Their messages focused primarily on Islamic piety. They described what types of practices were halal, and how people should dress and pray. According to scholars Rachel Harris and            Aziz Isa the vast majority of those who began to study            Islam by smartphone were simply interested in instruction on what it might mean to be a contemporary Muslim, something they felt was lacking in government-censored state-run mosques.  The Uighur internet as a space of surveillanceBut Chinese state authorities interpreted it differently.They regarded the Islamic appearance and practice of Uighurs, such as young men growing beards and praying five times per day, as signs of what state authorities described as the "           extremification" of the Uighur population. They began to link violent incidents, such as a suicide attack  in the city of Kunming in Eastern China, to what government officials told me was the "           Talibanization" of the Uighurs.In response to this Chinese authorities declared what they called a "People's War On Terror." They began to use            techniques of counterinsurgency, a mode of military engagement that stresses            mass intelligence gathering, to assess the Uighur population.As part of this process, in 2016, they began to collect biometric data, such as DNA, high-fidelity voice recordings and face scans, from the entire population of the region            in order to track the activities of people on WeChat and in their daily lives using their voice signature and faceprint.They also began a process of interviewing millions of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities to determine who could be categorized as            trustworthy or "normal" as stated on official population assessment forms.  In order to determine this, state authorities            mapped out the person's social network and history of Islamic practice, both in their local community and online.Since the total Muslim population of the region, including other Muslim groups such as the Kazakhs, Hui, Kyrgyz, Tajiks and others, is around 15 million, these assessments and activity checkpoints required the deployment of more than 90,000 police officers and            more than 1.1 million civil servants.The majority of the security forces are of Han ethnicity. Han people are settlers in the Uighur region. They are not Muslim, they do not speak Uighur, and many of my Han interviewees described the Uighur culture as "backward," "primitive," or even "dangerous."In order to aid in this assessment process, state authorities also contracted with Chinese private technology firms to develop software programs and hardware that could comb through the images, videos and speech recordings in the WeChat histories of a targeted person in a matter of seconds.The Uighur internet as a trapThrough this process around 1.5 million Uighurs and other Muslims were determined "untrustworthy" and scheduled for detention and reeducation in a massive internment camp system.  Government procurement records show that the camp facilities have "no blank spots" outside the vision of surveillance cameras and that the camp workers are often armed with            tasers and other weapons.In the prison-like camps the detainees were held in crowded dormitory cells where they studied Chinese, learned the political thought of Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of China's ruling political party and confessed their past crimes. In many cases, these crimes were            related to their internet use. Since more than 10% of the adult population has been removed to these camps, hundreds of thousands of children have been separated from one or more of their parents. Many children throughout the region are now held in boarding schools or orphanages which are run by non-Muslim state workers.Erasing identityToday the Uighur internet has begun to merge with the Chinese internet. Uighurs are discouraged from writing or speaking in Uighur or            celebrating Uighur culture. Instead Uighurs often post statements written in Chinese attesting to their loyalty to the Chinese state.As my research shows, the Uighur internet has been transformed from a space that fostered a cultural flourishing for Uighurs into a space that controls many aspects of their lives. In the past, it was a place where Uighurs published short films,            poetry,            art and            music.  They            critiqued police brutality and defended the            social mores of Uighur society against conspicuous consumption and economic corruption.During my last trip to the region in 2018, my Uighur interlocutors told me  that the Uighur internet had become a "trap," or a "qapqan" that they cannot escape.[ Expertise in your inbox.

Are LeBron, NBA right to bow to China?USA TODAYOctober 16, 2019 WednesdayA CHASE EDITIONCopyright 2019 Gannett Company, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: SPORTS; Pg. 2CLength: 1263 wordsByline: Brent Schrotenboer, USA TODAYBodyThe Chinese government won't put up with this sort of thing. And LeBron James darn well knows it.The NBA star suggested Monday it's better to just shut up and keep your head down than risk offending the rulers of China. Even a seven-word message on Twitter from an NBA general manager can get under their skin, as James and the NBA learned last week."So many people could have been harmed, not only physically or financially, but emotionally and spiritually," James told reporters Monday. "Just be careful what we tweet, what we say and what we do. We do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative things that come with that too."Such fear has revealed a mini-clash of civilizations in an increasingly globalized world, all started by a tweet and driven by a fundamental question about political power: Why would the world's most populous country - an economic superpower - get this offended about a since-deleted message posted on social media by a single U.S. sports administrator who isn't even familiar to most American sports fans?After all, millions of Americans see revolting messages on social media every day. They deal with it and move on. By contrast, nuclear-armed China practically threatened to shut down the NBA's business there after Rockets general manager Daryl Morey temporarily posted an image on Twitter Oct. 4 that said, "Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong."Is that  all it takes to hurt the feelings of the ruling Communist Party in China?Yes, experts say, that's really all it takes. That's also why they suggest this issue won't be forgotten by China and is bound to flare up again. The bigger question is what happens the next time China gets bothered by something else."The paradox is that the Chinese leaders, with all their power in the world and control at home, are deadly frightened that their regime might topple," said Stein Ringen, a Norwegian political scientist and author of "The Perfect Dictatorship: China in the 21st Century." "These men, who seem so assured, do not sleep at peace at night. As a result, they react with brutality against any slight."When the next slight comes, experts say China will expect the offender to fall in line with the usual response. At a minimum, that means an apology and muting of any message that  remotely challenges the power of the authoritarian regime or its "sovereignty."In the case of the NBA, Commissioner Adam Silver said last week the league was "not apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of expression" but said he regretted that people got upset over his tweet. The NBA also shut up about Hong Kong, where protesters have been fighting for democracy and autonomy apart from mainland China and its one-party government in Beijing.Even James, outspoken about domestic politics, apparently would rather side with China against Morey than risk billions of dollars in business in China with media, apparel and other deals, including an estimated $500 million in annual NBA revenue from China.China's warning shotJames said Morey was "misinformed" or not properly educated about the potential consequences of his tweet before he posted it. James said: "We all do have freedom of speech but at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you're not thinking about others, and you're only thinking about yourself."Those ramifications all but crushed James and NBA during their  tour there last week. State TV in China blacked out NBA games. NBA advertising in China was torn down or removed. NBA news conferences in China were canceled.On the other side of the geopolitical divide, the league  got bombarded with criticism  for not more strongly supporting freedom of speech against China.Yet the NBA still seemed somewhat brave compared to the many other U.S. companies that have faced the same choice between making money in China or sticking up for American values. One side often wins that battle, even when the whims of Beijing seem increasingly less reasonable.Clothing retailer The Gap last year apologized for selling a T-shirt of a Chinese map that didn't include the island of Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy that China still claims as its territory. The Gap said it would destroy the shirts in China and said it mistakenly failed to reflect the "correct map" of China."If the Chinese leadership can pressure companies to play by Beijing's script, it will do so," said Margaret Lewis, a Seton Hall law professor whose research focuses on law, criminal justice reform and human rights in China. "It's worked."Though the NBA has billions at stake in China, its global brand and beloved celebrity players also give it lots of leverage - much more so than, say, The Gap. James and the Lakers still attracted a sellout crowd in China for a preseason game last week."Given the high popularity of NBA in China, perhaps over time this conflict could soften," said Maria Repnikova, an assistant professor at Georgia State and author of the book "Media Politics in China: Improvising Power under Authoritarianism."The key words are "this conflict."Repnikova notes that Morey's tweet came at a particularly sensitive time in U.S.-China relations. Besides the conflict in Hong Kong, China is engaged in a trade war with the U.S. that's led to global economic anxiety. Against that backdrop, Repnikova told USA TODAY Sports that China's reaction to the tweet can be viewed as a warning shot to others - a "signaling mechanism for other U.S. companies and entities to practice more caution in discussing China's politically sensitive issues publicly."In that regard, China's reaction succeeded, for now.'It's not their habit to back down'That's because this is what happens when companies from a country that values democracy and freedom of speech try to make money in another country that considers such values to be threatening to its very existence. They try to toe the line, even if the line isn't clear.Government officials in China recently have tried to crack down on foreign names on buildings,  suggesting such names aren't appropriate because they hurt the nation's feelings."This happens all of the time within China itself," said Carl Minzner, an expert on Chinese governance at Fordham and author of the book "End of An Era: How China's Authoritarian Revival is Undermining its Rise." "Domestic (Chinese) firms and international companies are perpetually altering their self-depictions to correspond with tacit or direct political signals. This is just part of being in an authoritarian one-Party state which doesn't have a free press, has been pushing a strongly nationalist line among the public for decades, and in which lower-level bureaucrats are always worried about making a misstep that might cause them to fall out of favor with their superiors."Minzner said this has gotten worse in China, devolving into a more closed, nativist autocracy under  President Xi Jinping. This suggests that American companies there will be expected to continue to bend  even more away from the direction of democracy. But their choice isn't necessarily binary between following orders from Beijing or not doing business in China at all, Lewis said."This is the lightning rod right now," Lewis told USA TODAY Sports. "This hits any American or foreign company involved with China. There needs to be deep think about a company's values: what they stand for and what compromises they are willing to make in order to have market access."Some kind of trade-off still will be required.  The question is how big."It's not their habit to back down," Ringen said. Load-Date: October 17, 2019End of Document

Bipartisan Members Condemn Activision Blizzard and Apple Actions to Enforce Chinese Government CensorshipTargeted News ServiceOctober 18, 2019 Friday 8:01 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 359 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, issued the following news release:* * *- Senate and House Coalition Warns U.S. Companies to Resist Pressure to Suppress Criticism of Authoritarian Governments* * *A bipartisan coalition of Senate and House members today condemned Activision Blizzard and Apple's recent actions to suppress criticism of the Chinese government in hopes of gaining higher profits.Apple recently removed the HKMap mapping app, which was widely used by peaceful Hong Kong protestors, from the App Store, at the request of the Chinese government, and has censored at least 2,200 apps in China according to the nonprofit group GreatFire.Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Sen. Maro Rubio, R-Fla., Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas along with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wisc., and Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J., condemned the moves, in a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook."You have said publicly that you want to work with China's leaders to effect change rather than sit on the sidelines and yell at them. We, too, believe that diplomacy and trade can be democratizing forces. But when a repressive government refuses to evolve or, indeed, when it doubles down, cooperation can become complicity," the members wrote.Bipartisan members also called on Activision Blizzard to reverse its decisions to ban players who have voiced support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, particularly its ban on Mr. Ng Wai Chung.Wyden, Rubio, Ocasio-Cortez, Gallagher and Malinowski wrote to Activision Blizzard CEO Robert Kotick today."As China amplifies its campaign of intimidation, you and your company must decide whether to look beyond the bottom line and promote American values--like freedom of speech and thought--or to give in to Beijing's demands in order to preserve market access. We urge you in the strongest terms to reconsider your decision with respect to Mr. Chung," the members wrote.Both letters follow on a bipartisan letter organized by Rep. Malinowski, which called on the NBA to resist Chinese efforts to censor American support for the Hong Kong Protests.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6896976 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: October 19, 2019End of Document

China has a vice grip on American entertainment. It's a bad look.The Seahawk: University of North Carolina WilmingtonOctober 19, 2019 SaturdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 980 wordsByline: Darius MeltonBodyChina has been in international headlines for months now, as the riots in Hong Kong have made waves around the world. Those waves are now clearly present in American entertainment, and the implications are worrisome, to say the least.The NBA has been at the forefront of Chinese controversy in recent weeks, as on Oct. 4, 2019, Daryl Morey, general manager for the Houston Rockets, tweeted out the words "Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong."Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times/TNS Hong Kong police officers in riot gear raise warning flags as they use tear gas to disperse demonstrators, gathering in defiance of the upcoming China's national day, in Causeway Bay area of Hong Kong, on Sept. 29, 2019.This simple tweet virtually set the entire NBA on fire, as athletes and behind-the-scenes businessmen alike scrambled to distance themselves from Morey's declaration. Morey himself quickly deleted the tweet and sent out a series of apologies, but it was too late to undo what was done.China was furious.NBA G League games scheduled to take place in China later in October were canceled. Nike pulled all Houston Rockets merchandise from their Chinese webstore. ESPN insider Adrian Wojnarowski's Chinese basketball show, Woj in the House, was canceled by Chinese sports-broadcaster Tencent after he liked Morey's original tweet. Houston Rockets star James Harden issued a hasty apology in light of their general manager's tweet, saying, "We love China... We love everything they're about."Even when the NBA put out a press release of their own, siding with China while giving half-hearted support for free speech, Chinese blog site Weibo altered the apology via translation to say that the NBA was "extremely disappointed" by Morey's "inappropriate" comment.This would not be the only time that China altered information on the internet to keep its people in line. Earlier this month, Comedy Central series South Park was banned in China after an episode in which Randy Marsh was sent to a reeducation camp for selling drugs in China.Feeling the episode poorly represented China, the government retaliated by not only banning South Park episodes and clips, but also scrubbing the internet of any discussion of the show. South Park now finds itself in the same boat as Winnie the Pooh, a property also banned in China in 2017 after the spread of an internet meme in which Chinese citizens said that the titular bear resembled president Xi Jinping.Even those not living in China caught fire for associating themselves with South Park, as German-Russian music producer Zedd was "permanently banned" from China after liking a tweet celebrating the show's 300th episode-one which had nothing to do with China.The idea that someone can be punished and have already-scheduled shows canceled for liking a tweet is ridiculous. Between Zedd, Daryl Morey, and the entire saga of competitive Hearthstone player "Blitzchung," it seems that Lebron James had a point when he said that "we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too"-even though James, unfortunately, said this in an attempt to denounce Morey's actions.It is there with Lebron James' statement that we get to the real problem on our end: America is not standing up for democracy. In fact, it appears most of the faces of this country are either keeping quiet or scrambling to appease the Chinese government.Donny Donadio, a UNC Wilmington senior who was born in Shantou, a city in the Guangdong province of China, spoke with The Seahawk about what may come next after this current controversy."What I think is going to evolve from this isn't that international companies are going to disengage from China. I just think that these companies are going to try to get better at working in China," Donadio said.Speaking of reeducation camps in the South Park episode, Donadio noted that they are still in use to this day in the Xinjiang territory to control the Muslim Uyghur population. Donadio also drew parallels between Hong Kong and Tibet, a country where people still set themselves on fire to protest Chinese rule."...China has gotten so powerful economically that China is in this position where it's like, 'Oh, you don't like the way we run Tibet? Well, do you still want to do business with us?' That shuts a lot of countries up," Donadio said.Whenever the choice is between money and human rights, America-despite the constant pride and insistence that we are pro-freedom-will often opt for the money route. China is huge for America's economy, giving their country not only a reprieve from the critical eye, but also the service of people like Lebron James and Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta who will defend them when China does something that goes against the very values of our nation.Artyom Ivanov/Tass/Abaca Press/TNS From left, China's President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump shake hands on November 9, 2017, during a meeting outside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.Hong Kong is fighting to keep its autonomy and its democracy, and if they are looking to function well in that system, they are going to be looking at the Western world as an example-hence why their signs are written in English.They are hoping to be seen and be helped, but when the loudest voices in America side with China, it has to be demotivating. A victory for Hong Kong is a victory for democracy, and is that not what America wants?I am fully aware that there would be huge economic ramifications if America were to dump China, which is why I cannot fully endorse it until I know someone with power has a plan-but a plan is worth looking into.We need to do a value check as a nation, because regardless of money, allowing Hong Kong to lose this fight for democracy is absolutely un-American.• autonomy• Blitzchung• China• Daryl Morey• democracy• Hong Kong riots• NBA• South Park• ZeddLoad-Date: October 19, 2019End of Document

The NBA is feeling China's wrath. Here's what other businesses can learnCNN.comOctober 8, 2019 Tuesday 10:07 AM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: PERSPECTIVESLength: 653 wordsByline: By Phil Taylor for CNN Business PerspectivesBodyIt is not exactly news that in order to tap into certain international markets, US businesses often choose to turn a blind eye to the policies of foreign governments that are not in line with American values. US companies tend to choose profits over ideals.The National Basketball Association was doing exactly that in China, where it has profited from the burgeoning Asian interest in professional basketball to the tune of $4 billion while ignoring the Communist government's human rights issues. But the dynamics of the NBA-China business partnership changed last Sunday, when Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for Hong Kong protestors."Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong," Morey tweeted, triggering backlash from the Chinese government.Within hours Morey's boss, Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta, responded:That didn't stop Tencent, which has a five-year streaming deal with the NBA in China worth $1.5 billion, from announcing that it would not air Rockets games until further notice. Chinese online stores pulled Rockets merchandise from their websites, and the Chinese Basketball Association, headed by national icon and former Rockets star Yao Ming, announced it was suspending cooperation with the team.Other American businesses with foreign interests are undoubtedly watching the NBA's difficulties with interest, realizing that doing business with an authoritative regime can be like walking through a minefield. Taking issue with the policies of such a government, even in a relatively innocuous way like Morey's tweet, can have severe financial repercussions. The Rockets' GM, after all, is hardly an internationally well-known figure, and his stance on the Hong Kong protests would not have done any real damage to the Chinese government. If China reacted so strongly to Morey's comment, imagine the wrath LeBron James or one of the NBA's other world-famous players would have received if they had expressed support for the protestors.The NBA isn't the first company to run afoul of China. Versace and Gap have also apologized in recent months over products that inadvertently questioned Chinese sovereignty. But other companies haven't fostered as much of a reputation for speaking out on social issues and standing up for human rights as the NBA has.This is a league that forced Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling to sell his team five years ago after several of his racist comments came to light. James and other NBA stars have spoken out about criminal injustice reform and the NFL's treatment of Colin Kaepernick. Coaches Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich have made their feelings known about US immigration policy and gun regulation. The league has been praised for its willingness to allow players and coaches to take political stances without fear of being silenced by Silver or team owners.It's that reputation that has made the China situation more complicated for the NBA. How does the league walk the fine line between not offending a major partner and allowing its employees the freedom to express themselves publicly? The answer so far has been -- awkwardly.After the Rockets distanced themselves from Morey's tweet, he deleted it and apologized. NBA commissioner Adam Silver released what amounted to an apology, but specified that the league would not discipline Morey. After media criticism alleged Silver was capitulating to China, he issued a statement on Tuesday that defended Morey more strongly.Other companies who do business in China may have to bend over backwards to avoid offending the Chinese, but they don't have to then twist themselves into a pretzel trying to reconcile that position with their public stance on freedom of expression and social justice. Tapping into the Chinese market requires a certain selling of the corporate soul, but other US businesses are surely grateful that their decision to do so isn't quite as glaring as the NBA's.Load-Date: October 10, 2019End of Document

US citizen accused of spying on behalf of Chinese governmentAssociated Press InternationalOctober 1, 2019 Tuesday 00:20 GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: DOMESTIC NEWSLength: 815 wordsByline: By JANIE HAR and JOCELYN GECKER, Associated PressDateline: SAN FRANCISCO BodySAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A California tour operator charged by U.S. officials with illegally ferrying information to China was a quiet and friendly man with a taste for luxury cars, a neighbor said.Xuehua Edward Peng, 56, of Hayward was charged in documents unsealed Monday with being an illegal foreign agent and delivering classified U.S. national security information to officials in China, U.S. Attorney David L. Anderson said in San Francisco.Anderson accused Peng, whom he described as a tour operator for Chinese students and visitors, of a "combination of age-old spycraft and modern technology.""The charges announced today provide a rare glimpse into the secret efforts of the People's Republic of China to obtain classified national security information from the United States," Anderson said.Danilo Serrano said Peng moved in across the street from him about five years ago and kept a Lexus and Porsche parked outside. About a year ago, he bought "an expensive Tesla SUV, the nice one where the doors go up," Serrano said.Serrano recalled thinking, "Man, he must have a lot of money."The U.S. is engaged in a trade war with China. But John Bennett, the FBI agent in charge of San Francisco, said international politics had nothing to do with the arrest and charges against Peng."We have criminal spies that are running around in our area of responsibility and it's the FBI's mission to stop this, so what's going on in the rest of the world, it doesn't matter to us," he said.FBI Director Christopher Wray has said China poses a more serious counterintelligence threat to the United States than any other country, including Russia.In July, he testified before a Senate panel that the FBI had more than 1,000 investigations involving economic espionage and attempted intellectual property theft, nearly all of which lead back to China.The Justice Department has brought multiple cases in the past year involving Chinese espionage and has also brought charges against operatives working with the Ministry of State Security as law enforcement officials grapple with how to deal with an increasing threat of China trying to steal information from American companies.Last October, prosecutors charged a Chinese spy with attempting to steal trade secrets from several American aviation and aerospace companies, the first time an MSS operative was extradited to the U.S.Anderson did not say how long Peng had been operating as an unregistered spy for China's Ministry of State Security, only that the FBI employed a double agent in 2015 who conducted exchanges with Peng in the San Francisco Bay Area and in Columbus, Georgia.Over six occasions between 2015 and 2018, Peng would secure a hotel room and leave up to $20,000 there, authorities said in the criminal complaint. The double agent would then get a key to the room, take the cash and leave a digital card containing information, it said.Peng would then take the card and travel to Beijing to meet Chinese intelligence officers, authorities said.Authorities say the unnamed double agent went to the FBI in 2015 after China's intelligence department tried to recruit the person as a spy. The unnamed agent was told by Chinese intelligence officials at a meeting in 2015 that "Ed" was reliable and had family in China, according to the complaint.The criminal complaint says Peng is a naturalized U.S. citizen who entered the country on a temporary business visitor visa and became a permanent resident in 2006. Peng was naturalized in September 2012.He holds an acupuncturist license from the state.Peng was arrested at his home Friday and ordered held without bond at a hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge Joseph C. Spero. He is scheduled to return to court Wednesday.Qian Peng, the suspect's daughter, said she could not comment because she had not seen the charges.Serrano said he sometimes wondered what Peng did for a living but didn't inquire."He seemed to travel a lot," Serrano said, recalling he would sometimes see cars come to pick up Peng, who would get in with suitcases.Serrano and Peng chatted about domestic things, he said, with Peng admiring the fencing and succulents in front of Serrano's home. Peng installed a similar fence and planted succulents that Serrano gave him.Serrano was shocked when told about the spy charges."I can't believe Ed was a Chinese spy!" he said.Court records indicate Peng will be represented by the federal public defender's office. The office did not respond to requests seeking comment.Anderson did not elaborate on Peng's tour operations. Public records list Peng as president of U.S. Tour and Travel in San Francisco, but no website for the company was found in an online search.He could face up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted of working as an unregistered agent of a foreign government,___AP reporter Michael Balsamo in Washington contributed to this report.Load-Date: October 1, 2019End of Document

That nothing got done with the lower deputy meetings.Then, we saw the Dow moving into positive territory this morning, as the White House said it had no knowledge of any news that it was -- that the delegation was leaving, ahead of talks.Futures, right now, showing a decline of 55 points on the Dow, a quarter of a percent, S&P is down 5 points, and the NASDAQ lower by 11. This, on top of big gains yesterday, and that was because there were hopes of, at least, a partial trade deal.We are following the bouncing ball here on China, the Industrial Average is up 182 points yesterday, at the close, S&P up 26, and the NASDAQ gaining 79 points, almost 80 points at 4:00 on Wall Street.Global markets this morning, we had some economic data which net was not good, in the Eurozone, FT-100 up a fraction, CAC Quarante up 15, and the DAX Index up a fraction, as well, very much a flat showing in Europe, this morning.In Asia overnight, markets finished mostly higher, as you can see, here too, fractional movers, Korea, bucking the trend, down almost one percent.China continues a full-court press on the NBA, Lakers are taking on the Nets right now, in Shanghai.

And joining me to break it all down, FOX Business' Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal's Wealth Management reporter, the host of the podcast, Secrets of Wealthy Women, Veronica Dagher and assistant editorial page editor of the Wall Street Journal, James Freeman. Great show, so far, guys, a lot of important topics.JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. And we have seen -- it's been the story since early 2018, when -- looks like we're going to get a trade deal, stocks go up when the chances seem more remotely go down, so we've been talking about what should a deal look like. The big message from investors is, they want a deal.BARTIROMO: Yes, they want a deal. You are right. And it looks like they want a skinny deal, like you mentioned earlier.VERONICA DAGHER, WEALTH MANAGEMENT REPORTER, WALL STREET JOURNAL: That's right. You know, it'll be interesting to see what we actually get. I'm so fascinated by this China story, especially with the NBA, wondering if the Chinese government is underestimating how passionate their citizens are about basketball.And so, when you don't televise like this morning's game, this could have real pushback on that Chinese government.BARTIROMO: Do they care? Veronica, does the government care? I mean, unless they actually see them taken to the streets and protesting, but then they'll be put in jail. I don't know if the government there, cares.DAGHER: Probably not right now, but I'm thinking the long game here.BARTIROMO: Yes.DAGHER: Is this a sustainable way of doing business with their own country?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: They care enough to make a beef about a tweet from a general manager that the people of China can't actually see because there's censorship.BARTIROMO: By the way -- yes, exactly. The tweet wasn't even seen in China. It just goes to show you how they are watching everything and monitoring a tweet that was sent in the U.S.MCDOWELL: They monitor what every major CEO in the United States does, essentially.BARTIROMO: And they're tracking dissidents and their families. Remember, we had Nury Turkel on a couple of weeks ago, he is a Uyghur -- he was a Uyghur in China, and his family was actually put in a -- you know, what they're calling reeducation camps, other people call them concentration camps.And he said that they are tracking families of dissidents, wherever you are, America, in China, whatever it is.

Talks at the deputy -- at the principal level, rather, those are the top negotiators, Robert Lighthizer, Steven Mnuchin, Liu He and his team, as well, set to resume, once again, for another round later this morning. But there was also a real question this morning, of exactly how long those talks might last.After the deputy level talks wrapped up here in Washington, earlier this week, the South China Morning Post said that those talks essentially went nowhere and suggested that Liu He could cut his trip, short.Now, as of late last night, the White House says they were operating under the same timeframe for the talks, as a spokesperson responded by saying, "We are not aware of a change in the Vice Premier's travel plans at this time."When asked yesterday about the reluctance of the Chinese to take on intellectual property theft, President Trump suggested that there were really only two people who could tackle that issue.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There are so many false reports, everybody is trying to guess, but there're really only two people that matter in this one, and that's President Xi and myself. We get along very well.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: The president also said he does not think China is lowering its expectations ahead of the talks. China has said a deal would need to be win-win, but the president says, it would have to be bigger than that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: You know, this can't be like a 50-50 deal, because a 50-50 deal, you're like, up there, we're down here. So, a 50-50 deal doesn't work, right? You've got to have a little balance. This has to be better deal from our standpoint, and I think they fully understand it.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: There is also a report out this morning, Maria, in the New York Times, suggesting that Huawei licenses could be eased.A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry was asked about that earlier today, and responded by saying the following, "I would like to stress once again that the U.S. approach is neither glorious nor ethical, but it is contrary to the market economy principle that the U.S. has always advertised."So, that, from China this morning, on Huawei. Bottom line, big picture here, Maria, it goes to show, just how many balls are up in the air this morning, and just how fluid this situation really is, so much so, that we don't even know how long China's top negotiator might be staying here in Washington, Maria.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, the White House said it's unaware of any schedule change, but --BURMAN: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- you're right. The rumors -- the rumors have been flying, overnight. Blake, thank you.BURMAN: You got it, Maria.BARTIROMO: Blake Burman at the White House. Joining us right now is senior adviser to president -- former senior adviser to George W. Bush, FOX News contributor, Karl Rove. Karl, good to see you this morning.KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.BARTIROMO: Your reaction to what's going on here, with the China situation, first, then we'll get into the impeachment push, but, you know, I mean, the U.S., it sounds like wants to do a deal, and yet the Chinese want just their topics and issues, discussed. They don't want to deal with the industrial side of the economy meaning, intellectual property theft.ROVE: Yes. There are two questions facing the Chinese, are they going to pursue the strategy that helps them with economic growth in the short term, are they going to pursue a strategy that allows them to dominate the emerging technologies in the 21st century, and surpass the United States as an economic power, sometime, in the future.And the other one is, are the stresses and strains of the moment with regard to Hong Kong, and the situation there, going to cause them to be more forthcoming, in order to lessen tensions with the United States.We don't know the answers to either one of those questions, we'll see the answers as this plays out, but my gut tells me they are more inclined to look for the long term, rather than the short term, on both of those issues, that is to say they're going to be hard-nosed on trade and they're not going to feel compelled to move because of Hong Kong.BARTIROMO: Yes. Meanwhile, South Park responded to its own China controversy in typical South Park fashion. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TOWELIE, BUSINESS PARTNER OF RANDY MARSH: I'm never working for a company that's regulated by a Communist government.RANDY MARSH, SOUTH PARK: OK. OK. No more selling to the Chinese.TOWELIE: Then say it. Say (BLEEP) the Chinese government.MARSH: (BLEEP) the Chinese government.TOWELIE: I didn't hear you.MARSH: (BLEEP) the Chinese government. There.TOWELIE: Well, you just got your partner back.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Karl, your reaction?ROVE: Well, that's cheeky and American, good for South Park.BARTIROMO: Yes.ROVE: Look, it's appalling what the NBA has done, groveling in front of the Chinese. Now, the idea, with all due respect to Veronica, the idea that the Chinese people, who love American basketball, are going to change President Xi's mind, I think is not accurate.But the way the NBA is groveling in front of this market, this is exactly what the Chinese want to send a signal. They want to send -- just as they did with Cathay Airlines, earlier in the Hong Kong dispute. They want to send a message to western business leaders, don't mess around with China, because there'll be a price to be paid.BARTIROMO: Right.ROVE: And so, they are going out of their way, in my opinion, to make an example of the NBA, just not because of what it does inside China, they could care less if Chinese -- if the Chinese fans are upset about this.What they want to do is send a message to westerners, to western business leaders, better be in sync with China under these international economic questions or else there'll be a price to be paid among -- on your bottom line.BARTIROMO: I know, but a lot of them are responding, Dagen, they are rolling over, they are bowing to China, some of these companies in America, I mean, China is bullying them.MCDOWELL: That's been the history of American companies doing business in China, and frankly, they're finally -- they have businesses here, have the backing of this president to stand up and push back.BARTIROMO: That's right.MCDOWELL: And I think, the American people -- listen, the American people, anybody who lives in Trump country, in the south and in the Midwest, they know the damage that's been done.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: Because this country, basically, traded good paying jobs and a safety net, with a pension. And in manufacturing, for example, and it was handed to these corporations say, hey, you want low wages? You want a tax cut? We won't say anything. Politicians did this for decades. We won't say anything if you ship your jobs overseas to China.And then they try to sell it to the American people. It's kind of the great lie --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: -- of the last century, that oh, you get all this, excuse my language, crappy cheap stuff from China, that you can blow up and put in your front yard. And that's essentially -- that was the trade-off. The American people woke up to this a long time ago, and it was President Trump who finally tapped into it.BARTIROMO: He really did. And now, CEOs are -- I mean, beginning to wake up, but it doesn't look like it, some of them are keep rolling over. What do you say?FREEMAN: Well, I think, to Veronica's point, about how much can the Chinese government deny NBA fans basketball? This is, sort of, the big question with the trade dispute, Karl, and I guess it goes to how much pain can Xi Jinping, the Chinese dictator, impose on his own people, economically, before his leadership is in question?Certainly, it's hurt them, certainly, their currency shows it's been in hurt -- they've been hurt, but maybe not enough yet.BARTIROMO: Now, real quick, because we want to get to impeachment.ROVE: Yes. James, I think you're absolutely right. The question is, the economic pain that they stuffer, not the cultural pain. He's willing to deprive NBA fans, in China, of watching basketball games.But you are right, he's got a certain amount of jobs and a certain amount of economic growth that he needs to have each year, otherwise, a restive world peasantry is going to be very upset with the central government and he knows that's a danger to his continued leadership at the top of the Chinese government, not the Communist Party's control over China, but his personal situation.BARTIROMO: Yes. So, you wonder how much the Hong Kong protesters are, you know, pressuring him, as well. He doesn't want to see that kind of situation in mainland China, that's for sure. But let me take you back to the U.S., former Vice President Joe Biden formally calling for the president's impeachment while on the campaign trail, yesterday, in New Hampshire. Listen to this. Got to get your reaction.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Donald Trump has violated his oath of office, betrayed this nation. To preserve our constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Karl, your reaction?ROVE: Well, Biden, about three weeks ago, stumbled into the situation of being hit by the president, on the issue of his son, being on the board of the stinky Ukrainian company, and it has taken him three weeks to finally find his footing.This is what he should have responded to, three weeks ago with, not what he has done, in the meantime, which is just first, ignore it, and then to say, how dare he attack my family, which just simply put the focus right back on Hunter Biden and the stinky Ukrainian company.So, finally, after three weeks, Joe Biden has gotten his sea legs, and I thought it was interesting, he seemed to be taken aback when he first did this yesterday. And the crowd exploded in applause and cheers, he got, sort of, taken aback, but he's now stumbled into where he needs to be, if he wants to get back in the game on the Democrat side, and that is, to out impeach everybody else in this crowd.So, you know, smart politics, I think dumb for the general election, and most important of all, wrong for our country. I wrote a piece today in the Wall Street Journal, it actually passed James Freeman's approval, apparently, it got under the page.But it's -- but, you know, I just -- this is -- this is wrong for our country. The way that the Democrats are going about doing this, and this, you know, he is --BARTIROMO: Yes.ROVE: He's violated the law. Well, I looked at the law, and I looked at what the DOJ has said about it, and offer a couple of thought experiments. If Democrats want to be consistent, then how are they going to react to these other similar circumstances that they've never treated as a violation of law?Anyway, it's bad for our country that the Bidens --BARTIROMO: You think voters will react? Do you think voters react in 2020? Real quick.ROVE: I think it depends on how it plays out. But yes, I think anybody who goes into this thing saying, Trump should be impeached, you know, there's a -- there's a bump in the polls for impeachment, no ifs, ands or buts.BARTIROMO: Yes.ROVE: I'm not sure that's durable over the long haul, and particularly in the unfair way and the highly political way the Democrats are going about doing this. Highly partisan.BARTIROMO: Karl, great to see you. Thank you so much. Karl Rove.ROVE: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: We'll be right back. Hit the brakes, why consumer reports is likening Tesla's automated parking system to a drunken and distracted driver, that's next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. More Fidelity Investments joining the no-fee bandwagon. Cheryl Casone with more now and headline. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, Maria, Fidelity Investments following Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, and E-Trade, cutting trading commissions down to zero. This takes effect on November 4th and also eliminates that 4.95 fee. The race to zero coming as online brokers compete for market share, but the move could also cut the profits.All right. To baseball, the Washington Nationals stunning the LA Dodgers, winning the National League Division Series.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is deep to centerfield. Bellinger's back. It's a grand slam. Howie Kendrick.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: The drama happening in the 10th inning. The Nationals faced the Cardinals in the championship series tomorrow after St. Louis clobbered Atlanta 13:1. Tonight on Fox Sports One, the Astros face the Rays in game five of the ALDS.And staying with sports, guys, I want you to check this out. A little football player inspiring his team.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Be you, but also have passion. Be determined, beat this team. We can beat them anywhere. We can go to New England for goodness sake, clenched out, we can still beat them.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: That is little. I love him, too. That's (INAUDIBLE) of East Texas. His coach wrote on Twitter, this kid has got it figured out. Players must lead programs. They won the game, by the way, guys. And I just want to add, Dagen, you know, I think the Redskins are looking for a coach. Maybe they should give --(CROSSTALK)(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Oh, God. Oh, God.MCDOWELL: They're going to go down as one of the worst sports team in the history of sport.FREEMAN: That's just the guy who'll turn it around.DAGHER: Yes, he looks like he knows what he's doing.BARTIROMO: That kid has such leadership.DAGHER: Energy and inspiration.BARTIROMO: Yes, for real, I love it.DAGHER: Yes. Hey.FREEMAN: Yes, maybe play that in the morning. Start the workday, you know? Get inspired.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: They'll be seizing the day with that.(CROSSTALK)FREEMAN: Yes. Absolutely, seizing the day.BARTIROMO: A quick break. And then consumer reports slashing its hazards on Tesla. Why it's likening the automakers' new smart summon feature to a drunk driver, that's next. And then, shaking up the hospitality industry, I'll be speaking with the CEO of Sonder. It's a boutique hotel chain similar to Airbnb. How the company is revolutionizing the rental market. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Bed Bath & Beyond stock is soaring this morning. It's up 20 percent. Take a look, after the company named a new CEO. Gerri Willis on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange checking that out and the opening this morning. Gerri, good morning to you.GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey, good morning, Maria. That's right, I hope you enjoyed yesterday's rally. It appears to be over on the major indexes this morning. Let's get to Bed Bath & Beyond. That company shares surging after they announced they had hired an ex-Target chief merchandising officer named Mark Tritton, tells the analysts he's upgraded the stock to outperform them. Boy, is it this morning.Meanwhile, PG&E set to open at its lowest level since January on a court order in bankruptcy. It favors debt holders over stockholders, and advantages victims in those wildfires. Of course, PG&E shut off power to half a million California this week to avert yet another wildfire. Speaking of that, Tesla chargers, let's get to CEO Elon Musk's tweet this morning. He's saying that, Tesla Supercharger stations in areas affected by those power outages will have Tesla Powerpacks in a few weeks." Those are just massive batteries that people would be able to use.And speaking of Tesla, Consumer Reports is slamming the company this morning about its automated parking system calling it, well, it's like a drunken or distracted driver doesn't work very well, they say. The services called Smart Summons. It comes as part of a $6,000 upgrade package. And it's supposed to be able to say navigate a rainy parking lot for you and come and get you. By consumer report, it says the system works only sometimes, stops for -- suddenly for no reason, and doesn't always stay on its side of the road. Maria, back to you.BARTIROMO: Gerri, thank you so much. We will check in as this market opens. Looking lower right now, 62 points lower. Coming up, high stakes trade talks, Washington and Beijing set to meet face-to-face at the negotiating table today. What's at stake for truce with China amid the looming tariff deadline which is next week? Then pack your bags, I was speaking with the CEO of home rental company Sonder on how his company is transforming the way you travel. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday October 10th. We have breaking news right now, the strength of the U.S. economy at hand, September consumer price index is out in moments. We're going to get a check on what the inflation picture looks like with the CPI. Economists are expecting an increase of one-tenth of a percent month-over-month and 1.8 percent year-over-year.As we await the numbers, investors around the world are keeping a close eye on today's trying to trade stocks. Futures indicating a decline at the start of trading down 64 points on the Dow. The S&P is down six, and the NASDAQ down 12. Global markets this morning are mixed, but really flat. As you can see not too far from where they open the session, up one point on the FT. In Asia overnight, also a flat session there, the Korea market was the weak spot, down almost one percent as you can see there.We are waiting on the CPI. So far, no signs of inflation anywhere.FREEMAN: Yes, the producer price index came in lower than expected, so it'd be interesting to see now what it means in terms of consumer prices.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, the CPI's what we're waiting on, but we know that we have seen really no inflation, whether it's the consumer level or the producer level. Is this going to matter to the Fed?MCDOWELL: Probably not, because we saw wage growth in the most recent month. The average hourly earning come in below three percent year-over- year.BARTIROMO: It's --MCDOWELL: Are we getting the number out?BARTIROMO: Yes, it's unchanged, Dagen. It's -- the number's unchanged. Let's get to Deirdre Bolton with more because even the year-over-year number, I think, was below estimates. Over to you, Deirdre.DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, exactly, Maria. So unchanged, if you like, for this headline number, and as you've been pointing out, Refinitiv Poll was for a gain of a tenth of a percent year- over-year, as you just alluded to, lower than expected so 1.7 coming in. And of course analysts were looking for 1.8 percent.Now if you look at the core, slightly lighter than expected, 0.1 versus 0.2 percent, and then if you look at the core CPI year-on-year (INAUDIBLE) 2.4 percent, but it backs up exactly what you were just talking about, that CPI indication, this is a little bit more of a steadier number, that September PPI number unexpectedly declining, 0.3 percent month-on-month.And of course all this just goes into one more piece or two more pieces of the puzzle for the Fed. We've been spinning forward, of course, to that meeting on the 29th and the 30th of this month, 85 percent. If you look at Fed funds futures, there is an 85 percent chance, according to investors, that the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 basis points. So, we'll see how equation goes. But for the moment, just to repeat here, unchanged for the month of September. Maria.BARTIROMO: All right, Deirdre. Thank you so much.BOLTON: Sure.BARTIROMO: You got lack of inflation, you've got unemployment at a 50-year low, and then there's income and inequality. I wanted to point out the Lindsey Group's research that says, income and inequality declined sharply in 2018. You just wrote an op-ed about this. James.FREEMAN: Yes. Thanks. It's kind of interesting because inequality has been this mantra for Democratic candidates the last several years. It's' kind of a centerpiece of Elizabeth Warren's campaign, and really the excuse for her to try to remake the American economy, and you have a couple interesting things here to trends.One is that inequality in the Trump era seems to be declining. We saw that with the most recent wage data where assembly workers, or I should say rank-and-file workers, nonsupervisory works, are seeing their wages rise faster than bosses. So this has been kind of a trend over the last few years and it makes sense.If you think about the Obama era, it was characterized by monetary policy giving us big gains in the stock market, but kind of crummy growth, and not big wage growth for the average workers. The other issue is not just that inequality seems to be declining in the Trump era, but generally, it doesn't seem to be the huge issue that it -- that it has been portrayed.In terms of the Democratic argument is inequality has been rising in recent decades and they've pointed to a number of economists, but all of that data is starting to be called into question now, and you look at data from the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Congressional Budget Office, a lot of sources saying, wait a minute, it looks like inequality really hasn't changed that had much since the 1960s.BARTIROMO: Yes. Read James' op-ed on this. And I would also point out that Larry Lindsey's group is the Lindsey's Group says that poverty has dropped -- the poverty rate in 2018 was 11.8 percent, that's down five- tenths of a percent, from the 12.3 percent rate in 2017. So you've got wages going up, all boats rising and poverty going down.MCDOWELL: So --BARTIROMO: This is a very important point and nobody is talking about this, that inequality is declining.MCDOWELL: So when the fiction, the fibs, the fairytale that you've been telling the American people about how the rich and Wall Street are trying to stick it to you and you're -- and preaching the inequality message, when that turns -- when people aren't feeling that, what do you do? You pivot to impeachment.BARTIROMO: There you go. And you make it a big show as if it's really happening when in fact there's no rules on this. Bingo. All right. We want to change -- turn to U.S.-China trade, the two sides holding high level negotiations this morning ahead of the possibility of increased tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods. That tariff increase is set to go into effect next week. China is now reportedly planning to ask the U.S. to lift sanctions on its biggest shipping company, China COSCO Shipping Corporation. President Trump weighed in on a trade deal yesterday at the White House. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: So I think they feel that I'm driving a tough bargain, but I have to. And I told that to President Xi, I said, you know, this can't be like a 50/50 deal. This has to be a better deal from our standpoint and I think they totally understand it.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Texas Congressman House Financial Services Committee Member, Lance Gooden. Congressman, it's good to see you. Thanks for joining us.REP. LANCE GOODEN (R-TX): Good to see you. Thank you.BARTIROMO: What do you want to see out of this -- out of this trade talk conversation these next two days?GOODEN: You know, I want to see what I've been seeing from President Trump, and that is continued toughness toward China. The president understands that we've got to be tough on China because China, they just haven't respected us and they don't. They want these tariffs lifted but they also don't want to do things like deal with their -- the patent infringement, the cheating that they've been a part of over the years, they don't want that to stop. So they're willing to give, but I don't know that they're willing to give enough for President Trump to be happy with this and I love what he's doing. I hope he continues it.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, you know, it's the first president that's actually changed the conversation on China. And, you know, we've been talking about --GOODEN: That's right.BARTIROMO: What I've been saying for a long time, that American CEOs have been so interested in getting their products in front of 1.4 billion people they forgot to protect the products and they forgot to -- the themes that they deem as so important in America, due process, you know, human rights, et cetera, so what do you say to some of these companies this morning that seem to be rolling over and getting bullied from the Chinese People's Liberation Army?GOODEN: Yes. I would say remember the past, because it's going to repeat itself. I mean the Chinese, we don't have any idea how these companies run. They don't have an SEC, they don't have financials that are available to the U.S., we don't have any idea how much state influence or state funds are going into these competitors that U.S. companies are competing with. They haven't been playing fair, and if we're just going to roll over because we don't like the recent tariffs and we think that we can't take it anymore, then we're just going to back to the way things were and what was the point of all this? So I think we've got to continue to be tough and say that enough is enough.BARTIROMO: Let me move on to Facebook's digital currency plan. You have called on Zuckerberg to testify since the original Facebook Libra hearing back in July, Zuckerberg will testify before the House Financial Services Committee on October 23rd. To answer your questions about the company's proposed Libra cryptocurrency. PayPal has also withdrawn the support there. MasterCard and Visa reportedly questioning their involvement. What do you want to see? I know you've been pushing for Zuckerberg to testify. What do you want to ask him?GOODEN: You know, I want to ask him how much involvement he has with this plan moving forward. I want to ask what their plans really are for the future, how do they intend to ensure that the U.S. dollar remains strong? Chairwoman Waters, Maxine Waters, and Donald Trump, actually seem to have agreed on the concept of these cryptocurrencies, that there's too much unknown, that the potential to destroy the U.S. dollar is very strong. And there were a lot of questions that their spokesman didn't seem to have answers for.And so Maxine Waters, myself, and a few other members of the committee, we went to Switzerland back in August. We talked with the members of the commission that were expected to really play a part in this. They didn't have great answers and so we're hoping that Facebook can really put some concerns to rest, bipartisan concerns, that are important for the American people.BARTIROMO: Any thoughts on the other issues around social media? I mean Congressman Devin Nunes really sued Twitter in the Virginia Court back in March and he seems to have gotten a victory this week. He calls them a content creator. You've got Tulsi Gabbard suing Google for censoring conservative conversation is rally what Devin Nunes is saying.GOODEN: Uh-hmm.BARTIROMO: But Tulsi Gabbard is not saying much difference, saying that there's censorship going on. What do you want to see in terms of --GOODEN: It's fascinating.BARTIROMO: Yes, go ahead.GOODEN: This is one of the few issues that Democrats and Republicans are both in unison on. Democrats don't trust Facebook for various reasons, Republicans don't trust Facebook because they censor our communication across the country when it comes to campaigns and elections, so it's really fascinating that this is one of the few issues that both Democrats and Republicans seem to have an issue with.BARTIROMO: Right. But the point is --GOODEN: And, you know, Facebook is run by a bunch of liberals.BARTIROMO: I mean can you --GOODEN: Go ahead.BARTIROMO: Do you believe that they should be immune from getting sued, that they are just platforms?GOODEN: No.BARTIROMO: Yes. Go ahead.GOODEN: No. I think they should absolutely be held responsible.BARTIROMO: Yes.GOODEN: It's -- and then the other thing with all these issues with their social media, if we can't run a social media platform, why would we want to go out and run a gigantic cryptocurrency platform that we want the whole world to be a part of.BARTIROMO: Well, that's a good point.GOODEN: I mean the PayPal, MasterCard, Visa, these big prestigious players are pulling out. I think this is an indication that this is heading in the wrong direction for Facebook. Perhaps Mr. Zuckerberg will have some enlighten information in the few weeks and I'm grateful --BARTIROMO: Yes.GOODEN: -- to him for appearing. I think that speaks volume.BARTIROMO: All right. So you've got an agreement on that, but there's not a lot of agreement elsewhere. This impeachment inquiry is creating uncertainty for many of President Trump's proposals --GOODEN: Right.BARTIROMO: -- like USMCA. So what do you think? Is anything going to get done? Will Nancy Pelosi bring USMCA to the floor and will it pass?GOODEN: You know, I think every day is an unpredictable, unprepared for day it seems, with the Democrats. The USMCA agreement is the one issue that I have found that my colleagues across the aisle are actually in agreement for. They're frustrated that their speaker has not brought it up, and said let's get this out.But, you know, Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to give the president a win on anything. Unless her Liberal Wing of the caucus approves and they haven't approved it yet. So, with respect to China, all these agreements, what a shame that our president can't go into these agreements from a standpoint of force, because he's dealing with impeachment.When other world leaders see that our president is having to deal with impeachment, and also world leaders don't -- and other countries, they don't know what impeachment proceedings really entail. They don't realize that this whole thing's a sham and it's going to die in the Senate whenever that happens. So it's a real shame that our president is having to deal with this when he's having these high level discussions with China when he's in New York at the U.N.But back to your original question, what are we going to get done between now and Christmas? With the Democrats running the show, I'm not real confident that anything happens.BARTIROMO: That's too bad. Congressman, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks very much.GOODEN: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Congressman Lance Gooden joining us. Coming up, a boost for Bed Bath & Beyond, the stock soaring this morning, up 20 percent, as the company named a new CEO. Stuart Varney weighs in on that. Then transforming travel. I'll be speaking with the CEO of Airbnb partner Sonder on how his company is revolutionizing the home rental market. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Bed Bath & Beyond getting a new CEO just in time for the holiday shopping season. Joining me now, the host of "VARNEY & CO." Stuart Varney to weigh in. Hey, Stu.STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. You know every day, on our show, we like to pick a stock of the day. The stock of the day has to be a stock that everybody knows, maybe it's a service or a product or a store that everybody uses, and today, our stock of the day is Bed Bath & Beyond.Now, why are we doing that? Oh, I'll tell you, look at the screen. It's up 18 percent. Now that's premarket, that's a significant rebound for a stock that's been under very heavy pressure for a long time. What have they done? They've hired Mark Tritton, they've taken him away from Target and they're installing him at the head of Bed Bath & Beyond.Now Mr. Tritton, he's only been a target for 2-1/2 years, but he turned the company around after a sale slump, they're now expanding their sales rapidly. I guess Bed Bath & Beyond hopes that they can do same -- he can do the same thing for them, and investors appear to believe that he can indeed do the same thing for Bed Bath & Beyond. It doesn't always work, you hire a guy from this sector of retail, you put him here, you expect him to succeed, does not always work.But investors think that this maybe will work for Bed Bath & Beyond and it is our stock for the day. Look, if the market is in kind of a stalemate waiting for news from trade, that is the stock of the day.BARTIROMO: Yes. It sure is. It's looking good. We will view -- we will -- we will tune in, Stu.VARNEY: OK. Got it. Thank you.BARTIROMO: We'll see you in about 10 minutes.VARNEY: See you.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. "VARNEY & CO." begins top of the hour 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Join Stuart as he is up next first.But first, pack your bags, I'll be speaking with the CEO of Sonder, it is a boutique hotel chain shaking up the hospitality industry, how it's revolutionizing the rental market right here next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Shaking up the hotel industry, travel startup Sonder aims to provide sleek temporary housing that feels like a home away from home. Sonder offering travelers flexibility. It says that's not existed traditional hospitals.The government now expanding its Version of home through growing partnerships CEOs. Joining us right now is the CEO of Sonder. For instance, Francis Davidson, it's great to have you on the program this morning.FRANCIS DAVIDSON, CEO, SONDER: Thanks for being here.BARTIROMO: And I know that you have just entered unicorn status with your -- with your latest money raise, reaching a valuation over a billion dollars, with help of an investor whose family a built Hyatt Hotel chain entrepreneur. And former Yankees star Alex Rodriguez also a Sonder. He joined us recently and talked about his real estate investing. So let me ask you about all of that and how you're going to use that money to grow.DAVIDSON: Well, listen we've figured out a business model that really works well. We have hundreds of thousands of guests that have loved their stay with us, and basically we want to replicate that formula across more markets, go deeper in the markets in which we are. So, expansion is really kind of the primary use of that capital.BARTIROMO: Why would someone choose Sonder over a hotel?DAVIDSON: Well, if you were to picture your perfect hotel, you'd probably want it to be extremely well-designed, you'd want it -- you want your room to be much bigger than the 350 square foot room you usually get. You want maybe an interesting neighborhood, and if can you wrap all of that really, you know, really attractive price point with modern service, I think -- I think that'd be something that most people, most traveler use cases would prefer that, and it's basically reality that we're -- that we're now offering upwards of 26 cities in six countries.BARTIROMO: Do you -- do you compete with Airbnb? I know you have a partnership with them, but that's also a competitor, right?DAVIDSON: I wouldn't classify them as competitors. Really, you know, what we're trying to do way better is the hotel business. We actually think that it's possible to offer an experience that is much more modern, to have really beautiful spaces. I think we're done with the ugly carpets and the beige walls and the -- and the bed skirts and expensive room down -- rooms downtown and we think that there's a way to do it way better by leveraging technology and design to offer better expense at a lower price and really that's going after the hotel business far more than the Airbnbs or booking dotcoms and Expedias who are -- who are really important partners of ours.BARTIROMO: So on a practical level, how do you do that? What specifically are you doing with technology hotels aren't?DAVIDSON: That's right. I think every layer of our experience, there is an element of technology. If you think about just booking the space takes a couples taps. You can use your phone or a keypad code in order to get into the unit, you're automatically connected to Wi-Fi via the app, which his by the way, that Wi-Fi is fast and it's free. And if you want to request an early check in or late checkout, that's done through the app. Basically what we figured out is if we put the lobby in the front desk and the concierge on your phone, the experience is way better and it turns out we can operate that business way more efficiently so we can pass on some of these savings to our guests.BARTIROMO: So what do you say to critics who compare Sonder to WeWork, saying that bulk leasing empty space, renting it out cannot compete with worldwide hotel chains?DAVIDSON: Well, you know, I'd say it's no surprise that if you have a business that doesn't have good unit economics, you're going to have a hard time as you scale. I think we've watched that company, and had some concerns right from the start that were shared by a lot of others and that's why we've been extremely focused in our organization to make sure that our economics are really good, and so Sonder at a property level is extremely profitable. We also are very careful about the kind of risks that we take on, so negotiating with, you know, land boards property, leases that fluctuate with the conditions of the economy.So, we've done a lot of things that our investors have actually really love. It's -- that's, you know, led to a lot of their excitement and leading our latest round, despite the fact that there are some concerns in, you know, the corking business with one of its biggest players. We've been very, very diligent financially in addressing those concerns.BARTIROMO: So is going public a priority this year or next year or what?DAVIDSON: I think, you know, priority is building an amazing business so great experience, really fast growth, great communicates, having a great culture as well. And, you know, at the right time, absolutely I think an IPO is the path for this company. If I had to guess, I'd say in the kind 18 to 36 months' time horizon.BARTIROMO: Eighteen to thirty-six months? I mean you've got a lot of -- a lot of interest, from private investors right now but you know the criticism in terms of the private market, their valuations are sky-high. How do you justify that?DAVIDSON: Yes. So I mean I think valuations who function of free capital business can generate and so we've been careful in our business to make sure that we weren't valued from the start as a software, you know, pure play tech company, and so our valuation multiples have actually been reasonable, you know, throughout our lifecycle, and a function of the margins that we generate and the kind of business that we're in.So the revenue that we generate for the evaluation is actually -- is actually really high compared to most technology about enabled businesses.BARTIROMO: Francis, it's great to see you and meet you. Love to see the disruption story happening and continuing. Good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.DAVIDSON: Thank you so much.BARTIROMO: Francis Davidson. We'll be watching Sonder. Still ahead, we got final thoughts from this all-star panel right after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We have breaking news right now. We are seeing the arrivals of U.S. and Chinese officials in Washington ahead of the trade talks. There is Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Trade Representative Bob Lighthizer, and the Chief Negotiator in China Liu He arriving in Washington this morning to kick off those trade talks, which will be very closely watched in the next two days.And, of course, we're going to have all the headlines all day. Markets will react to them and, of course, tomorrow as well. Let's get the final thoughts as we watch these arrivals here. James Freeman.FREEMAN: Yes. Looked like they successfully negotiated where to stand while taking the picture so maybe they can now work out something a little larger. Let's hope.BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes. Veronica.DAGHER: Yes. I'm curious what's his kind of progress we're going to get and will it require the president, our president and their president, meeting face to face to really get some substantial progress.BARTIROMO: Uh-huh. We'll see. Dagen, what are you looking at?MCDOWELL: I'm watching Nancy Pelosi to see if she will ever step up and vote on this USMCA. Again, it's about the American people, it's about jobs, it's about fairness, in the interim, the -- quite frankly the house is going to have to step up and vote on to launch a formal impeachment inquiry if they're going to do this because the American people are losing interest in the dog and pony show coming out of Congress.BARTIROMO: It's a real dog and pony show. Do you think most people understand that?MCDOWELL: I take that back.BARTIROMO: This is my impeachment. This is a show.MCDOWELL: I take that back because dogs and ponies are awesome.BARTIROMO: They are awesome.MCDOWELL: And what they're doing at D.C. is not.BARTIROMO: All right. Well, look, today is throwback Thursday, right? On Instagram and Twitter. So, I got a great throwback Thursday picture that I'm about to post on my Instagram feed. Check it out. @mariabartiromo. I'll be checking out your later as well.MCDOWELL: OK.BARTIROMO: Have a great day, everybody. "VARNEY & CO." begins right now. Stu, take it away.VARNEY: Hey.

'Our Government Doesn't Want to Spoil Relations with China'Atlantic OnlineSeptember 3, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1494 wordsByline: Reid StandishBodyALMATY, Kazakhstan-In early March, Serikzhan Bilash, a Kazakh activist documenting and advocating for Muslims caught up in an immense internment-camp system in China, was taken from his hotel room by security services and arrested. Late on August 16, after being under house arrest for five months, he was unexpectedly freed.Kazakhstan, the Central Asian country of 18 million that shares a 1,100-mile border with China, has become an unlikely window into Beijing's crackdown on Muslim minorities. In recent years, the Chinese government has built the world's most advanced            surveillance state in Xinjiang, the western region bordering Central Asia. Bolstered by public video surveillance, regular scans of digital devices, and coded ID cards used to track the movements of their holder, the Chinese Communist Party has erected a massive internment program targeting the Muslim population, especially Uighurs, but also            Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Muslim minorities. According to the U.S. State Department, 800,000 to 2 million people, or roughly 15 percent of Xinjiang's Muslim population, have been incarcerated in the sprawling camp network.Atajurt Eriktileri, Bilash's organization, grew from a small office in downtown Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, into a front-line force in raising awareness about the mass detentions and camp system. Bilash and other members of Atajurt posted regular video testimonies from people whose relatives had gone missing in Xinjiang, as well as from recently released camp detainees,            cataloging their abuse and indoctrination and bringing international            attention to the issue in the process. But Atajurt's success and Bilash's reputation as a critic of China's policies put him in the crosshairs of the Kazakh authorities. Like others vying for favor with Beijing, the Kazakh government has used its location to position itself as a strategic notch in the billion-dollar Belt and Road infrastructure program. Bilash was arrested on charges of interethnic incitement for critical remarks he had made about China's policies in Xinjiang. The case, his supporters say, is an example of China exerting influence beyond its borders, pushing the Kazakh government to muzzle its own citizens.After his release, Bilash            told his supporters gathered outside a courthouse in Almaty that his freedom was a "victory for the people," as he had dodged a seven-year sentence. But the details of his release point toward a quiet victory for Beijing. To secure his freedom, Bilash signed a plea bargain with the Kazakh authorities and accepted guilt over charges that several international rights groups            characterized as politically motivated. Moreover, in signing the plea bargain, he agreed to stop his work. "I had to end my activism against China. It was that or seven years in jail. I had no choice," he said after his release,            according to Agence France-Presse.[           Read: China is treating Islam like a mental illness]The episode is part of a wider effort by Beijing to shape the narrative regarding its treatment of Muslims that extends far beyond Kazakhstan. China's government initially denied the Xinjiang camps' existence, then went on a diplomatic and public-relations campaign to counter the growing outcry against what it calls "vocational-education centers," and then defended them as necessary to combat Islamic extremism. From            targeted social-media ads to            Potemkin reporting trips organized for international journalists to Beijing flexing its diplomatic muscle, the Communist Party has gone to great lengths to quell criticism around the world. In late July, the Chinese government said that the camps were succeeding in eliminating radicalism and separatism, and that most detainees had been released.            Recent reporting shows that the camps continue to operate."Our government doesn't want to spoil relations with China," Aiman Umarova, Bilash's former attorney and a prominent human-rights lawyer in Kazakhstan, told me before his release. "Chinese investment is important, and any information or activism that can damage that is extremely sensitive to the Kazakh government." Umarova refused to sign Bilash's plea bargain, insisting that her client was innocent, and told me that it was set up without her involvement. "This was a deal signed under pressure intended to silence a critic of China's camps," she said following Bilash's release. (Bilash did not respond to my multiple requests for comment.)Other attempts to            stymie criticism of the camps have been deployed across the Muslim world. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has welcomed Uighurs to Turkey for many years, and has been            critical of China's heavy-handed policies in Xinjiang. More recently, Erdogan has            tempered his remarks as he's shifted toward attracting Chinese investment and building up bilateral ties. Similarly, Pakistan-which remains heavily dependent on Chinese money and, like Kazakhstan, plays a large role in the Belt and Road Initiative-has been notably silent about Xinjiang, and Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan denied knowing about the camps in an            interview.[           Read: Uighurs can't escape Chinese repression, even in Europe]Still, many Western nations have not shied away from their criticism. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called China's policies "           the stain of the century" in July, and that same month, 22 countries, including Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, and Japan, signed a            letter to the United Nations raising serious concerns about Beijing's internment of its Muslim minorities. In response, a second letter emerged a few days later,            signed by 37 countries endorsing Beijing's policies in Xinjiang."It's certainly a sign of China's new global position, and it shows the diplomatic effects of [Belt and Road], which is no doubt a goal of the project," James Millward, a China expert and professor at Georgetown University, told me. "Yet it's hard to call this a success. Xinjiang has hurt China's soft power, and they've largely been caught off guard by the international attention its received."The camps in Xinjiang have not helped China s reputation in Kazakhstan. Nearly            1.5 million ethnic Kazakh Chinese nationals live in Xinjiang, making them the second-largest Muslim group in the region, after Uighurs. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991,            200,000 ethnic Kazakhs from China have moved to Kazakhstan and become Kazakh citizens, including Bilash; tens of thousands of other ethnic Kazakh Chinese nationals live in Kazakhstan as permanent residents, according to estimates. Stuck between popular anger and deepening ties with Beijing, the Kazakh government has tried to strike a balance. The country's tightly controlled media have given limited coverage to the issue, and when they have, it has largely echoed Beijing's state propaganda. Meanwhile, Kazakh authorities have engaged in behind-the-scenes diplomacy with China, and managed to secure the            release of some Kazakh citizens and ethnic Kazakhs from the camps.In getting Bilash to sign a plea deal, the Kazakh authorities have sucked the air out of the activism around the internment camps. Several former camp detainees I spoke with following Bilash's arrest in March said the move sent a chill among the community of camp survivors and their families. With Bilash no longer active, former detainees and those with family members still missing in the camps will be far less willing to share their stories, they said, especially given Beijing's            tactic of threatening and targeting the families of activists who still live in China.[           Read: China's jaw-dropping family separation policy]Gene Bunin, a Russian American writer and translator who runs the            Xinjiang Victims Database, a project documenting the testimonies of detainees and their families, told me that Bilash's deal is a blow to those in the Central Asian country working on the issue. He continues to work with activists in Kazakhstan, and has gathered and published more than 5,000 detailed testimonies in his online database, which he said is a "grassroots weapon" that "China reacts to," noting how public testimonies have led to interned family members            being allowed to contact their relatives or being released from the camps and placed into another form of detention, such as house arrest.But he said that with Bilash no longer active, much of the momentum within the activist community has been slowed. Atajurt, the organization headed by Bilash that once drew global attention to Xinjiang, has been operating at a limited capacity and could shut down without its leader."What kept them going was hope that he could be freed and things would continue as before," Bunin said. "I hope I'm wrong."Load-Date: September 4, 2019End of Document

Rubio Joins Wyden, Colleagues in Condemning Apple and Activision Blizzard Action to Enforce Chinese Government CensorshipTargeted News ServiceOctober 19, 2019 Saturday 8:08 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 310 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: MIAMI, Florida BodySen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, issued the following news release:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) joined Ron Wyden (D-OR) and a bipartisan group of lawmakers in condemning Apple and Activision Blizzard's recent actions to suppress criticism of the Chinese government in hopes of gaining higher profits.Apple recently removed the HKMap mapping app, which was widely used by peaceful Hong Kong protestors, from the App Store at the request of the Chinese government, and has censored more than 2,200 apps in China according to the nonprofit group GreatFire.Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Tom Cotton (R-AR), and Ted Cruz (R-TX) were joined by U.S. Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Mike Gallagher (R-WI), and Tom Malinowski (D-NJ) condemning the moves in a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook."You have said publicly that you want to work with China's leaders to effect change rather than sit on the sidelines and yell at them. We, too, believe that diplomacy and trade can be democratizing forces. But when a repressive government refuses to evolve or, indeed, when it doubles down, cooperation can become complicity," the lawmakers wrote.Rubio, Wyden, Ocasio-Cortez, Gallagher, and Malinowski also sent a letter to Activision Blizzard CEO Robert Kotick urging the company to reverse its decision to ban players who have voiced support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, particularly its ban on Mr. Ng Wai Chung."As China amplifies its campaign of intimidation, you and your company must decide whether to look beyond the bottom line and promote American values--like freedom of speech and thought--or to give in to Beijing's demands in order to preserve market access. We urge you in the strongest terms to reconsider your decision with respect to Mr. Chung," the lawmakers wrote.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6897918 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: October 19, 2019End of Document

A look at what could be off the table when both sides meet Thursday in Washington, coming up.Then, the NBA is under fire this morning from China, Chinese businesses cutting ties with the Houston Rockets after its manager expressed support for Hong Kong's pro-democracy activists, in a tweet, even the NBA is distancing itself from the remarks, prompting backlash from lawmakers, all this as violent protests continue over the weekend, in 18 straight weekends of protesters in Hong Kong.All those stories coming up this Monday morning, but first, our top story this half an hour, whistleblower controversy continues, the attorney representing the Ukraine whistleblower says another person is coming forward with a complaint against the president. Blake Burman is at the White House this morning, covering the story. Blake.BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you. That's right. There are now multiple whistleblowers, and one of those whistleblowers is said to have firsthand knowledge of that July 25th phone call between President Trump and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky.Attorney Mark Zaid, tweeting out over the weekend, the following, writing "news update: I can confirm this report of a second whistleblower being represented by our legal team. They also made a protective disclosure under the law and cannot be retaliated against. This whistleblower has firsthand knowledge.The Democratic Congressman Jim Himes, who is the number two Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, contends that these whistleblowers could not sit by idle any longer.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT): People around the president, professionals, who are in the Oval Office, who are in the situation room, are watching what is happening, and are finally saying, my God, this cannot happen anymore.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: The White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham shrugged off reports of another whistleblower, saying in a statement, "It doesn't matter how many people decide to call themselves whistleblowers, about the same telephone call, a call the president already made public, it doesn't change the fact that he has done nothing wrong.One of the president's top allies on Capitol Hill, Senator Lindsey Graham, saying on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" that he feels the mounting allegations parallel Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): This is Kavanaugh all over again. It -- does this second whistleblower, if there is one, are they within the intel community? And what is it about the intel community and Trump that is so off base here?(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: Meantime, Maria, here at the White House, we await a letter from the president, to Nancy Pelosi, that will challenge her to officially hold a vote on an impeachment inquiry. This could happen at some point this week.The thinking here, Maria, over here at the White House, is that the president is not being afforded all of the legal rights that he would have, if there would be an official impeachment inquiry versus kind of the state of limbo, that everything is in, right now. Maria?BARTIROMO: All right, Blake, thank you. We will be following that. Blake Burman is at the White House. And joining us right now with more on that is California congressman, House Minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, Leader McCarthy, it's good to see you.REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Thank you. First time on the new set. It's wonderful.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. And you sent two letters to Speaker Pelosi last week, calling for customary rules and procedures to be established for the impeachment inquiry. I want you to talk about that a bit, because I know that having an inquiry in the intel committee is different than having it in the judiciary committee. Can you explain?MCCARTHY: Well, first of all, let's think about all the past Congress in modern history, before they go to any impeachment, they have an impeachment inquiry, why? Because it's such an important fact. You are asking to remove -- which democratically, someone was just elected, so you should not take this lightly.And everybody in America lends their voice to 435 people, so everybody should have a voice, and it sets the rules. So, with Clinton, with Nixon, with the judges, a fair process. Right now, the minority does not have the right to subpoena power. The president's counsel can't be in the room. They moved it from the jurisdiction of having it from judiciary to intel.So now, they have a hearing, you know who gets to control who gets to come in the room? The Democrats. They tell us how many Republicans are allowed in, how much staff is allowed in. They don't allow us to set witnesses.BARTIROMO: So, they want to impeach a duly elected president behind closed doors.MCCARTHY: Exactly. And if you would release the transcripts of the hearings from last week, I think American public would again say, in this facade, this is all about politics. No, what happens is, they released just one or two texts, something that makes them look good, instead of letting all the facts speak.Nowhere in America would somebody go to a trial without able to have a witness, without able to cross-examine without being able to have any fairness, and that is what Nancy Pelosi is doing. She's going against what Speaker Albert did and what Newt Gingrich did, unheard of --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCCARTHY: -- in the process, and it goes to the fact that this is all political.BARTIROMO: So, we saw that this last week, because Atkinson was in a hearing behind closed doors. Kurt Volker was at a hearing behind closed doors. And these hearings, you know, little things leak out, I guess, and it -- and I'm hearing that -- the testimony, basically put this whole impeachment, you know, idea, it just busted it because of what Kurt Volker said.MCCARTHY: Exactly.BARTIROMO: But we don't know because it was closed doors.MCCARTHY: But very clear when you talk to the members who were in there. There was -- they were very clear about no quid, I mean, stated it, the fact, all of them, and they're good for nine hours. But what we found about the I.G., I think, is very important.Here we go, another common denominator, Adam Schiff, the man who started out telling us he had proof beyond circumstantial, and put America --BARTIROMO: It was in plain sight. It was in --MCCARTHY: Exactly.BARTIROMO: -- plain sight.MCCARTHY: He met with the -- his staff met with this whistleblower, the whistleblower then goes to the I.G., the Inspector General, never mentions that he met with Schiff's staff. They are now fact witnesses. If we had subpoena power, we'd call their staff and Adam Schiff, as one of the witnesses.BARTIROMO: Right.MCCARTHY: What did you talk about? What was said? How many times did you speak? They cannot be a prosecutor.BARTIROMO: Right.MCCARTHY: There's nowhere in American judiciary that allows an individual, that is a fact witness, to become the prosecutor.BARTIROMO: So, do you believe the president will be pushed out of office?MCCARTHY: No. Because -- and I read about this second whistleblower, you and I have more knowledge than the first whistleblower, America --BARTIROMO: Well, we have the transcripts.MCCARTHY: Exactly. So, what more came out? There's nothing in that phone call that's impeachable, or that he did wrong. Every day, we work with other countries, to solve cases.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCCARTHY: There is an open case about what happened with this Russia coup that they want to try to do in America. The attorney general has an open case about it, the world knows about it. A lot of that started in Ukraine, and they're trying to find the information about it.BARTIROMO: And that's why, I think, this is really what this is about, the Democrats are going to do anything they can to stop William Barr and John Durham from, you know, uncovering what took place in 2016.MCCARTHY: You know, William Barr, I respect the man, greatly. He believes in the rule of law.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCCARTHY: And he's going to follow it. Unfortunately, the Democrats in Congress do not believe in the rule of law. They are trying to discredit democracy. Think about what they are doing, they're going to tear the fabric of America apart. Remove a president? With no basis. If the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, had waited 48 hours, and had that transcript --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCCARTHY: We would not be in this nightmare we are today.BARTIROMO: What are you going to do about this, though? I mean, you are the leader of the Republicans, you're trying to get work done, you got USMCA hanging in the balance --MCCARTHY: Exactly.BARTIROMO: -- you got a meeting with China on Thursday, trying to do a deal there. You've got immigration, gun legislation, all this, nothing gets done?MCCARTHY: The Democrats have the majority, so they could control what comes forward. What they really should be doing, USMCA, United States, Mexico and Canada. Mexico already ratified it, Canada is waiting us on, we've got a meeting with China coming up.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCCARTHY: A month and a half ago, Mexico became our number one trader and Canada became number two. We would be stronger in our negotiations with China, but they are more concerned about tearing the president down, than building America up.BARTIROMO: So, let's talk China for a second, because there is real basketball backlash going on this morning. The Houston Rockets' general manager, he's under pressure because he put out a tweet supporting the Hong Kong protesters.It's caused a major uproar in China, where the Rockets are extremely popular, by the way, they want that market access. Chinese sponsors, Chinese businesses, all pulling support from the Rockets.An NBA spokesperson responded this way, the values of the league support individuals educating themselves and sharing their views of matters important to them. We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used for a unifying force to bridge cultural divide.But they rolled over. They rolled over. They basically removed the tweet, and now they're saying, OK, you know, we didn't mean it, because the Chinese government is on the Rockets to stop supporting the protesters.MCCARTHY: I have one question for them, do they stand for freedom or do they stand for money? America's more than a country, America is an idea, just like in the 80s, when the shipyard workers rose up in Poland, because they believed in freedom.You've got a large percentage of people standing up in Hong Kong, every Saturday, peacefully protesting for the idea of freedom of speech. This is -- this is a defining moment. The Houston Rocket G.M. should be -- should be celebrated because he understands what America means.He understands what freedom means. And if these people will fold to China, in an idea that they just want to have a bigger market share, that is concerning to me of what the world will look like in the future.BARTIROMO: You know, it's a -- it's a bigger issue for corporate America, right? Because CEOs for a long time, just wanted the access. They want to be able to sell their goods to 1.4 billion people, but in the process, they forgot about protecting the product.MCCARTHY: Did they forget Tiananmen Square? Why wouldn't you stand with a man who stood in front of the tank? What about how this country was created? Does that mean, at the end of the day, they will fold over for the freedom and rights of what deems to be an American just because they want to earn a dollar?BARTIROMO: What should we be thinking about that whole military parade that we saw in China the other day? I mean, you know, you talk about national security, I know not publicly, but you are, you know, understanding the issues with regard to China and its risk to America and our national security.So, last week, they've got this military parade, celebrating, you know, 70 years of Communist rule with a missile that has the range to hit the United States.MCCARTHY: Hypersonics, because in the Obama administration, he cut our funding when it came to hypersonics. This is what's so important if why, because we have impeachment, we don't have USMCA. This president is trying to rebuild this military, but we don't have the appropriation bills done, why? Because Congress can't do their work and move forward.We need to make that investment to make it safer, because China just celebrate its 70 years, in 2049, when they are at 100 years, they believe there's one world power. That was a clear message to us. And wouldn't be we be stronger in our negotiations with China when it comes to trade, if we had the USMCA done before President Trump has to sit down with Xi Jinping?But you are making us weaker in this whole basis, they are making every president in the future, weaker, by having to show a transcript, of a conversation he had with another world leader. The Democrats are just focused on politics, instead of focused on this country.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, what about that? I mean, are we going to now want to see every conversation that the president has with another foreign leader?MCCARTHY: We should not want to see -- because what foreign leader is going to be honest? You can't say anything.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCCARTHY: Could you talk to your friend if you -- if everything you say is going to be in public transcript?BARTIROMO: Yes.MCCARTHY: You've wanted to be able to have that trust, and right now, the Democrats who put America into an untrustworthy place, because they want to discredit democracy. They want to remove somebody from office, simply from the fact that they did not like the outcome of the 2016 election.BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, the president had a huge money raise, $125 million last quarter, how are you feeling going into 2020? Can the House reclaim the majority in 2020?MCCARTHY: Yes, we can. I want all your viewers to know this, it takes 19 seats to put the Republicans in the majority, but there are 31 seats that Democrats currently sit in, that President Trump carried, 13 of those are ruby red. He carried by more than 6 points, and you got another 18, and then we're in the seats that he didn't even win, that we're able to play in today.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Congressman, we'll be watching.MCCARTHY: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Good to see you. Congressman Kevin McCarthy there. Quick break. Still ahead this morning, we're going to speak with the founder of Anduril Industries, Palmer Luckey is here. Join us for that special interview. Plus, the host of "VARNEY & COMPANY" weighs in, Stuart Varney, coming up.But first, Uber getting an upgrade, Citigroup lifting its rating on a stock to a buy, it's had a tough couple of months there, citing optimism on revenue growth, the stock is up three percent on the news. Then, the future of offshore wind farming, we're taking a closer look at the new threat for the commercial fishing industry. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are watching shares of Uber this morning. Stock is up on an upgrade from Citigroup. Jackie DeAngelis on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with some details there. Jackie, good morning.JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning to you, Maria. You can see the stock is trading, as you said, up three percent in premarket. This is because Citigroup upgraded the stock to a buy on improving fundamentals. Now, the price target is the same, $45.00, just around its IPO price. And you can see it's still trading well under that, but Citi says the third quarter results could signal renewed revenue growth. Remember, of course, investors want to see top line growth but they want to see bottom line growth as well, profitability. This analyst is also saying that the value of Uber Eats may not properly be reflected in the stock price. And of course, it's been rocky for Uber, as I mentioned.Meantime, I want to move on and talk about PayPal as well as Facebook and Libra because PayPal has said that it's actually pulling out of that digital currency project, and it's the first company to do this. Now, it didn't give an explicit reason why, but it did say that it was still supportive of PayPal -- of Libra's goals but that it would focus on its own business model, which is probably a sound thing to do. PayPal shares slightly higher Facebook slightly lower today. Facebook, of course, revealed Project Libra back in June, and it's been scrutinized because regulators are worried about how it will integrate within the larger system. Maria?BARTIROMO: All right, Jackie, thank you. We will be watching that. Jackie DeAngelis on Wall Street this morning.Coming up, I'll be speaking with the founder of Anduril Industries, Palmer Luckye, one startup disrupting the technology industry. Plus, his take on the Hong Kong crisis as the Houston Rockets' General Manager sparks a major uproar in China. Then this, the future of offshore wind farming. We're taking a look at the new threat for the commercial fishing industry all ahead. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A federal tax credit set to expire; it could jeopardize the future of offshore wind farming. Fox News Correspondent Todd Piro is here, covering the story with details. Hi, Todd.TODD PIRO, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, thanks so much for having me. This is great to be here. That tax credit you mentioned is set to expire at the end of the year, but this summer, the Interior Department announced to hold on offshore wind projects until, quote, accumulative analysis is conducted. The move delaying potential approval of the country's first large-scale offshore wind farm, the Vineyard Wind Project until December 2020. And without that tax credit, the entire future of Vineyard Wind is in doubt. One industry that's actually pleased with this development, fishing. Here's why.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)AARON WILLIAMS, FISHERMAN, CAPTAIN OF THE TRADITION: As a family business, it's a lot of pride. My grandfather was a fisherman, my dad. Hopefully, someday my son would want to do it. But if something doesn't change, I don't even want him coming onto the boat.PIRO: The last time we spoke with Connecticut commercial fishing Captain, Aaron Williams, he was worried that government regulations would kill the business that's been in his family for four generations. Now, fishermen like him are facing a new threat, offshore wind farmsMEGHAN LAPP, FISHING LIAISON, SEA FREEZE LIMITED: If these offshore wind farms that are projected and the areas that they're being leased are actually built, it's over for the commercial fishing industry.PIRO: The shift to wind energy is growing. The first wind farm was installed in the U.S. in 1980. And now, there are more than 200 wind farms providing about 6-1/2 percent of the nation's electricity. And more growth is expected, specifically in our nation's oceans. In 2016, the first commercial offshore wind farm began operations with five turbines off Block Island in Rhode Island.And according to the American Wind Energy Association, 10 more farms could be up and running as soon as 2024.WILLIAMS: All right, this is Block Island --PIRO: Aaron drove us to get a better look.You may look at this and say it's just five windmills, who cares? But this could be the start of thousands of these up and down the East Coast of the U.S., some of them much larger than what you see in front of you.LAPP: The impacts from five is not going to be the same as the impacts from 500 or 5,000. However, there have been impacts.PIRO: Where are they seeing the impact? On the fish?LAPP: Fish have different habitats. They have certain migratory routes that they repeat year after year after year. So, when you put the wind farms on those places, those fish are definitely most certainly impacted.PIRO: On the boats.WILLIAMS: We're trying to navigate. Now, we'd have to be avoiding a base to a windmill,PIRO: And most concerning the wind farms effect on radar. We watched it happen.WILLIAMS: These right here are the five wind turbines. This is what the radar does when you do get close to the wind farm. It looks like there's about 20 here when there's actually only five right here, but it's the interference --The costs of the windmills outweigh the benefits of it.PIRO: But proponents of the wind farm, say the farms' environment and economical advantages need to be taken into consideration as well. Connecticut is one of 15 states with plans to add wind farms to their shores.KATIE DYKES, COMMISSIONER, CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION: Connecticut is excited to be investing in offshore wind. We are directing project developers to ensure that they have adequate funding for surveys and for monitorings. And we know that they're going to be driving investment in manufacturing and construction jobs.PIRO: The fishing industry response?WILLIAMS: It's easy to -- for a lot of folks to look out to the ocean and think it's an endless -- it's not endless, and we're going to get displaced not only on the fishing grounds, guys, certain boats will go out of business.(END VIDEOTAPE)PIRO: And if you think it's just the fishermen that are worried about these windmills, think, again, the Coast Guard as well as a team of members from the Departments of Energy, Homeland Security, the FAA, and NOAA are actually looking into the radar interference these ships are experiencing. So, this could actually become a national security issue in addition to a fishing industry and an environmental issue.BARTIROMO: Wow. It's interesting.PIRO: You know, I thought to myself, why can't you just go around? What's the big deal? They really do explain why you can't just go around with a boat. There are a lot more factors to play, and I'm not somebody who's anti-windmill. I lived in an area -- Palm Springs, California -- where they had a lot of windmills. But there wasn't a national defense issue. There was no concern that Orange County was going to invade Riverside County at any point while I was out in California. National defense concerns here on the offshore wind farms are concerning.BARTIROMO: Very important story, Todd, thank you.PIRO: No problem. Thank you.BARTIROMO: We will see you soon, Todd Piro. Coming up, I'll be speaking with the founder of Anduril Industries, Palmer Luckey, one startup disrupting the technology industry. Then, his take on the Hong Kong crisis as the Houston Rockets General Manager sparks a major uproar in China, that's coming up. And then, the streaming wars heating up, Disney banning Netflix advertising from all its networks. We're breaking down the Battle of the media giants later this hour. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, October 7th. Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.There are concerns, this morning, about the U.S. and China trade talks, that, of course, is happening this Thursday. And there is a -- new look at it because China says it will narrow the topics that they are willing to discuss on Thursday -- to trade, and not looking at any industrial part of their economy. Meaning, the intellectual property theft.Meanwhile, markets this morning are lower, off of the lows of the morning. Now, Dow Industrials down 49, S&P down six, and the NASDAQ lower by 18. Global markets this morning look like this: European indices are mostly higher. There were more signs of a slowdown in Europe, German factory orders were down six-tenths of a percent in the month of August -- that was worse than expected. Orders from Inside Germany down 2.6 percent. In Asia overnight, markets finished -- fractionally moving markets in China and Hong Kong closed, for the holidays of Golden Week.Our top story this half an hour: baseball backlash over the Hong Kong protesters. Houston Rockets general manager under pressure over a tweet supporting the protesters causing a major uproar in China where rockets are extremely popular. Chinese sponsors, businesses pulling support. The NBA responded to the criticism from China: "The values of the league support individuals educating themselves and sharing their views on matters, important to them.We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divide." According to NBA and its response to China's upset. From the general manager's tweet of the Houston Rockets. Joining me right now is the Founder of Anduril Industries, he's Palmer Luckey. And Palmer, it is great to see you this morning, thanks so much for joining us.PALMER LUCKEY, FOUNDER, ANDURIL INDUSTRIES: Good to chat with you again, Maria.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, the last time we spoke, I came to Anduril Industries and you were showing me all of this great technology: the drone zone that your company produces. I wanted to get that, but the reason that we began on the Hong Kong protests and what took place with the Houston Rockets, is because you and I had this conversation before about American companies not seeing China as an adversary, but instead focusing all on the business opportunity in China. What's your reaction to this?LUCKEY: Well, I mean, we have this big problem where the biggest technology companies in the United States see China as their biggest revenue growth opportunity, and a lot of smaller tech companies see China as a huge investment opportunity -- that China Chinese money is going to flow into their company. And so, they make decisions that are based on this and often they'll say that they're doing things for one reason and behind scenes they're actually being influenced by this desire to work with the Chinese over American interests -- and that's not a good for our country.BARTIROMO: Yes, and we talked about this -- the two of us recently earlier last year because your company, Anduril Industries got the project Maven Contract -- I know you worked for government on lots of different projects but Google walked away from that project. Google balked at the company working with the U.S. government, but now Google has an A.I. lab -- an A.I. lab, probably the jewel of all artificial intelligence is at Google and that lab is in Beijing, your reaction?LUCKEY: I mean, I think I the big problem -- the big problem here is not just the U.S. companies are going to China; it's that the United States in many ways, is behind. You know, that's why I started my company because I wanted to build a defense company that was unapologetically hiring best people to work on national security problems. So, you know, obviously, I'm really concerned that there's other big tech companies that are, in many ways, working for the other side.BARTIROMO: Yes, I want to ask you about that. You are the tech genius that sold Oculus back in the day to Facebook, then you created Anduril Industries and you just unveiled your drone smashing interceptor. The small UAV designed to take out drones like consumer quadcopters by colliding them into one another. Given the prominent role drones play in modern warfare, tell me about Anduril and the technology that you are making to take out larger UAVs.LUCKEY: Sure. So, the system that you're talking to is called Anvil, it is a drone detection and countering system, so we're able to detect drones over military bases and other critical infrastructure; and we're able to send our own counter drone to go out and knock it out of the sky. And it's really important that the U.S. has this kind of technology -- we can't allow the skies over our military bases, our critical infrastructure to become Wild West.And the same goes for a lot of the bases and critical infrastructure of our allies; we need to make sure that we can protect our airspace, from these threats because you're already seeing, attacks in Saudi Arabia, and Afghanistan other things that are not necessarily public yet, and this trend is only going to accelerate. So, until we have control of the skies, we're going to have to be a lot more afraid of drones than we should be.BARTIROMO: So, tell me about that, the administration says that it was Iran, behind the attack on the Saudi oil facilities but that was done by a drone.LUCKEY: Right, I know, and I don't know who did it. That is not my area of expertise. My area of expertise is making sure that attacks like that don't happen; knocking those kinds drones out of the air before they attack your -- their target not afterwards. We can do all investigation we want, but in a perfect world, this attack never would have happened and we never would be talking about it and it wouldn't even be a thing worth discussing because it would have been stopped in its tracks by a system like ours.BARTIROMO: Which is why it's so important to -- and it brings me back to China, because China is using artificial intelligence very effectively. We are using A.I., that's why I did one hour special that Anduril and yourself were featured prominently in my A.I. special. But the issue is, is if China can have A.I. that basically tells the Chinese, our troop movements, you know, our weaponry movement this really speaks to the national security that we face as a result of China and its and its goals to get become the largest superpower.LUCKEY: Yes. Well, I mean we're not going to be able to beat China by just building faster aircraft, by building better hardware. You know, even if they have equivalent hardware to us, even if we have hardware that's slightly better, if they have better artificial intelligence, if they have a better ability to respond and coordinate effectively using artificial intelligence, we're going to be in a really bad place. So, what we really need to do is make sure that we match and then surpass China.And the goal here is not that we get into a huge conflict and that we beat them necessarily, it's to be so strong that they know they can't get into a conflict with us. You know, in the same way that having a strong counter drone system deters people from even trying to attack U.S. drones; having a strong artificial intelligence strategy, counters the abilities of people, to use artificial intelligence, to even contemplate attacking us.BARTIROMO: Do you feel that the U.S. does have that, Palmer? What can you tell us about the defense industry today in terms of the wherewithal, the money allocated to our defense, the use of drones versus our adversaries like China?LUCKEY: Well, right now U.S. defense companies, the main contractors do not have the technology, or the tools or the talent to build these types of systems. They don't have the best experts in computer vision, autonomy, artificial intelligence, machine-learning computer vision. Those are at these -- the best talent in the world is really at companies like Google, like Facebook, like Snapchat. And so, one of the things my company is trying to do is take people out of those places and putting them to work, on problems that are actually going to be of critical importance for our entire country.BARTIROMO: Yes, and you've done it by working with governments not just the U.S., but cross the world. Anduril Industries now valued at more than a billion dollars in a recent fund-raising round. Tell us where the growth comes from Anduril; what you are trying to do here with this company?LUCKEY: I'm trying to build a major defense company, a defense products company, not a defense contractor. I want to save taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars, and I want to make tens of millions of dollars, and we do both of those things by building technologies that keep the men and women who keep our country safe and making sure that American interests are protected long into the future no matter what the technology does.BARTIROMO: You know, one of the issues in this whole China fight is the fact that we have ethics in this country they don't. So, we have --LUCKEY: Yes, we talk about this a lot.BARTIROMO: Exactly! You know, we have ethics where, you know, you don't want to make the last decision in terms of the kill decision left to machine, right? So, talk a little about the ethics in terms the U.S. versus China. As we look at Chinese theft, U.S. researchers on front lines of the battle against it, now the Chinese are saying with these upcoming meetings on Thursday, we're going to put, you know, intellectual property theft on side; we don't want that to be one of the topics on Thursday's meetings.LUCKEY: Well, Maria, you got right to the heart of the issue, which is that this is not just a problem with the way that artificial intelligence is deployed; it's a problem with the way it's even developed. China's ethics are such that they're willing to steal our technology and our countries' technology and develop themselves. They're then willing to gather tons of training data for their artificial intelligence, by surveilling their entire population; monitoring everything that they do. And at the end, they're willing to deploy systems that countries like the United States would never want to deploy. The U.S. has a really good policy around making sure that a person is always responsible for what autonomous systems are doing.And China can afford to play faster and loose, because if you criticize them, you're going to prison or you're going to be disappeared -- or you're going to end up in a camp and that is not a problem that we have here in the United States. Our kind of the strong system of ethics and accountability that we have in the U.S., it's very important for us as a country to maintain who we are, but it does put us at a somewhat strategic disadvantage against a country that can go whatever it wants, whenever it wants with no accountability.BARTIROMO: Yes, and I don't know that if corporate America understands that very well, frankly, right now. Because they are more interested getting that market access, getting their products into the market of 1.4 billion people. I mean, just look at facial recognition and how China uses that, right? I mean, right now in Hong Kong, China is trying to get those facial recognition cameras back up and running again. You know, they knocked one; they're all right there so that they can identify exactly who's at protests. They're saying no more masks, they're demanding that the protesters do not wear masks because they know there will be consequences for whoever is seen at those protests.LUCKEY: Well, it's not just in Hong Kong, it's all around the world. China is distributing technology, to countries in Asia, to countries in Africa that will allow those countries to build totalitarian police states and their hope is that they make these countries dependent on China. You know, somewhat similar to the way that the Soviet Union deployed technology and weapons to their partners around the world, to try to bring them over to their world view.But what China is doing is far more dangerous because it makes these countries, not just dependent on China but also dependent on the Chinese world view that you need to surveil citizens control your citizens, and then remove the elements that you don't really like, and that's something that we don't believe in in America, our allies don't believe it. And so, we need to make sure that we're able to stop this threat.BARTIROMO: So, Palmer, what's your take on all of this conversation around technology in terms of regulation? You know, there's the privacy aspect of it and then there's the anti-trust and power aspect of it. Because you're looking at these companies more powerful than they ever have been. I'm talking about Facebook, and Google, and others which right now are caught in the middle of the debate on a how much regulation technology companies should face, what is your take on this?LUCKEY: I mean, I lean Libertarian. So, I'm generally not fan of having stronger regulations for over private sector companies, but I also think that the government has given a lot of special privileges to these technology companies and we need to re-examine whether it makes sense to give these companies special privileges that no other private sector companies have. Should we be giving them special government advantages, like immunity from certain liabilities that other companies have to deal with, and I think that the answer there a lot less clear.BARTIROMO: Well, I think this is a really important point that you make, and this is the point that Devin Nunes has made. The congressman is suing Twitter, because he calls them a content creator. And in fact, they -- he was victorious in the most recent trial over the weekend, with Twitter, but they say: no, we should be shielded from lawsuits because we are just a platform; we're not a media company.LUCKEY: Right, and I think if you exercise -- look, I'm OK with companies censoring all they want on platforms. But if you're going to censor ideas, if you're going to say that certain people and certain ideas are not allowed -- you know, I don't think that the government should necessarily be giving you special liability protection that were meant to preserve free speech and were meant to encourage open debate and discussion. You know, I'm not fan of regulation, I am a fan of the government not giving special advantages to one type of business over another when it isn't accomplishing any good.BARTIROMO: Yes, and by the way, the court decision on Friday Devin Nunes' team won on all fronts. The trial will move forward with Twitter. All right, let me switch gears and ask you about border a bit. I know you've done -- your drones have been used at the border and you see, really, the activity there. The president did a partnership with Mexico, did a partnership with Guatemala, have you seen the numbers come down in terms of the apprehensions at the border? What can you tell us about the border right now, Palmer?LUCKEY: So, I can't talk about specifics like that. You'd have to ask Customs and Border Protection. But you know, they are one of our customers -- our technology is deployed on the northern and the southern border across hundreds of square miles. I think that what you see is that when you put technology into a place on the border, like typically pattern we see, apprehension goes way up with our technology as soon as you're able to see everything that's going on, and then they plummet to almost nothing as soon as the cartels figure out that they can't get through in that area.And I think that what we need to do is take that approach and apply it to the entire border. So, they say, you know what, this -- it's not viable for us to just -- run thousands of pounds of drugs across these remote and unsecured areas. Obviously, they're still coming through other ways; they're going to try to come in to the ports, they're going to try to smuggle it in cargo containers, but at least that allows us to focus our resources on a few key ports of entry rather than thousands of miles of unsecured border. And so, that's one of the things that we've been doing with CBS -- is helping to be a part of that solution.BARTIROMO: We were just showing video I took to show to the border it was really stunning what we actually witnessed. Palmer, you are a patriot. It is great to have you on the program. Congrats to you! Thank you so much.LUCKEY: Thank you. I'll keep doing my best. See you next time.BARTIROMO: We hope you'll come back soon, Palmer. Great to talk with you. Palmer Luckey, is the Founder of Anduril Industries. Coming up, the battle of the media giants. Disney dueling it out with Netflix; banning all Netflix ads from all of the Disney networks. The escalating streaming war is coming up. Plus, stock alert; shares of G.E. getting a boost this morning after announcing it will freeze pension plans for thousands of U.S. employees. The move expected to cut the company's debt, stock is up a quarter percent. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The media is focused on impeachment and whistleblowers, but what about 2020 in the state of Democratic candidates? Joining us now, the host of "VARNEY & CO." Stuart Varney to weigh in. Good morning, Stu.STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I don't know why I'm smiling because, you know, first thing you do when you wake up on a Monday morning, you look at the media, and you look at what they're saying about impeachment and whistleblowers and all that stuff, then you got to ignore it and look below that what's really going on in the 2020 campaign. But to me, the Democrat presidential hopefuls are in a mess, a right royal mess.Joe Biden's got an op-ed in The Washington Post in which he says he is going to beat, "President Trump like a drum." He makes no mention whatsoever of Hunter Biden and the problems that he's got with the conflict of interest.Then you go on to -- let's see who else we got, Bernie Sanders, God bless him, we wish him well, but he's recovering from a heart attack, and I'm not sure how easily you can fit back into a rigorous campaign. It is true that Elizabeth Warren is gaining ground, she is getting a couple of key states, but we've got newspaper reports this morning that some key donors are balking. They don't want a socialist at the head of the Democrat ticket.Kamala Harris, she only gets eight percent support among California Democrats, that's her home state. Eight percent support in her home state.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.VARNEY: That's looking like a mess. I'll wrap it up for you, Maria, I don't think they can win and I don't think they're going anymore, and I think impeachment is sucking all the oxygen out of their campaign.BARTIROMO: Yes. Lindsey Graham on Sunday said to me, it was the most consequential week of the president reelection campaign because of all of the reasons you just mentioned, Stu.VARNEY: He's right.BARTIROMO: All right. I know you'll have more about it in 10 minutes. We will see you then.VARNEY: Sure.BARTIROMO: "VARNEY & CO." begins top of the hour right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Join Stuart in about 10 minutes' time.But first, Disney duals with Netflix, we've got it next. It us banning Netflix ads from all of its networks. We'll break down the battle of the media giants right after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, it is getting tough. The streaming wars are hitting fever pitch now. Disney is reportedly banning all Netflix ads across all of its networks.Joining us right now is FOX News Headlines 24/7 morning anchor, Brett Larson. Brett, good to see you.BRETT LARSON, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7 ANCHOR: Yes. Good to see you, guys. It is -- this may be the first shot across the bow in the golden age if streaming wars and that's what I'm calling it.Over the next of couple months, we're going to have dix to choose from, Disney+, Comcast Peacock, Apple+, HBO, and we already Netflix and Hulu. Netflix is, of course, the 800-pound gorilla. They have over a hundred million subscribers worldwide and they're seen as the largest target for all of these competing services.What we've already seen since Disney+ announced that they're going be launching a streaming service, a lot of content is slowly being yanked off of Netflix, a lot of the content that Disney owns. Comcast did the same thing that, you know, everybody's very concerned. The Office is leaving Netflix because it's going to go the, I think Comcast is calling it Peacock, that's their streaming service.So this is going to be interesting. And now Disney's saying, "We're not going to run advertisements for Netflix. Odd because they are running advertising for other streaming services, but as Disney says, Netflix doesn't run any advertising, which his true. Sometimes, the advertising is written into the show so it feels like it's part of the content and it's not like a in-your-face advertisement.So this is the first salvo in the -- in the streaming wars and pretty soon --BARTIROMO: But these two are the ones to beat, right? I mean where's Amazon on this?LARSON: Amazon's also in the picture so I guess that would be seven because Amazon has their prime video, which just won a bunch of awards. It was kind of interesting Emmys that all these streaming platforms and cable networks are winning the awards and not the broadcast networks.Plus, you've got -- you've got CBS All Access, you've got FoxFast.

THE TRADE WAR RAGES ONStates News ServiceSeptember 4, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 4470 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS):Scott Miller: I'm Scott.Bill Reinsch: I'm Bill.Group: We're The Trade Guys.Andrew Schwartz: You're listening to The Trade Guys, a podcast produced by CSIS where we talk about trade in terms that everyone can understand. I'm H. Andrew Schwartz and I'm here with Scott Miller and Bill Reinsch, the CSIS Trade Guys. The Trade Guys are back and they're here to talk about all the eye-popping news between the US and China as the trade war rages on. Meanwhile, the US and Japan appear to have their trade relationship back on track with a new agreement. We'll talk about all of that, and more, on this episode of The Trade Guys.Andrew Schwartz: The Trade Guys are back, school is in, and the trade war is escalating.Scott Miller: And traffic is terrible.Andrew Schwartz: Traffic's terrible.Scott Miller: Yes.Andrew Schwartz: It took me 45, 50 minutes to get in this morning.Scott Miller: It's all those people turning left at your school.Andrew Schwartz: That's right. They're all turning left. I left late today. My wife took the kids. I was in the pool and it still took me 45, 50 minutes to get here.Bill Reinsch: Really?Scott Miller: Yeah. It's the first day of everybody's new commuting pattern.Andrew Schwartz: Well, nobody's going to like it because today the market is way down as we speak. It's Tuesday, obviously, the day school's back in Montgomery County and in DC. There's a lot going on with the trade war escalating. On Sunday, President Trump's trade war with China entered new territory and the next round of tariffs took effect. It's interesting, Peterson, our colleagues over at the Peterson Institute have now come up with a new piece of data. They say that this move will bring the average tariffs on Chinese imports to 21.2% up from only 3.1% when President Trump came into office. That's pretty big.Bill Reinsch: That's huge, actually 20% on anything is going to be huge. It's going to get worse when the December ones go into effect.Andrew Schwartz: But, we're near maximum coverage on tariffs, right?Bill Reinsch: Yes, so-Scott Miller: Not quite. We're about 65%, 70% of imported goods from China are affected by the tariff. The plan is by December 15th though, almost a 100%.Bill Reinsch: I think it's like 97% will be covered by December 15th.Scott Miller: By December 15th, but you're right the average trade weighted tariff, but the United States is basically an open market. Our average trade weighted tariff on an MFN basis is around 3% actual collections are about 1.7%, so we generally have low tariffs on everything, almost everything. Now tariffs on Chinese goods are getting to the point where everybody starts to notice.Andrew Schwartz: I mean American tariffs on foreign goods have already climbed higher than any time since the '60s before Sunday. Then the United States imposes another new 15% tariff, and these levies are on food, clothing, lawn mowers, and thousands of other made in China products. This is almost nearly everything China ships to the United States.Bill Reinsch: The ones on Sunday will be significant because for the first time there are a lot of consumer items that will attack people right in their pocket book, clothing, shoes.Andrew Schwartz: This is stuff people buy Walmart.Bill Reinsch: Toys, furniture, electronics.Scott Miller: Toys are mostly in the December tranche and electronic stuff is mostly in the December tranche.Andrew Schwartz: It's just in time for Christmas?Bill Reinsch: Well, no, because it'll all be important before December 15th. I mean, the stuff that you're going to buy for Christmas presents that comes in in September and October, if not already in. In fact, shoppers today at Walmart may not. Well, it depends. They may not notice a difference because actually all the stuff that's there today certainly arrived before Sunday.Scott Miller: Correct.Bill Reinsch: Now that doesn't mean that Walmart won't take advantage of the situation and bump up a price or two in anticipation.Scott Miller: But Bill's overall point is right, so far the consumers have really not seen much in pricing that it's affected them directly.Andrew Schwartz: But now they're going to?Scott Miller: Well, likely. I mean, look, the first year of the tariffs on China, many of us were surprised when the average import price to the United States actually declined in the first year. You look on the macro level, it's hard to find the disruption. Now product by product, I'm certain there's a lot happening and a lot of adjustments in supply chains. Now, given the scope of the new tariffs and the basically complete coverage by December, if we're ever going to notice, we'll notice now.Bill Reinsch: It'll be interesting to go back and look at this six or eight months from now to see what happened, because it's an interesting example of the argument that we've exploded, I think on this podcast in the past, about who pays.Andrew Schwartz: Yeah.Bill Reinsch: Because Trump keeps getting the Chinese to pay and the fact is the Chinese don't pay the importer pays. But, it is also true that if you're an American buyer and you have a lot of market power, Walmart might be a good example, you can sometimes go back to your supplier and say, "Will you give us a deal because I'm going to buy 8,000 dozen of this kind of tee shirt? If you can't lower your price a little bit, maybe I won't do that." The big guys come out of this sometimes being able to force some of the costs back on the Chinese, whereas the little guys don't have any leverage and they can't do that. Clear that that's going to happen all the time. In the end it ends up being in the gray area where the Chinese will eat some, the retailer will eat some, and the consumer will eat some. It's not entirely clear cut. What is clear cut is the Chinese don't not pay at all, and we know that.Scott Miller: The Chinese government?Bill Reinsch: Chinese.Andrew Schwartz: Are they hurting from this?Bill Reinsch: Oh yeah.Scott Miller: Yes. I mean, look, I think we've characterized it before as given the economic relationship, the US has more ability to inflict harm on China. China has more ability to absorb harm and then to absorb the pain. But, this is hurting, and you can see it in their economic numbers appear to be slowing down. This is a factor in it.Bill Reinsch: But they'd been slowing down for other reasons.Scott Miller: Yes.Bill Reinsch: I mean, it's hard. These things always get complicated because you're trying to tease out a single cost when there are many. Their economy has been slowing down more or less for the last couple of years. Growth is still around 6%, which people here would kill for. For them it's a significant reduction-Andrew Schwartz: It's low for them.Bill Reinsch: From what it had been, and it's beginning to get worse. Wage rates have been rising anyway. We think that, I mean, I shouldn't speak for Scott, I think that the way that Xi Jinping is conducting the economy, which is channeling more credit to the state on enterprises, more credit to the unprofitable parts of the economy, and not to the vibrant private sector part, is only making things worse. There's a lot of things that are happening in the Chinese economy that are bad, one of which is tariffs but it's not the only thing,Andrew Schwartz: The latest tariffs bring the total US tariffs on China to about 360 billion worth of imports. That's nothing to sneeze at.Bill Reinsch: No.Scott Miller: Well that's correct. It is a lot of what we import from China, but in the context of a $22 trillion annual economy here. You got to keep all in perspective.Andrew Schwartz: Right.Scott Miller: This is the kind of pressure that the president intends to apply and force all the supply chain operators to revisit whether or not they want to relocate, whether they want to hedge and move production out of China. Once those decisions to move supply chain partners, and use partners that are not in China, those decisions kind of have semi-permanence to them. Once you've hedged, qualified a new supplier, gotten new production up and running, it probably doesn't revert back even with a removal of the tariffs.Andrew Schwartz: So Scott, is is the administration's objective to push United States companies out of China or is it to force China to make concessions that result in US companies being treated more fairly in China?Scott Miller: It seems to me that their objective is the latter. Their tactic is the former. In other words, they're using supply chain pressure, pressure on supply chain operators, including those with American headquarters to make different decisions to apply pressure to the government of China. What they're really looking for is fair treatment. Keep in mind, not every American company or every American enterprise that operates in China is a supply chain operator. There are many, KFC would be a good example, or Walmart operates a lot of stores in China. They basically are in China to serve the Chinese consumer.Andrew Schwartz: I hear by order Kentucky Fried Chicken out of China.Bill Reinsch: Why? It's not-Scott Miller: Yeah, right. It's a really different business model. My general motors sells more cars in China than they sell in United States.Andrew Schwartz: Yeah.Scott Miller: So these companies that are in business to serve the Chinese consumer have a different profile and are certainly would like fairer treatment. On the other hand as pressures escalate from the United States, I think that we are likely to see a number of US firms in China face pressure from the Chinese government whether it's delayed regulatory approvals, or additional inspections, or whatever it might be. It's never been easy to operate in China. It's likely to get tougher for those firms.Bill Reinsch: Yeah, I'd answer the question a different way. I think Scott is basically right, but I think within the administration there are differences of view about this. I think there are some people in the administration who think the decoupling, which is what you're talking about, is a good idea and that is what we should be pursuing. I don't think that's the President's goal. I think the President wants a deal. That's the way he thinks and what a deal is for him tends to change from time to time, which is why people are confused.Sometimes a deal is let's buy a whole bunch of soybeans or let's sell them a whole bunch of soybeans. LNG airplanes, cut the deficit, declare victory. Other times there are these structural issues that we've talked about for weeks that really need to be addressed, and if the Chinese won't address them, we can't have a deal. He has not yet accepted big buys as a solution. On the other hand, you don't really know what he's prepared to accept as a solution. I think what he wants to be able to do is declare victory to the American people and say, "I've made things better for you," and decoupling, I think, is hard to say that's better for anybody. He wants to come back with a victory saying, "I forced them to change their practices. I forced them to buy more stuff," and he is the president, so that's the policy that will prevail.Scott Miller: In the interim, he's basically saying, "Somebody had to do this. Okay, I wish one of my predecessors would have done it, but somebody had to and I'm the guy."Andrew Schwartz: Okay, but so maybe he can say that, but hasn't the trade war turned into something of a quagmire at this point?Bill Reinsch: Well, yes, they're locked in one of these embraces that they neither one can get out of, because right now I think it's not in the interest of either a to pull out. I mean, Trump has spent a year, two years, talking about how important this is, what a big deal it is, also how close to a deal we are, how much progress we're making, how much they're suffering, how anxious they are and make a deal. If he pulls out, that's failure, which is not really in his vocabulary, but that's admitting failure and exposes himself to enormous criticism.Scott Miller: For the Chinese, the closer we get to our election, the closer they get to potentially having a different counterparty, so they're going to wait it out.Bill Reinsch: If they pull out it allows Trump to blame it all on them, which gives him not really a victory but something he can call better than a defeat. It also, I think, undermines the role the Chinese are trying to play globally, which is to say, "Hey, we are the good guys. We are the sustainer of the trading system." I don't know that anybody believes that, but that's what they're saying. If they pull out, I think they undermine that. It gives Trump an excuse to blame them. And Scott is exactly right. I don't think they've figured out, as nobody has figured out, how our election is going to come out. It's got to be tempting for them to continue this for awhile.Scott Miller: Just wait to see.Bill Reinsch: Wait and see what happens, but you see Trump's going to wait and see what happens too. The best thing for him, I think, is to make a deal in October of 2020. Because if he does it sooner than that it has time to fall apart. It won't be a good agreement because they're not going to give us everything that he wants. So, he has a choice of a week agreement or continue the war. What he will do, I think, is take a weak agreement. Say it's a strong agreement, declare victory, and hope that nobody figures out that that's not true before they vote. But that means he has to drag these talks on for another year, because if he makes a deal this September or next month, it's going to fall apart in the intervening period. If he waits a year, maybe he gets away with it. I think he's in the talks for the long haul. The Chinese are in the talks for the long haul. It's what you said, it's a quagmire because neither one is going to agree to what the other one wants, but neither one is willing to pull out.Andrew Schwartz: Meanwhile for Donald Trump, consumers may start to feel this, particularly his voters.Scott Miller: Well they may, but keep-Bill Reinsch: We say that, but look at the farmers.Andrew Schwartz: Yeah, right they're feeling it and it hasn't shaken them in terms of their vote.Scott Miller: They're still with him. A year from now, I mean, there's a term in consumer marketing called meeting and an initiative in the base. You launch it in January of one year, the next year it's part of your base period. He's going to meet the tariffs in the base right before the election. The economy, since all our comparisons are versus year ago may actually look rosy given the tariffs are in the base end of post. It's not a bad gamble on his part. Also, I would point out, there is no challenge to the substance of the policy from his political opponents, from Senator Schumer, to any of the democratic candidates for president.Bill Reinsch: That's right only the implementation not the goal.Scott Miller: There's criticism on the implementation, but not the policy itself.Bill Reinsch: In fact, most of the politicians are falling all over themselves to take an even tougher line than he has.Scott Miller: Right.Bill Reinsch: For example, when he put or implied the Huawei was in play as a bargaining chip, he took enormous grief from his own party beginning with Senator Rubio but also Senator Schumer and host of Democrats who said, "It's a national security issue. You can't put it on the table."Andrew Schwartz: Well, isn't there a case to be made also though that he's got problems coming at him from small business owners as well. I mean, something caught my eye this week too. Wall Street Journal survey that showed that economic confidence among small US businesses is at its lowest since November, 2012, so he's got heat coming from there as well.Bill Reinsch: Still waiting for that to show up in political polling though.Andrew Schwartz: Yeah.Bill Reinsch: He's still got what, 90% support in most Republicans?Scott Miller: 88% according to Gallup, but 90% is a good reference number among same party support. That's why there is no challenger for the party nomination.Andrew Schwartz: He's not feeling the heat from the Democrats, not feeling the heat from his own party. He fine, he can work it out.Scott Miller: The main street economy continues to be relatively strong.Bill Reinsch: That's what I think things will turn on. Do we begin to slide into recession in the first part of next year, which will make everyone nervous? We seem to be going through these waves of recession panic. We went through one in February because there were fourth quarter of 2018 results were not so great. Everybody was predicting a recession either later this year or early next year. Then the next tranche of data looked pretty good, so in May and June people weren't talking about that anymore.Scott Miller: There were earlier this month.Bill Reinsch: Earlier this month, well last month in August, we had recession panic all over it.Scott Miller: Yeah, the inverted yield curve sent everybody into a panic. But look, the basic consumer numbers are holding up. Employment is still strong. There's some things that indicate that how people feel about the economy may be different than what the numbers say.Andrew Schwartz: Why do you think the Democrats aren't more critical of Trump and his erratic handling of the Chinese?Bill Reinsch: You know, I asked one of them about that. There were multiple answers. One was, well, we are, but people aren't paying attention. Another one was, because we're spending way too much time responding to every tweet rather than looking at the bigger picture. The guy is a master at changing the subject. Every day he rolls out a new enemy, a new thing that you've got to deal with. A lot of them are not able to resist the temptation to go after the outrage of the moment instead of concentrating on the bigger picture.Andrew Schwartz: They're basically saying he's rendered them powerless.Bill Reinsch: They wouldn't put it that way.Scott Miller: Keep in mind, on this issue, the issue of China, the American people, and Bruce Stokes as data shows this, the American people believe China is an unfair trading partner. Okay, they believe that, so if you're going to pick on somebody, that's fine. They do not perceive Europe, or Japan, or Canada, or Mexico that way, so the voters are basically saying the president's right about identifying them as an unfair trading partner. That's why nobody challenges the policy, I think.Andrew Schwartz: Even though the way he's handling it is-Scott Miller: Oh, they'll nitpick the way he handles it.Bill Reinsch: They're criticizing the way he handles it.Andrew Schwartz: Yeah, but it's not sustained. It's not loud. It's not, "This isn't the right guy to handle it."Bill Reinsch: Maybe because everybody's been away. There hasn't been anybody here in Washington doing the daily briefing or anything. They've all been out meeting with constituents. The last debate was at the end of July, so we haven't had the candidates making nationwide public statements. They've all been at the Iowa State Fair or a various other places. I think once people come back into town, next week, you're going to hear a more coordinated approach.Andrew Schwartz: Why haven't we heard more from business leaders? I mean, it's made the market uncertain at best. The market's been up, it's been down. It looks like Trump's playing with the market even. Why haven't we heard more from business leaders about this?Bill Reinsch: Well, you've heard from the Roundtable and you've heard from the US Chamber. I can't remember if NAM has said anything recently.Andrew Schwartz: Well, we're not hearing from major investors, are we?Bill Reinsch: No, I don't know. I'm not.Scott Miller: Well, it's a missing piece. Keep in mind, their experience with China is not all that different than voters. I mean, companies doing business in China, and you can see this in the US China business council surveys, are generally they're making money. They know they have to be there because of the size of the consumer market, but they're not happy about the way they're being treated, and they don't think it's going to improve anytime soon. So, for some companies in some respects, they probably agree with what the president's doing.Andrew Schwartz: It sounds like you all think that there's some support for what President Trump's doing.Bill Reinsch: There's support for his ideas, there's support for his goal. There's not a lot of support for tariffs as an instrument. Most people think that that's an instrument that's doomed to fail, that he's not going to achieve what he's wants. There's been a couple of surveys of American companies doing business in China recently and I mean, they say what, what Scott said, "They're all making money, but they're all unhappy because of the way they're being treated." Fewer of them than you might think are seriously considering leaving. But, of the ones that are seriously considering leaving, I think, all but 3% of them are considering going somewhere else other than the United States.If the message from the President is come home, that's not being heard. They're not coming home. They're going to Vietnam, they're going to Bangladesh, they're going to India, they're going to Indonesia, they're going to 50 places, but not the United States.Scott Miller: It's a lot of hedging, but if you're hedging, you don't want to be in the newspapers. You don't want to be making public statements. You want to just hedge.Bill Reinsch: The ones that are not going are not going for the reason that Scott said. That is, despite all the talk here, they're not in China to import back into the United States. They're in China to meet the demands of Chinese consumers, to serve the Chinese market. Now, some of them ship stuff back here, and those are the people that Trump likes to attack. It's like KFC, they're not shipping chicken back to the United States. They're in China to sell chicken to Chinese.Andrew Schwartz: All right, in this quagmire, what do you guys think happens next in the short term?Scott Miller: Sound and fury signifying nothing.Bill Reinsch: Yes, exactly, a lot of drama. They're locked in this embrace. I don't think they get out of it for a year, so we can have this conversation 12 more times at least.Scott Miller: The US China tensions will be like the standard and poor 500 which has crossed the 2,900 mark about 30 times since January of 2017, or 2018.Andrew Schwartz: Oh man, so we're for a ride here.Scott Miller: You're in for a cycle here, buckle up.Andrew Schwartz: Buckle up?Scott Miller: Yeah.Andrew Schwartz: All right. Let's turn to Japan quickly. What happened with Japan? Japan, that's a good news story, right?Bill Reinsch: Well, maybe. It does reveal the tendency, I think, which transcends this administration to announce things before they're finished. In trade agreements that's dangerous. When they say we've reached an agreement in principle, what that means is we haven't agreed on the fine print yet.Andrew Schwartz: That's not an agreement, right.Bill Reinsch: There's a good bit of fine print in this beginning with will the Japanese get a commitment from Donald Trump not to impose automobile tariffs?Andrew Schwartz: It's a big one.Bill Reinsch: He has not said that he's committed to that. After the Mexican episode, which I put great stock in, where here's a case where we negotiate an agreement, painfully, sign it, and six months later he declares across the board tariffs on Mexicans, because of something completely different. Then he doesn't do it, but he declares it. Anybody watching that is going to say, "Why do I believe him?"Scott Miller: But we've got to be prepared to cope with the difference in language between what the President says and what people, particularly in Washington who are in the trade business, hear. What we hear, a US Japan trade agreement. We see a stack of papers about 18 inches high with all kinds of detailed commitments and obligations that are mutually agreed and mutually reinforced. We see a lot of complexity. The President sees a deal. He's got a deal probably on a few products nobody really knows. The headlines are about a few products.Bill Reinsch: Beef and pork.Scott Miller: Beef and pork. We know there's not going to be zero tariffs on automobiles. The 2.5% tariff stays in place apparently, but we don't know any of the parameters. That stack of papers is not going to suddenly materialize. What the President wants to do is he wants deals. He does not want comprehensive trade agreements.Andrew Schwartz: Does this thing stack up to the TPP or what?Scott Miller: Oh, no.Andrew Schwartz: Not at all?Scott Miller: Apparently not.Andrew Schwartz: It's just a smaller bilateral-Bill Reinsch: Yes, but don't sell it off completely because the inclusion of digital trade language is important and useful. It's probably gold standard language. If it came from USMCA, or it's USMCA plus, and it's a good thing, but it's not comprehensive.Scott Miller: Will there be coverage of services? We don't know. Will there be a chapter on investment? We don't know, probably not. Will there be chapters on conformity assessment and regulation? We don't know, to be determined.Andrew Schwartz: When are you guys going to get the actual details on this and be able to geek out on it?Scott Miller: Well, I'm counting on a Chairman Grassley and a Chairman Neal to demand it fairly soon.Andrew Schwartz: Yeah, that's got to be coming.Bill Reinsch: I think, well, they're not going to get anything until after UN General Assembly time when it's something that's signed or announced. I think, the big reveal is being delayed until Abe and Trump meet in New York at the end of September. Even then, I mean, I don't think there's going to be an agreement unless Abe gets what he wants on autos. And so, you can raise the question is anybody going to believe anything that the president says? But if he doesn't say it, I don't think there's going to be an agreement anyway.Andrew Schwartz: Well, we'll have to watch that one too and wait for the fine print.Scott Miller: Yes.Andrew Schwartz: To be continued. Guys, it's good to be back. School is in and we'll have to watch out for the traffic.Bill Reinsch: Indeed.Andrew Schwartz: To our listeners. If you have a question for the Trade Guys, write us at tradeguys@csis.org That's tradeguys@csis.org We'll read some of your emails and have the trade guys react to it. We're also now on Spotify, so you can find us there when you're listening to the Rolling Stones, or you're listening to Tom Petty, or whatever you're listening to. Thank you, Trade Guys.Scott Miller: Thanks, Andrew.Andrew Schwartz: You've been listening to the Trade Guys, a CSIS podcast.Load-Date: September 5, 2019End of Document

SPEECH BY H.E. LIU XIAOMING, CHINESE AMBASSADOR TO THE UK, AT THE OFFICIAL BANQUET OF THE CHINA-UK BUSINESS LEADERS FORUM: PRODUCE NEW OUTCOMES AND PROVIDE NEW IMPETUSStates News ServiceSeptember 5, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 873 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: L, City of London BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:From Chinese Embassy in UK2019/09/05Guildhall, City of London, 3 September 2019Lord Mayor Alderman Peter Estlin,Mr. Richard Burn,Distinguished Guests,Ladies and Gentlemen:Good evening!It is a real delight to join you at the official banquet of the China-UK Business Leaders Forum hosted by the City of London.Today is my "City Day".Early in the morning, I was at the London Stock Exchange for the Market Open in honour of the 15th World Chinese Entrepreneurs Convention coming to London.Right after that, I was here in the Guildhall for the International Forum for Green Finance hosted by Asian Financial Cooperation Association.And now, here I am again joining you for the banquet of the China-UK Business Leaders Forum.Never before in my more than nine years as Chinese Ambassador to the UK have I ever visited the City three times and given three speeches on economic and financial subjects in a single day!I think this gives full testament to the vitality of China-UK financial cooperation. It shows the financial sectors of our two countries are bound together in a community with shared interests in win-win cooperation.The international financial sector is experiencing enormous transformation. This is as a result of constant upgrading of new technologies such as big data and cloud computing, which is giving birth to new concepts such as fin-tech, inclusive finance and green finance.I cannot agree more with the theme of today's forum, namely, "A Partnership for Sustainable and Innovative Growth". I think it reflects the new trend in the development of international financial services. And it encourages us to explore new frontiers of China-UK financial cooperation.We must all ask ourselves this question as we go forward: Where do we go from here for China-UK financial cooperation? How can we achieve greater progress?I think we should make the following three efforts.First, we should match our comparative strengths.The City of London, as a top financial centre in the world, has a time-honoured history, extensive management expertise and a rich talent pool.At the same time, London is also the world's largest RMB offshore trading centre and the second largest RMB offshore clearing centre. It is home to overseas branches of eight banks and many insurance companies from China.China, with its newly-acquired financial strength, and the UK, with its traditional financial power, have comparative strengths in financial services, management and innovation. The strengths of our two countries combined could achieve multiplying effect.Second, we should fully leverage the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).BRI could add wings to China-UK financial cooperation.Britain is the first major Western country to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the first to sign the Guiding Principles on Financing the Development of the Belt and Road, and the first to appoint a special envoy and set up an expert board for BRI.China and the UK have also worked together to launch the G20 Green Finance Study Group, signed an agreement on cooperation in third markets, and issued the China-UK Strategic Plan for Financial Services.China-UK cooperation on BRI and at multilateral forums will surely have a positive, extensive and profound impact on the world.Third, we should make full use of China's opening-up policies.China is deepening reform and opening its door wider to the world. It has taken concrete steps to open up the financial sector.In April last year, China issued detailed measures and a timetable for further opening up the financial sector. Last July, the Chinese Government announced 11 measures, including bringing forward the deadline for lifting the foreign ownership caps in joint venture firms in sectors such as securities, future and life insurance from 2021 to 2020. This speedy opening up promises a brighter future for China-UK financial cooperation.Talking about China-UK financial cooperation, I would speak highly of a special project. At the end of last year, Lord Mayor Alderman Estlin and I witnessed the launch of the China-UK Charity Initiative. This is a joint venture between Chinese and British financial sectors. I am glad to see that in less than a year, this initiative has borne fruitful results. It has funded a school for poor children in Shaanxi Province (e•,cu), and it will launch a heath care project in a poor village in Yunnan Province.I wish the China-UK Charity Initiative great success. I am sure it will make greater contribution to the charity work of our two countries.Ladies and Gentlemen:The Chinese people often say, "We should seize the day and seize the hour."We are living in a complex and constantly-changing world. It is a world full of new opportunities and new challenges. It is a world that offers invaluable opportunities for China-UK financial cooperation.I hope and believe that the financial communities of our two countries will tap the potential and seize the opportunities. I can count on you to make sure that China-UK financial cooperation will produce new outcomes and provide new impetus for financial and economic growth in the world!Thank you!Load-Date: September 9, 2019End of Document

US travel industry to Chinese tourists: What trade war?Associated Press Financial WireOctober 28, 2019 Monday 5:21 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 1365 wordsByline: By BANI SAPRA, AP Business WriterDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - Washington, D.C., has dangled hotel discounts tied to the Chinese Lunar New Year.Arizona has promoted its outdoor attractions to draw visitors during another popular Chinese holiday.San Francisco has expanded its social media presence on Chinese apps to market year-round travel to millennial tourists.Across the country, the U.S. tourism industry is trying to counter one of the casualties of the trade war with China that is still raging despite a temporary truce this month: A drop in the flow of affluent Chinese visitors to the U.S. As the conflict has dragged on for 15 months with no meaningful breakthrough, the travel industry is trying to minimize the damage.It has good reason. An enlarged Chinese middle class has become a lucrative market for the U.S. travel industry. Close to 3 million Chinese tourists visited the U.S. last year. And they spent liberally: An estimated average of $6,700 per person per trip - exceeding the average spending of international tourists by more than 50% - according to the U.S. Travel Association.Concerns among U.S. tourism agencies have grown as Beijing has warned that Chinese travelers to the United States may face harassment. Compounding the problem is increased difficulty in obtaining U.S. visas.The number of visitors from China dropped nearly 4% in the first half of this year after a nearly 6% drop in 2018. More broadly, the U.S. share of the global travel market has slipped in the past year, and travel and hospitality groups blame the trade conflicts and intensified competition from rival countries. To close the gap, they've urged the government to extend funding for the U.S. national tourism marketing agency and to work more closely with overseas trade fairs and tour groups.At the same time, tourism marketing agencies for states and cities are hedging their bets by intensifying their outreach to countries other than China. Utah and Los Angeles, among others, are trying to expand their presence in nations like India, whose large and youthful middle class is seen as a potentially rich source of tourist dollars.Yet there is no easy way to replace a drop in Chinese tourism. Some U.S. tourism agencies say they worry that Chinese travelers feel unwelcome in the country under the Trump administration. Warnings from Beijing about traveling to the U.S. have likely reinforced that view."With the trade war, with some of the travel warnings, with some of our visa challenges that we've had, we've seen a little bit of a dip in Chinese visitors," said Theresa Belpulsi, a senior official at Destination DC, the city's tourism marketing office.Tourism is one of the few industries where the U.S. has enjoyed a substantial advantage over China. In 2018, Chinese tourists traveling to the U.S. spent $30 billion more than American tourists visiting China did. Yet that edge may be shrinking."The U.S. is just losing market share," said Adam Sacks, president of consulting company Tourism Economics. "Something's made the U.S. uncompetitive, and I would target the trade war as one of the reasons."Larry Yu, a professor of hospitality management at George Washington University, warns that once impressions of an unwelcome environment take hold, they're hard to erase."The trade war creates a kind of environment in China that makes people think twice," Yu said. "Even though we know that Chinese demand is high, the current environment makes people substitute the U.S. for another place."Beijing has issued two warnings to would-be visitors to the United States - one about gun violence, the other about harassment by U.S. law enforcement.Visa approvals for Chinese visitors have meanwhile become more difficult. The rejection rate for Chinese tourist visa applications to the U.S. reached 17% in the 2018 fiscal year from a low of 8.5% in 2013.Some tourism companies are feeling squeezed. DFS Hawaii, which operates duty-free stores in Hawaiian airports, plans to shed a quarter of its workforce and has pointed to a drop-off in tourists from China and elsewhere in Asia as a reason. As of August, Chinese tourist visits to Hawaii are down 27% this year."There is no foreseeable indication this will be reversed in the near term," said Tim DeLessio of the DFS Group, parent company of DFS Hawaii.Sacks of Tourism Economics says he holds out hope that local travel marketing agencies can reverse the trend. The District of Columbia, for one, says its outreach to China has intensified. Destination DC's latest initiative - hotel discounts for the Lunar New Year early in 2020, with events and performances tailored for Chinese tourists - builds on a sister-city partnership with Beijing.San Francisco's social media expansion to three new Chinese apps marks its latest effort to draw more Chinese tourists. Ads the city created and hosted on two popular Chinese apps, WeChat and Weibo, drove 12 million people to a contest promoting the city's landmarks, according to the San Francisco Travel Association.Meanwhile, Arizona leveraged social media and Ctrip, a Chinese travel website, to urge visitors to check out the state's outdoor and wellness activities during the popular Golden Week holiday period this month.But the number of Chinese who traveled abroad fell 15% during the week-long holiday compared with a year ago, according to the Chinese government. Many would-be tourists opted to stay home and experience the celebrations planned for the 70th anniversary of Communist Party rule.At a gathering of industry CEOs in September, leading travel brands urged the government to stem the eroding U.S. share of the global market by guaranteeing future funding for Brand USA, a tourism marketing agency. Entry fees paid by international travelers entering the United States fund that agency. But its dedicated funding expires next year. If it does, tourism from China and other countries could drop, travel industry officials warn, and American jobs might be put at risk."Without Brand USA, we would be in an even worse situation vis-a-vis our international competitors," said Heather McCrory, CEO of Accor, a leading hotel group.Even New York City, which enjoyed a surge in tourism this year thanks in part to the new Hudson Yards development and World Pride Day, has grown concerned about attracting Chinese visitors."We can't control the market conditions," said Christopher Heywood of NYC & Company, the city's official tourism marketing agency. "The geopolitics comes into play."In the meantime, some U.S. competitors may gain an edge. The European Travel Commission, which says Europe welcomed 14 million Chinese last year, has joined with its Chinese counterparts at travel shows and partnered with Chinese celebrities to share videos and social media posts involving Europe.American tourism agencies say they're seeking other potential sources of visitors in India and elsewhere. But Indian tourists are still less accustomed to traveling in the United States."There's a great deal of interest," said Jamie Foley of the Los Angeles Tourism and Convention Board. "But that comes with the understanding that India is very different from China."Left with little choice, the U.S. travel industry is redoubling its efforts to engage with Chinese tourists while waiting out the trade war."The trade war's an important subject, but it's seen as a temporary setback," said Sage Brennan, co-founder of the consulting firm China Luxury Advisors. "Over the next 20 to 30 years, China is going to continue to impact and shape the tourism market."Mindful of that likelihood, David O'Donnell of the Greater Boston Convention and Visitors Bureau, said that city has built a pipeline of projects to try to drive tourism from China. Boston is working with China's Hainan Airlines to showcase the city and with Boston's airports to develop additional routes to China. It's also seeking partnerships with China Union Pay and Ctrip, the Chinese travel website."Are we concerned that the trade war may impact the travel trade?" O'Donnell said. 'Of course. Are we frustrated by new and more restrictive visa policies? Absolutely. But we know that Boston will always be very appealing to the China market. We are in to stay."Load-Date: October 29, 2019End of Document

Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, September 5th. Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.U.S.-China trade talks back on, Chinese and American officials will have a face-to-face meeting -- several meetings in Washington in early October. That will happen in the next couple of weeks.And it is fueling a rally in stocks this morning. Take a look. We've got the Dow Industrials right now up 258 points, about 1 percent. S&P is up 27. And the Nasdaq is up 93.This on top of the big rally yesterday after, remember, Hong Kong's controversial extradition bill was formally withdrawn. The market was up 237 points on the Dow yesterday on that news. S&P was up 31. And the Nasdaq was up 103 points -- that was one and a third percent yesterday.Global markets this morning are mostly higher although we are looking at weakness in the U.K. FT 100 down 43 points. There was another sign of slowing in the European economy when we got the German factory orders report out. They were down in the month of July, worse than expected.Nonetheless, Dax index is up 93 points today -- that's three quarters of 1 percent. And the CAC 40 in Paris is up 49. Perhaps that report indicating more stimulus is on the way and certainly the perception of that is what's driving markets there in Europe.Asian markets this morning are mostly flat. Hong Kong was down. The Hang Seng down just slightly over concerns that protests will continue despite the extradition bill being dropped.Good op in the Journal this morning as the Chinese leadership is now charging Jimmy Lai who you saw in this program.Tracking Hurricane Dorian, the storm gaining strength overnight. It is now back up to a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 115 miles an hour, moving up the East Coast, taking aim at the Carolinas now. We're going take you there live this morning.Meanwhile the death toll in the Bahamas up to at least 20 people dead as rescue efforts continue and aid starts making its way to the devastated areas.Meanwhile this -- more security issues at Facebook, reports that hundreds of millions of user phone numbers have been exposed. What you need to know, coming up.The top colleges in America, the "Wall Street Journal" this morning is out with its latest rankings. Find out which one tops the list. We've got the list here from the Journal. Wait until you hear this.All those stories coming up this Thursday morning. And joining me to break it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; commentary writer at the "Federalist", Emily Jashinsky is here; and assistant editorial page editor at the "Wall Street Journal" James Freeman.Great to see everybody this morning.JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, "WALL STREET JOURNAL": Good to be here.BARTIROMO: Yes, a lot going on.FREEMAN: Yes. Waiting on those big jobs numbers to tell us how the economy is really doing.BARTIROMO: The ADP number will be out in about an hour and 15 minutes and that will give us some sense of what we might see for the jobs number out on Friday.Op ed in the Journal this morning on Beijing, cracking down on Jimmy Lai, the activist who has been very vocal about look, if that extradition bill were to go through, Hong Kong is over.FREEMAN: Yes.BARTIROMO: But it's not -- I don't know that the protest stops because the people on the ground want universal suffrage. They want to be able to vote for their local leaders.FREEMAN: That's right. And I think that's why the Chinese been intransigent so long may really create a problem here. If they had simply withdrawn that extradition bill weeks and weeks ago, maybe the protests would not have gone this far to where as you say.Now the demands have gotten much broader. They want independent inquiries on police brutality. They want as you say more democracy and they're entitled to it.BARTIROMO: I wonder if this is creating a pressure for Xi Jinping as he deals with President Trump.EMILY JASHINSKY, COMMENTARY WRITER: THE FEDERALIST: Well, and President Trump wants it to create pressure, certainly. So I imagine that it is.BARTIROMO: Well when Jimmy Lai came on this program, he basically appealed to the U.S. government saying, please, stand with Hong Kong.JASHINSKY: Yes.BARTIROMO: And then you've got those protesters holding the American flag. So we're going to talk about that coming up.But our top story this hour is Hurricane Dorian. Again, it is back up to a Category 3 storm. It is now taking aim at the Carolinas, the area bracing for potentially life-threatening storm surges and damaging winds.Jeff Flock is in the middle of it all. He's live in Charleston, South Carolina with the very latest. Have you moved -- Jeff? Because -- well, earlier you were in water -- floodwaters up unto your knees. Are you in a different spot now?JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Different spot now and same problem -- Maria. We've got serious street flooding in Charleston. And we're not even in the worst of it yet.You know, we didn't expect this to get back to Category 3 and that's where we are right now. This is Calhoun Street, one of the main streets that runs through Charleston and maybe you see, we're again, up in almost knee level here.And we expect, according to the National Weather Service and the Hurricane Center, 12 -- as much as 12 inches of rain. We've already got -- we're nowhere near that yet. We've already got a serious situation.This street is obviously impassable and there are a lot of them like this here and we are getting pelted by rain right now and wind. I don't think we'll get full Category 3 conditions today. They may get them farther up the coast in North Carolina tomorrow.But it's worth saying we're getting pretty strong conditions now and we're still maybe 40 miles away from the center of circulation. So I think it's going to worse before it gets better here. Hate to throw that cliche out at you but that's pretty much where we are right now in downtown Charleston, South Carolina.You know, they don't call this, Maria, the low country for nothing. It is low here and that's why we've got this problem.BARTIROMO: Incredible reporting, Jeff, in the middle of it all. I wish you had a hat on. It's really looking really bad out there. Thank you so much for your reporting.Jeff Flock in Charleston this morning.Want to turn to the new NAFTA. Congress is back in session on this Monday. Lawmakers returning with a big to-do list, passing USMCA is among the priorities.President Trump's trade deal with Mexico and Canada is a top priority for Republicans this fall but the NAFTA revision stalling in the House as Democrats delay the vote.Joining us right now is Fox News Contributor, former speaker of the house, and the author of "Collusion" -- Newt Gingrich. And Newt -- it is great to see you. Thanks so much for being here.NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It's good to be with you. And you know, I think this is a pretty good contrast to draw. The President and the Republicans should just keep emphasizing, if you want the economy to grow, if you want to create jobs, you have to pass this bill to open up our relationship with Canada and Mexico. And just simply keep the pressure up on Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats.It's a little tricky for them to worry about a potential recession while blocking the biggest single trade deal that they're going to get in the near future. And I think the President could have a very winning hand on this.And if you look at the big winners in this bill, for example, the American agriculture, there could be a lot of pressure brought to bear on the Democrats in both the House and the Senate to pass this and help the American economy keep growing.BARTIROMO: So -- I mean you were once in Pelosi's position -- speaker of the house. She's got the power to defer the vote. Is it just all politics? Why is she deferring this vote? Why not take it to the floor?GINGRICH: Well, I think it's -- look, first of all, any trade agreement that's complicated has something you could say oh, if only that were fixed. If only we had a better labor part. If only we had a better environment part. You can always find an excuse.But the fact is Canada, Mexico and the U.S. have agreed to this. Ultimately it comes down to yes or no. I think the pressure on Speaker Pelosi, particularly from the radical left, to do nothing which gives President Trump a victory is very, very real.And that's why you have to build counter-veiling pressure about the jobs issue and why are the Democrats killing jobs. Why are they refusing to create more economic opportunity? Why are they abandoning American workers?So it's got to be a fight in a sense between two narratives. And if the pressure builds enough, then the moderate Democrats and the rural Democrats are going to go to Pelosi and say, look, you've got to pass this. It's too important for us to try to go home this fall without having passed it.JASHINSKY: Do you think Speaker Pelosi's strategy is even politically smart? I mean there's obviously the question of whether in principle it's smart, but do you think it's even a politically beneficial way to handle this question?GINGRICH: Look, I think she has a huge problem. The left wing of the Democratic Party hates President Trump so deeply that anything -- and you saw this recently in the "New York Times", they ran a neutral headline and they were bombarded with people attacking them on the grounds of it's the duty of the "New York Times" to be anti-Trump and they had to literally change the headline halfway through the day because they couldn't take the pressure.Well, she's even more political than the "New York Times", as hard as that is to believe. And she would be -- I think she would face enormous pressure if she suddenly became in any way seen as President Trump's ally. So in a sense, she has to hope that the economic components of America will bring enough pressure to bear that her own members give her permission to bring it up.But if she were to bring it up purely on her own, I think she would get hammered by the left wing of her party.JASHINSKY: And that's what's interesting because she would be under enormous pressure from that wing of the party, from the left on Twitter, from the hard left in general. But then at the same time, of course, there would be benefits from other constituencies in different parts of the country, rural parts of the country so it's not an easy thing for her to balance by any means.GINGRICH: No. But remember, the Democratic Party in the House is overwhelmingly an urban party and overwhelmingly it's a big city party. And so other than rare people like Congressman Peterson from northern Minnesota who is almost, you know, a fossilized part of the past, right, there's so few people like him still in the Congress as a Democrat, that the underlying power of the Democratic Party is entirely among radicals and among intellectual activists and none of them care what happens to rural America.BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. Should we take a look at what Joe Biden said last night. Newt -- he's defending his blunders on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" last night. He joined the show. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEPHEN COLBERT, TV HOST: In the last few weeks, you've confused New Hampshire for Vermont. You said Bobby Kennedy and MLKL were assassinated in the late 70s. Assured us I'm not going nuts.Follow-up question, are you going nuts?JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Look, the reason I came on "The Jimmy Kimmel Show" is because I'm not.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: That was actually funny. You highlight the former vice president's --GINGRICH: That's actually a pretty good comeback.BARTIROMO: -- yes. You highlight the former vice president's downswing in a new Fox News op-ed. Tell us what you think.GINGRICH: Look, I think the Democrats have a challenge. In many ways, if you were just thinking strategically, you would say that Vice President Biden is probably their best candidate against Trump. But he has the same problem that Ed Musky had in 1972 when Musky should have been the Democratic nominee, was much more moderate than George McGovern but he collapsed.Biden's problem is -- you know, the other day, when the "Washington Post" prints that you have made seven mistakes in three minutes, which is one of their articles about Biden talking, he said seven factually wrong things in a three minute period. Now, when "The Post" does that to you, then your day as a Democratic frontrunner are beginning to be numbered.And I think that what's happening is by contrast, Senator Warren, who is running -- you know, I've said this to you before on the show. I thought Kamala Harris would do much better than she has. She obviously can't hit major league pitching. And so you now have the emergence of Senator Warren who is very formidable, is organized, structured, remembers everything.So the contrast between her and Biden -- this next debate will be interesting because . She's not going to make many mistakes of a Biden type. And yet, she's a very radical left candidate.BARTIROMO: Yes.GINGRICH: So, the Democrats are playing with fire as they move further and further to the left.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:: Just really quickly, Newt -- it's Dagen McDowell. Who hits her though on the fact that she lied about her ethnicity. She was calling herself an American Indian on her bar application in the 80s and until --BARTIROMO: And the Harvard application.MCDOWELL: -- and may the heavens fall, she was a Republican until I think '96.GINGRICH: Well, I think if you want to nitpick -- look, you live in the age of the Kardashians. You live in the age of President Trump. I mean you're not going to beat her over something she used to do that she really feels bad about having done and would not have done except that, you know, she felt like she had to do it when she did it and therefore, she hopes you won't mind the fact that she felt really compelled to do this thing that she now wishes she hadn't done.I mean that kind of stuff is not how she's going to get beaten. People are going to shrug it off. They're going to say that's politics that's why she did it.BARTIROMO: Well, what about her policies?GINGRICH: And all of this had become --BARTIROMO: How about her policies?GINGRICH: -- I think her policies are a bigger problem because her policies are a direct threat to the average American.BARTIROMO: Yes.GINGRICH: And I think that's where this campaign is going to come down to. When you get a list of how crazy these people are on policies, you begin -- you know, for example, I think it was just yesterday you have Sanders saying that we ought to use taxpayer money to pay poor people to have abortions so that that will really help the climate.First of all, I'm surprised nobody called him out for racism because the people he's describing paying are frankly black and brown. That may be Sanders' idea of a good eugenics policy to pay black and brown people to have abortions. But that is not a policy which is going to last very long or be very acceptable to most Americans.BARTIROMO: Wow. Newt -- it's good to see you. Thanks so much.GINGRICH: Good to see you.BARTIROMO: Newt Gingrich joining us there.Coming up, Hong Kong crisis -- the controversial extradition bill withdrawn, months of protest. The fallout coming up next.And then privacy scandal -- Facebook users' phone numbers have been leaked. The crackdown on big tech coming up.Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Hong Kong's leader providing more details on her decision to fully withdraw the extradition bill.Lauren Simonetti with headlines now -- Lauren.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam saying Beijing respects and supports her move to formally remove that controversial legislation. Lam insisting it was her decision, not Beijing.Meanwhile, the home of tech tycoon and democracy advocate Jimmy Lai was hit with fire bombs. He discussed the months' long protests in Hong Kong on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES".(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: You made an appeal to the U.S. government, to President Trump to support Hong Kong. Have you spoken with anyone in the administration?JIMMY LAI, HONG KONG ACTIVIST: Right. Right. No, I haven't. But Mr. Trump has already, you know, spoken. He thinks our movement, (INAUDIBLE) negotiations, which is very good.BARTIROMO: Connect the dots for us in terms of why this is important to the President in the United States and what he is going to do with China.LAI: I think it's tremendous. United States should uphold the moral authority, the value of the West, the value of America. We are actually fighting the same war. We don't mean cold war. We are fighting poverty (ph) because we share the same values with you.So it's very important for you to uphold the values we are fighting.(END VIDEO CLIP)SIMONETTI: Yes. Many protesters in Hong Kong say Carrie Lam's announcement yesterday was too little, too late. We'll see how big the protests are in Hong Kong this weekend. They want more -- Maria.BARTIROMO: All right. Lauren -- thanks so much. I mentioned earlier that op-ed in the "Journal" this morning basically saying that the Chinese government is now targeting Jimmy Lai. You saw him on our air. He came on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" first to make an appeal to the U.S. government to say please stand with Hong Kong -- James.FREEMAN: Yes. And the Chinese government has noticed. They don't like it. They're now explicitly condemning him. No word on that Molotov cocktail thrown at his home there, who is responsible, as far as I know.But I think it's really interesting in your interview there where he is linking the Trump trade dispute with Hong Kong's desire for freedom. You might be -- I think some people might be a little surprised by that. They might think he doesn't just want to be a chip in that negotiation or Hong Kong doesn't.But I think he is saying basically that he stands with the Trump administration and it's part of a general need to confront China about more openness, allowing freedom in Hong Kong, allowing freedom and the rule of law in their own country for foreign businesses.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean I don't know how you look at Hong Kong any differently than an arm of China when we know that this whole agreement expires in 50 years anyway -- 2047.FREEMAN: Well, it's got about -- it's got about 28 years left. But the promises were very explicit. China when it started on this process in the 1980s and the handover in '97, they have promised many, many freedoms which we take for granted to the people of Hong Kong and they have to honor them.BARTIROMO: But China broke the promises. So there you go.We'll take a break. When we come back, we're looking at the Brexit showdown. U.K. parliament delivers a double blow to Prime Minister Boris Johnson. His plan to leave the E.U. next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.We have breaking news this morning. U.K. parliament member and brother of the U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson resigning over concerns of staying loyal to his family and national interest. This as the U.K. parliament delivered a blow to Johnson's Brexit plan voting in favor of a Brexit delay, barring a snap election.Johnson and the conservative majority are pushing for the country to leave the E.U. either way by October 31st. It looks like now it's being pushed to 2020.Joining us right now is AlixPartners CEO Simon Freakley. Simon -- it's good to have you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.SIMON FREAKLEY, CEO, ALIXPARTNERS: Maria -- thanks for having me back.BARTIROMO: Your reaction to what took place in the U.K. Explain what this means in terms of the U.K.'s exit.FREAKLEY: So Boris Johnson's had a double blow this week obviously. You know, first all parliament has voted to block a no deal Brexit on Wednesday. And also of course his response was to call a snap election double which he needed a two-thirds majority of parliament to be able to do which they haven't given him. So we're now in stalemate.But why is this important for businesses -- Maria. The reason is very important for businesses that have a European-wide business or a global business operating in Europe. It's of course, the basic premise of the European Union is that you have seamless trade across the E.U. -- free movement of labor and goods and services and capital.If that's not possible because of a hard Brexit, then it means that the integrated supply chains of businesses that are pan-European are interrupted. And so when I speak to our clients, what they worry about is -- for instance, the auto manufacturers. If they're building cars in Europe, they might be building powertrain in France. They might be building bodies in the U.K. They might be building brake systems in Spain.If they can't freely move on an uninterrupted basis, those parts around Europe, it makes them -- interrupts their business and makes them anti- competitive. So this is why business has been so strong about avoiding an exit from the E.U. that crashes out without a deal and why, of course, parliament's in dead lock.FREEMAN: Ok. And we see certainly markets are sending the same signal, that this is going to be very costly if there is a hard Brexit. But what about the potential upside? You no longer have a bureaucracy in Brussels you have to answer to. Maybe you get a new free trade deal with the U.S. President Trump is saying that will happen.Is there a good case scenario for hard Brexit and then a new path to economic revival?FREAKLEY: Well, I think in the short term there's going to be pain and all the economists are saying that, you know, crashing out of the E.U. without a deal will inevitably result in a recession. But that's a short-term issue.I think in the medium and the long term, the U.K. will be just fine. It's still a G-7 country. It's still an amazing country and a world class capital in London. So I think the U.K. will be just fine. And of course, we trade with other people in the U.K., not just European countries.In the short-term though for business, it presents real challenges and for the larger integrated businesses in the E.U., they have to reconfigure to deal with what is going to be customs restrictions in moving goods and services in and out of the U.K.JASHINSKY: How damaging were the events of this week to Boris Johnson's leadership?FREAKLEY: Difficult to say at this stage. Obviously every day brings a new drama. I mean my goodness, every day brings something significant. So who knows.MCDOWELL: Welcome to our world.FREAKLEY: So I think what we're definitely going to see now is a general election. Obviously the forces of parliament are stopping that happening before the 31ar od October which is the definitive date for coming you out of the E.U.I think if Boris Johnson doesn't get a deal done on the 17th and 18th of October with the European Council that everybody can live with, then he's going to have to under this legislation go for three-month extension.We're going to see a general election. But what's so interesting about this general election is that most elections in the U.K. maybe arguably every election in the U.K. has been about whether you want to vote for Labor government, Socialism or whether you want to vote for a Conservative government, capitalism.This election is going to be entirely about Brexit. This election is going to be are you for leaving the E.U. or are you for staying in the E.U. So essentially it's going to be a second referendum.BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, he's got all the banks wondering what am I going to do, right, that are based in London --FREAKLEY: Right.BARTIROMO: -- financial hubs in London. What are they going to do?FREAKLEY: And of course, what they have been doing is making sure they have redundancy. So Amsterdam, Frankfurt have been major beneficiaries of the major financial institutions setting up operations in those centers and others to make sure -- Paris, another one -- to make sure that with a hard Brexit they can continue with their business.Now that's been extremely complicated to plan. It's been complicated to deliver --BARTIROMO: Sure.FREAKLEY: -- but those contingency plans have been well in action for the last three years since the referendum.BARTIROMO: Simon -- it's great to have you on the show. Thanks so much.FREAKLEY: Thanks so much for having me.BARTIROMO: Good to see you.FREAKLEY: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Simon Freakley joining us there, AlixPartners Consulting.Coming up, U.S.-China trade talks back on.

How the company is responding to this, coming up.Also, hitting the books, the Wall Street Journal releasing its list of top colleges in America. We'll tell you which one tops the list. That list, coming up.All those stories coming up this morning, but first, our top story this half an hour is U.S.-China trade. Chinese and American officials agreed to hold high level talks in Washington early next month. Deputy level discussions will take place this month to lay the ground work. The plans come as each side ramps up tariffs.Joining me right now is the CEO of Cambria, Marty Davis. And it is great to see you, Marty. Thanks very much for joining us.MARTY DAVIS, CEO, CAMBRIA: Good morning, Maria.BARTIROMO: A privately owned company in Minnesota that's actually done very well in the face of these tariffs. Tell us about your reaction to, first, that we're going to see more talks in October.DAVIS: Well, as we talked earlier on your show some time ago, our company filed petitions on a private direct basis, so we won our case and now our activity is beginning to rebound for our company.But what we're really about right now is the people that haven't gotten themselves in that position yet. More on America first basis, an American manufacturing basis, and helping support the president in what is the -- really in the face of a lot of criticism and condemnation about his policy from all sectors of our country. But most importantly, from Wall Street and from public company CEOs.BARTIROMO: And why do you think that is?DAVIS: Well, I think short-term gain, long-term pain is the way Wall Street operates and in some cases. And I mean, if you look at the history, really if somebody would dig into the history of what created this mess with China that Trump is fixing, the smart guy in the room is President Trump.Bob Rubin, Larry Summers, Hank Paulson and even Cohn under Trump, these Goldman Sachs Wall Street titans, not American titans, they baked a lot of this. They created this trade policy with China. They advised and influenced heavily President Clinton and President Bush. And now they're criticizing President Trump.And one just needs to look back at the testimony that they gave before the Congress and elsewhere in the late 90s, early 2000s. Look at Larry Summer's testimony and now he's out here criticizing the president? The president is the only one that gets it and is the only one that is interested in America, not interested in feathering his own nest.BARTIROMO: Well, the president certainly has changed the conversation on China. There is no doubt about it. And you know, people understand now the intellectual property theft that has been going on for so long and for too long CEOs were more interested in getting their product in front of the 1.4 billion person population in China than actually protecting their own goods.Having said that, the economy is slowing. And it has to do with the uncertainty around this trade war, right? I mean, CapEx is down. People are worried that this is going to take steam out of the -- you know, the economic growth that the president actually led because of his tax legislation. So what about that?DAVIS: Well, I think that you have to play the long-term game here. This is a 25-year practice around that Wall Street and the Bush and Clinton administrations created and it didn't work at all. It's been -- it's been very, very challenging for U.S. manufacturing and ultimately the underpinning of the U.S. economy, we've seen that.BARTIROMO: Tell me what you faced at Cambria. I mean, you know, dumping of products from China, how do you know so much about how business has been impacted? Give us the background.DAVIS: Well, we lived in it where we saw the Chinese government fund the raw materials and the manufacturing and the entire infrastructure cost of our industry, of our product production industry around cord servicing and dumped the product into America.And what I get a kick out of is Rubin and Paulson and Summers and Cohn and these supposed intellects of Wall Street using the term free trade so loosely. For them to suggest that what we have going on over the last 20 years under their -- under their authorship was free trade is that's a great travesty of this story. What a -- what a fake narrative they brought forward.It's not free trade. You cannot have free trade with a foreign dictatorship, a communist dictatorship who's frankly just harvesting the prosperity of an American democracy. So this free trade line is such a false narrative, when you're dealing with China.BARTIROMO: And you've seen it firsthand. Your company makes quartz services, right, quartz surfaces rather.DAVIS: That's right.BARTIROMO: Tell us about that. So I mean, it may very well -- I think -- I think we have that quartz in our kitchen here.DAVIS: Yes you do. You have our product here, thank you for that.BARTIROMO: So it's used --DAVIS: We make quartz surfaces --BARTIROMO: -- for counters, kitchen tops.DAVIS: Counter tops, flooring and building (INAUDIBLE).BARTIROMO: And China was bringing courts in and dumping the products at cheaper prices?DAVIS: In four years under great subsidy, after we founded our company in 2001, President Bush's administration, you know, encouraged entrepreneurship. Had I known that at the time we were risking our family's business to invest in such a wide ranging industry of quartz surfacing and develop a new business, that at the same time they were making deals with China that were -- was going to ended a -- end up undermining our very business platform and that's what happened in 2012 and '13.China came pouring into a market that we and others created in the U.S. and under great subsidy from their government and their state-owned banks and so forth, they came in and basically hijacked our industry.BARTIROMO: Yes and that's the same thing happened with steel. Same thing ha that --DAVIS: Oh, yes. And it's going to happen with airlines. It's going to happen with medical devices. It's going to happen -- it happened with aluminum. It's going to ha -- it's happening in all areas. I mean, of our sector --BARTIROMO: Why do you say that? Why do you think it's going to happen in all these other areas? Because China wants to be number one.DAVIS: China is smart. And they know what they're doing and they're able to play Wall Street. I mean, why is Goldman Sachs supporting -- you look at the article written in New York Times about a year ago, it was an excellent article, about all the Wall Street titans, including Blackstone, that were to heading over to China to meet up with the China brass, the top two-three guys under Xi over there and to develop a strategy with how to -- you know, help China negotiate with Trump in essence.And why is the Blackstone CEO, he's got a $500 million scholarship in China. Why? Why does -- why does Goldman report that they're going to support China in a $5 billion worth of support in investing in American companies, getting stake in American companies?This China, the -- Trump is not benefiting from his efforts on China. Wall Street is benefiting from their efforts on China. And these guys have made several hundred million dollars personally as this whole thing has played out over the last 25 years.BARTIROMO: See, I think some of this stuff is cultural. I mean, the theft of intellectual property, I don't think you can change very much unless -- I mean, especially when you have a dictator for life in place.However, the U.S. trade gap did narrow last month, in July, rather. Manufacturing weakness held down imports on business equipment and supplies. What did you think of that? And in terms of a potential trade deal, is it even possible that the U.S. can do a deal with China to agree on things like intellectual property theft and the dumping of the products that you're talking about.DAVIS: If President Trump wins the election, yes. I think he will sustain it and China will know it's serious. Right now, he's running in an election where Wall Street titans are criticizing him.Rubin's out criticizing him. Summers is out criticizing him. Hank Paulson's backed off a bit. Not enough.BARTIROMO: Mr. Paulson was (INAUDIBLE) by the way, we talked about him in the commercial break.DAVIS: Yes, and that's what's hurting the president's position and his trade team is we can't even get Wall Street on the same page with what's best for America. And what's best for America in many cases has proven not to be best for Wall Street on a short term. And I think that's the challenge.And I think it's a challenge with American companies public CEOs who look for short-term, cheap raw materials and understand that that's going to benefit them on the short-term and they have very short life cycles in their company.BARTIROMO: So you're not uncomfortable with all these massive wild swings for the stock market when people get nervous about a deal not happening?DAVIS: It will settle out. It's a lot --BARTIROMO: OK.DAVIS: It's going to be a lot worse for this country long term if we would have continued down the path of the Clinton, Bush and Wall Street platform that was being built and had been really executed until Trump came along and really saved to the middle classes in his efforts here. He's the only one fighting for the middle class. Wall Street is not.And Bush and Clinton administration -- under the Bush administration, they even deflected the safeguard actions that American private companies took in those years and actually shot them down. And you can -- this stuff is all factually, you know, illustrated in a variety of testimony and articles and writings that have been put forth.So, the American people need to get educated. And we're very fortunate to have Trump in this position. He is the smart guy in the room. I like when these Wall Streeters talk about they're smarter than Trump. No they're not. Trump is a smart guy.BARTIROMO: Marty, it's great to have your insights on this and you've seen it firsthand.DAVIS: I have and they didn't -- they didn't -- I think they owe us an apology, not the other way around.BARTIROMO: Marty, great to have you.DAVIS: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Marty Davis, the CEO of Cambria joining us there.Coming up, more security issues at Facebook. A reports that hundreds of millions of user phone numbers were exposed.

The search goes on for the last person missing from the deadly boat fire in California. Lauren Simonetti on headlines now, Lauren.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Maria, FBI divers are on the scene, searching this morning. Coast Guard officials have recovered the bodies of 33 of the 34 people on-board, following the Labor Day fire. The captain and four crew members, the only survivors. A preliminary report is expected from the NTSB. A final report could a take up to two years.Nissan is facing another executive pay scandal. The company's CEO will return part of his salary after auditors determined he was paid too much. The audit found that Hiroto Saikawa received $400,000 in miscalculated stock appreciation rights.And the trial of former Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn could reportedly begin as early as March. And you know, Ghosn was arrested in Tokyo last November. He faces charges of financial misconduct.Privacy concerns plaguing Facebook, the company confirming more than 400 million users' phone numbers exposed online. The information was stored in an online server that was not password-protected. Facebook is investigating, saying there is no evidence any accounts were actually compromised.And no real big surprise here, Harvard is still the nation's top university, that according to a new ranking by the Wall Street Journal in Times Higher Education. The study says Harvard adds value to its student's financial futures and opens doors because of its name recognition.MIT came in second, followed by Yale and the University of Pennsylvania, the California Institute of Technology rounding up the top five. So there you have it. That's where the kids should go, I guess, if they can get in and we can afford it.BARTIROMO: All right, thank you so much, Lauren. Everybody wants that list it's -- thank you.Coming up, plus made in America, we sit down with the man behind the Disneyland of dairy stores, why he says products made here are so important. That's next. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Now made in America, dubbed the Disneyland of dairy stores, Stew Leonard's is more than just a store, it is an experience for shoppers certainly in New York, Connecticut and soon New Jersey.Joining us right now is the president and CEO of Stew Leonard's, he is Stew Leonard Junior. And Stew, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.STEW LEONARD JR., CEO, STEW LEONARD'S: A pleasure, thank you.BARTIROMO: I love the story of Stew Leonard's and you're now at you're 50th anniversary.LEONARD JR.: That's right.BARTIROMO: The company began as a small dairy store founded in 1969 with just seven employees. But you've kept it in the family and you've expanded, tell us how.LEONARD JR.: Actually it was my grandfather started back in the 20s, delivering milk. And then my dad started the retail really in '69. And you know, I have a brother and two sisters in the business and we have 13 next generation and so my next -- my nephew Jake is going to be running our new store that we're opening just in a couple weeks in Paramus, New Jersey.BARTIROMO: Congratulations. How do you keep growing and keep the company in family control while also growing?LEONARD JR.: I mean, we have a family business consultant you know, and you really try to work on communication and keeping the passion, the vision that really is from the founder. And you have to keep them excited about retail right now.I just called my nephew up, he was on his way down to Paramus. So he'll be there early in the morning and he's all excited about opening this new store. So you have that passion and that's what you hopefully want to keep continue in generation to generation.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: The headquarters is in Norwalk, Connecticut. You have a store in Danbury, among the collection of stores. What about the economy out there specifically? Because again, you want to talk about higher taxes, higher taxes, higher taxes. It's really hurt everybody across the state, even in home prices and home sales in Connecticut.LEONARD JR.: Yes, our family -- we've definitely felt, you know, the taxes increasing and it's tough. And the wage rates going up. We opened a store in Farmingdale back in 2016. We hired 400 people. We had one job fair, filled it up. We opened a store in 2017 in East Meadow, Long Island. 400 people, one job fair. The new store we're opening in Paramus, we've had to have three job fairs and the average rate of everybody we're hiring is $1.50 an hour more, it's about $15.50 an hour right now, our average rate in whole store.BARTIROMO: So it sounds like the economy's going well from your standpoint. You're having a hard time putting people to work.LEONARD JR.: You know what? All of this -- we can feel the unemployment rate being so low right now just in our business. We have about 3,000 people working at Stew Leonard's now.So this dollar an hour increase really impacts us a lot because it also creates compression because the people that were making $16.00 an hour, 17, you've got to raise them up too. Because you can't bring new people in at a higher rate.So it's very expensive, on top of, you know, the difficulty in retailing today which is, you know, online sales, Amazon, Whole Foods. You know, it's tough. We're a family business here and they're really masters at, you know, data mining.JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: So, to compete with that, you really have to create that in-store experience. We see retailers like TJX that have made it fun to shop by doing well now. How do you make it Disneyland (INAUDIBLE) I haven't been to a Stew Leonard's, but what is -- what is --LEONARD JR.: You've got to come -- you've got to come to Stew Leonard's. We've got to animate -- we've got animation shows and that's why they did call us the Disney of dairy stores.But in the new store we're putting augmented reality in. So we're going to have animation shows, they're going to sort of pop out into the store.BARTIROMO: Wow.LEONARD JR.: And we're going to gear it toward kids so they can actually go on their phone and learn to count one to 10, like colors, shapes. We have some educational consultants helped us with that.BARTIROMO: Great, and I see you've got an expanded menu. You're keeping up with the time, you sell Beyond Burger, that's something different, relatively new.LEONARD JR.: Yes, Ethan who's the CEO and I just talked to him. And that thing is growing. That became one of our million dollar items now.BARTIROMO: And you've got coffee here, you have MORNINGS WITH MARIA.LEONARD JR.: Yes, but that's a good one, but check the next one out. It's the hot seller (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: Look at that. That is great. MORNINGS WITH MARIA blend, I like it.LEONARD JR.: You know what we're going to do? In honor of you, we'll serve that when we open up our store on September 18th in Paramus.BARTIROMO: Yes, I love it. Thank you for that.LEONARD JR.: Yes, you bet.BARTIROMO: It is great to have you on the show, Stew. Congrats to you.LEONARD JR.: Thank you. You know what's interesting, it's just going plant based I think is the point, you know.BARTIROMO: Yes, we talk about it all the time. Dagen is a vegan.LEONARD JR.: And the milk also is going from this which is our original.Load-Date: September 5, 2019End of Document

He posed as a tour guide but led a double life: he was a spy who sent US classified information to the Chinese governmentCE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 1, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 505 wordsBodyXuehua "Edward" Peng led a seemingly normal life. Every week, it welcomed Chinese tourists eager to get to know California's most iconic landmarks. With hats to protect themselves on hot days, and water to hydrate, the group toured San Francisco listening attentively to the historical explanations and curiosities that the guide told them. A man in ordinary, low-profile appearance who actually hid a double life.The naturalized U.S. citizen of Chinese descent was arrested Friday at his home of $1,200,000 for "hiding different USB, sending cash and personally taking to Beijing, China, memory cards containing classified information Concerning U.S. national security," Deputy Attorney General John Charles Demers said on Monday.According to the complaint filed with the U.S. District Court for Northern California, the defendant was working as a spy for the Asian Ministry of Homeland Security. Between October 2015 and June 2018, he explained the document, slept in hotel rooms where memory cards had been hidden. Xuehua Peng retrieved them, left $20,000 envelopes in the accommodations, and soon after traveled to Beijing to deliver SD cards in person.Federal Prosecutor David L. Anderson showed at the press conference on Monday the memoir cards that the defendant had in his possession, and that contained secret US information (Photo: Reuters)"In this case, the defendant combined old methods of espionage with modern technology," said John Charles Demers. "The charges filed today strangely show the efforts of the People's Republic of China to obtain classified information from the United States and the struggle of our intelligence communities to protect our citizens, our ideas, and our national defense," Demers added.After his arrest, the defendant appeared before federal judge Joseph Spero in San Francisco, who ordered that he be released without bail."According to the allegations, Peng hid numerous USB sticks (a practice known as dead drops) here in the US on behalf of Chinese intelligence agents and sent them classified information to China. His arrest interrupts an operation of those officers who sought to collect such information without having to step foot in this country. [...] This case illustrates the seriousness of Chinese spying efforts and America's determination to frustrate them," insisted Charles Demers.A tour guide working as a spy for China (Infobae)The defendant's home is worth $1,200,000 (Photo: Google)If proven, Xuehua Peng could face a prison sentence of 10$250,000 for working as an undercover agent for a foreign nation. His arrest, federal forces said, expect him to send a blunt message to China."Ending Mr. Peng's alleged actions is an important and significant step in dismantling the people's general efforts against our country," explained a special agent of the FBI Division in San Francisco. "Our message is clear: the FBI, along with our intelligence partners, will pursue foreign enemies, at any level of operation, and disrupt their malicious activity when detected."Load-Date: October 2, 2019End of Document

THE CHINA SYNDROME; The People's Republic is complicated, but most U.S. brands can't afford to walk awayAdvertising AgeOctober 28, 2019Print VersionCopyright 2019 Crain Communications All Rights ReservedSection: Pg. 20; Vol. 90Length: 1360 wordsByline: Angela DolandBodyNike's outgoing CEO Mark Parker made a comment in a September earnings call that might have startled people who think of the company as a great American success story. Nike, he said, "is a brand of China, for China."Parker's provocative remark meant to draw attention to how important China is for the sportswear giant. Nike has had 21 consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth in the China region, and sales there were up 22 percent in the quarter ended in August. Nike looks to China's 1.4 billion consumers and its swelling middle class to power future growth.Like many Western brands, it also carefully tailors its China messaging to the market. Soon before Nike took a stand on U.S. social justice in its "Dream Crazy" ad featuring Colin Kaepernick, Wieden & Kennedy Shanghai dreamed up a very different Nike commercial for the Chinese market. In time for the 2018 World Cup, the spot imagined a future in which China is a global soccer powerhouse. That vision just happens to align with President Xi Jinping's ambitions; he's a soccer superfan who made the sport a national priority.It's not always easyDoing business in the world's second-biggest economy is a balancing act for Western brands that want to stay true to their values, craft an image that appeals to Chinese consumers and at the same time stay in Beijing's good graces.That was obvious in the National Basketball Association's recent debacle, when the general manager of the Houston Rockets, Daryl Morey, sparked a crisis with a seven-word tweet supporting Hong Kong's anti-government protesters, angering many in China.The NBA supported Morey's right to free speech but also released a statement on Chinese social media that sounded more contrite than the English version. Nike, mindful of local sensitivities, quietly removed Houston Rockets gear from some Chinese stores, Reuters reported. When Nike endorser LeBron James criticized Morey for speaking out, he might have had the NBA's business interests in mind, but also Nike's and, by extension, his own.Separately, Apple pulled an app that identified the location of Hong Kong police, and video game company Activision Blizzard sanctioned e-sports players who showed support for the protesters.Sensitivity over Hong Kong comes on top of uncertainty about the U.S.-China trade war and efforts to negotiate a truce. But this isn't a strictly U.S.- China phenomenon-politics often cause flare-ups for multinationals navigating China.Ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, when France greeted the Olympic torch relay with protests over human rights abuses in China, Chinese consumers retaliated by burning a French flag outside Carrefour, the French supermarket. After Japan was embroiled in a territorial dispute with China in 2012, Chinese sales of Honda and Toyota vehicles plummeted. In 2016, China cracked down on K-pop and other South Korean imports as punishment for Seoul's decision to let the U.S. build a missile defense system on its soil.People were caught off-guard by the NBA incident "because the NBA understands China very well and made friends with the Chinese government and people on many levels," says Tom Doctoroff, a longtime China advertising executive who is now global senior advisor at consultancy Prophet. "It shows how fundamental the idea of [Chinese] sovereignty over Hong Kong is." While Chinese broadcasts of preseason NBA games were canceled, Doctoroff says, "if the NBA were just banned, the Chinese people would view it as a step too far."Sticking it out (or not)So yes, it's complicated-even for brands with deep China expertise like the NBA, Nike and Apple. But most are not walking away. China's economy has slowed, but it's nonetheless set to grow 6.1 percent this year, the International Monetary Fund says. The middle class is still growing and buying more washing machines, smartphones and diapers; McKinsey & Co. says more than three-fourths of China's urban population will be middle class by 2022. That's up from 4 percent in 2000 and 68 percent in 2012.When Western brands generate sales in China, it's win-win, says Humphrey Ho, U.S. managing director at Hylink, a major independent Chinese digital agency. "An American brand that does well in China increases domestic consumerism, which serves the brand's interests in the U.S. on Wall Street," he says. "But it also serves one of the core pillars of China's current five-year plan, which is increasing domestic consumption."China has transformed over the past few decades from an agrarian society into an urban nation of savvy consumers. But it isn't as easy for foreign brands to grow in China as it once was. There's more competition from local players-which have improved product quality and gotten more savvy at marketing-and there are signs consumers are saving more and spending less.China is the world's second-largest ad market, but overall spending is cooling from its previous double-digit years of growth; Publicis Groupe's Zenith predicts China ad-spending growth of 4.5 percent this year.Many U.S. brands have invested heavily in China and are still betting big. Starbucks, amid competition from local rival Luckin Coffee, still expects to open nearly 600 stores in China this fiscal year. Marriott International says China is its strongest driver of growth in Asia, and the company has 300 hotels in the pipeline there. Apple has strong Chinese competitors, including Huawei, but it is deeply invested there, logging 17 percent of its global sales in greater China in the most recent quarter.Brands can't afford to ignore the market or walk away, although there are exceptions. Amazon struggled for relevance in China, where Alibaba Group and JD.com dominate online shopping, and this year Amazon shut its domestic Chinese e-commerce business. In 2017, McDonald's sold most of its China business to Chinese state-backed conglomerate Citic and private equity firm Carlyle Group; observers said the move would allow McDonald's to benefit from royalty fees while letting its local partner handle the hassles of growing in a tough market. After being hit by a scandal over the quality of a supplier's meat in China, KFC parent Yum Brands spun off its massive China business into a separate company in 2016 to allow it more agility there.Other companies have simply been forced out. Most Western tech platforms, including Facebook, Google search and Twitter, are censored for China's masses, and accessing them from within mainland China requires special software.So what's a brand to do?Like all foreign companies operating in China, U.S. brands strenuously try to avoid offending Chinese political sensitivities or insulting consumers, as Dolce & Gabbana did in 2018 with ads that showed a Chinese model awkwardly eating pizza and spaghetti with chopsticks. The ad was deemed racist, and sales have suffered. "Now it's a powder keg whenever anything happens that seems to be disrespectful or against Chinese nationalism," says Jerry Clode, who founded The Solution, a consultancy focused on understanding Chinese consumers. "These types of incidents are going to happen more regularly and become a core behavior of China's social media culture."Aside from avoiding crises, brands also try to show they value Chinese consumers and understand their traditions and aspirations. Brands from Starbucks to Tiffany & Co. sell traditional mooncakes for the Mid-Autumn Festival, and many brands spend big on campaigns for the Lunar New Year. Occasionally they even tap into Chinese patriotic feelings-surprising people accustomed to brands' U.S. messaging. Last year, a KFC ad marked 40 years of economic reform in China, looking back at how far the country has come and ending with a cheer of "Go China!"Yet Chinese consumers (just like Americans) aren't always looking at brands through a patriotic lens.

Xi vows attempts to split China will 'end in crushed bodies and shattered bones'CNN WireOctober 14, 2019 Monday 9:49 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 911 wordsByline: By Joshua Berlinger, CNNDateline: HONG KONG (CNN) BodyHONG KONG (CNN) --  Chinese President Xi Jinping warned adversaries on Sunday that any attempt to split China will "end in crushed bodies and shattered bones" according to state-media, as anti-government protesters in Hong Kong returned to the streets for a 19th consecutive weekend. Though Xi didn't explicitly name Hong Kong in his comments, his references to "separatists" and "external forces" echoed previous language used by Beijing when talking about protests in the semi-autonomous Chinese city."Anyone attempting separatist activities in any part of China will be crushed and any external force backing such attempts will be deemed by the Chinese people as pipe-dreaming," said Xi during a state visit to Nepal, according to state news agency Xinhua. The comments differed slightly to those aired by CCTV, with no mention of crushed bodies or shattered bones.Demonstrations in Hong Kong continued Sunday, but were smaller than in previous weeks and appeared to portend a shift to more guerrilla-style tactics.Groups of protesters engaged in flash-mob style demonstrations across the city, embracing the phrase "blossom everywhere" on social media.Though the majority of protests are still peaceful, the number of violent incidents has risen as the unrest has dragged on. During a press conference Monday, a police spokesperson said that officers had uncovered an improvised explosive device on Sunday night on Nathan Road, one of the city's busiest thoroughfares. "The tactic used in such kind of bomb and the explosives involved in it are almost identical to those used in different terrorist attacks around the world," said Suryanto Chin Chiu, the superintendent of the Hong Kong Police Explosive Ordnance Disposal Bureau.Suryanto said the device, which was hidden meters from a police car in a planter and controlled by a mobile phone, appeared to be homemade but required a significant amount of time and expertise to put together. No one was reported injured.Violence in Hong Kong has become more acute since the city's leader, Carrie Lam, used colonial-era emergency powers to ban citizens from wearing masks at public gatherings earlier this month. On Sunday, protesters dressed in black vandalized and set fire to government facilities, subway stations and shops deemed to be pro-China.Several incidents were caught on video, including one showing what appears to be a protester stabbing an officer in the neck with what police called a "sharp-edged object." A group of protesters was also filmed attacking a lone officer in riot gear, with one delivering a jump kick to the neck.'50 years ago it was Berlin, today it's Hong Kong'Beijing has been particularly critical of Washington's support for the Hong Kong protesters in recent months, with authorities accusing the US of helping to organize demonstrations, claims the US State Department has called "ridiculous." Beijing has also used its economic power to punish businesses and entities that don't toe the line. Recently the NBA's 30-plus year, multibillion-dollar relationship with Beijing was jeopardized by a single tweet from an NBA executive in support of the Hong Kong protesters.The US House of Representatives is considering legislation that could tie the city's response to the protests to its special trading status with the US. Two prominent US lawmakers -- Senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley -- were in Hong Kong as protests continued throughout the weekend to voice their support for the movement. Hawley likened the incident to the fight against Communism in East Germany during the Cold War. "Sometimes, the fate of one city defines the challenge of a whole generation. Fifty years ago it was Berlin, today it's Hong Kong," he said in a video filmed in front of Hong Kong's Legislative Council. "The eyes of the world are on Hong Kong, and free people everywhere are standing with you."Speaking to a small group of journalists Sunday, Cruz said he believes Xi is "terrified" of the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong because they pose an existential threat to the Communist Party. Beijing accused him of "maliciously" defaming Hong Kong and Chinese authorities."The Chinese people, including Hong Kong compatriots, resolutely oppose liars like Cruz who came to Hong Kong to stir the pot," China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.Hong Kong's protest movement began due to widespread concern over a proposed bill that would have legalized the extradition of suspects from Hong Kong who were accused of crimes in mainland China.Nepal and China appear to be working on a similar agreement, which activists say could affect thousands of Tibetan refugees who are believed to have fled China's Communist rule and are now living in Nepal. A joint statement from Nepal and China, published Sunday by Nepal's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said the two countries signed an agreement on mutual legal assistance and criminal matters and "expressed hope for an early conclusion of the Treaty on Extradition." Tibetan independence advocates fear the treaty could expose refugees to potential arrest and extradition to China."The Chinese government systematically violates basic human rights, including the right to a fair trial, so any extradition treaty with China is highly problematic," said Matteo Mecacci, the president of the International Campaign for Tibet.CNN's Isaac Yee contributed reportingTM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Mark Zuckerberg just slammed China for allegedly censoring Hong Kong protest videos on TikTok: 'Is that the internet we want?'Business Insider USOctober 17, 2019 Thursday 02:46 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 766 wordsByline: aholmes@businessinsider.com,  (Aaron Holmes)Highlight: Mark Zuckerberg had harsh words for China and its censorship laws on Thursday, saying that it doesn't have to be that way.BodyGeorgetown/Facebook• Mark Zuckerberg slammed China for its censorship Thursday, stating that Facebook,            Instagram, and            WhatsApp don't operate in the country because of the Chinese government's rules banning certain content.• He also took aim at TikTok, the Chinese viral video app that has complied with government censorship of messages protesting the situation in Hong Kong. TikTok is one of Facebook's rising competitors.• TikTok said in a public statement that it does not censor Hong Kong protest-related content.• Facebook previously spent years trying to reach an agreement with the Chinese government, but "they would never let us in," Zuckerberg said.• Zuckerberg stopped short of saying Facebook has entirely given up on doing business in China in the future, however.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.Mark Zuckerberg had harsh words for China over its censorship of the internet on Thursday, when the Facebook CEO delivered a rare public speech at Georgetown University.Specifically, Zuckerberg said that the Chinese government has forced TikTok, the very popular viral video app based in the country, to censor messages of support for the Hong Kong protests."While our services like WhatsApp are used by protesters and activists everywhere due to strong encryption and privacy protections, on TikTok, the China-based app growing quickly around the world, mentions of these same protests are censored, even here in the US," Zuckerberg said. "Is that the internet we want?"TikTok, for its part, issued a statement in response to Zuckerberg's comments, as shared by Mashable's Karissa Bell on Twitter:"Our content and moderation policies are led by our US-based team and are not influenced by any foreign government. The Chinese government does not request that TikTok censor content, and would not have jurisdiction regardless, as TikTok does not operate there. To be clear: We do not remove videos based on the presence of Hong Kong protest content."Mark Zuckerberg lays out his stance on free speechZuckerberg's speech was a defense of Facebook's policies on content moderation, which the CEO aimed to tie to the importance of the First Amendment in the US. He framed Facebook as a tool for expanding free expression that widens the number of people across the globe with a public platform.The future of free speech on the internet will be determined by the values of both social media platforms and the competing policies of governments across the globe, Zuckerberg argued. He framed China as one of the foremost threats to free expression."Until recently, the internet in almost every country outside China has been defined by American platforms with strong free expression values. There's no guarantee these values will win out," he said. "A decade ago, almost all of the major internet platforms were American. Today, six of the top ten are Chinese."The speech represented one of Zuckerberg's strongest rebukes of China to date. Previously, Facebook has attempted to court Chinese authorities in order to gain access to the country's massive market of internet users. The company was reportedly pitching censorship tools to woo Chinese approval in 2016, and Zuckerberg was            rumored to have asked Chinese president Xi Jinping to name his unborn child when they met the year prior.Zuckerberg addressed this past involvement with China during his speech Thursday, stating that Facebook was ultimately unable to meet China's censorship demands."I wanted our services in China because I believe in connecting the whole world," he said. "I worked hard to make this happen. But we could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there, and they never let us in."A handful of American companies have come under fire in recent weeks for acceding to pressure from the Chinese government to censor messages in support of Hong Kong protesters opposing the Chinese Communist Party. Blizzard,            the NBA, and            Apple have all come under scrutiny for downplaying or otherwise penalizing support for the Hong Kong protestors, in apparent moves to appease the Chinese government. NOW WATCH: 5 things wrong with Apple's lightning cableSee Also:• Tech execs who lie about privacy violations could face 20 years behind bars under a newly proposed Senate bill• JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs reportedly rejected any involvement in Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency because of fears it would be used by criminals• Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will give his 'most comprehensive take' on freedom of speech in a livestream on ThursdayLoad-Date: October 17, 2019End of Document

Rubio Urges POTUS to Enforce Anti-Boycott Laws After China's NBA CoercionTargeted News ServiceOctober 10, 2019 Thursday 8:30 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 950 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: MIAMI, Florida BodySen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, issued the following news release:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) urged President Donald Trump to fully enforce anti-boycott laws and regulations, and impose penalties against any U.S. persons--including U.S subsidiaries or affiliates of Alibaba Group, JD.com, Tencent, or other Chinese companies--that comply with foreign boycotts intended to bully and coerce American companies or American citizens to conform with the Chinese government and Communist Party's views, including those related to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tibet, and other issues.In the letter Rubio writes, "It is past time that the U.S. take a forceful and unambiguous stand against the Chinese Government and Communist Party's ongoing efforts to bully and coerce American companies and American citizens to bend to Beijing's will."The full text of the letter is below.Dear Mr. President:I am alarmed to learn that the Chinese government and Communist Party is now organizing and imposing boycotts against the Houston Rockets and certain activities with the National Basketball Association (NBA) after Daryl Morey, an American citizen who is employed by the Houston Rockets, exercised, in a personal capacity, his constitutionally-protected right to freedom of expression. What's more, Morey did so on a social media platform that the Chinese Government bans in China and routinely uses in the U.S. to spread its own propaganda and disinformation. China's coercive actions are clearly meant to restrict speech and instill fear of retaliation in American citizens and companies inside the U.S. Since 1977, Congress has consistently spoken on the record about the need to prevent foreign governments and foreign companies from using economic leverage to impose their political views on Americans, including through the enactment of several U.S. laws to penalize this behavior. As such, I write to urge your administration to fully enforce the anti-boycott laws and regulations and, as appropriate, to impose mandated penalties against any U.S. persons - including the U.S subsidiaries or affiliates of Alibaba Group, JD.com, Tencent or other Chinese companies that comply with foreign boycotts seeking to bully and coerce American companies or American citizens to conform with the Chinese government and Communist Party's views, including those related to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tibet and other issues.It is clear that the Chinese Government is imposing state-directed boycotts against the Houston Rockets and certain activities with the NBA. For example:- CCTV, a Chinese state television company, is already halting arrangements to broadcast the NBA's preseason games in China. Moreover, after NBA Commissioner Adam Silver told reporters that as a "values-based organization I want to make it clear that Daryl Morey is supported [by the NBA] in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression," CCT responded with a statement that lays bare the Chinese Government's opposition to free speech even in the United States: "we're strongly dissatisfied and oppose Adam Silver's claim to support Morey's right to freedom of expression."- Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce and technology company that is now listed on the New York Stock Exchange and has U.S. operations, and JD.com, a Chinese e-commerce company on the NASDAQ and has U.S. operations, both recently banned Houston Rockets-related items from their respective online shopping platforms.- Tencent, a Chinese technology company with a U.S. branch that owns the digital rights to the NBA games in China, recently announced that it would stop showing Rockets games and news.This is not the first time that China has threatened to boycott or otherwise harm American and international companies should they not toe the line of the Chinese Government and Communist Party. In April 2019, the Chinese Government threatened American and international airlines if they refused to make clear on their websites that Taiwan belongs to China. In January 2019, Beijing took down Marriot International's online portal and apps in China and demanded an apology after one of the company's employees, who is an American citizen and working in the U.S., used an official company account to like a tweet related to Tibet. Marriot subsequently fired that employee.Since the 1970s, the U.S. has adopted several laws to prevent foreign governments and foreign companies from using their economic leverage to impose their political views on Americans. In particular, Section 8 of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (Public Law 96-72), and its implementing regulations, prohibit any U.S. person, including "any domestic concern (including any permanent domestic establishment of any foreign concern)," from complying with a foreign boycott that is unsanctioned by the U.S. Moreover, the Ribicoff Amendment to the Tax Reform Act of 1976 (Public Law 94-455) denies specified tax benefits to companies that participate in an unsanctioned boycott.It is past time that the U.S. take a forceful and unambiguous stand against the Chinese Government and Communist Party's ongoing efforts to bully and coerce American companies and American citizens to bend to Beijing's will. I therefore urge the Executive Branch to fully enforce anti-boycott laws and regulations and, as appropriate, to impose mandated penalties against any U.S. persons - including the U.S. subsidiaries or affiliates of Alibaba Group, JD.com, Tencent or other Chinese companies - that comply with foreign boycotts seeking to coerce American companies or American citizens to conform with the Chinese government and Communist Party's views.Sincerely,Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6886778 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: October 10, 2019End of Document

Experts discuss China's 'data sphere of influence'The Stanford Daily: Stanford UniversityOctober 31, 2019 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1613 wordsBodyThere is "a real cognitive dissonance between American policy and business leaders about China," Andrew Grotto said in his opening of a Tuesday talk on artificial intelligence and digital policy in China."Grotto, formerly the Senior Director for Cybersecurity Policy at the White House in both the Obama and Trump administrations, was one of ten expert panelists who gathered to discuss the state of artificial intelligence technology in China and its impact on global data governance.The event was hosted by DigiChina, a joint project of the Stanford Cyber Policy Center Program on Geopolitics, Technology and Governance and Washington D.C.-based think tank New America's Cybersecurity Initiative. New America's website introduces DigiChina as "a broad, cross-organization collaborative effort among specialists to give the English-language world better insight into the debates and outcomes around digital economy policy in China."'Data sphere of influence'Experts disagreed over issues of international collaboration for the global regulatory standards on data governance in a session moderated by Graham Webster, a China Digital Economy fellow and coordinating editor of the DigiChina project at New America.Wu Shenkuo, a law professor at Beijing Normal University, opened with a summary of China's recent development in AI-driven data governance.China is facing "new five-year planning for the national informatization," Wu said. As the nation moves on to the next stage of data governance, he said a new trend is emerging in China. "Chinese judicial organs are interested in the introduction of international judicial practice" and paying more attention to the "opportunities and risks" in introducing new technologies."[China] would like to have more experience or reference from international practices" of regulatory compliance, Wu continued. He cited the EU's introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation in 2015 and California's signing of the California Consumer Privacy Act in 2018, both designed to enhance privacy rights and consumer protection."We would also like to introduce such elements and the factors of internationalization in the area over digital policy... to facilitate an enhanced integration level of China and the outside world," Wu said.However, Rogier Creemers, assistant professor in the Law and Governance of China at the University of Leiden, did not hide his skepticism toward the feasibility of transnational cooperation between China and the Western world.He explained his belief that the Chinese Communist Party's "official worldview" is based on its conviction that technology like artificial intelligence can aid its understanding of "social reality," enabling them to determine ways to improve society.Creemer also said that the Chinese state strives to avoid the fate of past authoritarian regimes, such as the Soviet Union and countries in eastern central Europe. As the U.S. poses an existential threat, the Chinese Communist Party finds technological development more indispensable for its survival amid such competition, Creemer said.Samm Sacks, a Cybersecurity Policy and China Digital Economy Fellow at New America, concurred with Creemer's claim on the increasing significance of information technology in global competition."Data is increasingly going to be caught in the crosshairs of bigger geopolitical competition," Sacks added.She explained that China is following the practices of the E.U. in its introduction of the GDPR, creating its own version of cybersecurity law. Following the signing of the law, China expanded its scrutiny over private company databases, arresting both Chinese and multinational members of the "data broker chain," Sacks continued.Tension is also building up outside the country. Citing the U.S. government's recent decision to force a Chinese company to relinquish its control over the online dating app Grindr, Sacks said the U.S. government is showing more security concerns over China's abuse of information technology. This was the first instance in which the U.S. expressed national security concerns regarding foreign control over a social media app, The New York Times reported last March."We are... seeing both governments looking to put controls and checks in place that might limit the ability of data to flow freely across borders," Sacks concluded.Shazeda Ahmed, a Ph.D. candidate at UC Berkeley School of Information, stressed the globalization of Chinese tech companies. She said it would be increasingly important to understand the "inherent biases" of their services, citing the MIT Media Lab's research on current facial recognition software.All panelists agreed that the U.S., Europe and China will be three key players in determining the future of data governance. In the Q&A session that followed, Wu said international community can focus on "specific issues" that pertain to particular industries, such as finance, health, or airline industry, before finding consensus at a higher level.However, Creemer argued that the interests of national governments would ultimately determine the course of international regulation, depending on how much key actors prefer "regulatory harmonization" with transnational cooperation or "protectionism," as has been the trend in recent U.S.-China relations."We are moving towards a world of what I'm calling [the] data sphere of influence," Sacks said.'Regulatory renaissance' on digital issues"At the government level, we have stopped formal cybersecurity dialogues between the U.S. and China."Opening the second session, Voo, research director of China Cyber Policy Initiative at Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, shared her pessimistic view on the U.S.-China collaborations ion technology issues.The second session, moderated by Ian Wallace, director of New America's Cybersecurity Initiative and a senior fellow in the International Security program, focused on the global impact of policy developments in China's digital technology, especially on its relations with the U.S."I think the discourse on this issue is increasingly toxic," Voo continued. She claimed that politicians who built their careers during the Cold War and the conflicts in the Middle East are driving Washington's hawkish attitudes towards China.Washington's stance could provoke self-censorship among researchers, Voo said. "If you have a more moderate view [on China] and you dare to voice it... your credibility is questioned."Voo also worried about the impact of current tug-of-war on the experience of ethnically Chinese communities overseas."When they go back [to China], they are going to be future leaders," Voo said. "It's not going to help us to find a long term solution."Yuan Yang, Beijing correspondent to the Financial Times, echoed Voo's view while adding that she also sees a similar kind of hostility from the Chinese government.Both the U.S. and China are overestimating "the capabilities and the bad intent of the other side," Yang said.According to Yang, such misunderstanding is driving both governments towards disengagement. She said China's policymaking circles are showing concerns not only over the decoupling of the U.S. and Chinese economy but also over Washington's "decapitation" of Chinese growth.This reinforces Washington's "fatalism" in the perception of its ability "to influence outcomes in terms of establishing norms around AI and data policy in China," Yang said. "And that that fatalism leads us to presume that China is already that already there at some kind of dystopia that's already fixed in the future. And it's incredibly disempowering."Katharin Tai, a political science Ph.D. student at MIT, also stressed the feasibility of coordination between the U.S. and China. "It's easy to miss that there's actually a lot of agreement," Tai said.According to Tai, the U.S. and China need to "zoom out" from viewing U.S.-China coordination over data regulation as "a bilateral dynamic." Tai suggested that including Europe, which does not wholly endorse either position, in their discussion can bring alternatives to the status quo. Moreover, she argued that Europe has "credibility that the U.S. simply does not have," citing the Edward Snowden case, which "created a degree of mistrust" in the U.S. government.However, Tai also said the U.S. and China should both agree to bring Europe to the table. "Even though Europe has the possibility of acting as a credible intermediary, this also crucially depends on a willingness on both sides," Tai said.Grotto, the last speaker of the session, provided his take on the current tension between the U.S. and China as a Washington insider."This shift in Washington's orientation towards China is not a recent development... this shift began in 2015," followed by Chinese President Xi Jinping's rise to power, Grotto said. "What Trump did was take the populist anxiety around all things foreign in the U.S. and dial up the temperature of the rhetoric on China."However, Grotto shared his hope for transnational collaboration to mitigate the hostility from both sides. Chinese, American and European regulators face similar problems on the issues of AI technology and data governance, Grotto said. He also shared his belief that, by reconciling differences between their values, the world can expect a better outcome from what he calls the "regulatory Renaissance" on digital issues.The two-hour event at the Arrillaga Alumni Center was organized as a workshop affiliated with the Stanford Human-centered Artificial Intelligence Center's 2019 Fall Conference on AI ethics, policy, and governance.Contact Won Gi Jung at jwongi 'at' stanford.edu.Load-Date: October 31, 2019End of Document

SPEECH BY H.E. AMBASSADOR LIU XIAOMING AT THE RECEPTION IN CELEBRATION OF THE 70TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA: REMAIN TRUE TO OUR ORIGINAL ASPIRATION AND WRITE A NEW SPLENDID CHAPTERStates News ServiceSeptember 9, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 2161 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: GUILDHALL, City of London BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:From Chinese Embassy in UKDirector-General Richard Moore,My Lords,Your Excellencies,Ladies and Gentlemen,Dear Friends:Good evening!Today is the ninth day of the ninth month of 2019. In the Chinese culture, nine is an auspicious number, symbolizing abundance, nobility and sustainability. On this triply auspicious day, it is a real delight to have you with us to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China!The past 70 years have witnessed the rise of the Chinese nation from the ashes.They have seen the Chinese people united as one, blazing new trails and achieving historic feats.They have also experienced the deep integration and close cooperation between China and the rest of the world.These 70 years are a grand monument in the 5,000 years of Chinese civilisation. They are monument to both the tremendous changes that have taken place in the country and the unwavering aspiration, spirit and value of the Chinese nation.In the past 70 years, China has changed tremendously: A secluded and backward nation has gone through reforms and opened up to the world; An impoverished and weak country has gained prosperity and strength.The Chinese people have created an economic miracle through their hard work.With the GDP increasing by more than 450 times, from $30 billion in the early years of New China to more than $13.6 trillion in 2018, China is now the world'ssecond largest economy,largest industrial country,largest trader in goods,biggest holder of foreign exchange reserves,and top producer of more than 200 products.With increasing market access and improving investment environment, China has been the world's second biggest destination of foreign investment for two years in a row.98% of the Fortune 500 companies have investments in China. Moreover, 129 Chinese companies have made to the 2019 Fortune 500 list, forming the biggest country group for the very first time.The Chinese people have created a scientific and technological miracle through their intelligence and wisdom.In the early years of New China, Chairman Mao Zedong wrote these lines in anticipation of scientific advancement:Clasp the moon in the Ninth Heaven;Seize the turtle deep in the Five Seas.What these romantic verses envision has now become reality. China has made remarkable achievements in manned space flight, lunar exploration, quantum science, deep-sea exploration, supercomputing and satellite navigation. These are all fruits of the strategy of pursuing innovation-driven development.China has led the world in the number of RandD professionals and invention patent applications for many years in a row. It also ranks second in the world in terms of RandD spending.China has more than 1.3 billion mobile broadband users. Modern information technologies, such as big data, cloud computing and artificial intelligence, are thriving in the country.The Chinese people have also created a miracle of better livelihood through their strenuous efforts.From 1949 to 2018, China's per capita gross national income increased by 135 times, from roughly $70 to $9,470.In the 40-odd years since reform and opening up, China has lifted more than 700 million people out of poverty.Today, China has the world's largest middle-income population, that is, more than 400 million.In social security, China has built the world's largest network, with a basic pension insurance system covering more than 900 million people and a basic health insurance system covering 1.3 billion.On top of that, we have put in place a nine-year free and compulsory education system.Moreover, the average life expectancy in China has gone up from 35 to 77.The Chinese people now have a strong sense of achievement and happiness, and look forward to an even better future.In China's relations with the world, the past 70 years also witnessed a tremendous change: China is approaching the centre stage in world affairs, it is becoming more closely integrated with the world, and it is participating and taking the lead in building a better world.Forty-eight years ago, at the 26th UN General Assembly, Resolution 2758 was adopted with an overwhelming majority. The People's Republic of China restored its lawful seat in the UN and rejoined the international community. Since then, China has taken an active part in the international efforts to settle hotspot issues. It has contributed China's solutions to addressing major issues and building rule-based international system.Eighteen years ago, China became a member of WTO, taking its first step to embrace economic globalisation. Since then, China has fulfilled its duty faithfully and fully. It has made positive contribution to the development of world trade. For many years, China has contributed more than 30% of world economic growth. It has been a major stabiliser and propeller of world economy.Six years ago, amid deepening economic globalisation and multipolarisation, President Xi Jinping proposed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the concept of a community with a shared future for mankind.Since then, BRI has been translated from concepts to actions. It is turning from an abstract sketch into a detailed blueprint.From Europe and Asia to Africa, Americas and Oceania, BRIopens new space for world economic growth,builds new platforms for international trade and investment,provides a new solution to world economic governance,and makes new contribution to better life in the participating countries.BRI is a platform of opportunities and a road to prosperity for all the countries in the world.The concept of building a community with a shared future for mankind has also become a consensus. It is now endorsed by documents of the UN, the G20 and other international organizations. And it has played a positive role in promoting peace and progress of mankind.Ladies and Gentlemen,Dear Friends:Amid all these tremendous changes, the Chinese nation has been unwavering in its original aspiration, namely the pursuit of happiness for the people and rejuvenation for the nation. This is the force that has been driving generations of Chinese forward in defiance of all hardships.At the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the "two centenary goals" were proposed, the achievement of which will mark the 100th anniversaries of the founding of the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China respectively.These goals represent the Chinese people's aspiration for a better life. They are the most important mission of China today.Next year will be the run-up to the realisation of the first centenary goal, that is, to complete the building of a moderately prosperous society in all aspects and eradicate poverty completely. This will be an exciting moment in the history of China. It will also be memorable times for the world, as one fifth of all mankind achieve such an extraordinary progress.Amid the tremendous changes over 70 years, China has been unwavering in its national spirit.China is committed to self-improvement.China will grow strong, but will not bully.China values independent decision-making, but will not act arbitrarily.China is firm in safeguarding its interests, but will never seek hegemony.A stronger China will continue toadvocate exchanges and mutual learning between different civilisations,pursue peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation with other countries,make judgment based on the merits of things,and act in accordance with international law.Amid the tremendous changes over 70 years, China has been unwavering in its values.China is committed to peaceful development and pursues the common good for all. In the Chinese culture, we see the world as one harmonious community. Harmonious coexistence is an important Chinese value in the relations between individuals, between man and nature, and between different countries.This value is the rationale behind the Chinese Government white paper entitled China's Peaceful Development. It is why China has enshrined peaceful development in the Constitution of the country and the Constitution of the Communist Party of China.This value has also led China to resolve willingly, readily and fearlessly to act as a guardian of world peace and a defender of world order. Since 1990, China has sent close to 40,000 military personnel on peacekeeping missions. Thirteen brave Chinese peacekeepers gave their life to this lofty cause. This is an important contribution of China to peaceful settlement of disputes and to regional security and stability.Ladies and Gentlemen,Dear Friends:This year marks the 65th anniversary of the establishment of China-UK diplomatic relationship at the level of charge d'affaires. Looking back, we feel a sense of accomplishment. Looking ahead, we are full of expectations.How to ensure the steady and sustained development of China-UK relations in the next 65 years? I think it is crucial to abide by the following four principles.The first principle is mutual respect. This is the anchor of the "Golden Era".Our experience in the past 65 years tells us that when our two countries respect each other's core interests and major concerns, treat each other as equals, and seek common ground despite differences, China-UK relationship will move forward and even achieve leaps and bounds.Therefore, we mustremember the lessons of the past,act in the fundamental interests of the people of our two countries,see each other as opportunities rather than threats,enhance mutual trust,deal with differences properly,resist disruptions,and keep to the direction of the China-UK "Golden Era".The second principle is open cooperation. This is the basis for common development.Both China and the UK are supporters, practitioners and beneficiaries of free trade and open economy.We should focus on development, leverage our comparative strengths, dovetail our strategies, and foster a fair, transparent and non-discriminatory business environment for the companies of our two countries. We should enhance cooperation on the Belt and Road Initiative and in the areas of infrastructure, financial services, big data, clean energy, science and technology, and innovation. We must make sure such cooperation produces win-win results and leads to common development. Our concrete actions could help ensure that economic globalisation is more open, inclusive and balanced.The third principle is inclusiveness and mutual learning, which is key to building a bridge between hearts.China and the UK differ in social system, history, culture and development stage. Our two countries need a broader mind and broader vision to bridge cultural differences and break through the fence of ideology.We should expand cooperation on education, culture, science, technology, youth, sport and tourism. We could explore various forms and channels to strengthen exchanges between different regions and in different fields. These efforts will help enhance the understanding of our respective ideas, deepen the appreciation of our different cultures and cement the bond between our peoples. We must all do our best to make sure that China-UK friendship is passed on from generation to generation.The fourth principle is shouldering due responsibilities as major countries for the wellbeing of all mankind.China and the UK are big, responsible countries. We both have a global vision and global influence. We both believe in multilateralism, free trade and the rule-based international trade system.It is important that our two countries shoulder our due responsibilities as major countries, and take the lead in promoting reform in the global governance system, in forging a new type of international relations, and in building a community with a shared future for mankind. Together we can make greater contribution to peace and prosperity for mankind.Ladies and Gentlemen,Dear Friends:Right here at the Guildhall four years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech. He said, "The Chinese dream, an effort by the Chinese people to pursue a happy life, is closely linked with the dreams of the people in other countries."What drives China forward in the new era is not only the pursuit of our own dream. It is also the belief that every country deserves to pursue its dream and should work with others to realise the dream of all mankind.This must also be what drives China-UK relationship forward in the new age.Let us ride on the wings of our dreams, remain true to our original aspiration, and write a more splendid chapter for the new era -- an era that is full of hopes and full of opportunities. Let us live up to it!Now may I invite you to join me in a toast:To the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China,To the sustained, sound and steady development of China-UK relations,To world peace and prosperity,To the health of everyone present tonight,Cheers!Load-Date: September 16, 2019End of Document

Golub: Daryl Morey, a Chinese RevolutionaryThe Stanford Daily: Stanford UniversityOctober 14, 2019 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1649 wordsByline: Jack GolubBodyUp until last week, Tilman Fertitta had made a mildly bad impression as owner of the Rockets. He gets the "mildly" modifier because plenty of other owners have done the same. He loves to talk to the media, whether it be to publicly doubt Daryl Morey, perhaps the most innovative and successful general manager in the league, or complain about his players. Despite recently buying the team for a then-record $2.2 billion (only eclipsed by new Nets owner Joe Tsai's $2.35 billion; we'll get to him later), Fertitta has tried to duck under the luxury tax. After Morey's tweet in support of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, Fertitta raised his malfeasance to the next level. Almost immediately after reading Morey's tweet, Fertitta took to the twitterscape to condemn his GM and explain that the Rockets are "apolitical." His tweet - the instant refutation of his GM's words, the hypocritical insistence on an impossibility - kicked the snowball down the mountain. If all goes well, the ensuing avalanche has only just begun.Listen....@dmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization. @espn https://t.co/yNyQFtwTTi - Tilman Fertitta (@TilmanJFertitta) October 5, 2019As an international cultural force, the Houston Rockets organization doesn't get to choose to be apolitical. The absence of political stance, like, say, advocating for democracy in a repressive, authoritarian led territory, is itself a political stance. If the Rockets as an organization truly were apolitical, then they would have had no comment on something their employee said. If they were truly apolitical, their owner would not regularly go on CNBC and wax lyrical about the joys of capitalism and the need to enable big business billionaires to make more money so that they might be able to higher a few more minimum wage workers. Fertitta was wrong to apologize for Morey. If he threatened to fire Morey unless Morey deleted his tweet and semi-apologized, which is my guess as to what happened, he was wrong there, too. However, his ill-advised attempt at preserving his Rockets' Chinese market no matter the ramifications might end up being a good thing.Following up on the Fertitta tweet and the widespread condemnation of Chinese "companies" like Tencent and the CBA, the NBA stumbled into the arena. In a bumbling, hardly legible statement befitting the Notes app screenshot via Shams tweet delivery it rode into the internet, the NBA's statement stopped just short of condemning Morey while trying hard to apologize to China. In their Mandarin version statement, they fully condoned Morey. Who knew someone on Twitter might be able to speak both languages.NBA spokesman Mike Bass releases statement from league on Rockets GM Daryl Morey's situation. pic.twitter.com/GQyi1k7Qk4 - Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) October 7, 2019Their statement wasn't enough for China to reverse its ban on all things Rockets, but it was enough to incur the ire of basically all of America. The NBA, in its cultural unifying glory, managed to bring Beto O'Rourke and Ted Cruz to the same side of the debate. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver naturally followed up with a heartier affirmation of freedom of speech. China responded in kind, blasting Silver for his misunderstanding of freedom of speech and cutting off TV access to the NBA, including the games that were being played by NBA teams in China. As an aside, China's response was lunacy. They said that freedom of speech does not include statements that challenge national sovereignty. First of all, who are you, China, to decide what freedom of speech means in the U.S.? Second of all, if China itself stopped challenging the national sovereignty of its various territories, we wouldn't be in this mess. Alas, Silver stopped short of exposing the hypocrisy.Why did the NBA have to walk such a tight line? China is a larger market than the U.S.; more people in China watched Game 6 of the recent NBA Finals than people in America. Like many other big international corporations, the NBA has capitulated to China's authoritarian control. It accepts unfair rules. Because China so heavily censors its citizens' access to internet and so severely threatens any public opinion unaligned with the government, people in China don't get the opportunity to form their own opinions. The NBA, then, makes itself beholden to government officials. Nets owner (making him an NBA governor) and Alibaba co-founder Joe Tsai nicely conveyed China's stance. Tsai probably doesn't have a choice in what to say, given the immense pressure he must be under from his government. It's telling in itself that Tsai, the Taiwan-raised, American-educated, capitalist superhero, has no choice but to stick to the script the government gives him.At first glance, Tsai's Facebook letter reads like a well-informed explanation from the perspective of someone personally involved in Chinese politics. If you read with the slightest critical lens, though, it's a different story. Tsai laments foreign intervention in China, including the British-instigated Opium Wars. Britain sought to grow its economic power by selling opium to the Chinese. Here, Tsai is reminding us that China is intimately familiar with using political strategy to enable economic greed. It seems China has learned its lesson and managed to reorient the political power structure to serve its own needs. Instead of letting other countries wage war in order to profit, China now sets the political table to its choosing. If other countries want to profit, they must play by China's rules. China still represents a giant untapped (or not yet fully tapped) market, but now Xi Jinping's authoritarian regime uses its people to solidify its own stranglehold on power.Eventually, Tsai concludes with the party line: The Hong Kong protestors are separatists. The Chinese people deserve the support, or at the very least the immunity from, democracy-hungry Westerners because they don't want to lose Hong Kong again. I'm sure the 18th Century British empire would empathize; they probably hated losing their favorite colony, too.On another note, it really irks me when Chinese officials talk about how so many average joe Chinese people are outraged by what's happening. Maybe if they didn't censor their internet and gave their citizens any sort of freedom of speech then we, the entire world, might actually know what the Chinese people think. But they do, so we don't.Finally, Tsai's use of the word separatism explains that his stance is coming straight from the propaganda mothership that informs all Chinese news outlets. If Hong Kongers are separatists, mainland China is an oppressive colonial ruler. If there truly is one "People's Republic," then legitimate elections for representatives with real power shouldn't be too much to ask.Here is why sports matter and why this moment is about to reverberate far beyond what any of us can imagine. China's political situation is mostly on lock. News is so censored that most Chinese don't know what's going on. The few that do refuse to speak out - a refusal that makes a lot of sense when weighed against the imprisonment and potential death that certainly awaits anyone who dares to criticize the government. It is all but impossible to imagine a scenario where a political push for democracy springs up and spreads throughout China.What's more likely is that China encounters an economic slowdown, making its people susceptible to losing trust in their government. Then, they would be susceptible to a social disruption instigating anger among the people. China is hurting from the trade war just like we in the U.S. are. While the government has undoubtedly used the trade war to further solidify resentment towards the U.S., at some point people will ask their government for change. What happens if the government can't come through?Silver acted like he needs China. He sort of does. But more than he needs China, China needs him. The NBA is more popular there than it is here. It's estimated that nearly 500 million Chinese people watched an NBA game last year. China has bought in. And while China has gained success in the global economy through efficient production, it's hard to make a close substitute for pop culture. Instead of kowtowing to China, Silver should flex his muscles. It's not just about defending an employee's right to freedom of speech; the NBA does business with an authoritarian regime, and it just might have the clout to induce change.The Chinese government overplayed their hand. So far, international businesses have underplayed theirs. If the various international entertainment companies that have run afoul of Big Brother Xi can organize, their collective impact (or the loss of their presence) could be enough to make some people angry. The NBA should turn their "building bridges" talk away from China and towards the other members of the international entertainment industry that have so far acquiesced.Organized together, these companies could deliver the catalyzing blow to the Chinese social order that might precipitate political change. They must organize together. If the NBA does not take leadership and not only stand up for itself, acknowledging its own power, but also bring in others, then the Morey snowball will slow to a stop. If the NBA truly is a values-based organization, they will not let some of their customers dictate what those values are. They will, as TNT reminds us in every Game 7, win or go home.Daryl Morey isn't a Chinese revolutionary. Not yet. But, I hope one day we can look back and see that his tweet triggered a global evolution from prioritizing economic interest to recognizing and fighting injustice. Free Hong Kong. Free China. Revolutions of our time.Contact Jack Golub at golubj 'at' stanford.edu.Load-Date: October 14, 2019End of Document

We've got a big show this morning -- big two hours.And our top story this hour, the state of Papa John's. The pizza giant going through a series of leadership changes as the company's founder stepped down as CEO two years ago.Joining me right now in an exclusive interview is the founder himself, Papa John's founder and former CEO John Schnatter. Great to see you -- John. Thanks very much very joining us.JOHN SCHNATTER, FOUNDER, PAPA JOHN'S: Good morning -- Maria. Thank you.BARTIROMO: You stepped down. You were forced to step down, the company that you built and that you founded. Tell us first what happened?SCHNATTER: I was not force to step down. We had a successive plan in place so we actually heeded that plan. And I was ready to retire. We had a fantastic nine-year run. We took the stock from about $6.40. It's almost 88 bucks.And so good run, good fun, good time -- we were ready to go.BARTIROMO: So in other words, what you're saying is you enriched a lot of people by creating this business, making a profitable business and then -- and then making the stock go up, causing a very good situation for a lot of people involved.You were ready to retire but you had a problem obviously. And you were on a conference call and a racial slur was used, can you tell us what was behind of all of that?SCHNATTER: Well, if you look at the chronological events, the NFL call was November 1 and it was a benign call. There was nothing racial about that. They turned a little bit into kneeling but there was nothing said about kneeling.The call you're referring to was July -- May 22nd that aired July the 12th, yes.BARTIROMO: Ok. So let's go back to first the NFL call. Tell me about the NFL and your relationship with the NFL and commissioner Roger Goodell.SCHNATTER: Right, very good. Papa John's was the most associated brand with the NFL, most recognizable brand with the NFL, about a third of our budget was spent on the NFL. And they were having issue with kneeling.And I kind of got on Goodell a little bit to fix the problem here. You know, let's satisfy the players and the owners but there was nothing in there about the players kneeling or anything that was any way racial.BARTIROMO: So what was most upsetting about that call?SCHNATTER: The way it was misconstrued. The comments were benign and the way it was twisted. And then the company's lack of effort to correct the record, that was probably the most frustrating thing.BARTIROMO: So you're saying you would have liked Roger Goodell to come to your defense.SCHNATTER: I WOULD have liked Roger Goodell to fix the problem, remember, a third of our budget was the NFL. So when the ratings I think were down some 20 percent, so it was hurting our business. It was hurting our franchisees. It was hurting our small business owners.BARTIROMO: Do you think he was behind forcing you to give up the chairman's title?SCHNATTER: I don't know if he was behind it. I think he was a little bit frustrated with my comments. He's not used to being challenged. And the NFL's is very powerful.And I was pretty stern. You need to fix the problem. You're the leader, be accountable.BARTIROMO: Then what happened?SCHNATTER: I retired end of '17 and we -- we started to deteriorate a little bit with the performance and then as I was coming back in the picture we had a diversity training session in New York with the laundry service. And falling short of it is they tape the call which is fine. You and I get taped all the time. But I wish they would have told me who was on the call and they were taping it. And that got twisted.BARTIROMO: So on that call you were talking about somebody else and you made a comment that was a racial slur?SCHNATTER: No -- there Has never been any racial slurs. There's never been any use of the word, that's probably been the most frustrated. That's not true at all. What the call was 52 minutes and it was totally anti- racist.At the very end of the call, I simply stated what another founder said and the way he went about using that word. Colonel Sanders called black people the n word. I would never call a black person the n word. It's not the way I was raised.BARTIROMO: You were saying what Colonel Sanders said?SCHNATTER: Yes -- paraphrasing.BARTIROMO: Now, Colonel Sanders' family as you know has come out and said he's a weasel. He's a liar. You know, Colonel Sanders would never speak like that, he never said that. I don't know what John Schnatter was talking about?SCHNATTER: I haven't heard that.BARTIROMO: Yes. The family came out and said it's not true.SCHNATTER: That Colonel Sanders did not use that language?BARTIROMO: That's right. Yes. Colonel Sanders --SCHNATTER: I don't want to debate the Colonel -- God rest his soul.BARTIROMO: No, I know. I'm just saying but you repeated something that you say Colonel Sanders said?SCHNATTER: It was common knowledge that Colonel Sanders talked like that. But let's not talk about the Colonel.BARTIROMO: Ok. Ok.So let me ask you this. Can you give us a sense of the culture as you know it at Papa John's at that time. Was it common place for people to throw around words like that? Was it -- did you feel that it was no big deal that you were repeating something that somebody else said?Tell me about the culture and whether or not these kinds -- this kinds of language was acceptable at the time?SCHNATTER: Oh, Papa John's was voted the best place to work in Kentucky five years in a row. I would not tolerate that for one second. The board members that had been on the board for average of 10 years, management was 20, 25 years -- so no way that conduct would have been permissible, no way.BARTIROMO: So what happened after that call, after you repeated something that you had heard or you knew Colonel Sanders had said and you were referring to him when you said the word?SCHNATTER: First thing I found out IS they taped it and then laundry service was let go so they were bitter. And they attempted to extort money, otherwise they were going to hurt the company and hurt me.BARTIROMO: In what way?SCHNATTER: The owner of Washman, Casey Washman, who owns the laundry service, basically said if you don't pay me millions of dollars I'm going to bury the founder. So that's when I went, oh, my gosh, we've got a problem.BARTIROMO: Ok. So then what happened? When did you first realize this was going viral, this was going to be a public situation?SCHNATTER: The reporter at Forbes, Noah Kirsch -- excuse me -- he wrote an article on the 11th that went viral on July the 12th.BARTIROMO: Yes. And this is the inside story of Papa John's toxic culture? The Forbes story was that a second story?SCHNATTER: That was the second story.BARTIROMO: Ok. So the first story was just specifically about that phone call.SCHNATTER: What he has heard about the phone call. Noah at the time didn't have the tape but I believe laundry service or somebody else miscommunicated or mischaracterized what was on the tape and Noah ran with it.BARTIROMO: So what do you want people to know about you knowing that they have the story, that you used this word, this language even if you were talking about someone else saying it, what do you want the public to understand about you?SCHNATTER: Well, to put it in context the most unfathomable, unbelievable thing about this whole situation is that the old board and the old executive team under Richie used the black community, used race in the media, to Forbes, to steal company and thus stripped (ph) the company very badly.BARTIROMO: In what way? How?SCHNATTER: Well, stock was $88, went down to $40.BARTIROMO: Very quickly.SCHNATTER: $88 on the 16th, $40 as of two months ago. It's up to $50. So Jeff Smith and the new board have got the stock up. Wall Street is fine -- $40 to $50. Good momentum.What concerns me is main street, our business is not healthy right now so that needs to be rectified rather quickly.BARTIROMO: Ok. I want to talk to you about that and what you're going to do to try to fix the situation. Your life was completely changed after this. You make this remark on a phone call, your life changes, correct?SCHNATTER: No. My life --BARTIROMO: The public -- there's so many stories about you and this phone call. That's what I'm saying. I'm saying the perception, what people were talking about what's important to them.SCHNATTER: No, I don't like any of this and it's not true. It's a farce. But in the 14 months this has been going on I've never had a negative comment in public.Now what I'm worried about is my employees and my franchisees, the small business owners that really wake up every day and make Papa John's great. Those are the people that keep me up at night. They're losing their jobs. They are scared they're going to lose their jobs. And the franchisees are in trouble.BARTIROMO: All right.Let's take a short break. We want to hear more about what you're doing now and the future of Papa John's. The founder and former CEO is with me -- John Schnatter.We are going to take a short break and then we will have more when we come back.Then big tech is in the spotlight. Dozens of State Attorneys-general formally launching an antitrust investigation. What it means down the road. We will talk about that later in the program. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.I'm back in this exclusive interview this morning. The founder of Papa John's Pizza, he is the former CEO as well -- John Schnatter.And John -- we were just talking about what you have experienced in the last two years. You think this was a coup to get you out.SCHNATTER: I feel like the deal boards and all the executive team felt like they could run the business better than I could run the business.BARTIROMO: So this -- you gave them an opportunity to do something about it with that phone call. They said that you used racial slur, let's get him out. And then let's distance ourselves from the founder and the guy who built this company.SCHNATTER: I feel like it's safe to say that they used something that wasn't accurate in a way to twist it to get me out, yes.BARTIROMO: Then there was back and forth with other board members where you had said, well, this person said this, and somebody else said this about you and there was this conversation, locker-room type conversation, which they are denying that they ever said anything that was untoward?SCHNATTER: I don't really recall that, where they were saying things that were not true, I just know that, you know, being the founder, the brand is synonymous with me. And the franchisees and employees are not in a good place right now. And I will do whatever it takes in my power to help get the employees and franchisees back on their feet.BARTIROMO: How do you do that? I mean recently the company announced plans, partnership with Shaq O'Neill. Tell me about that -- Shaquille O'Neill.SCHNATTER: Shaquille O'Neill -- I like that. Shaquille sits on the board. The board and the chairman of the board report to the shareholders. So their duty of loyalty and duty of care, you know, is responsible to the shareholders -- myself and the rest of the shareholders.So I'm just hoping with Shaq on board that he -- he upholds his fiduciary duties and he sells a lot of pizza.BARTIROMO: Now you've already sold a big portion of your stake, you've cut that stake in half?SCHNATTER: Yes.BARTIROMO: Ok.SCHNATTER: I don't like what I'm seeing at store level. Again, Wall Street is $50 a share but at main street I just don't think the business is quite as healthy as I'd like to see it.BARTIROMO: How are you going to appeal to main street to make sure that your customers or even former customers in some -- in some regard understand that the culture is not what it appears based on what we've read in the headlines?SCHNATTER: Right, the culture on the way up, $6.40 a share at the end of '08 to $89 a share at the of '15 -- the culture was mutually respect, collaborative alliance, self-serving honesty. Everybody pulls together, everybody wins from top to bottom and that culture in the last two years has switched.BARTIROMO: Do you think that one of the reasons that you were -- were pushed out was because of the comments that you made on the call or is it bigger than that? You said this was a coup, explain.SCHNATTER: I think as long as I was in the building and as long as I had 31 percent of the company, whether I was CEO or whatever title I had I still was in control. And I think there is some resentment towards that of which I actually would have been fine with all this if it would have worked.The problem is the earnings at the end of '16 and '17 were $2.66 a share. In '18 it was 3 cents a share. EBITDA was $200 million, now it's basically flat. How do you take a business from $200 million EBITDA to flat, then you say well, that's after special charges. Special charges, legal fees -- they are not going to go away. Marketing supported franchisees -- that's not going to go away.Support for franchisees, recruiting bonuses, retaining bonuses -- none of those special charges are going to go away, so you basically have a company that makes almost no money.BARTIROMO: Does it have the scale to operate and thrive in this kind of a situation or would you like to see Papa John's merge or get acquired by Wendy's?SCHNATTER: I think to your point -- I think two things have to happen and a third one if Jeff Smith had his wish list. I think one is Rob Lynch needs a 12-month plan to fix this business, he's not going to fix it overnight. It's in trouble. So we need a good solid 12-month plan for Rob.We need to transition from Steve Richie and that team to a new management team. So Smith needs to quiet down Richie because he's not saying good things about Jeff Smith or the old board.And last but not least he's going to have to find (INAUDIBLE) for somebody that wants to take over this.BARTIROMO: Do you want them to merge or be acquired by Wendy's?SCHNATTER: I'd have to look at the deal.BARTIROMO: When you were in charge did you have conversations with Wendy's?SCHNATTER: We did have conversations with Wendy's.BARTIROMO: About a merger?SCHNATTER: Well, you've to look at what is the synergy between the two companies, purchasing power, marketing power and technology.BARTIROMO: Do you think that deal will go through ultimately?SCHNATTER: I think it's -- the odds have gone up with Rob Lynch in the picture because he comes from Arby's.BARTIROMO: Are you going sell the rest of your stock in -- in Papa John's?SCHNATTER: Well, depends on what happens. I mean every day is a different day at Papa John's. People buy stock because they think it's going to go up --BARTIROMO: Right.SCHNATTER: -- then they sell stock because they think it's going to go down.BARTIROMO: You sold half of your position?SCHNATTER: Right -- it's a short. It's a hedge.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you this. You hired an outside counsel to investigate all of these things that they said you did in terms of the racial slur, in terms of this -- you know, what Forbes wrote about a toxic culture. What has your investigation loose free (INAUDIBLE) with your lawyer. What has that turned up?SCHNATTER: Exactly what I told you. The entire thing was a farce and it wasn't true and they made it up.BARTIROMO: What are you going to do now, John?SCHNATTER: Sit back, try to help the franchisees and employees any which way I can. When they ask for counsel, give them counsel. Give them guidance. Give them -- you know, the institution knowledge that I hold and hope for the best.BARTIROMO: and what do you think about the restaurant business in general. I mean you've $15 an hour minimum wage coming up, what if Papa John's pays minimum wage?SCHNATTER: Depends on the phase. I mean you do $7.25 and it could be as much as, you know $9 or $10.BARTIROMO: Is it going up to $15?SCHNATTER: Over time it will go up to $15.BARTIROMO: And your assessment of the business today?SCHNATTER: The -- I don't like the culture. I don't like the momentum. The recipes have been changed, that bothers me. And I don't like the fact that the managers in the stores are not making a bonus. When I was there everybody made a bonus, we were all -- from store manager to the janitor, to accounts receivable -- all way up. I think that's key.BARTIROMO: When you say you don't like the culture, you were the CEO. Who breeds that culture?SCHNATTER: Well, the culture -- again that's the place to work in Kentucky for four straight years. Up to '16 beginning to '17 culture was good. From '17 to '19 culture has done this.BARTIROMO: Wow. John -- it's very good to have you on the program this morning. Thanks so much.SCHNATTER: Thank you.BARTIROMO: John Schnatter joining us, former CEO at Papa John's.We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Trouble at British Airways. Cheryl Casone with the details now and headlines -- Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Well, big trouble -- Maria.An unprecedented walkout has grounded nearly all British Airways flights. Pilots changing a 48-hour work stoppage. This is in response to a long running pay dispute between pilots and the airline. Another job action is actually planned for later this month as well. Those flights today and tomorrow, that's going to be the problem.And you may want to think twice if you plan to retire in New York state. According to a survey by a bank (ph) New York comes in dead last when it affordability due to high costs and taxes. Bank Rate survey also looked at other factors such the weather, crime, and culture. California was ranked second to least affordable followed by New Jersey, Maryland and Connecticut. The best states overall for the golden years folks -- Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, South Dakota and Florida.You know Maria -- I never saw myself wheeling myself around in that wheelchair in New York City. So looks like that's not my plan.BARTIROMO: All right. Cheryl -- thank you.CASONE: You bet.BARTIROMO: President Trump just tweeted on the 2020 race. Here is what the President writes, "When the former governor of the great state of South Carolina Mark Sanford was reported missing only to then say he was away hiking on that trail then was found in Argentina with his flaming dancer friend, it sounded like political career was over. It was, but then he ran for congress and won only to lose his reelect after I tweeted my endorsement on election day for his opponent. But now take heart he's back and running for president of the United States. The three stooges", the President writes, "all badly failed candidates will give it a go."The President went on to tweet about congressional rules this morning as well. Here's what he says there."House Republicans should allow chairs of committees to remain for longer than six years. It forces great people and real leaders to leave after serving, the Dems have unlimited terms while that has its own problems, it is a better way to go, fewer people in the end will leave."I guess the President here is talking about the fact that on the Republican side they have these term limits whereas if you're chairman of a committee like Devin Nunes who was the chairman of intel, once you lose that because of term limits often times you leave Congress. You don't want to go back to the rank and file membership after being the chairman of the committee.He's saying don't do that. Maybe that's the reason we are seeing so many retirements in the Congress. What do you think, Lee?LEE CARTER, POLLSTER: It could be or at least that's what he's trying to get people to believe is the reason so many people are leaving Congress and retiring right now.BARTIROMO: Yes.All right. We will take a break.When we come back, big tech in the hot seat. Dozens of states' attorneys general will formally launch an anti-trust probe. What it means for future of big tech, coming up. We're going to take a look at that.Then more worries for Wework, the company reportedly looking into further valuation cuts may postpone its public debut. We'll break it all down when we come back.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, September 9th. Your top stories right now, 7:31 a.m. on the East Coast.Futures pointing to a gain at the start of trading this morning. Dow Futures are up 55 points, S&P up seven and the NASDAQ up 15.We are watching China trade tensions, officials confirming the next round of face-to-face talks next month, early October in Washington, as the economy in Beijing continues to show more signs of slow growth.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will join me in half an hour. We will talk about China as well as housing reform, coming out of the Treasury.Markets finished the week higher last week, take a look, Dow Industries up 1-1/2 percent on the week, the S&P and the NASDAQ each up 1-3/4 percent.Global markets this morning are mixed. Take a look at European Indices which are largely lower, FT-100 down 38 points, CAC Quarante down four, although the DAX Index is up 35 points. We had Britain's GDP report out this morning, it's showing a surprising economic growth for the month of July that ease some Brexit recession fears.However, German exports are up in July and overall the European economic story is having a hard time generating any growth.It is a different story in Japan. Second quarter GDP grew at a slower than expected pace as you see, the Nikkei Average nonetheless was up one half of one percent. In Asia overnight, markets were mixed as you see there.Big tech is under pressure, states attorneys general ready to launch an anti-trust investigation into Google and Facebook over privacy concerns. Those stocks are up this morning in the premarket.Meanwhile, more worries for WeWork, the company reportedly looking into further valuation cuts, even may postpone its public debut all together.And a nostalgic trip, Sony is bringing back their Walkman and the surprise feature will blow you away. Wait until you hear that. All those stories coming up this Monday morning.But first, our top story this half an hour, taking on big tech, anti-trust investigations are launching across the country, looking into Facebook and Google parent company Alphabet, the main focus of their influence on advertising and whether they're stifling competition.Joining us right now is Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano. Judge, always a pleasure.JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Good morning.BARTIROMO: Are they stifling competition?NAPOLITANO: Well, I don't know what the answer to that is. It's the -- it's states attorney general believe that there's at least a case worth investigating.But let's look at a couple basics. The Supreme Court has ruled that if there was a federal statute and a state statute and the same behavior has arguably violated both, that both can investigate.So at the same time that the FTC is looking at Facebook and at the same time that the Department of Justice is looking at Alphabet, the state attorneys general in two groups, one headed by the attorney general of the state of New York and one headed by the attorney general of the state of Texas, these are non-ideological and non-political.In other words, there are Republicans, Democrats, Liberals, Conservatives in both groups are looking to see if each state individual states laws were violated, particularly the laws against privacy.So the federal law that prohibits for example computer hacking or failing to safeguard information that was given to you, there are state versions of those laws as well. That's one way to look at this.The other way to look at this is, what do they really want? They're run -- they're running in the red. They're looking for cash.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST: Bingo.NAPOLITANO: Just like when they shook down big tobacco. They got billions in cash and how many people stopped smoking as a result of all that? Where did that money go?BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE) a really easy reason and a -- and a good way to do it. I mean, they're giving it on the silver platter. They might be looking for cash, fine. But that doesn't mean that there's no problem here.NAPOLITANO: Correct. So there's two ways to look at it. If they won, one way is, we know they violate privacy.It's kind of silly for the government to say you're violating privacy because nobody violates privacy more than the government does, state and federal. But there are laws there and the state attorneys general have sworn to uphold the laws and this is the way you do it. You begin with an investigation.And it actually is more efficient to do it in groups rather than 30 different investigations. You have two, each of which has 15 states involved.BARTIROMO: Isn't there more to this, though? I mean, there's -- we know that the ideology of big tech is liberal is -- you know, how many people in Google were crying when Hillary Clinton lost the election. There's -- there are lawsuits right now that -- you know, that say they are stifling conversation coming out of the Conservative Party.NAPOLITANO: Right.BARTIROMO: Devin Nunes suing Twitter. Tulsi Gabbard suing Google --NAPOLITANO: Right.BARTIROMO: -- for these reasons. So is that part of this?NAPOLITANO: It is not and maybe it will be.BARTIROMO: It may not be part of this as state attorneys general, but isn't there pressure like in other corner?NAPOLITANO: You know -- you know, there might be. And I'm in the minority on this, in my view, as hateful as it is and it could happen to me, it could happen to anybody in this room, it could happen to anybody watching us now. Google's a bulletin board, they want to take me off their bulletin board, there's no First Amendment obligation on their part to keep me up there. The First Amendment only regulates the government. Not everybody believes that.A lot of people are (INAUDIBLE) that it is so big, it is tantamount to a government and it is so big it will be impossible to compete with it. And if they stifle my political speech, there should be recourse. Again, that has -- that issue hasn't been resolved.BARTIROMO: That's a conversation we get into a lot, I mean, is this a media company or is this the bulletin board?NAPOLITANO: Right.BARTIROMO: I mean, you can argue that these companies are more powerful today in terms of being media companies than they ever have been and that they have to be an open forum for everybody and not just pick and choose where they want to go.NAPOLITANO: Some federal judge sitting in Washington, D.C., I'm going to guess, probably in the next three or four years is going to have to make that call as to exactly what they are and what -- to what protections they are entitled. Because if they --MCDOWELL: Congress could make that call. They could get rid of the liability waiver for contents that's --NAPOLITANO: Yes.MCDOWELL: Because again, they're free from being sued for the content, saying (INAUDIBLE)NAPOLITANO: And what they put in the bulletin board, yes.MCDOWELL: -- it's the content that is produced by the users of these services and not the company. Congress could get rid of that. And it would open them up to lawsuits. They'd be a lot more careful about basically icing out certain types of speech. NAPOLITANO: Dagen is quite correct, a majority vote in either House of the -- both House and the Congress and the president signs it and the law is radically different and the courts would have to follow that.BARTIROMO: I mean, there's so many legs around big tech right now. I mean, you look at Google having an A.I. lab in China, right? The employees balked at Google, you know, using their A.I. technology for the government working with the Pentagon. They walked away from Project Maven, right?NAPOLITANO: Right.BARTIROMO: Because they didn't want to use that. And then they -- then they open up this A.I. lab in China.Google is the leading company in the world on A.I. Nobody has better A.I. than Google. That's their jewel, OK.They have an A.I. lab in China. So you have to question, is the Chinese -- can the Chinese try to intercept and meddle in our election through Google?NAPOLITANO: Yes. Well, I don't know if they can technically. But the more involvement Google has with the Chinese government, the more the Chinese government understands how Google works, the easier it would be for them to do it.The president of the United States is opposed, President Trump, to the relationship between Google and China's A.I., but he needs legislation to stop it. I mean, he's exposed it, but in order to make it unlawful, only Congress can do that.BARTIROMO: Yes it's interesting. Because in China, the Chinese government will say you do this and you do that companies.NAPOLITANO: Correct.BARTIROMO: And in this country we have our ethics and you know, --NAPOLITANO: Correct.MCDOWELL: We have laws.NAPOLITANO: We also have the free market, sort of free.BARTIROMO: Yes. All right, let's switch gears, ask you a pharmaceuticals because you got the drug maker Purdue Pharma expected to file for bankruptcy now, judge. Group of state attorneys general stalled. The company had offered billions to settle lawsuits claiming that they used deceptive sales practices to advertise the pain killer OxyContin.NAPOLITANO: These are the same state attorneys general that we were just talking about a couple of minutes ago. Which Purdue approached, said look, there's all these lawsuits. You guys are suing us on behalf of thousands of people and thousands of people are suing us individually. Here's $13 billion, you divide it up. And they couldn't come to an agreement.Now if this goes to bankruptcy court, Purdue Pharma will make out far better than it will if there are lawsuits before juries or if the case is settled, because bankruptcy is just a cold financial decision.There's no -- there's no pain and suffering. There's no emotion. There's no jury. It's just a bankruptcy judge deciding, OK, you're -- you owe 15 and you only have 10, here's how we're going to -- here's how we're going to divide it. Purdue Pharma will survive this. It will be a lot smaller but it will go on and have another life and the claimants will get far less money from -- mark my word, far less money from bankruptcy than they would get from filing lawsuits or even settling this case.BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. Judge, great insights from you always.NAPOLITANO: Such a pleasure on a Monday morning.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Judge Andrew Napolitano there.We'll take a break. But first, President Trump tweeted again this morning, he just said this. 94 percent approval rating in the Republican Party, a record. Thank you, writes the president.Quick break and then more worries for WeWork to report. The company reportedly looking into further valuation cuts to its IPO. It could in fact delay the public debut. We'll break it all down, next.And then Sony celebrates and updates one of its ground-breaking products 40 years later. What's old is new again at Sony. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, the trouble keeps on coming for WeWork. The company cut the valuation it could cut the valuation for its IPO. Jackie DeAngelis now with all the details. Jackie, Good morning to you.JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning to you. Well, as we're waiting to hear what WeWork exactly is going to do, the plan was that it was going to do a road show this week. But now they're having conversations about maybe taking the valuation down to $20 billion or even possibly delaying the IPO until 2020.And $47 billion is where they were earlier in the year. So this is a big cut, almost in half. And it's kind of a red flag to a lot of investors that have already been skeptical about this.A couple of the issue here, people are worried about governance, how they're running the company. But they're also worries about the business model and the ability to turn a profit.Now in the IPO environment, we've been talking about this, how do you invest in companies that don't turn a profit? But short-term there's some concern too back to that business model, that this renting of office space, if there's a downturn in the market, you know, could see potential problems and of course the environment's very different than it was in the beginning of the year as well when we saw Uber and Lyft go public.I will also say this, the CEO reportedly has sold some of his stock. That's making people nervous too, about $740 million. So it's never really a good sign if the chief executive isn't a hundred percent invested. And the question now really is, if you sell the IPO and you need all this cash to really hit the growth targets and help it move forward, where does WeWork go from here?SoftBank is a big investor and the conversation right now seems to be is SoftBank going to step up and infuse some cash here to keep it going. But it's definitely a story to watch.Maria, I know you always talk about the losses. 2018, WeWork lost $1.6 billion. Hard to get behind that.BARTIROMO: Yes, and then, you know, they had an all-male board until they decided to go public and then they had a woman then.DEANGELIS: Yes and so that goes back to the governance too and the chief executive, you know, there's some concern that he's very controlling. He's sort of a little overbearing in how the operations run. And people are just looking you know, twice at this and having a bit of a keener eye.BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, this the whole idea of what WeWork does has been quite popular in terms of when you actually look at the business. Mitch, your thoughts.MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC: When you shifts at the -- a business model like WeWork shifts the risk from trying to for a small business signing a lease with a landlord directly which can be very difficult if you're a small business, to having the ability to have your employees work in one location in one city, another location in another city. So it's a really good business model for small business. The question is, what's on the other side and how they operate their business.DEANGELIS: Right, conceptually and I go back to the Lyft and Uber models as well, you know, I mean, these are amazing businesses that people have praised in terms of the convenience that they've provided consumers. But when you're an investor really, it comes down to the dollar and cents of it all. And you can see, you know, in terms of the performance of those share prices, even though there was a lot of excitement around it, you know, maybe the rest remains to be seen if you will.MCDOWELL: I just want to point out Kevin Kelly, the day that this company filed its IPO on this show went through all -- the host of problems with this company, not just the governance and the fact that what the co-founder has 20 votes per share -- like 20 votes per share, so a complete voting control of the company, in addition to the kind of upside down business model that this company has.So it's trying to raise money to expand, to grow, when it's not making money now. And this kind of market environment, good luck selling shares with that pitch.ROSCHELLE: Well, what's interesting --CARTER: It just seems though that there's a -- there's a big opportunity in this space for a company that's going to make more sense. So they might have gone and made this splash. Now there's a lot of others that are coming up behind it that maybe could make a business model that make more sense.ROSCHELLE: The challenge is it's very capital intensive. So you're talking about Uber and Lyft, there the capital investment is on that part of an independent driver who buys or leases a car. Here, they have to buy -- you know, sign this long-term lease to secure, that takes a lot of capital and a lot of commitment.DEANGELIS: Yes, and I said, if the housing market were to turn or people were not feeling as stable if we do see the economy at some point go into a recession, that's going to be a problem in terms of delivering on those leases, I think.BARTIROMO: All right. Jackie, we'll be watching. Thanks so much.DEANGELIS: Sure.BARTIROMO: Important story there.Coming up, my exclusive interview with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is coming up on trade, the Fed, debt, Fannie and Freddie all that coming up, 8:00 a.m. Eastern this morning.Then, Sony updates one of its signature products with a 2019 makeover. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The Centers for Disease Control issuing a new warning against vaping. Cheryl Casone with the details this morning, Cheryl.CASONE: Yes, Maria, the number of deaths possibly linked to vaping has now jumped to five. Three additional deaths confirmed on Friday in Indiana, Minnesota and California following two previously reported deaths. CDC is currently investigating about 450 cases of severe lung illness nationwide, potentially connected to e-cigarette use.Well, Tesla fans will going to have to wait a little while longer to check out the company's electric pickup. The truck which CEO Elon Musk calls the coolest car I've ever seen was expected this summer or next month. But the reveal's been pushed back to November. Musk says it's a really futuristic, like cyber punk blade runner pickup truck. That's what he said.The Tesla truck would compete against an all-electric version of Ford's popular F-150 which could be available in 2021.Well, before smart phones and Bluetooth there was the Walkman. Remember the Sony Walkman? Well, the revolutionary portable music player that changed how we listen to our music celebrates its 40th anniversary this year.Sony is making the occasion releasing a new version, one with modern technology to support downloads and stream music. The new Walkman even comes with a soft case to make it look like the ancestor, complete with a touch screen window on the player, makes it looks like there's a cassette actually playing inside, Maria. So what's old is new again or something like that.BARTIROMO: Well, I can't wait to see it. And I think it's such an important reminder of how technology, the next better thing will take you out in three seconds. It was the Walkman which really all started us on, you know, music, mobile music and you know, walking around and having our earphones with our music and that was the rage until Apple came out and took the Walkman out.ROSCHELLE: How about the boom box? Why are we forgetting about the boom box?CARTER: I mean, just think about the impact that this had on our lives. It's like we were able to have a sound track to our lives, be able to walk around, listening to music and it's totally -- and you're right, it's such an important reminder to say like just one day, just like that, something can disrupt and come along that you're not even thinking of, so.BARTIROMO: Yes, Dagen?MCDOWELL: The -- I saw a boom box (INAUDIBLE) --ROSCHELLE: I saw a guy with a boom box yesterday.MCDOWELL: Yes, just -- and it was an old school boom box. I don't know how old the thing was with the cassette -- the cassette player in the front of it.CARTER: Say anything.MCDOWELL: But Sony had a good long run though throughout the '80s, and it went from the Walkman with the cassette tape to the Discman.BARTIROMO: Oh, you had the Discman.MCDOWELL: SO it was into the -- remember the round disc?BARTIROMO: Oh, yes, I had one of those.ROSCHELLE: You had to run very stably if you had the Discman or else it would start skipping on you.MCDOWELL: You ran with the Discman?ROSCHELLE: I ran with the Discman. Yes, I had to shop with Discman.MCDOWELL: (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: That's hard.MCDOWELL: Like you're carrying a China dish.BARTIROMO: Or tape it to your body somehow.MCDOWELL: Because it would skip (INAUDIBLE).BARTIROMO: All right, quick break and then my exclusive interview with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is coming up on trade, the Fed, Fannie and Freddie, next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA, right here, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Happy Monday, it is Monday, September 9th. Your top stories right now, just before 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.U.S.-China trade is in focus this morning once again. Officials confirming the next round of face-to-face talks next month that will happen in Washington in early October.However, we are seeing new signs of the economy in China continues to slow. As a result, of this partly Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is my special guest. He will join me moments from now to discuss that, as well as how housing finance and the Treasury's new plan.Markets this morning are higher. Futures are indicating a gain (AUDIO GAP) we are off of the best levels of the morning. Dow (AUDIO GAP) 51, S&P Futures up nine and the NASDAQ Futures up 15-1/4.On top of a pretty good week last week, markets were higher across the board. Dow Industrials up 1-1/2 percent at the close on Friday for the week. The S&P and the NASDAQ both up 1-3/4 percent.European Indices this morning are mixed.Load-Date: September 9, 2019End of Document

CHINA WILL DOMINATE HIGH-TECH UNLESS THE UNITED STATES TAKES OFF THE GLOVES | MON, 02 SEP 2019 07:47 EDTStates News ServiceSeptember 2, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1305 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for the National Interest (former the Nixon Center):Chinas ability to strike back at the U.S. proposed tariffs on Chinese imports was made dramatically apparent last week when markets reacted negatively to Chinas devaluation of the yuan and the announcement that it would impose an additional $75 billion in tariffs on U.S. goods. The U.S.-China trade war has affected businesses from Apple to American cherry growers and shows no signs of halting. President Donald Trump responded with additional retaliatory tariffs and a storm of tweets, demanding American businesses to immediately start looking for an alternative to China and leaving the country altogether. At the root of this trade war is the Trump administrations belief that the economy and security are intrinsically linked, notably in the realm of telecommunications.Telecommunications has become the nexus of U.S. frustration at unfair Chinese trade practices and concerns that the Chinese government is utilizing the networks of private Chinese corporations to spy on foreign governments and corporations. At the center of the debate is the leading Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei, which has been accused of poor ethics, shoddy security, intellectual property theft and even spying for years.In response, the Trump administration has signed an executive order that has all but named and banned Huawei products, and is appealing to allies to do the same. Trump contends that the negative impact on the U.S. economy in the short term is irrelevant because somebody had to take China on and his belief that the U.S. will be better off in the end. Yet, the profuse debate around Huawei and the Trump administrations trade war reveals a fundamental weakness in the American economy: its lack of competitiveness.5GIn addition to allowing consumers to download movies and browse the internet at high speeds, fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks will fundamentally alter the economy; the Internet of Things, smart manufacturing, automation and defense will be built upon the new network. Whichever country leads in 5G development will engineer and manufacture not only the network itself, but the applications and devices accompanying it. As 5G spreads, so will related devices and technologies, making this country the global leader in wireless technology.Huaweis entrance into the American 5G and broader telecommunications market concerns security experts. The Chinese government and Chinese companies have continually infiltrated U.S. corporations and government agencies: the data breach on the Office of Personnel Management, the theft of NSA cybertools, and the ongoing hacking of prominent American businesses are a few recent examples of these determined efforts. Furthermore, the Chinese government mandates that all telecommunications equipment installed or manufactured in China retain backdoor access, exemplified recently with security camera manufacturer Xionmai. This means that allowing Huawei components to be installed throughout the U.S. telecommunications network would leave the United States vulnerable to infiltration.American CompetitivenessAlthough the United States should continue to defend against potential security threats posed by Chinese firms, it should not rely on these protections only as a strategy to maintain competitiveness. The erosion of U.S. dominance in other key sectors, such as automobiles and consumer electronics, suggest that there are more fundamental problems.According to Sandra Rivera, an executive vice president at Intel: There is no U.S.-based wireless access equipment provider today that builds [5G] solutions. Considering the critical economic and security interests associated with 5G, it is alarming that the United States has not shown greater leadership in developing it, losing ground to Huawei and other international competitors. 5G is the technology of the future, yet the United States is not even a competitor. A willingness by the United States to invest in 5G would sideline the entire Huawei debate.American competitiveness has also declined in other industries. For example, while U.S. robotics development may have peaked, Chinas robotics industry is advancing at an incredible rate. Last year China installed 136,000 robots, dwarfing the 34,000 installed in the United States, leaving the United States disadvantaged in worker productivity. In 2026, China is forecasted to become the worlds largest user of robots.China has been making similarly impressive inroads in artificial intelligence: by 2020, China is expected to surpass the United States in the number of artificial intelligence (AI) research papers published, even when controlling for research quality. In contrast to the United States, where most research is conducted with private funding and oversight, most Chinese research receives government support and funding.Energy, biotechnology, shipping and electric vehicleshigh-tech, high-value industries that have historically been dominated by the United Stateshave all seen considerable progress by Chinese companies. But these companies benefit from Beijings willingness to subsidize high-tech industries. A small glimpse of the subsidies provided by the Chinese government include $58.8 billion in support for electric cars between 2009 and 2017, $435 million contributed to solar this year, and $65.5 billion Guangdong province plans to invest in strategic industries including robotics. When necessary, the Chinese government is willing to bankroll valuable industries to ensure their success and promote international dominance.U.S. lawmakers are beginning to take note of Chinas strategy. Recently, a bipartisan coalition of senators unveiled the 5G Leadership Act, promising $700 million to replace Huawei telecommunications tech in rural American communities. Though it mitigates vulnerability to Chinese influence, this legislation fails to offer a plan for promoting the innovation of American alternatives. As such, its $700 million is merely a costly band-aid.More than Just a SpoilerWhile the Trump administration has legitimate national security reasons for banning Huawei tech, the ban does not address the U.S. decline as a global leader in research and technological innovation.Huawei tech poses an apparent threat to both national and corporate security, but the current approach of eradicating already-installed equipment, banning its future use, and urging allies to follow suit without offering an American product comparable in quality and price has a range of unintended consequences. Not only does it imperil U.S. access to the cutting edge of technology and 5G connectivity, but it is also halting efforts to expand access to basic wireless connectivity in the same rural areas Trump promised not to ignore.If the United States wishes to maintain its high-tech leadership, it must be willing to invest in the industries critical to success in the twenty-first century. This investment doesnt need to be monetary only; it could be regulatory. The United States recently ranked forty-sixth in the world for ease of starting a new business, behind Afghanistan. It could be in human capital; the cost of higher education has ballooned to 11.1 times what it was in 1980. Or it could be in immigration reform; over a third of U.S. venture-backed startups have at least one foreign-born founder. Possible solutions abound, but what is clear is the United States needs to do something. By doing nothing, Washington is ensuring its future technological irrelevance.Tom Le is an assistant professor of politics at Pomona College. He is on Twitter at @profTLe.

Security firm says Chinese hackers intercepted text messagesAssociated Press InternationalOctober 31, 2019 Thursday 2:35 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 532 wordsByline: By TAMI ABDOLLAH, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - Chinese hackers with a history of state-sponsored espionage have intercepted the text messages of thousands of foreigners in a targeted campaign that planted eavesdropping software on a telecommunications provider's servers, a cybersecurity firm said.FireEye said in a report issued on Thursday that the hackers belong to the group designated Advanced Persistent Threat 41 , or APT41, which it says has been involved in spying and cybercrime for most of the past decade. It said some of the targets were "high-value" and all were chosen by their phone numbers and unique cellphone identifiers known as IMSI numbers.The cybersecurity firm would not identify or otherwise characterize the victims or the impacted telecoms provider or give its location. It said only that the telecom is in a country that's typically a strategic competitor to China.The spyware was programmed to capture messages containing references to political leaders, military and intelligence organizations and political movements at odds with the Chinese government, FireEye said.FireEye's director of advanced practices, Steven Stone, said that none of the known targets was a U.S. government official.The discovered malware, which FireEye dubbed MESSAGETAP, was able to collect data on its targets without their knowledge but could not read messages sent with end-to-end encrypted applications such as WhatsApp and iMessage."If you're one of these targets you have no idea your message traffic is being taken from your device because your device hasn't been infected," Stone said.FireEye said the hackers also stole detailed calling records on specific individuals, obtaining the phone numbers they interacted with, call durations and times.A government representative at China's embassy in Washington, D.C., did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.FireEye did not identify the maker of the equipment that was hacked or specify how the hackers penetrated the telecom provider networks.It said APT41 began using MESSAGETAP during the summer, which is around when pro-democracy protests began in Hong Kong. The firm said since its discovery, it has found "multiple" telecoms targeted by the malware.FireEye said it has observed APT41 targeting four telecoms this year as well as major travel services and healthcare providers in countries it did not identify.Details of the espionage operation come as the U.S. tries to persuade allied governments to shun Chinese telecom equipment providers led by Huawei as they build next-generation wireless networks known as 5G, claiming they represent a risk to national security.The U.S. government already has banned government agencies and contractors from using equipment supplied by Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese company. It is now seeking to bar their use in telecom projects that receive federal funding.Huawei vehemently denies that it has allowed China's communist rulers to use its equipment for espionage, and Washington has presented no proof of such. U.S. officials say a 2017 Chinese law requires organizations and citizens to help the state collect intelligence.___Follow Tami Abdollah on Twitter at https://twitter.com/latamsLoad-Date: November 1, 2019End of Document

USA blacklists 28 Chinese tech companies over alleged human rights violationsStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeOctober 8, 2019 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 577 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBody"The U.S. government and Department of Commerce can not and will not tolerate the brutal suppression of ethnic minorities within China", Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement.Rights groups say China has detained around one million Uighurs and other Muslims in re-education camps in the region - actions that Washington has said are reminiscent of Nazi Germany.In addition to the companies, the People's Government Public Security Bureau in Xinjiang and 19 of its "subordinate elements" have also been put on the list, according to the announcement.A US Commerce Department spokesman said the "action is unrelated to the trade negotiations", and China confirmed Vice Premier Liu He would lead the delegation as planned.The US Commerce Division introduced Monday it's blacklisting 28 Chinese language entities that it says are implicated in rights violations and abuses focusing on Uighurs and different largely Muslim minorities within the Xinjiang area.Among the 28 entities are eight Chinese technology companies, including Hikvision, the world's largest video surveillance products supplier, and its peer Zhejiang Dahua Technology; voice recognition software developer iFlytek; forensics app developer Meiya Pico; artificial intelligence giant SenseTime and its smaller peers Megvii and Yitu, as well as Yixin Science and Technology, a supplier of micro and nano fabrication equipment.Hikvision responded to the new by saying the company "strongly opposes today's decision by the United States government" and that the firm "respects human rights and takes our responsibility to protect people in the U.S. and the world seriously". The affected list also includes some regional government agencies in China.The US government Entity List has been used to limit the influence of Huawei for "national security reasons".'Zombie deer' disease reported in 35 Kansas countiesThe disease has also spread to South Korea through the importing of captive elk, and to reindeer in Norway, Finland and Sweden. The CDC highly recommends hunters have their animals tested before they eat it to avoid consuming any disease infected venison.Over the longer term, the blacklist could hamper the entities' access to the United States and European markets, as well as damage recruitment efforts. As The Wall Street Journal notes, they can also find ways around the ban such as selling Chinese firms goods made outside the U.S. like what Huawei's suppliers have been doing.Reuters reported in August Hikvision receives almost 30% of its 50 billion yuan ($7 billion) in revenue from overseas.Megvii, which is backed by e-commerce giant Alibaba, said in a statement that it "strongly" protests against the decision, which it insisted was "without any factual basis".Listed firms including iFlytek, Hikvision and Dahua halted stock trading in the morning session on Tuesday.The company said it has spent a year trying to "clarify misunderstandings about the company and address their concerns", and that this will hurt its USA business partners.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week at the Vatican that "when the state rules absolutely, it demands its citizens worship government, not God".This isn't the first time the Trump administration has slapped a major Chinese company with a ban.Huawei has repeatedly denied it is controlled by the Chinese government, military or intelligence services and has filed a lawsuit against the USA government's restrictions.Load-Date: October 8, 2019End of Document

GARDNER, MERKLEY INTRODUCE BILL TO ADDRESS CHINA'S INTIMIDATION OF AMERICAN BUSINESSES LEGISLATION WILL CREATE U.S. GOVERNMENT TASKFORCE AND REPORT TO CONGRESSStates News ServiceOctober 30, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 329 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by Colorado Senator Cory Gardner:U.S. Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) and Senator Jeff Merkley (D-OR), members of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy, introduced bipartisan legislation today to create a U.S. government taskforce that will monitor instances of China intimidating U.S. companies that exercise free speech."It's well known that China oppresses individual freedoms within its own borders, but we know it doesn't end there," said Senator Gardner. "Recently we've seen American companies censor themselves to avoid Chinese retaliation, which sends a chilling ripple effect across our country and further empowers the Chinese Communist Party. The first step to solving any problem is knowing its full extent and that's why I'm grateful to partner with Senator Merkley on this bipartisan effort to monitor China's oppression within U.S. borders.""Since the founding of our nation, freedom of speech has been a central pillar in our democracy, but the Chinese government is using their economic power to punish American companies who exercise their free speech rights," said Senator Merkley. "Our government needs to stand up for Americans and stand up for free speech. That starts by making sure we know when and how the Chinese government is censoring or punishing Americans for expressing themselves."The legislation would create a US Government task force ("China Censorship Monitor and Action Group"), comprised of the Department of State, Department of Commerce, the Federal Communications Commission, and the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which would consult with stakeholders in media and the private sector to create a public database documenting instances of China's diplomatic or economic intimidation of U.S. companies that exercise free speech.The task force would produce an annual report with recommendations and regularly consult with Congress.Load-Date: October 31, 2019End of Document

Manufacturing in the USA vs. China: AI Could Be the Tipping PointBusiness WireOctober 2, 2019 Wednesday 8:00 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 978 wordsDateline: SINGAPORE BodyIndustrial manufacturing is the heartbeat of the economy for the United States and China, hence building Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities in industrial manufacturing is not only critical for economic transformation but also a stepping stone toward sustainable competitive advantages. ABI Research, a global tech market advisory firm, found that despite the nearly equal number of installed bases of AI-enabled end device in both markets, the United States has an edge over China due to its different incentives and approaches that encourage AI adoption in industrial manufacturing.In the United States, the ecosystem of AI in industrial applications is growing quickly. The expensive labor force has driven the industrial sector to enhance production efficiency and lower operational costs. Currently, cloud service providers, smart manufacturing platform vendors, pure-play industrial AI platform and service providers, edge industrial AI gateway and server vendors, and chipset vendors are partnering with each other to bring AI into industrial manufacturing. "Major cloud players, AWS and Microsoft, have established a wide range of partnerships with industrial AI development platform vendors, AI software vendors, and system integrators to provide an end-to-end, cloud-to-edge solution to enhance operational efficiency, reduce bottlenecks, and optimize resource consumption in factories," said Lian Jye Su, Principal Analyst at ABI Research.In China, the Chinese government has listed 10 key industrial manufacturing segments under Made in China in 2025, and AI is a strategic component of the Information Technology segment. Since 2015, the government has been encouraging provincial and local government, public agencies, and state-owned enterprises to adopt AI in industrial manufacturing. Chinese cloud AI conglomerates such as Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei, and Tencent have all made AI in smart manufacturing a key priority in their business strategy. Manufacturing giant Foxconn even spun out Foxconn Industrial Internet (FII), a company focusing on developing software and building hardware, including precision tools, servers for cloud services, and robots, to accelerate its digitalization effort. However, despite the government's will to transform the industrial sector, small- and medium-size manufacturers, which represent a significant proportion of the manufacturing sector in the region, are less incentivized to follow the government guidance in adopting AI and automated operations. For these players, it is still economically viable and more practical to perform back-end operation tasks manually via a cheap and abundant workforce.Under these circumstances, it is very hard to build a pure-play industrial AI vendor ecosystem in China. A lot of industrial and manufacturing startups in China are still focused on the connectivity layer, instead of pure-play industrial AI solutions. AI market leaders like Alibaba are visionary and have their own suite of AI-based solutions for industrial manufacturing. However, these cloud AI companies do not often have the right connections and go-to-market channel to reach many provincial and municipal manufacturers where the majority of small- and medium-size manufacturers reside, and are still relying on existing relationships with legacy solution providers, local system integrators, and most importantly on cheap labor to support back-end operations.On the other hand, industrial AI startups in the United States are more mature than their global peers. C3, Falkonry, FogHorn, Sight Machine, SparkCognition, Uptake, and Zymergen are some of the highly recognized startups with proven solutions in AI development platforms, material synthesis, machine vision, and operational efficiency enhancement. Being vendor agnostic, they can coexist with many well-established industrial solution providers such as ABB, GE, Siemens, and Honeywell, and bring AI into brownfield deployment, lowering upfront cost and the barrier to adoption. Through their partnership with system integrators and regional distributors, these startups have also ventured into Europe, South Korea, and Japan."The high labor cost and the quick time-to-market have driven U.S. manufacturers to be more aggressive with the adoption of industrial AI solutions. This has given birth to pure-play AI players in the US, and as such, keeps the US to be the global leader in industrial AI solutions. Over time, however, we believe that China will catch up. The investments poured into AI and all its adjacencies, such as 5G and robotics, will create new opportunities for domestic companies that focus on AI in industrial manufacturing and this will boost China's sustainable competitive advantages," Su concluded.These findings are from ABI Research's AI in Industrial Applications application analysis report. This report is part of the company's            Industrial Solution research service, which includes research, data, and analyst insights.

Ian Harris: Entertainment vs. the Communist Party of ChinaMichigan Daily: University of Michigan-Ann ArborOctober 10, 2019 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: ARTS; Pg. 1Length: 798 wordsByline: Ian HarrisBodyIn the past ten days, the NBA has become embroiled in a PR war with the Chinese government, video game developer Blizzard banned a player for showing solidarity with the people of Hong Kong and South Park was erased from existence within the digital walls of China. In an increasingly connected world of global entertainment, is it fair for consumers to judge companies for kowtowing to the demands of governments that they don't support? How far should entertainment conglomerates go in order to get into the Chinese marketplace? Is there a line at which consumers and corporations alike should say enough is enough?Most American citizens probably didn't grow up thinking much about Hong Kong or the socio-political ramifications of its "one country - two systems" relationship with mainland China. I know I didn't. It wasn't something that was taught in school, it wasn't a part of world history that was treated as significant for American students. The euro-centric view through which world politics and history are taught has been expounded upon to death in other places, so I won't waste time re-hashing it here. What I will say is that even up to today I never thought much of the situation in Hong Kong besides "bad things are happening there" until a former co-worker of mine from summer camp posted on our old staff Facebook page. A Hong Kong native, he expressed his fear about what was happening in his country and reached out asking for prayers, help and a promise that we would help him raise awareness of what was happening. This column is my way of doing that. Over the weekend, Houston Rockets manager Daryl Morey tweeted an image that said "Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong." Though the tweet was soon deleted, it has created an uproar in both China and the United States. Chinese broadcasters soon announced they would drop Rockets pre-season games from their channels, the NBA commissioner flip-flopped back and forth over what to say in response, and a consensus of social outrage has emerged from Americans upset that one of their nations most popular sports leagues would bend to the whims of what is essentially a country in thrall to a dictator. Blizzard, the company behind games like "World of Warcraft," banned a player for publicly supporting Hong Kong protestors and was met with a wave of #BoycotBlizzard pronouncements across the internet. South Park responded to being banned in China by continuing to mock the Chinese government. Which of these responses was the right one?While many have come out against the NBA for attempting to protect their business interests in China over their employees's right to free speech, few have batted an eye at the ways in which Disney and other media conglomerates have sought to appease the Chinese government and marketplace over the past few years. For years rumors have abounded that the reason why there hasn't yet been an LGBTQ character introduced in a mainline Marvel or Star Wars movie is because Disney is afraid of how such a character would be perceived in China. This year the Chinese box office is expected to outstrip the USA as the largest film market in the world. Movies that bomb in America are now counting on making up that money overseas, particularly in China. But the Chinese government over the past two decades has slowly tightened the noose on freedom of expression, meaning that for domestic entertainment products to successfully export themselves they must also censor themselves in the process. This is a country that banned Winnie the Pooh because there were memes floating around of the President of the Communist Party that looked sorta like Winnie the Pooh. This is what the NBA is dealing with. Is it right to let a country that is violently putting down protests in Hong Kong every single weekend dictate the terms upon which American entertainment should be made?Money drives everything in this country and has for a long time. To demand that Disney or the NBA or Blizzard not do business in China would accomplish almost nothing. Apple, Nike, Adidas and dozens of other countries also rely on the Chinese market for huge portions of their revenue. They aren't just going to stop selling products in every country with policies Americans don't agree with. But more can be done to prevent their own employees' freedoms being rolled over in the process. The Rockets GM should be able to tweet his feelings about a totalitarian government that is actively harming its own citizens and he should not be punished for doing so. If we can't protect that much, if we can't protect our own freedoms of speech from countries and groups that would seek to silence us, then it doesn't matter what happens politically in these fifty states because we'll have already lost where it counts.Load-Date: October 10, 2019End of Document

Senators Call for TikTok Investigation Over Chinese Espionage ConcernsBillboardOctober 24, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Prometheus Global Media, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; TAGLength: 451 wordsByline: Chris EggertsenHighlight: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Tom Cotton have asked U.S. intelligence officials to look into security risks posed by the Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok, as stated in a letter addressed to acting director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire on Wednesday (Oct. 23).BodySenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Tom Cotton have asked U.S. intelligence officials to look into security risks posed by the Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok, as stated in a letter addressed to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire on Wednesday."With over 110 million downloads in the U.S. alone, TikTok is a potential counterintelligence threat we cannot ignore," wrote Schumer and Cotton in the letter.They went on to voice their concerns that the app -- which is owned by Chinese technology company ByteDance -- could be used for intelligence-gathering and foreign influence campaigns by the Chinese Communist Party, which controls the country's government. "Without an independent judiciary to review requests made by the Chinese government for data or other actions, there is no legal mechanism for Chinese companies to appeal if they disagree with a request," they continued.The letter also raises alarms about the possible "censorship or manipulation of certain content" on the platform, pointing to recent media            reports that TikTok removes materials "deemed to be politically sensitive to the Chinese Communist Party," including any content related to the recent protests in Hong Kong as well as references to Tiananmen Square, Tibetan and Taiwanese independence and the treatment of the country's embattled Uighur minority.On Thursday (Oct. 24), TikTok released a lengthy statement that attempts to refute the senators' allegations by noting the app stores its user data entirely outside of China and is therefore not "subject to Chinese law." It further notes that TikTok has "a dedicated technical team focused on adhering to robust cybersecurity policies, and data privacy and security practices" and that it does not remove content based on political sensitivities to the Chinese government."We have never been asked by the Chinese government to remove any content and we would not do so if asked. Period," the statement reads. "Our US moderation team, which is led out of California, reviews content for adherence to our US policies -- just like other US companies in our space. We are not influenced by any foreign government, including the Chinese government; TikTok does not operate in China, nor do we have any intention of doing so in the future."TikTok has been the subject of increased scrutiny on multiple fronts as of late. Earlier this month, the National Music Publishers' Association (NMPA) called on Congress to investigate the app over potential copyright theft. That move followed Sen. Marco Rubio's prior request for an investigation into the company by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).Link to ImageLoad-Date: January 23, 2020End of Document

From Apple to 'South Park,' Entertainment Companies Grapple With Profit Versus Ethics in ChinaIndiewire TVOctober 18, 2019Copyright 2019 Penske Media Corporation All Rights ReservedLength: 1377 wordsBodyApple TV+ shows are going to hit on a variety of topical themes, but don't expect any of them to be critical of China. Apple's upcoming streaming service made headlines late last week when BuzzFeed News reported that the company told some of its show developers to avoid angering the country, the latest news in a string of recent controversies regarding Western companies and their increasingly complicated relationships with China.Although major American entities such as Apple, the National Basketball Association, and Irvine-based video game developer Blizzard Entertainment have done business with China for years, stateside discontent regarding those relationships has increased in the last few weeks in the wake of the ongoing Hong Kong protests. It's creating a dynamic where companies have to choose between their morals and their bottom line - and growth, more often than not, wins.Take the case of Apple. On one hand, China is an essential business partner for the company, as much of its tech is manufactured there, and it's important for the two entities to maintain a profitable relationship. On the other hand, it's apparent that if Apple continues working with China, it will be doing so in spite of its purported company values, according to Keybanc analyst Andy Hargraves."Their brand is about freedom, fairness and equality, and yet here they are supporting what is widely viewed as a suppressive regime," Hargraves said. "Complying with the communist government of China is allowing them to export their view of the world to the rest of the world. The only way to settle that is to not comply, and if you don't comply, you have to accept that you won't do business there."Apple TV+ will not be available in mainland China, though the upcoming streaming service will be available in Hong Kong, according to Apple's website. The company's website notes that Apple media services available in China include its app store, Apple Music, Apple Podcast, and the Videos app. Apple            recently removed an app from its iOS App Store that allowed Hong Kong protestors to track police.Spokespersons for Apple, Blizzard Entertainment, and the NBA did not return requests for comment.For Blizzard Entertainment, recent criticism has revolved around the company penalizing several professional video game players who expressed support for Hong Kong protestors, while the NBA came under fire after distancing itself from a            since-deleted tweet from Houston Rockets' general manager Daryl Morey that expressed support for Hong Kong.Of course, not all American entertainment creators have backed off in the wake of Chinese pressure. The 299th episode of "South Park," titled "Band in China," which aired October 2, parodied the country's strict censorship laws, which caused the Chinese government to            ban the series in the country and scrub every mention of it from the Chinese internet. "South Park" co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have since doubled down and have continued mocking the country in subsequent episodes, which is all rather remarkable since they are in the midst of a reported            $500 million bidding war for the streaming rights to the show.Though the duo declined an interview request for this article, they've made their thoughts on the issue clear in a string of recent tweets on the official "South Park" Twitter account, such as:Watch the full episode - https://t.co/oktKSJdI9i           @THR article -            https://t.co/nXrtmnwCJB           pic.twitter.com/Xj5a1yE2eL- South Park (@SouthPark) October 7, 2019Still, "South Park" is somewhat of an outlier. For global-minded companies such as Apple, it's financially critical for them to placate, rather than agitate, one of its most important business partners, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives."The most important thing is for China to remain a major growth market for Apple, and anything that could cause less disruption there is viewed as a positive from an investor perspective," Ives said. "But there are negative perceptions associated with that, and Apple needs to manage that from a public perception. Most U.S. tech companies have not been successful in China, but there are a billion-plus consumers there, so there's a lot of growth in China."Regardless, the recent news about American businesses taking steps to appease the Chinese government is not an indication of a new trend. American entertainment companies often allow their products to be censored or be recut for release in China, which often bans content that features graphic violence, blood, homosexuality, or other specific themes. "Suicide Squad" was reportedly banned in China due to its violence, while the country's zombie ban allegedly stopped "World War Z' from showing in China,            among other reasons. Quentin Tarantino's "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood" was            blocked by censors a week before its scheduled release.Last year's "Christopher Robin" was also banned in China, as the country has a widespread ban on any and all things Winnie the Pooh-related-the anthropomorphic bear is something of a resistance symbol for Chinese citizens, who draw mocking comparisons between the character and China president Xi Jinping.That said, if box office numbers are any indication, China is still a significant factor in the success of mainstream American films. Films such as last year's "Tomb Raider" and            "Pacific Rim: Uprising" performed better in China than they did in the United States, according to Box Office Mojo. And then there was 2016's "Warcraft," based on the hit strategy and massively multiplayer online Blizzard Entertainment games: The film didn't crack $50 million at the domestic box office, but            soared in China, with a total gross of over $225 million.Although China has historically been a significant consumer of American media and some technology products, the balance of power is beginning to shift and doesn't indicate that American companies are advantaged when working with China, according to Andrew Polk, a founding partner at Trivium China, which analyzes China's political, economic, and technology sectors."For Apple, having an iPhone in the last 10 years instead of a phone from a cheaper, local competitor was a symbol of status as a Chinese person, but Chinese competitors have caught up," Polk said. "The NBA has the ultimate leverage in that it is a completely unique product you can't substitute with anything else. I think the Chinese government saw the reality of that and dialed its tone back because it knew it would force Chinese consumers to choose between the country and this other thing they really like. Most other companies don't have that much leverage."Although some critics have made note of films that            blatantly pander to Chinese audiences via product placements, throwaway character castings or random plot devices that bring the action to China (see: "Transformers: The Last Knight" and "Independence Day: Resurgence"), such things are comparatively benign to when American companies begin policing domestic consumers to stay in China's good graces.That concern has become especially relevant recently: After the aforementioned tweet from the Houston Rockets' Morey, some NBA fans began bringing pro-Hong Kong signs to basketball games. Those signs were reportedly confiscated and some fans            were kicked out.These issues aren't going to go away, and as China continues to bolster its economic power, American companies are going to need to begin addressing the fine line of ethical responsibility and financial profit, according to Polk."China's system is creating censorship outside of China, and you also see this to some extent in the NBA with people getting kicked out of games for making Hong Kong signs," Polk said. "For most businesses the big growth market is still Asia, centered around China, so from a business strategy, it makes sense. The question is, should companies be making moral or ethical decisions at the expense of their growth strategy, which I think is worth a debate."More from IndieWirePeak TV Is Only a Concern in the Gated Community of Hollywood           Netflix Misses Q3 U.S. Subscriber Forecast, Citing Price HikeLoad-Date: October 18, 2019End of Document

China's Power to the United StatesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 9, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 444 wordsBodyThe problems surrounding the "Made in China 2025" initiative have become symptomatic of a trend in which the United States and China see each other as a technological rival.This already contributes to the growing sense of a more general rivalry between the two powers.According to an analysis by the European Union Parliament, this is expected to mark the 21st century in the same way that the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union marked most of the second half of the 20th century.The Chinese Academy of Engineering, an influential advisory committee of the State Council, published the Key Area of Technology Roadmap in the "Made in China 2025" program in October 2015, where it describes localization objectives for strategic sectors.This program has, like, other targets for Chinese companies to increase the domestic market share of advanced medical instruments from 50 to 90%; 50 to 70% in technology products for smart cars, and 50 to 80% in robot components.China's powerDiscussion of the geopolitical implications of China's rise and power has been framed, in particular, in an article published by G. Allison in 2015, in which Professor Allison discusses whether the United States and China are likely to escape the Cheating , defined as the "accompanying dangers when a growing power rivals a ruling power, as Athens challenged Sparta in ancient Greece."It stresses in particular the "inexorable structural stress caused by a rapid shift in the balance of power between two rivals", and even emphasizes elsewhere that "never before in history has a nation increased so much, so rapidly, in so many dimensions of power ( Like China.""Chinese government targetsAccording to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Made in China 2025 "aims to harness the power of the state to alter competitive dynamics in global markets in industries critical to economic competitiveness."The plan supports 10 sectors: new energy vehicles, state-of-the-art information technology (IT), biotechnology, new materials, aerospace, ocean engineering and high-tech ships, railways, robotics, power equipment and agricultural machinery.Since 2014, China's central government has announced at least $250.7 billion (RMB$1.7 trillion) in state funds to support the development of these strategic sectors and the acquisition of foreign technology and expertiseThe Made in China 2025 and "Internet Plus" initiatives aim to capitalize on the emergence of integrated digital technology and automation to help the transition of the country's economy to greater value added in manufacturing and services, and to stimulate creation of "national champions" in emerging industries.  Load-Date: October 10, 2019End of Document

A dramatic 10th inning eliminates one of baseball's top teams from the playoffs last night. We have all the highlights.MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.And Good morning, everybody. We have a great show this morning.Joining the conversation, Fox Business' Dagen McDowell, "The Wall Street Journal's" wealth management reporter and host of "The Secrets of Wealthy Women" podcast, Veronica Dagher is here, and "The Wall Street Journal's" assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman.Great to see everybody this morning.JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL": Good to be here. Thanks.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Great to be here.BARTIROMO: Yes, the issues around China are deepening. That is our top story. Markets are watching every turn in the U.S.-China trade talk situation. The two sides holding high-level negotiations this morning ahead of increased U.S. tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods set to go into effect on October 15th. Going in effect October 15th.Washington also extending an olive branch of sorts to Beijing, granting licenses for some U.S. companies, some companies, to do business with Chinese telecom giant Huawei.All of this as the creep of authoritarian rule seems to be getting closer and closer and closer to American business. I mean you are seeing China bully American companies across the board. Apple just caved to business. You wrote this great op-ed this morning in the -- about Activation Blizzard.What's your take on all of this?FREEMAN: Yes, I think the regime is kind of revealing how -- how thuggish they are. But I feel like in past years they used to be a little more subtle. This is now not subtle at all. NBA, the video-game maker, basically a player said -- had a free Hong Kong message, immediately fired, his title taken away, prize money stripped. And so I think you are -- you are seeing, maybe on the encouraging side, maybe the NBA fans aren't necessarily going to go along with management's decision not to ruffle any feathers in China. We saw this badly a little while ago showing the Washington Wizards game where fans saying free Hong Kong -- their signs being removed. Some of them being escorted out of the arena.But I think a lot of customers don't necessarily want a -- want to knuckle under to China, even if management does.BARTIROMO: Yes, people don't want to knuckle under. But this is really concerning, the fact that China is extending its authoritarian rule wherever it feels like it can take effect, in America. And, I mean, you know, we know that they track their citizens in China. They are also tracking whoever they can in America, by the way.What do you think, Dagen?MCDOWELL: I know for a fact from CEO's that they are careful about what they say about China --BARTIROMO: Absolutely.MCDOWELL: On the air because every major CEO in this country essentially has an individual or individuals in China tracking their every word -- what -- that they say in public, tracking their every move. That -- that just goes on. And we've heard that privately. So the CEO's from American corporations really parse their words and are very careful about what they say, even in -- when they're on American television networks and talking to American reporters.BARTIROMO: Yes, can I -- can I just say one thing to -- to this point.Yesterday we had Jonathan Ward on, the founder of the Atlas Organization. He made such an important point, I thought. And it's sort of like the elephant in the room. You can't get the tweets from the general manager of the Houston Rockets in China. That was only in America.MCDOWELL: Right, that's -- that is China acting to put their thumb on American free speech.BARTIROMO: That's what I'm saying.MCDOWELL: and that's why there is such an outrage. There's such an outrage with the NBA because they put out separate statements and the one that was in mandarin was a great deal harsher when translated back to English.I want to point this out, though. This is something that has been brought to the forefront simply because of President Trump and what he's trying to do taking on China.Apple, for example, has -- in the past, has been quick to react to China's demands.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: 2013, Tim Cook issues an apology to quell criticism from the state run media with -- about Apple's warranties and discriminating, quote/unquote, against Chinese customers. This is in "The Journal" today.Apple also has deleted hundreds of apps from its mainland China App Store in recent years, including "The New York Times" in 2017.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: And (INAUDIBLE) app from the App Store in China was removed. That's a news outlet.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: And that just happened recently.BARTIROMO: And Apple issues a statement now talking about the app that they have removed. It said this. The app displays police locations and we have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement. The app violates our guidelines and local laws.MCDOWELL: We've -- we've got Apple basically caving in here and saying that it's because the police are ambushed, but the good news about that app was it was enabling people to connect. If you're in Hong Kong, connect with one another to see where the police are, but also where other people are. So it's, I don't know, I mean I -- we don't know how much of that app caused issues for police officers.FREEMAN: But that Apple statement is kind of consistent with the Chinese line, which is that this is essentially a criminal outlaw movement in Hong Kong.I have to say, on the trade stuff, this is a big give if we're saying we're going to sell U.S. technology to Huawei again. So I think this is certainly a moment for Xi Jinping, if he wants a deal, to say, OK, I'll tell my sham legislature to go ahead and put in a new intellectual property law.BARTIROMO: Yes.VERONICA DAGHER, WEALTH MANAGEMENT REPORTER, "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL": Companies -- I was going to say, companies are doing this calculus, right, because they want to get into this major market of China and expand there, yet at what cost, right? If it's going to cost free speech to their employees here and abroad --BARTIROMO: Yes.DAGHER: They need to weigh those risks, right? And you also really risk alienating the American consumer. I mean we're seeing some of that with the NBA.BARTIROMO: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo yesterday said that companies are slowly but surely getting it. But, I'll tell you, I've been saying this now for months, U.S. companies have been far too interested in getting their products in front of 1.4 billion people than they have been about protecting their products and about some of the issues and behavior of China.Now, I think "South Park" is responding to this in such a clever way. In typical "South Park" fashion.Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm never working for a company that's regulated by a communist government.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK, OK. No more selling to the Chinese.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Then say it. Say (EXPLETIVE DELETED) the Chinese government.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (EXPLETIVE DELETED) the Chinese government.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I didn't hear you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (EXPLETIVE DELETED) the Chinese government. There!UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, you just got your partner back.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: I actually watched it last night and, you know, they come up with really clever ways to make their point. Actually, he, last night, murdered Winnie the Pooh. I mean it's like -- because Winnie the Pooh is obviously the character who they say looks like Xi Jinping. And China is very upset about it.But, I mean, it's a cartoon. But they've actually been really clever in terms of making their point. Have -- have you seen any of it?MCDOWELL: I have seen --BARTIROMO: I watched it last night. It was hilarious.MCDOWELL: Not every episode of "South Park" in its entire history, including the birth of "South Park" in the -- the original -- the original cartoon that went viral during the dawn of the Internet, it -- they -- they're doing a brilliant job of pushing back.BARTIROMO: They really are.MCDOWELL: And it really shines a light on all of the other parties, whether it's corporations or sports players who won't stand up and speak out for what they know -- what -- what are our values.BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: And, again, give it to -- not -- I'm not I'm going to say Hollywood. Give it to Matt Stone and Trey Parker for being all over this.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: And all over every other hot button issues, because there's some episodes you're like --BARTIROMO: Yes, that's right.MCDOWELL: Other topics where you're like, oh, I don't know. Can't show that to my mother.DAGHER: I know. Yes.BARTIROMO: Last night they were pushing back at Hollywood, actually. They were basically saying, you know, about getting movies into China and that's all you're interested in, in terms of getting the money and the eyeballs in China. Last night's episode was really funny and they were basically pushing back against Hollywood. It was really funny.All right, we want to turn to impeachment.New Fox News polls shows 51 percent of those asked say President Trump should be impeached and removed from office. That is up from 42 percent in July. But, again, here you've got the public in these polls saying one thing, but then when you actually look at the facts an what's going on in terms of the Democrats' process to impeach him, we've got a whole nother, really, in my view, way to look at this because it's been ridiculous the way Pelosi and company have been trying to take this man out of office behind closed doors.MCDOWELL: I will -- just a couple of points of news and James can jump all over it.So President Trump did seem to open the door to cooperate with the House impeachment probe when he was asked if he would participate in proceedings if the House voted and followed the same rules when Congress previously charged presidents with impeachment. Again, it was the same rules or approach under Nixon and Presidents Clinton -- President Clinton. He was asked if he would cooperate. He said if -- yes, if the rules are fair, if Republicans get a fair shake.Joe Biden, on the campaign trail yesterday, he was, I think, the tenth of the Democratic presidential candidates came out and said that he's now in favor of impeachment and his speech was largely about, rather than plans for the American people, was largely attacking President Trump. Good luck prosecuting that on the campaign trail given the fact that his son was involved with the Ukrainian energy company. You can throw in China with that. He kind of skirted that yesterday. It'll be interesting to see how he wages this fight in the days ahead.BARTIROMO: Hunter Biden was getting, what, $50,000 a month --MCDOWELL: At least.BARTIROMO: From the Ukraine company.FREEMAN: From the Ukraine deal, yes.BARTIROMO: Yes.FREEMAN: But, you know, the China one, it's hard to say. I mean potentially could be more given typical management fees on a -- on a large fund of that nature.But -- but I think that the polling question is, now that the president has sort of called the House's bluff, said, OK, we'll cooperate, but you've got to have a vote, like there has always been. You've got to have both parties able to participate in a -- in the fact-finding, in the investigation. You've got to have more sunlight on this process. So I think it's going to be interesting to see where those polls go if we now have an open process, not a closed process, not a secretive process where Adam Schiff gets information, doesn't share it with colleagues. He's the House member who's running the impeachment inquiry. There's been a pattern here where he -- he keeps information to himself, misleads people about -- about the whistleblower and his communications. So now if this becomes an open investigation in the sunlight, it will be interesting to see what the polls do.MCDOWELL: Because -- because sunlight is the best disinfectant. Who said that, Brad Dice (ph).FREEMAN: I would think. It's a -- I mean guess you can say dangers for both side, obviously. This is high-stakes, kind of the final showdown between Trump and the --BARTIROMO: But that's the way it should be for duly elected presidents.FREEMAN: Yes.MCDOWELL: If they're -- if they're going to -- if this -- because right now it's not impeachment.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's an impeachment show.MCDOWELL: Nancy Pelosi is -- right, she's doing it by fiat and by decree.One thing I'll point out, not the Fox News poll but "The Wall Street Journal" poll yesterday, that in the -- in that survey, the poll, 43 percent of Americans approved of the president's overall job performance, which is right in line with the trend over the -- his time in office. And what was notable is that the story has not -- the impeachment story has not really reset the way that people feel about how he's doing. I think that the -- we'll talk about it, but the issue with Turkey and the Kurds, that could hurt him more.BARTIROMO: Yes, there's a lot of debate about that. That's for sure.All right, we're just getting started this morning.Also on deck, former speaker of the House, Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich is joining us this morning, talking about the latest on impeachment. The CEO of Waze, Noam Bardin is here on the company marking one year since its carpool service debut and Google partnership. Plus, "The Gartman Letter" editor and publisher Dennis Gartman on markets in China. Former senior adviser to President George W. Bush, Fox News contributor, Karl Rove joining us this morning on the latest on impeachment and his "Wall Street Journal" op-ed this morning. Plus the CEO of Sonder, Francis Davidson, talking about short-term rentals and the hotel industry.All that coming up this morning.But, first, let's take a short break.When we come back, the Boeing emergency. Southwest grounding two planes due to cracks. Details when we come right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.The Turkish military advancing into northern Syria.Cheryl Casone with headlines now.Chery.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Maria, Turkey say that its ground troops are advancing against Kurdish fighter in the area. The invasion began yesterday after American troops pulled back from that same area, paving the way for Turkey's attacks on Kurd forces who have long been allied with the U.S. forces there. Russia now says it plans to push for dialogue between the Syrians and Turkish governments.Back here at home, Southwest Airlines has grounded two of its Boeing 737 planes due to a crack in the pickle fork, which is that critical piece of equipment that attaches the plane's fuselage to the wing. It's under the wing. The problem discovered as an FAA ordered inspection found 36 Boeing 737s had the cracked wing supports. That's about 5 percent of the 686 planes that were inspected.Boeing issued a statement. They say, we are actively working with our customers with inspection findings to procure parts, develop repair and replace planes.And now to the baseball playoffs. The Washington Nationals stunned the LA Dodgers, winning the National League division series.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is deep to center field. Bellinger's back (ph). It's a grand slam. Howie Kendrick.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Yes, a grand slam. The dramatic moment actually happened in the tenth inning. The Nationals face the Cardinals in the championship series. That starts tomorrow. St. Louis clobbered the Atlanta Braves 13-1.Tonight, on Fox Sports One, game five of the ALDS between the Houston Astros and the Tampa Bay Rays is going to be all on TV. The winner's going to face the New York Yankees in the next round. Baseball playoffs is getting fun.BARTIROMO: Hey, really exciting.CASONE: Yes.BARTIROMO: Anybody catch that?MCDOWELL: I did not stay up late enough to finish watching it.FREEMAN: Yes, I've been resolving to go to bed earlier when I'm doing this show.BARTIROMO: Oh, good.DAGHER: Yes.FREEMAN: Yes, I'm making progress.DAGHER: Right. I'm focused on the Yankees because of my husband and they're doing pretty well. So things are getting exciting for the Yanks.MCDOWELL: Well, I enjoy it though because, again, it -- it clear the political anger and angst on Twitter.BARTIROMO: Yes.DAGHER: Right.MCDOWELL: And on social media just for a fleeting moment where everybody, you find out who they're rooting for. I know some Braves fans were deeply, deeply disturbed yesterday. I it was 13-1 loss last night. So --BARTIROMO: All right, we'll take a break.When we come back, markets are lower this morning ahead of China's trade talks today.Plus, Bed, Bath and Beyond targets a new CEO. How the stock reacts to the news, when we come back.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Markets are higher now. Take a look. A pretty good reversal underway. Dow Industrials have been negative when we started the show. Now we're higher, but just by a fraction. Investors are waiting on these U.S.-China trade talks. High level negotiations between the two sides taking place in Washington today.Joining us right now is Mainstay Capital Management's CEO and chief investment strategist, David Kudla.David, it's always a pleasure. Thanks for joining us.DAVID KUDLA, CEO, MAINSTAY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Good morning, Maria.BARTIROMO: How closely are you watching this to see what comes out for this for a trade deal or are you even expecting a deal from the two nations in terms of your direction in allocating capital?KUDLA: Over the past 24 hours it seems as though you almost have to watch it minute by minute if you're trying to determine how the trade talks, the 13th round of trade talks that are happening today, although the deputy ministers have already been meeting and talking ahead of trade talks today about what some of the background issues are going to be discussed. And we've already had some news about that.But it is important to the markets, it's important to our investment strategy, if you look at what the Fed -- it's one of the reasons they sighted for the two Fed rate cuts that they've already made. It's about slowing global growth. It's about muted inflation. The other is about trade uncertainty.If you look at what -- one of the round of tariffs that's coming later this year in December, it was delayed from September 1st to December 15th and it's 155 billion on consumer goods that was delayed on purpose for that reason. And, you know, one thing that has been a positive for this economy is the consumer. Two-thirds of our economy is based on consumption. And when these tariffs start to directly impact the consumer, that has more of an impact on our economy.So, you know, what is happening in these trade talks, it's important to what the Fed is doing, it's important to what our economy is doing and certainly it has to be important for anyone out there managing money to pay close attention to in how they're developing their investment strategy going forward.DAGHER: David, it's Veronica from "The Wall Street Journal."KUDLA: Hi.DAGHER: What kind of trade deal would we need to see to see a pickup in business investment spending?KUDLA: Well, the thing that has been critical for business -- for businesses going forward in -- and, you know, markets hate uncertainty and really business owners hate uncertainty, they've been unable to plan, not knowing what trade policy or what the picture looks like, it's been very difficult. There -- obviously there are companies out there who have built their entire business model around the kind of trade that's been available to them, in the way that it's been more unrestricted in years past, and that's been changing very much over the last year and a half. And they don't know how much more it's going to change. So it's a matter of where they source their -- how they -- how they source materials coming in that they're using in their manufacturing operations, they're using for input into their products and where they export.So that uncertainty is impacting business spending. Another thing that the Fed is looking at and is impacting our economy is on the manufacturing side, export side and for business spending and uncertainty. So that becomes very important as well.FREEMAN: David, hi, James Freeman here.KUDLA: Hi, James.FREEMAN: I'm wondering, obviously we've looked at the recent history here and I think the markets are going to -- are likely to rally on any kind of deal where tariffs comes down. Peace reins again. But I'm wondering, on the intellectual property piece, if the president gets some kind of commitment there, do you think that boosts IP based companies, software, semiconductors, et cetera, or is it going to be kind of a wait and see and we'll see if they actually mean it?KUDLA: Well, and I -- I don't know that I completely answered Veronica's question. I think it -- what they're -- the -- for Veronica's question, the deal -- if they got a deal that suspended the tariffs that were yet to come on October 15th and December 15th, that would obviously be a benefit to the markets and for businesses planning ahead. You know, what's off the table right now is the important issues to the U.S., intellectual property, subsidies for Chinese industry, the -- some of these -- these broader or more important issues from a security standpoint that the U.S. is concerned about. The Chinese wanting to -- China wanting to narrow this down to a much more muted or much smaller package for now, which would be beneficial for business spending for the markets. Even if that deal got signed, that would be a step forward. So that --BARTIROMO: Isn't that a victory for China, though? I mean isn't -- isn't that a victory for China, though, David? I mean, you know, the -- this administration has spent a lot of time explaining the issues, from intellectual property theft, to even fentanyl coming into the country. If he just gives on those things, because that's exactly what China does, doesn't it look like a loss for this administration?I don't know how the markets would react to that midterm.KUDLA: Yes. And, Maria --BARTIROMO: I mean I know that maybe that would be a positive over the short-term. Maybe it causes a knee-jerk rally. But I think soon into it markets would -- would realize that the U.S. didn't get a very good deal.KUDLA: Yes. And, Maria, as you -- as you said -- very well said and accurately said earlier this week, some of which they're agreeing to buy --BARTIROMO: Yes.KUDLA: Are things that they desperately need anyway, right?BARTIROMO: Right.KUDLA: These agricultural products are things that they desperately need anyway.BARTIROMO: Yes.KUDLA: So it's really just fulfilling a need for their country. It's --BARTIROMO: Yes, like pork, given the swine flu that they've got there, they need pork, they need soybean.KUDLA: Right.BARTIROMO: Real quick, David, before you go. The Fed released the minutes from September meeting yesterday. The Central Bank, obviously, approved that quarter point rate cut. Anything you want to say in terms of how you're allocating capital right now in the face of all of this?KUDLA: Yes, well -- so we're still constructive on the markets. We have increased our hedges we have in place, like rets (ph), gold, long duration bonds, those all benefiting from the Fed cutting rates. We had the cut in July.BARTIROMO: All right.KUDLA: And the cut in September. And we expect another one in October.BARTIROMO: David, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much.KUDLA: Thank you.BARTIROMO: David Kudla joining us.Coming up, Apple is under pressure. The company banning an app again that tracks Hong Kong police. Americans are supporting the protestors. They're feeling the heat at home.Then, early winter. Parts of the U.S. bracing for a massive storm. It could drop up to two feet of snow. The full forecast coming your way after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, October 10th.Your top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast.U.S.-China trade is in focus this morning. Investors are waiting to see any details out of the high-level talks getting underway this morning in Washington. The U.S. could be easing some restriction on Huawei. We've got those details.But there was a lot of volatility in markets overnight after a report said that the Chinese delegation would be leaving today. Now the futures are hovering near the flat line. Take a look, Dow futures down 17, S&P and the Nasdaq flat.This after gains yesterday on hopes of at least a partial trade deal. Yesterday at 4:00 the market was up big. Dow Industrials up 182 points, three quarters of one percent. The S&P was up 26 and the Nasdaq was up 80 points, better than 1 percent.Global markets this morning look like this. European indices fractionally moving. FT 100 down 2 points. The CAC quarante up 21 and the DAX index up 10 and a half.In Asia overnight, markets were mostly higher with South Korea's Kospi bucking the trend, down after being closed for the holiday yesterday and the day before. As you see, it really was a fractional move.China is continuing a full court press on the NBA. An exhibition game still scheduled to tip off in about an hour in Shanghai, but it will not be seen on TV in mainland China. Other related events have been canceled and businesses are continuing to cut ties with the league. This as fans at games in America are also being silenced for expressing support of Hong Kong protesters."South Park," the show, takes another swipe at China after being taken off the air there. The very latest on the growing controversy this morning.Plus this, Bed, Bath and Beyond targets change. The stock soaring this morning after announcing a new CEO. Bed, Bath and Beyond shares up 22 percent right now.Then this, wild weather coming. A massive snow storm hitting the northeast, northern plains, and it is only October.All those stories coming up this Thursday morning.But, first, our top story this half an hour.U.S.-China trade. The two sides holding high level negotiations this morning ahead of increased U.S. tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods set to go into effect on October 15th. President Trump weighing in on a trade deal yesterday at the White House.Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So I think they feel that I'm driving a tough bargain. But I have to.And I told that to President Xi. I said, you know, this can't be like a 50/50 deal.This has to be a better deal from our standpoint. And I think they fully understand it.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is the Heritage Foundation policy analyst on Asia economy and technology, Riley Walters.Riley, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.RILEY WALTERS, ASIA POLICY ANALYST, HERITAGE FOUNDATION: Yes, thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: What would be a victory for the U.S., in your view, for a deal with China?WALTERS: Well, I think certainly making sure that any deal that they have is enforceable with China, making sure that China actually lives up to the deal and that it's enforceable over not just a six-month period, but, you know, for the long-term.I think another issue would be, of course, the agricultural purchases. I think the administration has put a lot of influence on this. But, of course, a lot of the other demands around joint venture requirements and technology transfer as well.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, obviously American companies want the access, they want that market access into the Chinese economy. And that's why we're seeing some backlash and some American companies rolling over. So Apple is facing criticism this morning after it removed an app that Hong Kong protestors had been use to track police. Chinese state media critical of the tool. Apple issued a statement saying this, the app displays police locations and we have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement. The app violates our guidelines and local laws.They are explaining why they are removing that app. What's your take on Apple and all these other companies that seem to be caving in to Chinese demands?WALTERS: I think in the case of Apple, I think if we take Hong Kong out of the picture, I think any app that targets police should be concerning in itself. But, you know, these private companies, like NBA, like Apple, of course, they're allowed to operate however they want, but, of course, there's repercussions for this, right? And so we should be able to criticize them as well for all these ways that they tend to cave in on a lot of these really important issues for American values.BARTIROMO: So are you saying that it was the right move for Apple to remove the app or are you saying -- I'm not sure I understand?WALTERS: I mean, I'm just saying, you know, an app like that -- I'm just trying to say, without -- out of the context of Hong Kong, an app like that, I think, could be potentially contentious, right? So being able to target police at any moment and track them I think could be, you know, it's controversial I think in itself, that idea.BARTIROMO: Yes.WALTERS: But whether they do it or not, I mean that's up to them. I don't really want to say whether they should or shouldn't have.BARTIROMO: Yes.WALTERS: That's their decision to make at the end of the day. But, of course, we should be able to criticize them for doing it as well.BARTIROMO: Well, you know, it's interesting that all of this is happening in the face of all of these protesters as well, because this is a lot of pressure at the very time that the Chinese are trying to show a good face and do a deal with the U.S.Look at the NBA. Some league events in China have been canceled as Americans here in the United States are starting to be censored over pro- Hong Kong views. Fans of the game last night between the Washington Wizard and a Chinese team had their "free Hong Kong" signs confiscated in Washington, D.C. In Philadelphia, a fan was kicked out of a 6ers game for showing support for Hong Kong.Dagen, you mentioned this earlier. And the president weighed in on this controversy yesterday.Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They have to work out their own situation. The NBA is -- they know what they're doing. But I watched the way that like Kerr and Popovich (ph) and some of the others were pandering to China, and yet to our own country they don't -- it's like they don't respect it. It's like they don't respect it. I said, what a difference. Isn't it sad. It's very sad. To me, it's very sad.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, and I would point to Google, Dagen. And you know this bothers me, the fact that Google walked away from a -- from a contract with the Pentagon, that's Project Maven, and then it set up an AI lab in China. And there's something called civil military fusion in China. There's no separation between the commercial and the military. So if you have an AI, you have any technology, it's going to be used, if it can, in the military first, because that's the goal, become the number one military super power.MCDOWELL: With the NBA, what's interesting, and there were some -- there was a Wizards game with the Guangzhou team, and there were some signs that were removed from the -- some of the attendees.BARTIROMO: Yes, I know.MCDOWELL: And the -- and the arena falls back on saying that, well, that's our policy, that you can't have signs or banners in the arena.BARTIROMO: There's the sign right there.MCDOWELL: They're -- yes. They're were -- I don't think any -- the Wizard's game, no one was kicked out.With the issue of the NBA, the NBA has marketed itself as being completely in touch with social justice issues here in the United States.FREEMAN: Yes.MCDOWELL: And with Steve Kerr, you know, he's vocal, but then when asked about China is like, I don't know, hamina (ph), hamina, hamina, I don't know what to say. That's one of the biggest problems with the NBA. And this has kind of smacked him in the face that they were not expecting this to happen.They had the upper hand in China in the way because they're the most powerful sports league there. And they're about as many amateur basketball players in China as there are people in the United States. It's roughly 300 million people in China.But this is an issue of, what do you stand for?BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: And I guaranty you that the NBA management and the leadership there, if a player had spoken out, they would not have said anything and they would have been quick to standby that player and say, we -- they're expressing American values, we're not going to silence them. But the fact that it gave them a little bit of wiggle room to go after this one tweet by Morey of the Rockets.BARTIROMO: Yes.James, did you want to say something?FREEMAN: Yes.The NBA coaches, Steve Kerr and Greg Popovich, have been revealed as blowhards and phonies through this --MCDOWELL: La, la, la when they have to act -- actually answer a tough question.FREEMAN: Yes. But our college, Holman Jenkins, writes this week that, don't forget, there are a lot of people in China who would like the freedoms that have been enjoyed in Hong Kong. So if you're -- you're kowtowing to the thugs in Beijing who run the place but were never elected, a lot of these NBA customers might necessarily like it that you're not speaking up for Hong Kong.BARTIROMO: Yes. This is -- this is a debate about values, Riley, and that's why it's -- I don't know, when you have such different values, democracy, freedoms, versus this communist rule, can these two nations do a deal and respect each other's way of lives?WALTERS: I think there is a way to manage the relationship between the United States and China. You know, I don't think we should really expect China to become our, you know, our most free and greatest trading partner overnight. That's why I don't put a lot of emphasis on a deal getting done anytime soon.BARTIROMO: OK.WALTERS: But I think the United States, unilaterally, we should -- we should do more to manage the relationship that we have with China. We should stand up for intellectual property rights whether there's a deal or not, just like we should stand up for human rights issues whether there's a deal or not.BARTIROMO: Well, that's --WALTERS: At the end of the day there's --BARTIROMO: Then there's no deal because the human rights abuses are wide and deep in China and the intellectual property theft, same thing. So, I don't know -- then there's no deal.FREEMAN: Well, I think it's -- it's kind of strange, though. If -- if -- we've just put a bunch of Chinese companies on a ban list to use U.S. technology for their help in suppressing the Uyghurs over there, at the same time if it's true that we're giving on Huawei, Riley, I'm kind of wondering what the -- what the message is there.WALTERS: Well, I think -- let me, you know, parse some things out here.BARTIROMO: Real quick.WALTERS: Huawei was never a blanket ban, right? It was -- it was -- it was -- just like on the entity list, it does get reviewed through Commerce. So it's not a ban in itself.We've had instances like these in the past where issues like Huawei have happened around trade talks.BARTIROMO: Right.WALTERS: So it seems like it sours the immediate talks.But, in the long-term, we always come back to the negotiating table. And so I think maybe this week we're going to have some tough negotiations. But, you know, in a month or in two months, I think we could come back to the table and work something out.BARTIROMO: All right, we'll see.Riley, good to talk with you. Thanks so much.WALTERS: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Riley Walters joining us there.Meanwhile, a winter storm could dump up to two feet of snow on parts of the country.Cheryl Casone on it right now in headlines.Cheryl.CASONE: Forget that winter is coming. Winter is here, Maria. And this one could be for the history books for this time of year anyway. Winter storm warnings stretching from Wyoming and Montana through western Nebraska and into the Dakotas right now. This is the second time in two weeks a storm is poised to drop double-digit snowfall. Forecasters say that blizzard conditions are actually likely there.Well, millions of northern and central Californians are waiting for PG&E to restore their power after the utility intentionally blacked out homes and businesses. PG&E pulling the plug to prevent a wind-blown power line from sparking wildfires. The utility says power lines must be inspected and declared safe before the lights come back on.Tesla issued an in-car alert, warning owners to charge their vehicles fully ahead of that outage planned by PG&E.Finally there is this. Bed, Bath and Beyond turned to the competition for a new president and CEO. Mark Tritton, Target's former chief merchandising officer, starts his new job on November 4th. His first assignment, make shopping easier for customers, both online and in the stores. And investors like this news. Shares of Bed, Bath and Beyond soaring yesterday. That rally continuing in the pre-market. Look at that, up 22 percent, Maria. They're loving this.BARTIROMO: Yes. You've got to love that. He's got to save ticker tape.CASONE: Yes.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Cheryl.Coming up, America's opioid crisis. A new Fox Nation documentary focuses on the growing problem. We're taking a look at that when we come back.And then a real good boy. How this dog became a true hero to a veteran.All that on the other side of this break. Stay with usBARTIROMO: Welcome back.Headlines across America this morning."The Seattle Times" reports flavored vape products temporarily banned by Washington's state board of health to chants of shame. Despite plenty of opposition, the 120-day emergency ban takes effect today. It is sure to be a key issue for the 2020 legislative agenda and session of state law to raise the age to purchase tobacco and vaping products to 21 starts in January."The San Diego Tribune," this morning, writes, California bans hotels from using tiny plastic bottles. The law takes effect in 2023. Violators could see a $500 fine for a first offense and a $2,000 fine after that. Hotel giant Marriott International plans to stop using the tiny bottles by next December.And "The State" says, good boy! Dog saves South Carolina veteran during house fire. Curly, the dog, is a hero, nudging and pushing his beloved owner until he woke up. The two then ran to safety.DAGHER: Awe.BARTIROMO: Awe. Love that. Love that.DAGHER: Doggie.BARTIROMO: Good boy.All right, coming up, America's opioid crisis. A new Fox Nation documentary is focusing on the growing crisis. We're taking a look at that when we come back.And then this. Uber Pets. The new service allows you to bring furry friend on board.Back in a minute.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How exactly did all of these people become addicted? And was it their fault? We're about to find out.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There were many different lies that Perdue Pharma told in order to turn OxyContin into the multibillion dollar product that it would become.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: That was a clip from the new Fox Nation documentary series, "America's Opioid Conspiracy: Pills, Payoffs and Pain." It explores the drug crisis plaguing this country.Joining us right now is the host of the documentary, Fox News medical contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier.Dr. Nicole, good to see you this morning.DR. NICOLE SAPHIER, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you very much for having me here.BARTIROMO: Yes, tell us about the special.SAPHIER: You know, this is really great because, of course, we've been talking about the opioid crisis now for a couple of years. And what this opportunity the documentary gave us to do is to really hone in on, you know, some specific facets of how it became what it is.You know, everyone talks about it in this generalized grand sense, and I really wanted to kind of go into the nitty gritty of the nefarious dealings that Perdue Pharmaceuticals and other people had in this. And what I found really interesting was, so we actually interviewed a whistleblower from Perdue Pharmaceuticals, a prior pharmaceutical marketing rep.FREEMAN: A real whistleblower.SAPHIER: A real whistleblower. And it was just really interesting to hear the memos that were being back and forth between, you know, how to push some of these marketing strategies. And it was very upsetting, from a physician's standpoint, because, you know, medical doctors like to think that we're somewhat intelligent. However, we really played into their marketing tactics. We were not smarter than the marketing representatives. And, you know, it's upsetting.And I also got the opportunity to speak to people who have been personally affected by it. A mother who lost not one but two children to overdose, as well as a gentleman who overdosed himself and was on the brink of death in the hospital ICU for a month and who now has dedicated his entire life to getting people not to be addicted.BARTIROMO: I thought it was really interesting that "Sesame Street" got into this as well, breaking boundaries, the children's show, is having one of its characters reveal that her mother is addicted to opioids, to help kids whose parents may be struggling with addiction. Is that what you're talking about in terms of the one -- in the piece?SAPHIER: Yes. So -- no, actually it's a different one.BARTIROMO: OK.SAPHIER: But "Sesame Street" is kind of like "South Park," right, they like to take things out of, you know, what's going on socially and they like to talk about it.BARTIROMO: Very smart.SAPHIER: I have -- I have -- I have some concerns about "Sesame Street "doing this because there's a very fine line of decreasing stigma related to addiction, which we absolutely do need to do, but I also don't want to normalize substance abuse for our children. So "Sesame Street" is very smart the way that they do this and they want to make sure everyone is all inclusive. However, you know, I just want to make sure that children, it's not part of their everyday conversation that, oh, families start dealing with substance abuse and addiction. And even though that is our reality, because addiction is so rampant in the United States, I also would like to maintain some sort of, I don't know, I -- you know, something in my children where I want to have that conversation with them.BARTIROMO: Keep them in the dark until you're ready.SAPHIER: And I don't want to be -- I don't really want them to be learning about this from television without me talking to them about it.MCDOWELL: What about the role of prescribers and doctors in all of this? There was a doctor right near where I grew up that just got 40 years in prison for opioid fraud.SAPHIER: There are some bad players. The far majority of the physicians, when it came to the opioid crisis, were doing everything correctly. They were not -- had no mal intent. Possibly ignorance and under education when it came to this. However, there was not mal intent. However, when money's involved, there are always going to be some bad players. And some physicians, they were getting kickbacks from the pharmaceutical companies, they were getting paid hefty sums to go and speak on these drugs. And, unfortunately, they were -- had faulty evidence, bad data that they believe may have been true but it was really poorly done studies and, you know, I think they should be punished.MCDOWELL: and I've spoken a lot about the overreach now in terms of regulation. The backlash that is actually hurting people who need these drugs. And these drugs were created, say, for cancer pain and it's -- you can get them, but, again, there's a great burden on patients and the family members.SAPHIER: Well --BARTIROMO: Is it right to blame the, like, companies, like the Perdue Pharma, even Johnson and Johnson?SAPHIER: Well, let me tell you, watch the documentary, and you'll see some of their -- I mean there was some very -- there's a very specific intention to push these medications knowing the addiction potential, knowing the abuse potential and knowing risks of death, and they hid that.BARTIROMO: Yes.SAPHIER: So, yes, there -- there was some negligence there.BARTIROMO: That's why we've seen the judgements that we've seen. We will check it out.Dr. Nicole Saphier, thank you.SAPHIER: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We'll be right back. Stay with us.Load-Date: October 10, 2019End of Document

More than 320 Chinese arrested in PhilippinesAssociated Press InternationalSeptember 17, 2019 Tuesday 2:53 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 538 wordsByline: By JIM GOMEZ, Associated PressDateline: MANILA, Philippines BodyMANILA, Philippines (AP) - The Philippine immigration bureau says its agents, backed by troops, have arrested 324 Chinese accused of involvement in illegal online gambling and other crimes in a raid on eight hotels and other establishments in a western province.Immigration Commissioner Jaime Morente said the Chinese were arrested Monday in Puerto Princesa city in Palawan province, "where they were caught in the act of doing their illegal activities."Morente said Tuesday that they would be deported for violating the conditions of their stay in the Philippines and working without authorization.The Philippines, backed by the Chinese government, has launched a crackdown on large numbers of Chinese who mostly entered the country as tourists and then worked for online gambling operations, which are illegal in China."Initial reports indicate that most of these aliens are overstaying and undocumented," Morente said in a statement.The raiding teams seized hundreds of laptops and cellphones from the Chinese, many of whom failed to show passports or other travel documents, immigration officials said.Immigration intelligence official Fortunato Manahan Jr. said the raids were an offshoot of complaints from local officials over the presence of many illegal Chinese workers in Puerto Princesa. Authorities conducted weeks of surveillance before Monday's raids.Palawan is a frontier island province where the military's Western Command conducts naval and air patrols to defend Philippine-claimed areas in the disputed South China Sea. China, the Philippines and four other governments have overlapping territorial claims in the strategic waterways.Philippine defense officials recently expressed concern over the presence of large numbers of Chinese near local military camps.Morente said there would be no letup in the immigration bureau's campaign against the illegal foreign workers "who use the Philippines as a venue for illegal activities, particularly unauthorized online gaming activities, cyber fraud and investment scams that prey on unsuspecting victims who are mostly abroad."Last week, Philippine immigration agents arrested 277 Chinese in a raid on an online investment scam syndicate that defrauded hundreds of people in China.The arrests Wednesday in the Ortigas financial district in Pasig city in the Manila metropolis came after the Chinese Embassy provided information about the fraud, Morente said.Last month, the Chinese Embassy said many Chinese have been illegally recruited to work in the gambling industry in the Philippines, often without work permits. The online gambling operations cater mostly to Chinese in mainland China.The embassy said Chinese money was flowing illegally into the Philippines involving crimes such as money laundering and that many Chinese recruited to work in the online gambling operations were confined, physically abused and had their passports taken.The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. has stopped issuing licenses to offshore gambling operations while contracts and security and legal issues are reviewed. The gambling regulator said the Philippine government collected nearly 12 billion pesos ($235 million) in revenues from the operations from 2016 to last year.Load-Date: September 18, 2019End of Document

Meanwhile, Chinese tech giant Huawei crept up the ranking from 4th to 2nd place this year.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.Apple tumbled in a ranking of China's top brands in 2019.Brand consultancy Prophet surveyed 13,500 Chinese consumers its latest brand relevance index, released Wednesday, and asked which brands are the most indispensable to their lives.The results showed that Chinese consumers are increasingly patriotic when it comes to the brands they choose to use.In this year's ranking, Apple slipped to 24th place after being in 11th in 2018. Meanwhile, Chinese tech giant Huawei crept up the ranking from 4th to 2nd place this year.Huawei has suffered extensively from the US-China trade war.The firm is currently blacklisted from doing business with any US firms, its phones are locked out of the US market, and its latest flagships won't run with Google's services because Google is an American company. The US is also pressuring its allies to lock Huawei out of their 5G phone networks because of fears the firm spies on behalf of the Chinese government, a charge it denies. Huawei blasted the US government earlier this month, accusing it of "trying to disrupt Huawei's operations with every tool at its disposal."Read more: Apple already has a China problem. Here's why it could get worse.Apple is also likely to suffer from the trade war. Products like the iPhone, AirPods and the Apple Watch will become more expensive thanks to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports. The bulk of these products are manufactured in China.'Chinese consumers interpreted what happened to Huawei as an attack'Jay Milliken, a senior partner in Hong Kong at Prophet, told Bloomberg that Chinese consumers are becoming more "nationalistic" in their shopping habits and in the brands that they use."There's a lot of nationalistic buying in that category because Chinese consumers interpreted what happened to Huawei as an attack," he told Bloomberg.The ongoing US-China trade war and Trump's ban on Huawei is encouraging these consumers to opt for alternatives to US-made products. And some experts say that this wave of nationalism will stretch way beyond the trade war."It's not temporary," Melissa Guzy, a managing partner at Arbor Ventures, recently told Business Insider's Troy Wolverton. "It's a long-term shift that's happening." She continued: "I think most Chinese don't believe they need the US for anything."NOW WATCH: 7 lesser-known benefits of Amazon PrimeSee Also:• A UN study suggested it's sexist for voice assistants like Siri or Alexa to have female voices - but Google says it wanted to use a male voice from the very beginning• Apple discontinued last year's Apple Watch Series 4 after announcing its brand-new watch - here's how to decide between the Series 3 and Series 5• Apple lashed out at the EU in a fierce court battle, saying its $14 billion tax order 'defies reality and common sense'SEE ALSO: Huawei reportedly knew it was over-reliant on Google's Android before the US-China trade war and considered alternatives like SailfishLoad-Date: September 19, 2019End of Document

China tempers hopes about US tariff truceAssociated Press InternationalOctober 15, 2019 Tuesday 10:23 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 1108 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - A truce in a U.S.-Chinese tariff war and Beijing's promises to open more of its state-dominated economy are raising investor hopes. But Beijing is trying to temper expectations, while companies express frustration over the halting pace of market-opening.The China Daily, an English-language newspaper aimed at foreign readers, warned Tuesday the two sides have yet to put last week's agreement on paper after President Donald Trump suspended a planned tariff hike. In exchange, Trump said Beijing would buy up to $50 billion of American farm goods, a pledge China has yet to confirm."There is always the possibility that Washington may decide to cancel the deal if it thinks that doing so will better serve its interests," said the newspaper. It called on the Trump administration to "avoid backpedaling."Business groups welcomed the truce as a possible step toward ending the costly, 15-month-old fight but said it was a small one. Talks broke down earlier after Trump accused Beijing of backsliding on promises Washington believed were locked in.On Tuesday, a foreign ministry spokesman said Chinese importers have bought 20 million tons of soybeans and 700,000 tons of pork this year from the United States. He gave no details on when that happened.China's imports of U.S. soybeans fell by about half last year to 16.6 million tons from 2017's 33 million tons."China will further speed up procurement of U.S. agricultural products," said the spokesman, Geng Shuang.Friday's agreement coincided with China's announcement of a timetable to carry out a 2017 promise to abolish limits on foreign ownership of some finance businesses, starting with futures trading firms on Jan. 1. Securities firms and mutual fund managers follow later in the year.Investors saw that as a commitment to freer trade. Chinese officials say it has nothing to do with the trade talks and isn't a concession to Washington.Over the past 18 months, President Xi Jinping's government also has promised to allow full foreign ownership in banking, insurance and auto manufacturing in hopes of making its slowing economy more competitive and productive.None addresses U.S. complaints that plans for government-led creation of Chinese competitors in robotics and other industries violate Beijing's market-opening commitments and are based on stealing or pressuring companies to hand over technology.Chinese market-opening initiatives follow a standard script. Authorities announce dramatic but vague promises that raise hopes abroad. Six months to a year passes while companies wait to see regulations. Many are dismayed when they impose costly licensing requirements or curbs on the size of a business.Foreign companies are frustrated Beijing is moving so gradually 17 years after joining the free-trading World Trade Organization. China, the biggest global exporter, is widely seen as having benefited most from freer trade but faces complaints it violates the rules and spirit of the WTO by blocking access to its own markets and subsidizing Chinese competitors."China's opening-up process needs to move beyond piecemeal changes and instead embrace an absolute approach in which China goes from 'increasingly open' to 'open'," said Joerg Wuttke, the president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China.Chinese leaders want foreign capital, skills and competition for an economy where huge but inefficient state companies still control industries including oil and gas, telecoms, banking, insurance and power generation.Beijing wants more foreign involvement to help improve China's finance industry, said Lester Ross, a lawyer in Beijing for the firm WilmerHale."There is a lot of attractiveness" for foreign banks, insurers and other competitors in China's fledgling market, he said.Opening its own markets also gives Beijing leverage to ask the United States and other governments to let wholly Chinese-owned banks, insurance and other companies into their markets, Ross said.Beijing allowed full foreign ownership of electric car producers starting last year. Restrictions on commercial vehicle manufacturing end next year and for passenger vehicles in 2022.That reflects confidence Chinese electric car brands including BYD Auto and BAIC, which are among the global industry's biggest producers by vehicles sold, can compete with foreign rivals.Global automakers that until now were required to work through state-owned partners are so deeply enmeshed in those ventures that most plan to stick with them. Buying out partners could cost billions of dollars and the foreigners would lose their political connections."China is accelerating the pace of opening, but we still need to see those implementing regulations in place and how fast those are carried out," said Ross.Foreign banks are applying to set up shop in China following an August 2018 pledge to allow full foreign ownership. But they need an eye-wateringly high minimum capital of 40 billion yuan ($5.7 billion) to operate in China or 8 billion yuan ($1.1 billion) to conduct cross-border services.That is beyond the reach of all but the richest foreign institutions.A handful of American, European and Japanese banks have been given approval to set up Chinese ventures. It is unclear whether they met the capital requirement or whether regulators eased that as a concession to Washington and other trading partners.In insurance, foreign investors face a time-consuming licensing process that requires them to apply in one of China's 36 provinces and major cities at a time and wait up to a year for approvals. Obtaining approval for the biggest provinces could take up to a decade."China's efforts to boost investor confidence face significant headwinds," said Andrew Coflan and Allison Sherlock of Eurasia Group in a report.Another hurdle: government controls on the movement of money into and out of China. That adds to the cost and difficulty of bringing in capital and taking home profits.Such obstacles "make entrance by foreign financial firms a challenge, even with no ownership caps," said Coflan and Sherlock.Also Tuesday, the Chinese post office said fees it pays the United States and other countries to deliver packages will nearly triple through 2025 under an agreement following complaints by Washington.Payments will rise 27% next year and by 164% in total through 2025 under the Sept. 25 agreement by members of the Universal Postal Union, the State Postal Bureau said in a statement.The Trump administration complained the U.S. Post Office was subsidizing Chinese exporters, which it said pay too little to deliver the vast flow of packages generated by online commerce.Load-Date: October 16, 2019End of Document

Amid rift with China, will the NBA be forced to apologize?Associated Press Financial WireOctober 9, 2019 Wednesday 8:26 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 848 wordsByline: By TIM REYNOLDS, AP Basketball WriterBodyWhen major corporations have done something to anger Chinese authorities in recent years, the playbook has called for one thing: an apology.Marriott issued one. So did Delta. Mercedes-Benz, too.The NBA, embroiled in a rift caused by a tweet expressing support for pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong, has avoided going that route - for now. But with billions at stake from things like merchandise sales and media rights, some experts are wondering if anything other than an apology from NBA Commissioner Adam Silver will mend this fence, especially with the Chinese indicating that is what they want."I think that Commissioner Silver might have to do what everyone in our country doesn't want him to have to do," said Windy Dees, a sports marketing expert at the University of Miami. "He may have to say, 'I understand that your government, your political system, your culture, your ideologies are different than ours and we shouldn't push our beliefs on you.'""And that's exactly what Americans and NBA fans don't want to see their commissioner say," Dees added.Silver has chosen his words carefully to this point, defending the right of Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey - who sent the tweet, now deleted yet still causing major problems - to freedom of expression.Silver also said the league is apologetic over the disharmony caused by Morey's tweet but stopped well short of apologizing for the tweet itself.Morey attempted to clarify his position in subsequent tweets, which some, including Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai, the Taiwanese-Canadian co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, considered an apology.But the only true apology so far came from Rockets star James Harden, the 2017-18 NBA MVP who tried to fix things by insisting, "We love China."Clearly, that wasn't enough."The hurt that this incident has caused will take a long time to repair," Tsai said in an open letter to fans in which he tried to shed light on the Chinese perspective when it comes to Hong Kong.The question is, how long?Dean Crutchfield, CEO of the crisis management firm Crutchfield + Partners, said Morey's tweet, well-intentioned as it was, could cost the NBA billions. He wondered if a parting of the ways between Morey and the Rockets would appease China."You need to fire him and you need to fire him fast," Crutchfield said. "China needs a statement, and for him to still be in his job is remarkable. I think Silver did a remarkable job with his statement, but this is a senior official, well aware of the importance of the Chinese market. One man, one tweet."LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers are scheduled to play Tsai's Nets on Thursday in Shanghai, then again Saturday in Shenzhen. For now, those games are expected to be played.But China state broadcaster CCTV is not going to air the games as previously planned and said it is examining other aspects of its relationship with the NBA.Tencent, the Chinese conglomerate that has a $1.5 billion streaming deal spanning the next five seasons with the league, has said it will not show Rockets games and pulled some planned preseason coverage from NBA arenas. And Chinese companies like apparel giant Li-Ning and Vivo, a smartphone maker that was going to be a sponsor of the Lakers-Nets games, have suspended their business dealings with the NBA."If you have CCTV and Tencent saying, 'We're not airing the NBA,' that is a huge red flag," Dees said. "It's almost like a Chinese lockout. If China does not broadcast games, this is a major financial problem for the NBA. And I'm thinking this is going to go on for a while. This is not getting resolved right away. The one thing that you don't mess with is Chinese government, and unfortunately not everyone in the U.S. understands the global power that China is."In the meantime, Silver is "upholding the values of the two countries where the NBA is based," the U.S. and Canada, said Heather Dichter, a professor of sport management and sport history at De Montfort University in Leicester, England."If he had gone the other way, that to me becomes more damaging for the league financially," she said. "China puts in money, but they're not the core of your business. The teams can survive without their money. They can't survive if they have no ticketholders."The NBA's ties to China go back at least 30 years, from when then-Commissioner David Stern opened a fledgling office in Hong Kong with a bare-bones staff and struck a deal to show games to Chinese viewers on a tape-delay basis.The game's popularity in China has soared since. Many top NBA players visit every summer to promote footwear and apparel, usually greeted by huge crowds of adoring fans. The typically cited numbers are that 300 million Chinese play basketball and 500 million watch the NBA.Now those carefully cultivated and highly lucrative ties have been thrown into jeopardy."As to what the NBA should say and do next, I believe it knows better than anyone else," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said.___More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and            https://twitter.com/AP_SportsLoad-Date: October 10, 2019End of Document

CHINA: 70TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA MARKS SOMBER OCCASIONStates News ServiceOctober 1, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 856 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Freedom House:On the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Freedom House issued the following statement:"In recent decades, the people of China have achieved considerable economic progress by virtue of their own hard work and decreased restrictions on their economic activities. However, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) distorts and mars these accomplishments by sparing no means to retain its power," said Michael J. Abramowitz, president of Freedom House. "As CCP officials gather to congratulate themselves, more than one million Uighurs remain in detention camps; Christians, Tibetans, and Falun Gong practitioners are persecuted for their faith; human rights defenders and lawyers, civil society activists, labor leaders, and even ordinary internet users are targeted and arrested for trying to exercise rights guaranteed under China's own constitution and laws; and the Chinese government continues to tighten its grip amid escalating violence in Hong Kong. Rather than trusting the Chinese people to become informed citizens who responsibly exercise their rights, the party-state has, with the help of new technologies, reverted to levels of repression and control that have not been seen since the discredited regime of Mao Zedong."Today, we remember the millions who have died at the hands of CCP rulers and the millions who remain imprisoned amidst ongoing repression. We join the Chinese people in looking forward to the day when all can fully enjoy their inherent rights and freedoms."Background:Since the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, tens of millions have died as a result of CCP policies, including those tortured and killed in detention, murdered in the ideological violence of the Cultural Revolution, and targeted in crackdowns like the Tiananmen Square Massacre. Millions have succumbed to mistreatment and lack of care in prison and labor camps or perished in famine caused by state planning.Repression has worsened since President Xi Jinping rose to power in November 2012. The government of China has redoubled its efforts to exert control at home and expand its influence overseas, establishing an extensive surveillance system in China and conducting sophisticated propaganda and influence operations both at home and abroad.Deaths since June due to abuse in custody include:Meng Hong, an elderly practitioner of Falun Gong, a meditative spiritual practice, jailed in Heilongjiang Women's Prison for handing out flyers.Wang Meiyu, a Chinese activist arrested in July after calling for universal suffrage and the resignation of President Xi; a human rights group has reported that his body showed signs of torture.Nurmuhammad Tohti, a well-known Uighur writer, who died from medical complications following his release from detention in Xinjiang after being denied treatment in custody.Among the many prisoners of conscience in China who remain imprisoned or missing are:Tashpolat Teyip, a Uighur and the former head of Xinjiang University, who vanished in 2017 and was reportedly convicted in secret proceedings. He remains at risk of imminent execution.Ilham Tohti, a Uighur economist and scholar known as a vocal advocate for improving Uighur-Han relations. He is currently serving a life sentence on false charges of separatism.Yao Guofu and Liang Xin, an elderly couple sentenced in 2016 to four years in prison for sharing information about and practicing Falun Gong.Chen Jianfang, a human rights defender well known for her work demanding civil society involvement on human rights issues in China, held incommunicado since March.Wei Zhili and Ke Chengbing, editors of a labor rights news and advocacy website, held incommunicado since March.Gao Zhisheng, a Christian human rights attorney who has been disbarred, detained on numerous occasions, and brutally tortured while imprisoned. He disappeared most recently in 2017 after smuggling his memoir, which detailed his torture, out of China.Wang Quanzhang, a prominent human rights lawyer, sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison in January after being held incommunicado for over three years.Huang Qi, the founder of the human rights website 64 Tianwang, sentenced to 12 years in prison in July.Tsegon Gyal, a Tibetan sentenced in 2018 to three years in prison for a post on WeChat in which he criticized the Chinese government.Lee Meng-chu, a Taiwanese businessperson detained in southern China after sharing images with friends in Taiwan of the prodemocracy protests in Hong Kong.Lee Ming-che, a Taiwanese prodemocracy activist detained by Chinese authorities in March 2017. He was found guilty of subversion of state power and sentenced to five years in prison.China is rated Not Free in Freedom in the World 2019 and Not Free in Freedom on the Net 2018. Freedom House has also tracked the tightening of civic space in recent years in its China Media Bulletin.Freedom House is an independent watchdog organization that supports democratic change, monitors the status of freedom around the world, and advocates for democracy and human rights.Load-Date: October 2, 2019End of Document

Commerce's Blacklist Dampens Optimism Ahead Of US-China Talks' ResumptionThe FrontrunnerOctober 9, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 1168 wordsBodyReuters (10/8, Shalal, Cadell) reports China on Tuesday "sharply rebuked" the Administration "for adding some top Chinese artificial intelligence startups to its trade blacklist, dimming hopes for progress in high-level talks aimed at ending a 15-month trade war." According to Reuters, "A report from the South China Morning Post said China had tamped down expectations ahead of the talks scheduled for Thursday with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, saying the Chinese delegation could leave earlier than planned because 'there's not too much optimism.'" Reuters says "the mood soured this week after the US Commerce Department widened its trade blacklist to include 20 Chinese public security bureaus and eight companies."According to the New York Times (10/8, Mozur, Wong, 18.61M), "The world has largely sat by for nearly two years as China detained more than one million people, mostly Muslims and members of minority ethnic groups, in re-education camps to force them to embrace the Communist Party." The Times adds, "Now, the Trump administration has taken the first public step by a major world government toward punishing Beijing."White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said on Fox Business' Making Money (10/8) that the President's decision to blacklist come Chinese tech firms "is totally unrelated to the trade negotiations. It was an initiative that came out of the Department of Commerce led by Secretary Ross, with the coordination of the State Department and it addresses...what the State Department is called one of the worst human rights abuses that we've seen in the last century. Basically, you have a couple million people in concentration camps so it is separate matter from the trade negotiations."The AP (10/8) reports the Commerce Department "said the listed groups have been implicated in 'China's campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance' against Uighurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim minority groups." Geng Shuang, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, "said the US has no right to interfere in Xinjiang's internal affairs and denied there are human rights issues in the region."Reuters (10/8) reports the Chinese Commerce Ministry "strongly urge[d] the US to remove sanctions on Chinese firms," and vowed to "take any necessary measures to firmly protect its own interests."Stock Losses Blamed On Blacklist Announcement.Reuters (10/8, Valetkevitch) reports that US stocks "ended down sharply and near the day's lows on Tuesday as news that the United States has imposed visa restrictions on Chinese officials overshadowed comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell suggesting openness to further interest rate cuts." Reuters says it was also reported Tuesday that the Trump Administration is "moving ahead with efforts to limit capital flows to China," and that China "had toned down expectations ahead of the talks in Washington." The Dow Jones Industrial Average "fell 313.98 points, or 1.19%, to 26,164.04, the S&P 500 lost 45.73 points, or 1.56%, to 2,893.06 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 132.52 points, or 1.67%, to 7,823.78."US Imposes Visa Restrictions On Chinese Officials Over Treatment Of Uighurs.Reuters (10/8, Beech, Shepardson) reports the State Department announced Tuesday that it has imposed visa restrictions "on Chinese government and Communist Party officials it believes responsible for the detention or abuse" of Uighurs in Xinjiang province. Secretary of State Pompeo "cited the decision of the Commerce Department on Monday to add 28 Chinese public security bureaus and companies...to a US trade blacklist over Beijing's treatment of Uighur Muslims." The visa restrictions "complement" the Commerce Department actions, Pompeo said.NEC Reportedly Mulling Restricting US Investment In Chinese Firms.Bloomberg (10/8, 4.73M) reported the Administration is "moving ahead with discussions around possible restrictions on portfolio flows into China, with a particular focus on investments made by US government retirement funds." Bloomberg says "the efforts are advancing even after American officials pushed back strongly against a Bloomberg News report late last month that a range of such limits was under review." According to Bloomberg, last week, Administration officials "held meetings on the issue just hours after White House adviser Peter Navarro dismissed the report as 'fake news,' and zeroed in on how to prevent U.S. government retirement funds from financing China's economic rise."IMF Warns US Trade War With China Could Cost Global Economy $700B.The New York Times (10/8, Swanson, 18.61M) reports that the new head of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, warned Tuesday that America's trade war with China "could cost the global economy around $700 billion by 2020 - a loss equivalent to the size of Switzerland's entire economy."Chinese TV Cancels Broadcasts Of NBA Preseason Games Over Hong Kong Tweet.ABC World News Tonight (10/8, story 7, 1:35, Muir, 6.89M) said China "is now strong-arming the NBA" after "a tweet from the general manager of the Houston Rockets supporting Hong Kong's pro democracy protesters. China is now refusing to air NBA games." The Washington Post (10/8, Shih, 14.2M) reports Chinese state TV announced Tuesday it "would withhold broadcasts of National Basketball Association games at least this week to punish league commissioner Adam Silver for comments defending Houston Rockets executive Daryl Morey's right to free speech."NBC Nightly News (10/8, story 11, 1:45, Holt, 5.93M) reported, "The NBA is fighting back after being blasted for caving to China's communist government. Commissioner Adam Silver defending Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey, whose now-deleted tweet supporting protests in Hong Kong triggered fury in China." Silver: "We are not apologizing. I am an American, and there are these values that are deeply rooted in the DNA of the NBA, and that includes freedom of expression for our employees." The New York Times (10/8, Deb, 18.61M) reports Silver also "acknowledged that the backlash...might not end anytime soon," and said CCTV's cancellation "was unexpected, and a community outreach event scheduled to take place at a school in Shanghai also had been canceled."Franchisees Of US Companies Targeted By Hong Kong Protesters.The Washington Post (10/8, Mahtani, McLaughlin, 14.2M) reports that "Hong Kong's pro-democracy protesters have turned their anger toward businesses perceived as supportive of Beijing, with even American brands such as" Starbucks and Shake Shack "becoming targets." According to the Post, "It's not the corporations that are in the crosshairs, but rather the local franchisee, Maxim's Group, which is detested for perceptions that it backs China over the pro-democracy protests."

I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, September 10th, your top stories right now, 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.President Trump is doubling down on the China trade fight. He is touting how the tariffs are hurting China's economy, also talking about the need for a fair deal with the United States. The president is getting praise for his handling of China from an unlikely source this morning.Billionaire and Democratic supporter, George Soros, writes an op-ed in the Journal this morning, praising the president's stance on China.Markets this morning, look like this, Futures indicating a decline at the start of trading. We are off of the worst levels of the morning. Nonetheless, Dow is down 22 points, S&P down 5, and the NASDAQ down 24, after modest moves on Wall Street yesterday. The Dow was up for a fourth straight session yesterday, but the S&P and the NASDAQ, well, they finished slightly lower.Global markets this morning look like this, European indices this morning are mixed, ahead of the ECB meeting on Thursday, the FT-100 is up 5, the CAC Quarante is down 3, and the DAX Index in Germany is up 28. We have the European central bank policy decision, on Thursday of this week.In Asia overnight, markets finished like this, mostly higher, with the exception of China. In China, you had lots of economic data. The Producer Price Index for August fell eight-tenths of a percent year-over-year. That was the worst contraction since August of 2016.Meanwhile, the Consumer Price Index in China was above expectations. The price of pork is up 47 percent year-over-year, due to the swine fever outbreak, and the CPI, Consumer Price Index, was up 2.8 percent in China.It's Apple's big day, the technology giant is set to announce new iPhones today. We're going to take you live to Apple Park, get a look at what to expect from Apple this morning. Then, "Jeopardy!" on the go, how you can play the game, Alex Trebek and all, while driving your car.All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning, and joining me to break it all down, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell, commentary writer with the Washington Examiner, Tiana Lowe, and associate editor of Barron's, Jack Hough is here. Great to see everybody this morning.JACK HOUGH, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, BARRON'S: Good to be here.BARTIROMO: Yes, not a lot happening, in terms of macro news, although, the economic data out of China was one, and of course, we got all these central bank meetings happening. You got the Fed next week, September 18th, the ECB this week, Thursday. Any takeaways, what you are anticipating, Dagen, on the Fed, coming on Thursday the 18th -- Wednesday, the 18th, pardon me.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: The Federal Reserve's going to cut by a quarter of a point, but we do have some data coming out later this week. You got the JOLTS report today, when in term of job openings. You still have a vast number of many more -- I think it's almost a million and half more job openings than there are unemployed in this country.And also, CPI, out later in the week, and retail sales, to go right to the health of the consumer and how much more we're paying in prices in this country because of the tariffs. Those will be interesting to watch.BARTIROMO: And the question is, are we going to see an impact through these numbers, about an economy that is slowing down, over uncertainty over the global slowdown, or uncertainty around the trade conversation.HOUGH: Yes, but not going into recession slowing down. The economy will look good not great. Stocks will move higher because bonds are bad alternative, right now, at these -- at these yields. And I don't think, you know -- the retail numbers will be pretty good. Retail is a bright spot in America despite --BARTIROMO: Yes, it sure is.HOUGH: -- the bankruptcies and store closings in retail. Consumers are spending, it's just that we have too many stores, right now, so --BARTIROMO: It's important, two-thirds of economic growth. Joining the conversation this morning is the Arkansas attorney general, Leslie Rutledge is here, on the Google anti-trust case.Former National deputy -- National Security adviser for President Trump, K.T. McFarland joining us this morning, on North Korea and Afghanistan, and the host of "VARNEY & COMPANY," Stuart Varney weighs in, as well. Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big hour, coming up.President Trump is talking up the economy, while taking a swipe at Democrats, during a packed rally last night, in North Carolina, Blake Burman is live at the White House this morning with the details. Blake, good morning to you.BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you, as well. President Trump slamming Democrats last night, as he went to North Carolina, ahead of today's special elections, special congressional election in the Fayetteville area, giving a bit of a preview as to what his message could be like at this point, next year.The president saying radical Democrats, as he described it, want to dismantle and destroy progress that's been made and said it won't take long. He also tried to link Democrats to socialism.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion and socialism. They're socialists. A vote for any Democrat in 2020, and a vote for any Democrat tomorrow in North Carolina, is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: However, new poll out this morning from ABC News and The Washington Post shows that the president has some convincing to do, that he is steering the economy in the right direction, while 56 percent of Americans view the economy in a positive light, more than 43 percent view it, negatively, and the marks take a dive when it comes to trade.Fifty-six percent of Americans disapprove of the president's handling of the trade negotiations with China, while only 35 percent approve.Confidence in the economy appears to be taking a hit as well, as 43 percent say the president's handling of trade in the economy has increased the chance for a recession, only 16 percent say it's less than a chance, and about a third of Americans, Maria, say it hasn't moved the needle.Sixty percent of Americans, Maria, in that poll, feel that a recession is likely, at some point, over the next year. The same amount say that they are concerned that the trade war with China will lead to higher prices. The president's approval rating in that one poll, Maria, from ABC News and the Washington Post dropped 6 points, the approval rating, down to 38 points. Maria?BARTIROMO: All right, Blake, thank you. Blake Burman is at the White House. Pushing back on big tech, meanwhile, 50 attorneys general from 48 U.S. states and territories, announcing a wide-ranging anti-trust investigation into Google. The probe is largely looking at advertising practices. Here's what several of them had to say, yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)KEN PAXTON (R), ATTORNEY GENERAL, TEXAS: While many consumers believe that the Internet is free. Certainly, we know from Google's profits of 117 billion, that the Internet is not free. And this is a company that dominates all aspects of advertising on the Internet. This investigation is not a lawsuit. It is an investigation to determine the facts.KARL RACINE (D), ATTORNEY GENERAL, WASHINGTON D.C.: Attorneys generals really care about where the rubber meets the road. And that is for the residents of their states and consumers. We also care about businesses, especially small businesses, that may be locked out as a result of what may be monopolistic power.LESLIE RUTLEDGE (R), ATTORNEY GENERAL, ARKANSAS: Most Americans think it's free to Google something. But it comes at a cost. A cost that the freedom to choose the best products from the best companies.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: The only states not onboard, California and Alabama. Joining us right now is Arkansas attorney general, Leslie Rutledge. Ms. Attorney General, good to see you, thanks so much for joining us this morning.LESLIE RUTLEDGE (R), ATTORNEY GENERAL, ARKANSAS: Good morning.BARTIROMO: Tell us, really, what the big issues are from where you sit, in this lawsuit, around Google. Because there's a lot conversation whether it be the way they say that their algorithms deal with searches or the fact that the company has 90 percent market share in search, or the other argument, that they are actually censoring certain speech, censoring conservatives because of their own liberal ideology.RUTLEDGE: Well, thank you. I think it's important to note that this is an investigation. That, right now, we are -- these 50 attorneys general, we have launched this investigation and we will go where the facts lead us.Our concerns with Google being the online search engine juggernaut that it is, has to do with whether or not we are adequately protecting American consumers, protecting the free market in America to ensure that, again, Google is not violating any anti-trust laws, because as you just noted, aptly 90 percent of the market on the online search engines.BARTIROMO: Yes. And there's also this issue about Google working with China, and I wonder what your -- what your thoughts are here, because I've been working on a lot on Artificial Intelligence and looking at the issues around A.I.And, of course, we know that Google walked away from a contract, Project Maven, with the Pentagon. They said that they didn't want to be involved in anything that it was used in the military, and that is Artificial Intelligence. And yet, they are working with China, and they've got their A.I. lab in Beijing.Is there any way that the Chinese might try to infiltrate or meddle in the U.S. election, try to take Trump down through Google?RUTLEDGE: Well, I don't think that we should underestimate any of our foes across the globe who are looking to infiltrate and impact elections, and to use American companies to do so. Whether or not Google would have a hand in that, one would hope not, and we would ask they not.The investigation that we launched yesterday, has to do with digital advertising of this company. And so, we're going to remain focused on that. However, if other issues arise, whether it's Google or another company, we will certainly look into that and work very closely and cooperatively with the Department of Justice.BARTIROMO: So, you're going to look at other companies then, not just Google.RUTLEDGE: Absolutely. It's -- you know, this is a beginning. Google is one that we are launched investigations yesterday. However, it's imperative that we protect all Americans and that we protect our free market, and perhaps, you know, when Americans go to conduct a search, that they understand, as I stated, that a search is not free.We want to make sure when we are looking for help with a sick child on the Internet, late at night, that you are getting the best services and the best advice, and not simply those who paid the highest price. Each and every one of us when we look at our smartphones, we are brought a Super Bowl ad to us, powered by Google.MCDOWELL: Attorney General, it's Dagen McDowell, but what are you going to find that the FTC did not? Google has faced, I think, three multi-billion- dollar fines from the European Union.But the FTC decided against suing Google back in 2013, because it found it was basically divided between making innovative products with the clear desire to hobble would be competitors, in the words of the Wall Street Journal.So, what are you, as attorneys general, going to find now that, basically, the U.S. government has not yet?RUTLEDGE: Well, I think, Google would be the first to admit that quite a bit has changed since 2013, and it's 2019, and perhaps their business practices have changed. Again, this is an investigation. And as the attorneys general for the states, we will go where the facts lead us.And so, this is not an outcome determinative investigation. We are simply wanting to protect the American consumer in doing so.BARTIROMO: All right. Ms. Attorney General, good to see you this morning, thanks so much. We'll be watching the developments.RUTLEDGE: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Leslie Rutledge, joining us there. Coming up, Apple is hitting the reset button. The technology giant expected to unveil a brand-new version of its iPhone. We are taking you to Apple Park, live, getting a look at what to expect out of Apple today, big announcements.Then, take a joyride with "Jeopardy!". How fans can now test their trivia knowledge in the car, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, more evidence seized in the deadly California boat fire investigation, Cheryl Casone on headlines now. Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Well, Maria, federal agents say that they have recovered a trove of information after they searched the offices of the diving boat company that owned the boat for two days. That information includes training records and business documents. That massive fire last week killed 34 people on board off the Southern California coast.Investigators are working to determine that the captain and boat owners followed safety requirements. Well, Elliot management is now calling for major changes in AT&T. The activist shareholder who has invested $3.2 billion into that company says a restructuring could boost its stock to more than $60.00 a share by the end of 2021. Now, Elliott says AT&T needs to be more like Verizon, the competition, aggressively cutting their cost, investing heavily in wireless networks across the world. There is the AT&T premarket read, up more than three-quarters of a percent right now.And finally, there is this, some good news. Alex Trebek is back, hosting another season of "Jeopardy" after being treated for stage four pancreatic cancer.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ALEX TREBEK, HOST, JEOPARDY: Today, Jeopardy begins its 36th season on the air. And I'm happy to report I'm still here. Our champion --(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: He's still there to celebrate the 36th anniversary of the show. He's introducing a new app that's called "Drive Time." Fans can answer trivia questions on the road from the last 35 "Jeopardy!" seasons, Maria. And I know that you were part of one of those seasons many years ago.BARTIROMO: I was.CASONE: Yes. I would be so nervous.BARTIROMO: I will by now. But I was and then I bummed horribly, but I would do it again.CASONE: You're going to do it.BARTIROMO: It was so much fun to be in "Jeopardy!" Let's talk AT&T for a second. We know that Elliott Management has taken a stake in AT&T. AT&T is hiring Goldman Sachs. The company is talking about the Time Warner acquisition, Elliot management is, Jack. Your thoughts on AT&T.HOUGH: Look, AT&T is not a total mess. The phone business is quite strong, the T.V. business is a little bit of trouble, especially the DirecTV, which is losing subscribers. There is a path here, and the path is streaming. I think they're going to announce some plans to shift customers from, you know, satellite T.V. towards streaming the future. The bottom line is you get a dividend yield of five percent and change at a time when the 10-year Treasury has given you 1.6 percent. There's enough free cash flow to support that dividend long-term. As investors become more comfortable with that fact, I think they're going to move into the stock.BARTIROMO: At one point, AT&T was the most -- the single-most widely held stock in America. I don't know if it's still the case in terms of -- but it certainly is very widely held in portfolios. Elliot is saying that this stock could go to 60.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: That's what it said. Elliott Management said we want to drive this stock to $60.00. And I'm wondering --HOUGH: Yes, but you own the stock, you say, it can go to 60.BARTIROMO: Yes, sure. But what do you think about some of the moves it is talking about tot get it to 60? Would that do it if it were to, in fact, make some changes on the Time Warner deal?HOUGH: I think the only move they need is stop the bleeding at DirecTV and show that no matter what you do in the future, that there is going to be the free cash to support that dividend payment. As long as I know that those dividends are going to come, I'll be comfortable with the stock. I think that's what people feel about AT&T.BARTIROMO: Yes, I'm sure -- I'm sure that's right because that's why one of the key reasons people buy the stock because of that deal.HOUGH: They're not buying it for the growth.BARTIROMO: That's right.HOUGH: At this point, they want the income.BARTIROMO: Exactly. All right, a quick break. And then, Apple is getting a refresh. The technology giant gears up to unveil a brand new iPhone. When you can expect it on store shelves, coming up. And then, a new era for Alibaba, founder Jack Ma officially steps down as head of one of the world's largest e-commerce companies. We're breaking it down. What comes next? Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets are in focus this morning. Futures indicating a decline at the start of trading, down about 28 points. But really, the news is going to happen later on in the week when the ECB meets on Thursday and the Federal Reserve meets next week. Stocks are back near record levels after weeks of turmoil. Investors still on edge though over trade. Last year, the S&P peaked in late September, only to fall almost 20 percent the rest of the year.Joining us right now is Federated Investor Senior Equity Strategist Linda Duessel. And Linda, it is good to see you this morning, thanks so much for joining us.LINDA DUESSEL, SENIOR EQUITY STRATEGIST, FEDERATED INVESTOR: Well, good morning.BARTIROMO: September can be a tough month for markets. And we've seen the big blow ups in October, as well. What are you expecting rest of the year from this market?DUESSEL: Well, we -- as you suggested, we've had some volatility and through the summer here, but we've taken a break. Lots of people are looking more and more positive. And you know, we had some rotation just in the last couple of days into the more value-oriented stocks that maybe indicate that we've been oversold, we piled into the defensive stocks. And now, maybe we're going to go the other way because things are looking perhaps a little bit better. So, we still think we're going to get our 3100 year-end figure.BARTIROMO: So, when you say things are looking a little better, we still have the uncertainty around trade. What in your standpoint is looking better?DUESSEL: You know, I personally think that we blame trade for every good day and every bad day.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a good point.DUESSEL: And I think -- you know, and I think that -- I really think that our administration would like to kick this can down the road, much as Brexit is getting kicked down the road. Kicking the can down the road is pretty much all the market needs to say, let me look over at earnings. What we're bullish about is earnings. We think that there is no recession on the horizon. And we think that as we make our way to the end of this year, the markets will say, actually, I don't see a recession into next year. And we could continue to build up this market on a reasonable earnings growth, and maybe get that 18 P.E. multiple, which might get us closer to even 3300 next year, if all goes according to plan.MCDOWELL: Well -- go ahead, Jack.HOUGH: Linda, hi, it's Jack Hough from Barron's magazine.DUESSEL: Hello.HOUGH: I could have sworn I heard you use the V word earlier, value. It's been a decade that growth stocks have beaten up on value stocks with very low interest rates, and low interest rates look like they're here to stay. Why wouldn't I just put everything in Amazon and Netflix and forget it right now? Are we going to see a return to value stocks anytime soon?DUESSEL: Well, the value stocks are simply a rotation. As we know, the market itself hadn't really gone up. People selling out of growth to go into value as a short-term potential rotation that will unwind itself because it was overdone. I'm not suggesting that I think value -- it's not the time for value. You buy value in the midst of a recession when you think that there's enough -- that there's enough stimulus to get you out of the recession, and we're not in a recession.As you suggested, we've been in a growth regime for some time. I see no reason to think that we won't stay in a growth regime. As far as value is concerned, that type of value that where you get the high-quality dividend stocks in the search for yield anywhere, that I think can continue to work.BARTIROMO: Even where rates are, you're not seeing any recession then?DUESSEL: No, I don't see a recession. What I see is a global deflationary bust potential. And here in the United States, the beautiful thing about the United States is we're a consumer-led economy. And the consumer is doing just fine. I insist to people, you know, go to any restaurant that's very busy and wonder how many people are debating, try to buy that new pair of shoes, because I don't know how this trade war is going to work out. I don't suppose they are.BARTIROMO: Yes. I know. I'm just asking --(CROSSTALK)DUESSEL: At least that's not my view.BARTIROMO: There's got to be a reason that all these central banks that are easing, you got the European Central Bank set to finish its latest policy meeting on Thursday. Many expecting a rate cut there, stimulus measures there at the Federal Reserve meeting next Tuesday and Wednesday. Chairman Powell saying that the Fed will continue to act as appropriate to sustain the economy. So, Dagen, here you have all of these central banks stimulating, even if we're not in -- facing off a recession.MCDOWELL: Right. And -- but will it do any good, though, Linda? Particularly, maybe you were talking about the U.S. consumer, maybe the U.S. consumer doesn't need it. But with all this stimulus being -- flooding the world economy with money, will it bolster these economies? We talked about the trade fight, but we have the whole of Europe struggling? Will it help?DUESSEL: Right. Now, of course, Europe, I've thought for many years, Europe is a basket case, they've got some really big structural issues over there. Cutting interest rates, doesn't seem like it's going to work, or it hasn't really worked at all. And that that is this deflationary bust that I am concerned about. Here in the United States, there's no reason to cut interest rates except for looking at what's going on around the whole wide world. But there, again, I think that we're just attached to this story so very much.What I see in terms of growth around the globe is, you know, you may be slipping below that 50 line of demarcation, or you may be toggling around it, or you may be getting lots of stimulus from China, which very well may help the global economy. Maybe we don't have a big trade war with Europe, and things are OK. Why are we panicking here with we need to keep reducing interest rates into more further negative territory? I don't really think that we even need to.BARTIROMO: All right. So, you're still buying stocks?DUESSEL: Stocks are the only place to go, yes. And particularly in the United States, I've said for some time, I'm Team USA. We like U.S. stocks. We like the growth stocks, small cap growth, it looks really, really good, too.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Linda, good to see you. Thanks so much.DUESSEL: Hey, thank you very much.BARTIROMO: Linda Duessel from Federated. Coming up, Apple's recess. The tech giant expected to unveil its latest iPhone. We're going to take your live to Apple park at a look at what's ahead and coming out of Apple. Then, hit the brakes, Ford's credit rated down -- credit rating has been downgraded this morning to junk, where the automaker fell short, coming up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, September 10th. Your top stories right now 8:31 a.m. on the East Coast.It is Apple's big day today. The technology giant set to announce new iPhones. We're going to take you live to Apple Park at a look what to expect out of Apple this morning. Markets are lower today. Take a look at futures indicating a decline at the start of trading. We're not at the lows of the morning, down just 35 points on the Dow, but the S&P is down 6- 1/2 and the NASDAQ lower by 26.We're all waiting on the ECB on Thursday and the Federal Reserve next week Tuesday and Wednesday. Global markets this morning are mixed, European indices mostly lower. FT-100 down 11 points, CAC Quarante in Paris down nine, the DAX Index is up, it is up at 21 points. We are looking forward to the European Central Bank policy decision on Thursday this week. That will move markets.In Asia overnight, markets finished like this mostly higher, better tone, although China was lower, the producer price index for the month of August fell eight-tenths of a percent year over year. That was the worst contraction since August of 2016.Meanwhile, the price of pork soared 47 percent year over year due to the swine fever outbreak and consumer prices in China were up 2.8 percent overnight. North Korea fired off two projectile missiles, this just after saying that it is willing to restart nuclear talks with the United States.Alibaba's founder steps down. Why Jack Ma has given up his title of Chairman at one of the world's largest online retailers. And Ford this morning is under pressure. Take a look, the company's credit rating was cut to junk status, it was down better than four percent. This is raising new questions about CEO Jim Hackett's turnaround plan at Ford. All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.But first our top story this half an hour, Apple's annual iPhone event is happening today. The technology giant is expected to release new iPhones, Apple Watch, and other things as well. Susan Li is live at Apple Park in Cupertino, California this morning.SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes.BARTIROMO: With more in the day ahead. Susan, good morning to you.LI: It's going to be busy out here, Maria. Good morning to you. So, in just about 4-1/2 hours, we do have the big event kicking off at the Steve Jobs Theater behind me here in Apple Park today and it's a very crucial time for the company since we know that iPhone sales have been slowing, so what is the next driver and what'll be the next callous for one of the biggest companies in the world.But let's get to the event today, you know, there's been so many rumors flowing here about, it seems like it's expected we're going to get three new iPhone models, longer battery life maybe, more waterproofing hopefully in future, and upgraded cameras as well. Maybe we'll get a new bigger MacBook, maybe we'll get some waterproof AirPods and maybe we'll get a new Apple Watch as well.But what we're also looking for is the services since Apple has pointed us to services picking up some of the slack given that people aren't upgrading their phones as much as they used to. Will we get a pricing maybe on their streaming service and when will it actually launch? Since Disney has already given us more of the detailing.We (INAUDIBLE) with one of the more bullish analysts on the street, Dan Ives, and he says that this refresh cycle, he says, is being positive for Apple.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAN IVES, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WEDBUSH: I think ultimately, this upgrade cycle is extremely significant for Apple and really Cupertino going forward because you have a third of the installed base, about 350 million users today that are in the window of and upgrade opportunity. And when you get iPhone 11 in terms of the camera technology and the pent up demand, we believe this is going to be a significant upgrade that the street is underestimating.(END VIDEO CLIP)LI: Apple's hoping for that as well since we know that there are 1-1/2 billion iPhones around the world. The installed base is at around 900 million phones. And as we know Apple, seeing some iPhone sales slip in the past, a few quarters over the past year with China being a problem, and coxed in this U.S.-China trade war, back to you, Maria.BARTIROMO: All right, Susan. Thank you so much. Susan Li is in Cupertino this morning. I want to turn to foreign policy and in particular, Afghanistan first.President Trump speaking out yesterday on his decision to end peace talks with the Taliban.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We had a meeting scheduled, it was my idea. When I heard very simply that they killed one of our soldiers and 12 other innocent people, I said, "There's no way I'm meeting on that basis. There's no way I'm meeting." They're dead as far as I'm concerned.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The president called off the meeting after the group claimed responsibility for a car bomb attack that killed a U.S. service member.And joining me right now is former Deputy National Security Adviser under President Trump, K.T. McFarland. And K.T., it's good to see you again.K.T. MCFARLAND, FORMER DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Great to be with you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Your reaction to this.MCFARLAND: Yes, sure, absolutely, call those talks off.BARTIROMO: Yes. Why were they scheduled in the first place?MCFARLAND: Well -- I mean my assumption is they thought they had a deal, that Trump thought he had a deal, and unless you have a signed, sealed, and delivered deal, you don't do anything in the United States with the Taliban, you particularly don't do it at Camp David.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.MCFARLAND: But I think he was right to cancel it, because number one, let them think, you know, why should they think they've got the upper hand?BARTIROMO: Yes.MCFARLAND: And then the second thing is let's have them think about what life is going to be like when the United States pulls out and we pull out all of our aid. Then they're just going to go at it with each other, the Afghan Government, every tribe, the Taliban.BARTIROMO: Well, that's the thing, I mean do we want that to stoke even more upset and more, you know, issues on the ground? Maybe the Taliban wants the U.S. out.MCFARLAND: Of course they do.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCFARLAND: They want to go at it. Now look, what's our interest? I'm not -- I don't care about the Taliban, I don't even care about the Afghan Government. I mean they've been corrupt and incompetent for 20 years. What I care about is killing Americans and if they all agree, if the Taliban says, or we should say to the Taliban, "Do whatever you want, kill each other, that's fine, make peace, that's fine, too, but don't you dare kill Americans in Afghanistan, do not kill Americans overseas, and certainly do not come and kill Americans in the United States homeland and don't let any of your buddies do it either because if that happens, you will not get another dime of American aid under any circumstances any time any place and we are going to come after you."BARTIROMO: Let me switch gears, ask you about this op-ed in the Journal, "Will Trump sellout the U.S. on Huawei?" This is a piece by George Soros in The Wall Street Journal, and George Soros is basically praising the president. I was pretty surprised at this. He's been a detractor of the president for a long time and he writes this, "Will Trump sell out the U.S. on Huawei," writing, "the administration rightly declared Beijing a strategic rival and placed Huawei, China's multinational telecom giant, on the Commerce Department's so-call entity list as a national security threat.This prevents U.S. companies from doing business with Huawei, but it -- he appears desperate for a deal with President Xi to bolster the stock market and the economy to improve his chances at reelection, putting his electoral interests ahead of America's interests. He urges the president not to let Huawei off the hook or use it as a bargaining chip like he did with Huawei's rival, ZTE, last year. You think the president's doing that?MCFARLAND: No. I think that what's -- Soros, I almost never agree with, but the beginning of his article, I do agree with, we shouldn't give that up because that is the crown jewel. But he's right in that the most important relationship the United States has is with China and it's one that finally having a president who stood up to the Chinese.We've been betting ripped on for 20 years by the Chinese over trade and tariff agreements, subsidizing their economy at the expense of outs, and all in the hopes that once China got modernized and wealthy, that they would be our best friends, they would be an open society and they would trade fairly. None of that has happened and so finally a president's standing up and it's the right time to do it, and it may be the last time to do it.BARTIROMO: So what should be done at this point? Because, I mean obviously, markets want a deal, the economy seems to be slowing around this uncertainty over a deal, and yet the president has changed his conversation on China. He has been very articulate in terms of the national security risks, so should we forget a deal?MCFARLAND: I think we go for the tough -- this is the moment to have the deal. The Chinese economy is slowing, Xi Jinping has problems in Hong Kong with those demonstrators and he finally has an American president who doesn't back down. We are in the best position we've been in for decades, the economy is terrific, Trump already has trade deals with Canada, with Mexico, South Korea, now Japan, and potentially Britain.I think Trump should take all of those trade deals he has in his pocket, and take all those countries to the Chinese and say, "We want a new deal. We are all getting ripped off from you and we have for decades, and we now want another relationship. Now we don't want to screw you, we want a fair and reciprocal relationship, but the days of the United States subsidizing your economy are over."BARTIROMO: Yes. You make a good point but, you know, do we have enough allies on this subject against China? Because last time I checked, Huawei infrastructure was all over Europe.MCFARLAND: That's right. OK.BARTIROMO: Do the Europeans not get it that there are back doors in Huawei equipment where data is their going right back to the -- to the Beijing government?MCFARLAND: If China controls the technologies of the future, which is their goal.BARTIROMO: Right.MCFARLAND: By 2025, they want to be dominant at -- in all 10 technologies of the future. If we allow Huawei to be the dominant platform for internet transactions and the way we all now communicate with each other, we might as well send it all to the Chinese government because that means the Chinese will control all communications with anybody everywhere in the world, and what does that allow them to do? To do exactly what they're doing to their own people, which is listening to everybody.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, I mean, that's what's happening with artificial intelligence, the Chinese are tracking their people --MCFARLAND: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- you know, tracking their citizens with facial recognition and using A.I. to do it. A.I.'s being used in the military as well.MCFARLAND: Uh-hmm.BARTIROMO: What are your thoughts about A.I. in the military and China being perhaps ahead of the U.S. in that regard?MCFARLAND: OK. Two things. One, the Chinese are using all of this facial recognition software algorithms. They're using it to track every one of their own people because they need it. They want to have a complete authoritarian state.BARTIROMO: But -- and they have it.MCFARLAND: Everybody's at Big Brother and they have it now.BARTIROMO: And they've got it, yes.MCFARLAND: Now what they do to their own people, they're -- they would happily do to the rest of the world. As far as the United States and our A.I. technology or any of those advanced technologies, I think we've dropped the ball for 20 years because we've been fighting wars in the Middle East that we couldn't win, they have consumed our attention, and our resources.I think it is time to turn around and invest like a Manhattan project, invest in American technologies, because unless we are the leader in these technologies, robotics, artificial intelligence, all these different technologies that the Chinese are trying to beg, borrow, or steal from us, then we're in a very difficult position 10 years from now.BARTIROMO: Yes, for sure. Well, that's just the -- this is the issue. K.T. it's great to see you.MCFARLAND: It's great to see you, too. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. K.T. McFarland joining us there. Coming up, Brexit uncertainty as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson suffers another setback. Stuart Varney will weigh in. And then Ford flashing its hazards, its credit rating was downgraded to junk status. Where the automaker fell short coming up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. President Trump and British Prime Boris Johnson have a chance to put their stamp on the special relationship. Joining me right now the host of "VARNEY & CO." Stuart Varney to weigh in. Yes, it's a good point, Stu.STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I suspect you're laughing at me under the surface there, Maria. But I --BARTIROMO: No. I think you're right.VARNEY: It's not the same as the old special relationship Margaret Thatcher-Ronald Reagan, it's more of a parallel which I hope continues, quite frankly. Have you noticed that on both sides of the Atlantic, the media detests the Prime Minister and the President of the United States? There's a parallel.Have you noticed that on both sides of the Atlantic, the elites detest the Prime Minister, Boris, and the President, President Trump? And both sides of the Atlantic have the commonality of a very strong economy. Most of our viewers probably don't know this, but the Brits just reported a 3.8 percent unemployment rate and a four percent gain in wages, it's almost exactly the same as the United States, they share something in common right there.And I -- look, they both have super powerful rivals, Boris Johnson's going up against the European Union, President Trump's going up against China, there's all these parallels going on, which suggests a special relationship. And as I said, I hope it continues because if the Brits can get out of Europe, we can then have a special trade deal with the United States. I keep saying "we." I mean they can have a special trade deal with the United States.You think -- I think there is a parallel here, maybe not a special relationship but definitely a parallel worth pursuing.BARTIROMO: Yes, and I think that that's in the conversation right now. I mean you know --VARNEY: I think so.BARTIROMO: -- the president has talked much about the U.K. being at the top of the line --VARNEY: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- when they are ready.VARNEY: Unlike the Obama years when America -- Britain would be in the back of the line, if they went through with Brexit.BARTIROMO: That's right.VARNEY: My, how time's changing.BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly. Stu, I know you'll have more in 10 minutes. We'll see you top of the hour.VARNEY: See you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. "VARNEY & CO." begins every day 9:00 a.m. Eastern. Join Stuart after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. But first, it is a new era for Alibaba. The founder, Jack Ma, officially steps down as the head of the one of the world's largest e-commerce companies, we'll break down that, what's the impact.Then rough roads ahead, Ford's credit rating was downgraded to junk status. Where the automaker fell short after this break. Back in minute.BARTIROMO: We are watching shares of Ford down better than four percent in the premarket after bad credit rating. Gerri Willis on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with details there. And a market that looks like it's opening flat this morning, Gerri.GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, so who knows what'll happen? But that's what it's looking like right now. Let's talk about Ford taking a big hit. You said down almost four percent, that's worse than it was even 30 minutes ago. Why Moody's downgrading Ford credit to junk status, they say weak EPS, cash generation, as ford restructures the company's spending about $7 billion on that restructuring and taking $11 billion in charges.Ford for its point of view says that their business and balance sheet is solid, we did not get a response to our questions to Ford or Moody's this morning.Meanwhile, Jack Ma, the richest man in China is going to retire, step down from Alibaba, the empire he built. You can see shares of that company are down this morning. It was a long planned succession scheme.And Facebook, big problem here, they're facing massive damages in a lawsuit in San Francisco over the Cambridge Analytica embarrassment, what you want to say, breach of all of our personal data. The judge in that case in San Francisco saying that Facebook's interpretation of this is that they can use their information pretty much any way they want to, that they gather on the social media web site. He disagrees.And also Treasury U.S. Undersecretary for Terrorism saying that Facebook will have to comply with U.S. laws regarding money laundering and terrorism as it gets ready to launch Libra cryptocurrency. You can see those shares down as well today. Maria, back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Gerri. Thank you so much. We will watch that as well. And, Jack, your thoughts on these tech companies in terms of this big antitrust fight.HOUGH: Yes. Step back for a minute on big tech. The five biggest companies in America, they're all tech companies, they're all really software companies when it comes right down to it, and it's not -- I don't see a price bubble there because they're not so expensive, but they're 28 percent of U.S. profit, that's close to the peak for the financial sector during the height of the housing bubble.BARTIROMO: Yes.HOUGH: Bank of America points out that's a level that can often signal major market peaks. I don't know how the -- how the burst -- if that's a bubble, I don't know how it bursts for tech because some of these are still growing their top lines by 20 percent, that profit bubble, if you want to call it that, it's interesting that that's happening in a time when these companies are under the gun from regulators in all sorts of directions.BARTIROMO: Yes, a lot of conversation about this rotation going on on Wall Street right now and whether or not the valuations in tech are going to mean the rotation skips over tech.HOUGH: Yes. I'm looking for what could slow the profit growth for some of these companies.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm. All right. We'll take a break. When we get back, we've got final thoughts from this all-star panel. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets are going to open lower this morning. You just saw futures, we are -- we are waiting on the ECB Thursday and the Fed next week, down 38 on the Dow. We'll see what comes out of it. Couple of name stocks though are actually moving much more than the averages. Let's get some final thoughts from this all-star panel. Jack Hough.HOUGH: Well, we're going to -- we're going to get lower rates. Who benefits from that? I don't -- maybe we don't have any more stimulative effect anymore, but I'm looking at home builders. Mortgage rates are attractive but, millennials are reaching these peak years when they might be moving out of the parents' house, buying houses. I see good signs that millennials could drive home building. I'm looking at D.R. Horton which I think has a good entry level product.BARTIROMO: So you --HOUGH: For homebuilders.BARTIROMO: You think these rock-bottom mortgage rates, actually they haven't kept up with other rates, but still, they're low, is that going to provide some stimulus for the housing market?HOUGH: I think the general homebuyer, a quarter point is not going to make a difference, but I think it's happening at just the right time for millennials who could be the next big driver for the homebuilder market.BARTIROMO: Tiana, what are you looking at?LOWE: So we spoke with Senator David Perdue earlier. Late breaking news last now is that he's a primary -- or he's a Democratic challenger for his re-election. Jon Ossoff, you may remember, because he spent six times the amount that Karen Handel did and still lost to her despite raising $24 million. I would say that Stacey Abrams would be a compelling candidate for the senate race except that would mean that she'd have to abdicate her slot as governor of Georgia. But she still maintains that she won.BARTIROMO: So what do you -- what do you think happens?LOWE: I think Perdue wins re-election.BARTIROMO: OK.LOWE: We keep on hearing about Georgia's going to go blue. It hasn't happened.BARTIROMO: Dagen.MCDOWELL: No, it has not happened. I'll point out that the story about the e-cigarette makers and Juul in particular with the Food and Drug Administration going after Juul, saying you can't claim that e-cigarettes are safer than traditional cigarettes, also feeling the heat from the Federal Trade Commission and even the first lady tweeting about the danger of e-cigarettes and the nicotine addiction. I would pay attention to that because it's getting -- that company it is getting it from all sides.And I think Rob Gronkowski's on Stuart's show coming up, by the way.BARTIROMO: Yes, and by the way, we also had a warning from the FDA saying while we investigate this, stop vaping.MCDOWELL: Right.BARTIROMO: I mean this is a serious stuff. Great show, everybody. Great to see you. Thanks for joining us. Have a good day, everybody. "VARNEY & CO." begins right now. Stu, take it away.VARNEY: Good morning, Maria.Load-Date: September 11, 2019End of Document

Elon Musk is doubling down on China as car sales plummet and electric-vehicle subsidies are slashed (TSLA)Business Insider USSeptember 24, 2019 Tuesday 05:18 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 717 wordsByline: mmatousek@businessinsider.com,  (Mark Matousek)Highlight: The launch of Tesla's first factory in China will likely come at a difficult time for auto companies in the world's largest passenger-vehicle market.BodyKyle Grillot/Reuters• The launch of Tesla's first factory in China will likely come at a difficult time for auto companies in the world's largest passenger-vehicle market.• The electric-car maker is building a factory in Shanghai that it expects to begin producing vehicles by the end of this year• Having a factory in China will reduce the shipping costs required to send vehicles to Chinese customers, which could allow Tesla to cut prices and attract more customers.• But Tesla is increasing its investment in China at a time when auto sales are declining for the first time in almost three decades, and the Chinese government is cutting subsidies for electric vehicles.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.The launch of Tesla's first factory in China will likely come at a difficult time for auto companies in the world's largest passenger-vehicle market.The electric-car maker is building a factory in Shanghai that it expects to begin producing vehicles by the end of this year. On Tuesday, CEO Elon Musk           tweeted that the company is building a significant engineering team in China focused on software and firmware for both its factory and vehicles.Read more: Angry shareholders accused Elon Musk of using Tesla and SpaceX to bail out his cousins' solar company for $2.6 billionHaving a factory in China will reduce the shipping costs required to send vehicles to Chinese customers, which could allow Tesla to cut prices and attract more customers. But Tesla is increasing its investment in China at a time when auto sales are declining for the first time in almost three decades, and the Chinese government is cutting subsidies for electric vehicles.During the first half of this year, passenger-vehicle sales in China declined almost 10% compared to the same period last year. And in 2018, the country experienced its first annual auto-sales decrease since 1990. In a note to investors from June, UBS cited trade issues, tepid economic growth, and a lack of government stimulus as possible reasons for the slowdown."China auto sales year-to-date have been much weaker than we anticipated at the beginning of the year," the investment bank said.The decrease has not been limited to gas-powered vehicles. Following years of explosive growth, electric-vehicle sales            declined year-over-year in July and August following            subsidy cuts from the Chinese government. After introducing generous incentives for electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in 2014, China's government plans to            phase them out entirely by the end of next year.See also: Apply here to attend IGNITION: Transportation, an event focused on the future of transportation, in San Francisco on October 22.That puts Tesla in a difficult position. Success in the Chinese market, which is the largest for both gas-powered and electric vehicles, will be essential as the company attempts to grow from a luxury automaker to a mass-market one. And the long-term cost savings made possible by operating factories closer to international customers could help the company, which has posted only four profitable quarters in its 16-year history, move closer to long-term profitability.But for reasons outside of its control, Tesla may end up opening its factory in an unusually challenging economic climate. (Though in the June note, UBS said it expects at least some recovery in the Chinese auto market next year.)Tesla did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment for this story.Are you a current or former Tesla employee?

THE U.S. AND CHINA DRIBBLE ONStates News ServiceOctober 22, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 4928 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS):October 22, 2019Scott Miller: I'm Scott.Bill Reinsch: I'm Bill.Scott and Bill: And we're The Trade Guys.Andrew Schwartz: You're listening to The Trade Guys, a podcast produced by CSIS, where we talk about trade in terms that everyone can understand. I'm H. Andrew Schwartz, and I'm here with Scott Miller and Bill Reinsch, the CSIS Trade Guys.Jack Caporal: I am Jack Caporal, filling in for Andrew Schwartz. On this episode of The Trade Guys, we'll catch up on all the latest China news, from the partial phase one deal reached last week to the blacklisting of Chinese tech companies over human rights concerns. Plus, we'll break down what the NBA China dispute means for businesses, and we'll try and make sense of the latest USMCA developments. All that and more on this episode of The Trade Guys.Jack Caporal: We're back with a fresh episode of The Trade Guys, and a lot has happened on the China front over the past week. Last Friday, U.S. chair Lighthizer and China's top trade negotiator, Liu He, was here. And they struck a deal, and then a few days went by, and they apparently have not completely struck a deal. Maybe you have a broad outline of it, but I would say maybe some flags have been thrown on the field and some more work needs to be done. So, Bill, why don't you catch us up? What exactly did they allegedly agree to on Friday, and then what unraveled since then?Bill Reinsch: The tip off was that they provided no paper and no details. In fact, the president said that it needed to be papered over the next three weeks, which meant they hadn't written it yet. And it sounds like they had a verbal agreement, although as more information has come out, it sounds like they're, pieces of it are taken from where they stopped last May. So that, at least, is on paper, but it needs to be tweaked and approved.The basic deal, I think, is, in the end, may just do nothing more than take us back to where we were when all this began. The Chinese have allegedly promised to buy more stuff. They have been vaguer in their commitment than Trump was. I think he said 50 billion. They've said not a number, and they've also said that their additional purchases will be based on market demand. Also, I think on no further tariffs being imposed, including the ones in December.So they're going to do what they were going to do anyway, which was buy more of our stuff over time. The 50 billion, it's never been clear what time period that is. If that were one or two years, that would be a big deal, because it's never been more than 20, I don't think. If it's over five or 10 years, it's the same old, same old. We put off, in return, we put off the October 15th tariffs; they were increases of older ones. Left up in the air was what he was going to do about the December 15th, the new tranche that was going to go into effect, all the consumer items.The Chinese appear to be holding out for some commitment not to do that. Secretary Mnuchin made a comment about a currency agreement which has not yet appeared but appears to be pretty much the same as what he said they were going to do last April. There are rumors about an IP commitment with no details. I think we wait to see the rest.It sounds as though, if I were the Chinese, I would be smiling right now, because what they appear to give up is what they were always willing to give up, which was to buy more stuff. What we gave up was an element of leverage. There's nothing in this agreement that anybody has said so far that addresses any of the structural problems the U.S. has identified. So, it's phase one.In a way, it's exactly what the brilliant Trade Guys predicted. Trump's not the only one that's brilliant, you see. We're brilliant too. It's exactly what we predicted that he would do, an interim deal, a phase one deal, and punt all the difficult stuff till later. I think this all comes back and bites him or not a year from now.From the standpoint of keeping the thing alive, preventing him from having a failure, saying that he's accomplished a great thing, this checks all those boxes, but there's not a big bear there.Scott Miller: Right, look, there wasn't a total breakdown, so that's probably on the positive side. And as in most of these arrangements, a verbal agreement is usually not worth the paper it's printed on. That's certainly the case here. We always knew that there was going to be some element of market access and some elements of structural reform in any satisfactory final package. And it's still very vague, but as you point out, Bill, the easy part of that is the market access part, is the increasing exports from the United States. But even that is less specific than I think anybody would like.Look, there's time to hammer this out. There was a good headline or two, and a sigh of relief from the market, but this is going to be a long negotiations. If it ever really comes to a satisfactory conclusion, nobody knows yet, but we continue to ask China to stop a whole set of unfair practices that they are highly disinclined to do. The idea of getting anywhere fast in this has always been crazy, but whether we'll get anywhere slowly remains to be seen.Bill Reinsch: There's two other elements to it too. It's following the Japanese model of putting these things in phases, and it's making the mistake that I think we've talked about before that negotiators will warn you against, is if you do the low hanging fruit first and save the hard things for later, you make later much more difficult than it would be before. Usually, you need some of the easy stuff to grease the wheels on the hard stuff. And by doing the market access piece now, it's a little bit difficult to see how they're going to move on to phase two.The other issue that has bubbled up and I don't think it will go anywhere, but is growing frustration in Congress, and I was at a dinner last night with some members where this was mentioned, about this kind of agreement doesn't go to them.Scott Miller: Right.Bill Reinsch: Because this is constructed in such a way as to not require congressional approval, because it doesn't require any changes in law. And Congress appears to be unhappy about that. It's not clear to me that they're going to do anything about their unhappiness, but it's one more element of friction between the executive and the legislative branches.Jack Caporal: In the short term, there's the APEC Leaders Summit in the middle of November, where Trump is expected to sit down with President Xi, and they're supposed to formally sign off on this phase one agreement. What needs to happen between now and then for them to really ink a deal, China to make good on farm purchases, and for the U.S. perhaps to hold off on the December 15th tariff hike?Scott Miller: Well, the first thing is they have to get on the same page about what was actually agreed, because that is, to me, completely unclear. At some point, whatever was agreed in the room has got to be rendered to writing and approved by both sides, so they can at least talk about what they're agreeing to. And at that point, there's at least, there will be more information to the public, and to members of Congress and other parties with a strong interest in this, about we can expect, at least in the near term.I think that's the first step. But I also think that, likely that they will continue on this path of taking what they can now, keeping enough tariffs in place to provide at least what the president believes is leverage, and continuing to negotiate and continuing to demand further action on the structural reform part of the unfair practices argument.Bill Reinsch: Which, by the way, is going to be fine with the Chinese.Scott Miller: Yes.Bill Reinsch: They're not giving up anything that they care about.Scott Miller: Yeah, and they like it that way.Bill Reinsch: And that's fine. And if we want to keep doing that for years, I think they will sure fully keep doing that.Scott Miller: Yes. They'll be hosting meetings all the way to the next century if we let them.Jack Caporal: And they can continue to buy our farm products when they feel as though they need to?Scott Miller: When they're hungry, yes.Jack Caporal: Exactly. And it doesn't seem to be much of an issue for them.Bill Reinsch: Well, they're out of pigs. And so, there's going to be probably pork purchases, and sadly. That's a swine flu epidemic, which apparently now is spreading elsewhere in Asia.Scott Miller: It's a highly contagious virus.Jack Caporal: African swine fever?Scott Miller: Yes. It's a highly contagious virus. And given farm practices in that part of the world, it's not surprising to see it spread quite rapidly.Bill Reinsch: We've been meaning to have Nick Giordano from the pork producers come on the show. We should go back and see what he has to say about this. They should be ... There are various metaphors here. They should be fairly happy right now, and I think the soybean people will be happy. Although, if you talk to them, it's going to take a lot of purchases to make up for what's been lost.Jack Caporal: Exactly. And we also, in the broader scheme of things, seem to be stuck in a long-term cycle, where we make a short-term deal, the Chinese buy some products, a few months go by, the president isn't extremely happy with the pace of the overall negotiations, and he makes another tariff threat. And there has been reporting that the hawks, the China hawks in the administration, are actually quite pleased with this outcome because it allows the tariffs to remain in place, it seems, almost indefinitely. It seems like that's what we're being set up for, right?Scott Miller: It's almost as if that's what they wanted in the first place.Jack Caporal: Exactly. And so, the question is do they want to break the tariff cycle, and what would be the best way of doing so?Scott Miller: Well, the hawks would like to see decoupling continue to the extent it's happening. And so, leaving tariffs in place would do that. I think the problem here really is the entire commercial relationship with China is getting more and not less complicated. So, as I see it, we now have actually three lanes, which sometimes intersect and overlap. There's the unfair practices, call it the 301 investigation lane. There's the high-tech lane, which includes dealing with Huawei and all the related security and technology concerns associated with that. And now there's a human rights lane, which, of course, has always been there and it gets less or more attention depending on the time. But it includes the ongoing religious repression that's happening in certain parts of the country, and now Hong Kong, which is, I think, now in its fourth month of unrest. It's starting to look less like a protest and more like a revolution.But those three lanes, unfair practices, technology disputes, and human rights are each complicated on their own, and they will wind up crossing over at each other and making the entire situation more difficult.Jack Caporal: Let's explore that, because in the lead up to the negotiations last week, the U.S. blacklisted Chinese technology companies that were involved in AI and surveillance operations, particularly as it relates to the...Scott Miller: That's the technology/human rights link.Jack Caporal: ... bleeding together.Scott Miller: Yes, right.Jack Caporal: But it seems as though the negotiations, or at least the negotiating teams, were able to compartmentalize and still make some progress. Is that sustainable, or do you think the other lanes that Scott's identified, Bill, do you think those lanes will eventually bleed into the negotiation? Right? There is the thinking, there's an economic conflict between the U.S. and China, and then there's a broader systems conflict that involves core values, technology, et cetera.Bill Reinsch: I don't think all three lanes are the same size. I agree with Scott that there's three of them. The security lane will be the most difficult going forward, first of all, because I think the issues are genuine. For a lot of people, they trump everything else. If there is a security threat, they should not be on the bargaining table.Scott Miller: You should deal with the security threat.Bill Reinsch: You should deal with the security issue. And the president's apparent willingness to keep these things on the table has been disconcerting to a lot of people, I think including some of his own, the hawks amongst his own advisers.The human rights lane, I think it's a convenient tool for the administration. The president, I don't think, has ever in his entire term ever indicated much personal interest in human rights anywhere. And I think that this is no different. I think it is one more tool that he can use to squeeze, in this case, the Chinese. And because you can do it in a way that also advances our security interests, it's convenient. But I think that if other issues get settled, that one would go away, I think, in his mind. The footnote, of course, is that there's a lot of people in this country, I think because of our history and the way we think, who care enormously about human rights. And what's happening in Hong Kong has outraged a lot of people. What's happening in Xinjiang and what they're doing to the Uyghurs has outraged even more people, including in Congress. And so, I think there's a lot of pressure on the administration to step up and take a much more forceful attitude on these subjects.And as long as it's convenient for the president to do so for other reasons, I think he will. Will it get so bad that he won't have any choice but to pull back because of what the Chinese are doing? I think that would probably depend mostly on what happens in Hong Kong. If the PLA moves in, if the Chinese government is perceived as having sanctioned, approved, or instigated violence in Hong Kong, I think that would make it very difficult for him to do an agreement in the face of U.S. public opinion.Jack Caporal: Right. And so, the administration and Congress are taking action on those fronts, right? So, last week, the administration put eight Chinese companies, they essentially gave them the Huawei treatment. These are Chinese technology surveillance and AI companies. This week, Congress has advanced through the house a legislative package on Hong Kong, which, among other things, shows or expresses U.S. support for the protesters there. And in response, China has threatened vague retaliation, although the language that they used was quite stark. And then finally, there's this whole episode with the NBA and Hong Kong, which raises a separate issue of how businesses now have to operate in a very complex environment where their reliance on the Chinese market or their desire to get into the Chinese market for economic reasons is quite strong, yet there's an issue of standing up and exhibiting American values, like free speech, et cetera.Jack Caporal: Right? So, should businesses navigate that? And just to put it into perspective with the NBA issue, the NBA has video streaming deal with Tencent, a Chinese company, that's worth $1.5 billion over five years. 500 million Chinese individuals watched at least one basketball game last year. And then, NBA players rely on shoe sales, Nike endorsements, and also have deals with Chinese apparel companies, right? And so, this is a massive issue, and it's not just the NBA. There are countless other examples of companies who've been scolded by the Chinese or threatened market access for statements, decisions, et cetera. And so, how should U.S. businesses now approach this fraught relationship?Bill Reinsch: Companies don't like to be in these positions. Companies like to be, they just like to do their business, and they don't like to be dragged into politics. It's particularly difficult for companies that basically have a consumer brand. That's where the boycotts come in, that's where the protests come in. They also end up in the position, this is happening in the NBA, where no matter what they do, somebody's going to be unhappy. In the NBA case, if you apologize, then the people that were outraged by the Chinese pushing them around get upset. If you stand up for freedom of speech and free speech, then the Chinese are upset. So you're going to lose fans one way or the other. If you do nothing, then they're both upset. So it puts companies in a no-win position.Where I ended up was, from an American point of view, I think, what the CEOs ought to do, and there are people in these corporations. They're not as soulless as Elizabeth Warren would have you believe; there are actual individuals running them. They ought to do what they think is right and just live with it, so they can look at themselves in the mirror in the morning.Scott Miller: I actually agree with that completely, but I worry about the direction of at least large corporations in America. I know it was less than a month ago that many CEOs of the Business Roundtable signed a statement about they had multiple stakeholders and sought to serve the interesting concerns of these multiple stakeholders instead of providing shareholder value. And now, that becomes incredibly difficult in our interconnected world, when you have major differences and you have a power like China, which is prepared to play for keeps in this. In the very early days of the Hong Kong protests, when they were still, could be characterized that way, the government of China forced Cathay Pacific to fire some of its employees who were caught with the offense of protesting in Hong Kong.All right, so, it was pretty clear it was going to be the approach of China. But look, I think that many companies are going long for the day when, if you produced a good or service of superior quality and value to competition, and stayed in business and rewarded your shareholders, that that was good enough. And that, for a long time, was. Getting woke seems to carry a lot of problems with it.Bill Reinsch: Yeah, but I think you have to put in perspective too the long term versus short term of these things. I rather like the Roundtable statement. I think it was a bold thing to do, because I interpreted it as saying, look, there's more to corporate success than quarterly earnings, and that the health of the corporation over the long term, and therefore the return to shareholders over the long term, has to be taken into account. It's not just what are you going to do for the next three months.Scott Miller: Yes. And that much is true. In fact, that was a widely held philosophy in the 1950s and 60s-Bill Reinsch: Correct, yes.Scott Miller: Okay? By far. And the move to total shareholder value as the single measure had downsides to it, had difficulties, but it's very difficult to manage. And so, you have the NBA, which is getting the full brunt of this. But look, the NBA was woke to begin with. The NBA had points of view on American policy. They were, they had points of view on state policy, okay, that they were willing to use their economic power to act against. And now it's backfiring. I'm just very interested to see where this settles. It is going to take very careful management and really real visionary leadership to get through these kinds of things.Bill Reinsch: Yeah. I think if you spend too much time trying to game it and figure out how we navigate through, you just end up making everything worse.Scott Miller: You got to figure out what the right thing to do is...someone is going to do it and do it.Bill Reinsch: No matter what you do, even if you do nothing, a substantial number of people are going to be mad at you.Scott Miller: Yes.Bill Reinsch: Which is why I ended up, you can just skip all that. Do what you think is the right thing and live with it.Scott Miller: Yes.Jack Caporal: Let me flip that back on both of you then, and say you're CEO of a Fortune 500 company, and expansion into China is the next hottest thing that you think will drive growth for your company and your shareholders, et cetera. How big of a flashing red light is this NBA episode? What kind of signal does that send to American companies looking to grow and looking at China as a key part of that growth?Bill Reinsch: I think the signal it sends is don't go there. Now, that's a dangerous thing to say. In sessions with representatives of big companies who've said that it's such a big market with so many people that you can't really be a multinational company and not be there. And I think for a lot of companies, they feel they don't have any choice but to go. And even if they only end up with a small slice of the market, which is normally what happens, because it's not exactly a market in the normal sense of the word, the Chinese will pretty much decide what slice they're going to get. But even if it's a small slice, it's a lot of money. So if you say don't go, you're asking them to make a rather significant sacrifice. But the costs of going, not only in terms of the moral hazard position it puts you in, but the cost potentially of having your IP stolen out from under you, or forced technology transfer, or fairly overt discrimination once you're there, the costs can be enormous.Scott Miller: Yes. And look, if you go, you better have a strategy to manage the risk, and you go in with your eyes open. That has been true of foreign markets for a long time. For hundreds of years, foreign markets were fairly hostile places to home market companies. And it got a lot better fast in the post-World War II era, and we forget that there are risks that need to be addressed, need to be planned for and managed when you run operations away from your home market.Jack Caporal: Tricky situation. Not going to be resolved anytime soon, I don't think, especially as the Chinese consumer market gets wealthier and wealthier and becomes more attractive.To shift gears, there's still the outstanding issue of USMCA, as always. Nancy Pelosi said today that there is good progress being made, which is obviously a positive sign-Bill Reinsch: Which is same thing she said for the last 10 days.Jack Caporal: Which is the same, right. But it's still positive rhetoric from her. She again reiterated that enforcement is the key issue, as it has been for Democrats for quite a while. But last week, Richard Trumka, head of the AFL-CIO, the country's largest labor organization, said a vote before Thanksgiving on USMCA would be ill-advised and would be dead-on-arrival. So, what do you all make of that? Because the administration and Republicans, I think, have been fairly transparent that pre-Thanksgiving vote is their preferred timeline.Scott Miller: Well look, couple things. One is a that progress can only be made in small increments for a time. If you start one day and walk half way toward the wall across the room from you every day, you'll never reach the wall. You've got to find a way to bridge the conclusion. My view is that they are in a position to do that, because A, there's still, I think, goodwill on all side, and B, and for me, this is the more important part of what makes this congressional process different than previous trade agreements, is there has not yet been organized opposition to the passage of the agreement.Now, Mr. Trumka's statement may change that, and labor has always been the issue that is most prominent among the objections and among the improvements needed, mostly because the labor movement still moves votes. So this is the one they had to get right; they haven't gotten it yet. But time's wasting, and if the Trumka statement turns into actual, mobilized opposition, then there's trouble that hasn't been visible so far. And that would, to my mind, it would be a change in the situation.Bill Reinsch: I got a first-hand view of this, because last night, I went to a dinner, which, as I mentioned, and the guests were a number of democratic freshmen. And it was a skewed sample, it wasn't a representative sample. They were pro-trade freshmen, but they were from a variety of places. The South, Midwest, industrial North. And they were all pro-trade, and they were all talking about how important getting this done for their constituents. The ones that represented farmers were the most exercised about it, and they had lots and lots of stories about the difficulties that their communities are facing because of what's going on. I was tempted to ask them why are they all still going to vote for Trump, but we didn't have that conversation. But it's very clear that there's a significant element of, which I think the speaker listens to. That's what's partly driving this train.A lot of these freshmen, which are the ones that gave her the majority, they're the ones that, they defeated Republicans, they either took open seats that had been Republican, or they defeated Republicans. And that's-Scott Miller: That's why she's-Bill Reinsch: ... those are the people that made her speaker.Scott Miller: That's why she's speaker. Exactly.Bill Reinsch: And she's paying attention to them, and I'd like to think that at the end of the day, organized labor ... And it wasn't just Trumka. He was followed by the UAW, the United Auto Workers, and the International Association of Machinists saying the same thing. I would like to think that they're going to figure out that they are so much better off on a host of issues with the Democrats running the show than they are with the Republicans running the show, not just on trade, but labor law and union dues and this whole host of issues where this administration in particular has tried to reduce their influence, reduce their ability to organize. And that you would think that, at the end of the day, they would be focused on what could we do to help the speaker maintain the majority.I also don't think the proponents had to be careful not to ask for too much. You don't have to get an endorsement out of Richard Trumka-Scott Miller: No, no. You just. You have to leave him in a position where he does not mobilize opposition.Bill Reinsch: Yes, exactly.Scott Miller: That's the key.Jack Caporal: Where does the Thanksgiving deadline come in then? Right? It just seems kind of arbitrary, right? It's not entirely clear what he's looking for. He has doubts maybe about Mexico's ability to enforce their own labor law reforms. I just don't know what could happen between now and Thanksgiving that would change his mind, right?Scott Miller: Look, this is never going to be good enough. I have no idea where the Thanksgiving date comes from, either. I think there are very few legislative days after Thanksgiving. It may be part of it. And look, this is never going to be satisfactory. It's never going to be enough. So the key question is how far do they have to get it where it's good enough to address the concerns in a fair way and not provoke organized opposition?And I think, will Mrs. Pelosi get half her caucus, 130 votes? I don't think so. Okay. Will she get 80? She probably could. Okay. So this is not a terrible outcome, but it is one that speakers are careful about. And it's complicated, still complicated, and it always has been.Bill Reinsch: The thing that worries me is some of the opponents, some of the labor opponents, are saying that we can't do it until we see evidence of Mexican implementation, which really is not the postponement till after Thanksgiving. That means postponement for months if not years. It's for them to develop a track record. In a way, there's kind of a catch 22 there. The Mexicans don't have any obligation to implement the agreement until the agreement's been approved.Scott Miller: Correct.Bill Reinsch: They have an obligation to implement their own law.Scott Miller: Yes.Bill Reinsch: But if you wait for them to develop a track record, I think we'll be waiting a long time. At some point, I think the parties simply have to say, they make commitments, they put their money where their mouth is, and the budget that needs to be decided.Scott Miller: Yes.Bill Reinsch: And that it's time to move on.Jack Caporal: Do you think if push came to shove, and the administration submitted the implementing legislation, and the speaker put the bill on the floor before Thanksgiving, that it would have the votes to pass?Scott Miller: Well look, I think those two things are inconsistent. If the administration sends the bill, I think that trips a wire that would gain resistance. If, when Mr. Neil and his working group are ready for a markup and the bill goes forward, at that point, I think it's a deal. Okay? And that it will move in good faith. But I would still discourage any provocative action, because I think it would be seen as bad faith.Bill Reinsch: We've talked about this before and I think Scott's right. If the president submits it preemptively, it goes down, because the Democrats will rebel. If the speaker puts it forward, it'll pass, because she won't put it forward until she's got the votes.Scott Miller: Correct.Jack Caporal: Sure. Okay, so stay tuned on USMCA.Scott Miller: Fair enough.Bill Reinsch: And we'll be back.Andrew Schwartz: To our listeners, if you have a question for The Trade Guys, write us at tradeguys@csis.org That's tradeguys@csis.org We'll read some of your emails and have The Trade Guys react to it. We're also now on Spotify, so you can find us there when you're listening to the Rolling Stones or you're listening to Tom Petty, or whatever you're listening to, thank you, Trade Guys.Scott and Bill: Thanks, Andrew.Load-Date: October 23, 2019End of Document

US companies walk fine line when doing business with ChinaAssociated Press InternationalOctober 8, 2019 Tuesday 9:26 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 797 wordsByline: By MAE ANDERSON, AP Business WriterDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) - The furor over a tweet by the Houston Rockets general manager in support of Hong Kong protesters is highlighting the fine line that U.S. companies must walk when doing business with China.The NBA is trying to manage that delicate relationship after Daryl Morey posted a now-deleted tweet of an image that read "Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong," referring to the 4-month-old protests in the semiautonomous Chinese territory. That set off an immediate backlash, with China's state broadcaster canceling plans to show a pair of preseason games in that country later this week.With a population of 1.4 billion people, a rapidly growing middle class and easing economic restrictions, China is highly appealing to U.S. companies looking for growth overseas. But companies must balance the potential for growth with the potential for pitfalls in dealing with a country that aggressively goes after its detractors.Paul Argenti, professor of corporate communication at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, cautions that companies should know what they're getting themselves into when they enter a relationship with a country that's heading into 70 years of communist rule."It has a regime that doesn't look like the United States," Argenti said. "We can pretend it is a democracy, but it's not."Western governments dislike China's attacks on companies but are unlikely to get involved, said David Zweig, a politics specialist at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. So it's up to companies to navigate situations themselves.Most of the time that means companies that face trouble quickly acquiesce to Beijing, apologize and try to "build bridges" instead of standing up to China, said Jonathan Sullivan, director of China programs at the University of Nottingham's Asia Research Institute.In 2018, Gap pulled a shirt with a map of China that did not include Taiwan, a self-ruled island that Beijing regards as Chinese territory, and apologized. Delta Air Lines, hotel operator Marriott and fashion brand Zara have all apologized to China for referring to Taiwan, Hong Kong or Tibet as countries on websites or promotional material. And Mercedes-Benz apologized for quoting the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, in a social media post."Everyone - states and companies - seem to accept that they have to tread on eggshells when it comes to China for fear of offending them and being punished," Sullivan said in an email. "And they have to contort themselves to do that."A rare exception of a company standing up to China is Google Inc., but even the internet giant had its limits. Google shut down its mainland Chinese search engine in 2010, no longer willing to enforce Chinese censorship by not displaying foreign websites in search results if they were blocked by government filters. Years later, however, reports surfaced that Google was working on a search engine that complies with China's censorship laws, dubbed "Dragonfly," leading to an outcry and a protest by hundreds of its own employees.Peter Petri, a professor of international finance at the Brandeis International Business School, said despite the risks of dealing with China, the country is hard for U.S. businesses to avoid."Both countries have huge economies and are the world's greatest innovators - they have too much to sell and license to each other to stay isolated in the long run," he said. "Especially in high-tech products, China will soon be the largest market in the world, and America's best companies can't stay global leaders without a strong presence there."China is well-aware of its power and influence. And while a tweet may seem inconsequential, the Chinese government's subsequent outrage has a chilling effect on anyone thinking of doing the same, said Alexander Dukalskis, a professor at University College Dublin specializing in Asian politics and human rights."In these episodes, the Chinese government is sending a clear signal to other companies that if you or one of your executives criticize certain policies, your company risks losing large sums of money," he said.Over time, companies that want to do business with China learn to censor themselves - and maybe even their own employees.Ultimately, some companies may find it's not worth the possibility of alienating U.S. customers or risking Chinese ire by doing business in China, no matter how lucrative the deals may be. Dartmouth's Argenti says they must consider how their business in China measures up to their own values and sense of responsibility and then decide, "Are you willing to go to the mat for that, or is it just lip service?""For most companies," Argenti concedes, "it's just lip service."___AP writers Joe McDonald in Beijing and Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report.Load-Date: October 9, 2019End of Document

Rubio Requests CFIUS Review of TikTok After Reports of Chinese CensorshipTargeted News ServiceOctober 10, 2019 Thursday 8:30 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 536 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: MIAMI, Florida BodySen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, issued the following news release:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) sent a letter to Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin requesting the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to exercise its authority and launch a full review of the national security implications of TikTok's acquisition of Musical.ly.In the letter Rubio wrote, "TikTok, which has millions of active users across the U.S., is now ranked among the world's most downloaded apps. There continues to be ample and growing evidence that TikTok's platform for Western markets, including those in the U.S., is censoring content that is not in line with the Chinese Government and Communist Party directives."The full text of the letter is below.Dear Secretary Mnuchin:I write to express concern with regard to Chinese influence operations, including by the social media network, TikTok, a short-video app owned by the Chinese backed, ByteDance. According to reports, TikTok acquired Musical.ly, a video-sharing platform, without any oversight and relaunched the service for Western markets. These Chinese-owned apps are increasingly being used to censor content and silence open discussion on topics deemed sensitive by the Chinese Government and Communist Party. These topics include Tiananmen Square, Tibet, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other issues. I therefore request the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to exercise its authority and launch a full review of the national security implications of TikTok's acquisition of Musical.ly.TikTok, which has millions of active users across the U.S., is now ranked among the world's most downloaded apps. There continues to be ample and growing evidence that TikTok's platform for Western markets, including those in the U.S., is censoring content that is not in line with the Chinese Government and Communist Party directives. Last month, it was reported that TikTok instructed its moderators to actively censor certain videos. This came after questions as to why the app only had a few videos of the Hong Kong protests that have been dominating international headlines for months. The Chinese government's nefarious efforts to censor information inside free societies around the world cannot be accepted and pose serious long-term challenges to the U.S. and our allies.CFIUS should be commended for its recent work in this space against Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd, which took majority ownership of a dating app that contained user's personal and sensitive data. Without intervention, there is no saying how this information would have been used by the Chinese government. What is known, the government of China is using these apps to advance their foreign policy and globally suppress freedom of speech, expression, and other freedoms that we as Americans so deeply cherish. Given the Chinese Government and Communist Party efforts to block content and undermine U.S. values, I urge that CFIUS launch a full and thorough national security review of TikTok's acquisition of Musical.ly.I appreciate your attention to this important matter and look forward to your response.Sincerely,Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6886781 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: October 10, 2019End of Document

NBA leader calls for support for Hong Kong, shone conflict with ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 8, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 489 wordsBody"Fight for freedom, support Hong Kong." The tweet released Friday by Houston Rockets CEO Daryl Morey has sparked a conflict between the Chinese government and the NBA. Representatives of the US League rushed on Monday to try to appease the Chinese administration's outrage over the Rockets' leadership's message of support to Hong Kong protesters.The excuses were mostly channeled through James Harden and Russell Westbrook, the two main figures of the Texan team, who are located these days in Tokyo, Japan, where he will play two exhibition matches. Reactions in China, the starof of the recent World Cup won by Spain and the largest market for the NBA outside the United States, were not expected. Chinese public television network CCTV announced that it will not broadcast Rockets games and several Rockets sponsors threatened to break their contracts with the NBA franchise."We apologize. We love China. We like to play there," Harden said at a press conference, alongside his new teammate Russell Westbrook. The NBA explained in a statement that Morey's point of view "offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is unfortunate." The message was expanded on Weibo, the Chinese twitter, saying, "The NBA is deeply disappointed by the inappropriate comments of the Rockets' leader."Daryl Morey himself said: "I didn't mean to offend Rockets fans or my friends in China with my tweet. I simply expressed a thought, based on an interpretation of a complicated situation, and I've had many opportunities from this tweet to hear other points of view." He added that his tweets do not represent "in any way" his club, very popular in China, or the NBA. Major Chinese basketball star Yao Ming, a 2.29-meter pitcher, played in the NBA with the Houston Rockets from 2002 until he retired in 2011, aged just 30 but heavily punished for injuries.Brooklyn Nets owner Joseph Tsai, a Taiwanese-Canadian billionaire, explained in a message why Morey's tweet was intolerable to the Beijing government and the Chinese. "The problem is that some issues are untouchable issues in some countries, businesses and communities," the co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba wrote on Facebook. "The damage caused by this incident will take time to disappear," said Nets President, who will face the Lakers in Shanghai on Thursday and two days later in Shenzhen.The NBA's excuses have also led to opposing reactions in the United States. The Democratic pre-candidate for the 2020 presidential election, Beto O'Rourke, called NBA messages "embarrassing" asking for excuses from the Chinese government. "The only thing the NBA should apologize for is the flagrant priority given to money at the expense of human rights," O'Rourke lamented. "We're better than that, human rights shouldn't be for sale, and the NBA shouldn't support Chinese communist censorship," tweeted former US Senator Ted Cruz, a GOP member, citing a "shameful setback."Load-Date: October 9, 2019End of Document

Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is jobs Friday, September 6th.Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.Jobs in America this morning. The August jobs report due out in an hour- and-a-half, 8:30 a.m. Eastern. We are expecting 158,000 jobs to have been added to the economy in the month of August with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.7 percent.We have special coverage coming up at 8:00 a.m. Eastern. Join us as we identify where the jobs are today and the best paying ones as well.Markets are higher going into this number. Take a look. Dow futures up 88 points, S&P futures up 8.75. And the Nasdaq futures higher by 17, a quarter of a percent. That is on top of yesterday's big rally as well. Take as look at these numbers.The major indices finished up across the board as U.S. and Chinese officials confirmed a fresh round of face-to-face trade talks that will take place in early October.Dow Industrials were up 372 points at the close yesterday, one and-a-half percent. The Nasdaq up 140 points, 1.25 percent yesterday alone.European indices this morning are mixed. FT 100 is down 5 points. CAC 40 is down 2. The DAX index is higher by 43 but you had weaker than expected economic data in the Eurozone this morning. German industrial production down in the month of July as Eurozone growth fell by 50 percent in the second quarter.The latest signs of slowing economic growth taking place hitting markets.In Asia overnight, markets were higher, take a look at the Hang Seng, up two-thirds of 1 percent. China cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves. That would inject liquidity into the economy which is facing a slowdown there.Hong Kong is still seeing chaos -- the region bracing for yet another weekend of violent protests despite the withdrawal of the controversial extradition bill. That bill sparked the demonstrations to begin with.I'll be speaking with Hong Kong tech tycoon and democracy advocate Jimmy Lai, coming up later this hour. He's coming to us live from Hong Kong. Don't miss that.Border funding battle continues -- the Trump administration diverting billions of military funds to pay for its long-promised wall. We will tell you about it.Dorian's path of destruction, meanwhile, high winds and torrential rain slams the Carolina coast, leaving hundreds of thousands without power this morning. At least four storm related deaths have been reported in the United States as Dorian makes its way up the East Coast.Meanwhile, in the Bahamas, it's really a tragic situation. Officials say hundreds, possibly thousands of people are still missing as the death toll continues to rise there. We will bring you live coverage all morning of Hurricane Dorian and it's impact.Officially out -- former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is dropping plans to run as an independent candidate. We've got the very latest on the road to 2020 as we have Howard Schultz's statement this morning, coming up.Also coming up this morning, Next Digital founder, majority shareholder Jimmy Lai on the Hong Kong unrest. California Congressman Rho Khanna. And Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds on tech jobs, going to talk about that. Plus former Wall Street Journal editorial board member and "Trumponomics" co- author Stephen Moore, as part of our jobs panel.Don't miss a moment of it when we do our jobs panel. We indicate where the jobs are. I want to get your take, Joanie, because your firm is putting people to work.JOANIE COURTNEY, EMPLOYRIDGE CAPITAL: Yes. Putting about 90,000 people to work -- manufacturing, logistics roles. And I will you Maria, there's still such a strong demand right now for workers.One of the things we do look at certainly is the demand for temporary labor because if we're starting to see a slowdown, employers will cut temporary workers.And another thing we're going to look for in this report today is average hours worked because that's another indicator. If we see that number start to slow down, that could show signs of, you know, a recession certainly. So --BARTIROMO: And this report is going to indicate what the fed may do -- John. I mean look -- the top story in the Journal as Dagen reported earlier is this 25 basis point cut that we're expecting from the Federal Reserve on September 18th. Is that what you're expecting?JOHN LONSKI, "WALL STREET JOURNAL": Exactly, almost A 100 percent probability according to the futures market that that indeed is going to take place in a couple of weeks.BARTIROMO: Yes.LONSKI: It would take a very weak employment report, an employment report that is capable of driving the equity market sharply lower to bring it, to view the possibility of a half percentage point rate cut. I don't think that's going to happen.BARTIROMO: I mean the "Journal" talked about the same thing yesterday -- Dagen. But I guess the fact that they're saying it is going to be a quarter point as the reporter, as you always mention him, spoke to the powers that be and know that it's a quarter point. We got to assume that the Journal knows exactly what the Fed is thinking.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I think the tag on the Journal Website this morning when I was looking at the story. It said "exclusive". So that's kind of like an exclamation point at the beginning and at the end of that --BARTIROMO: But it's going to be 25 basis -- to tell you to pay attention to this.I just really wanted to add that in July, average weekly hours worked among private sector employees did fall from a year earlier. So there's been some softness in some of the gauges on how much people are working and that's one thing to watch.(CROSSTALKING)COURTNEY: You know on the other side of that, just to mention quickly though -- unit labor costs came out and it did show that wages went up so watch that actually was something that was unexpected but certainly is impacting profits right now for companies. So a lot of interesting data points out there.BARTIROMO: All those things are going to be discussed.And coming up -- our the other side this hour is the border battle. President Trump diverting money from the military projects to pay for the border wall. Getting plenty of push back from Democrats.Joining us right now is the "Washington Examiner", editorial director, Hugo Gordon. Hugo -- good to see you this morning. Good morning to you.HUGO GORDON, EDITORIAL DIRECTOR, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Thanks very much for having me.BARTIROMO: Your reaction to all of this. Will the President be able to get his money that needs to build the wall?GORDON: Yes, he's going to get the money. It's billions of dollars and of course there's going to be pushback. When you take $3 billion or $4 billion from other areas of spending, they're going to be losers. And obviously members of Congress are looking at where the money is now not going to be spent in their districts and they're up in arms about it.You know, it's easy to find sob stories. They're stories about one base which won't get a new middle school, another place won't get child care. And it's interesting to watch the "New York Times" frame this, you know, it found those sob stories and then it refers to the wall as the President's wall.It's actually the nation's wall. And, you know, I think a lot of viewers will go say, listen, it is always the case that the President decides what the national security issues are. He has decided that an influx of illegal immigrants across the border is a national security issue and, therefore, money that Congress voted for defense, for national security, is appropriately spent there.BARTIROMO: Yes. It's interesting. You're right about the "New York Times" -- the President's wall. I mean, the administration meanwhile is speeding up a challenge to emission standards, Hugo trying to soften Obama- era rules. Your reaction to this? What's the impact here?GORDON: You know, I think that there will always be a debate about, you know, emission standards, greenhouse gases. We saw the Democrats speaking for seven hours the other day about all of their plans. There's plans for -- they want to have carbon taxes.You know, I think that human global warming, that is to say the contribution is one which is up for debate all the time. The Democrats want massive spending on this, massive taxes. The Republicans generally say let's not do things which damage the economy. And so that's where the debate is.BARTIROMO: Well, there's a lot of -- go ahead, Dagen.MCDOWELL: This is a really critical story. And I can't emphasizes this enough in the "Wall Street Journal" because they point out that it looks like the Trump administration is girding for a fight with California.California for years has taken the lead on essentially setting the emissions standards and the fuel economy standards for the entire -- standards for the entire nation. And President Obama and his administration allowed them to do that.It now looks like that we could be facing two sets of emission standards and a long protracted legal fight between Washington, the administration at in California. Why does that matter here. and calif the automakers are already struggling this year. Sales have been slowing. You've had lost jobs in the motor vehicle and automobile industry this year so far.They were hit with steel and aluminum tariffs. And you're basically telling American automakers what kind of car -- they don't know what kind of cars to make in terms of fuel economy.This is a big, big loser for manufacturing jobs in that sector.BARTIROMO: And we're just -- but this, go ahead.LONSKI: We don't want to lose sight of the fact that correcting climate change is not going to come he cheap. I mean people say, well, we have climate change, we have this problem. But they don't really go through the discussion of how much it's going to cost us to lower carbon emissions and it very well might be the cost could be astronomical.We're -- in exchange, we get a slight improvement maybe as far as lowering global temperatures.MCDOWELL: this is under -- we need to point out, this is something that was already in place. President Obama raised the CAF standards, the fuel economy standards for automobiles in this country. And they were too onerous and they were two high by estimations across the automobile industry.But now you have situation where California versus the rest of the country. California versus Washington. And these automakers don't know how this is going to end. That can't be good for business if you can't make decisions.BARTIROMO: These extreme left positions, like you're seeing coming out of San Francisco is one of the reasons a moderate can not get past go in the Democratic Party.We have the breaking news this morning, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said he will not run for president. This according -- well we have actually his statement right here.Howard Schultz writes, "Not enough people today are willing to consider backing an independent candidate, because they fear doing so might lead to reelecting a uniquely dangerous incumbent president with considerable concern that four is going to be too long.Howard Schultz is saying, he is announcing today he is pulling out of the presidential -- John.LONSKI: Well, as you said, there's no moderates running on the Democrat side, maybe except for Joe Biden and he's facing a lot of opposition. This brings back memories a lot of memories of 1972 when we had a not very popular president in office, Richard Nixon, going against this left winger from the Democrats, George McGovern. It turned out that Nixon won by a landslide.BARTIROMO: Hugo, what's your reaction. What's your reaction here?GORDON: I think that when you hear he's pulling out and then he says, you know, about -- he takes a shot at President Trump. He's pulling out because he was making absolutely no traction.And it's interesting to think that Joe Biden is now as you rightly say, you know, regarded as the mod he rest in the field. He's no moderate. He's always been a left-winger and he's going with the flow on this.I don't think there's any resistance on his part to -- for example, the other night, he was just saying how much he supported the Green New Deal. He wanted more details added. He said it didn't go far enough. He's not going to be resisting any left wing policies if he's the nominee.BARTIROMO: Yes. Do you think he is going to be the nominee?GORDON: You know, it's really fascinating but I don't think he is --BARTIROMO: Real quick.GORDON: -- going to be the nominee.BARTIROMO: You don't.GORDON: He's not going to be the nominee because he's going -- I think that once and this is going to happen, Elizabeth Warren takes more votes, more support away from Bernie Sanders. It's going to mean that Vice President Biden is not going to be able to run through the middle between Sanders and Warren. The party wants someone more left wing. I think it's how it's going to end up.BARTIROMO: That's what I said. These extreme policies are making it real hard for anybody who is remotely moderate to get past go. I don't know what happened to this party.Hugo -- thank you. Great insights from you as always.GORDON: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We will you soon. Hugo Gordon, "Washington Examiner". Be shore to join us on Monday morning money, I'll talking trade with Treasury conservative Steven Mnuchin in our 8:00 a.m. hour. We have a lot to talk about with the treasury secretary. From the economy and rates to housing finance, lot to talk about with the plans over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as well, Steven Mnuchin, my special guest on Monday.Meanwhile, Hurricane Dorian is churning off the North Carolina coast to heavy rainy and heavy winds leaving thousands without power.Jeff Flock has been doing great work. He is live this morning in South Carolina with the very latest -- Jeff.JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: In Mount Pleasant, South Carolina just north of Charleston. Just wanted to show you. You know, yesterday flooding all the way through the marshes here. And now look at this. It's even lower than when we started. That's characteristic after a hurricane.But first where is Dorian right now? Well, if you take a look at the maps, Dorian is up along the Outer Banks, lashing the Outer Banks right now in a similar fashion that last year.The weather wonks among us wondering are we going to get a landfall up there. At this point we don't know. The National Hurricane Center calls that. That's when the center of circulation, the dead center comes over land -- hasn't done that yet, may not do that.Big flooding here along the South Carolina coast yesterday, some pictures perhaps that show just how bad it was in Charleston, South Carolina.Also, tornadoes spawned. And up in North Carolina now, when you get that interaction with the eye wall and the land, that's what spins up tornadoes, it causes friction. That may be a problem here as well. We had several yesterday. May have some more today.The storm that will not go away -- Maria, called Dorian.BARTIROMO: Yes. All right. Thank you so much. Jeff Flock, live this morning.Coming up, Hong Kong bracing for another weekend of protesters, democracy advocate Jimmy Lai will join me live coming up from Hong Kong to give us a status check.Then Walmart versus Target -- why Target is seeing a boost in sales. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Robert Mugabe, the long-time leader of Zimbabwe has died.Lauren Simonetti with the headlines now -- Lauren.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Mugabe died in Singapore, Maria, where he had been receiving frequent medical attention. He was a former guerilla chief who took power after the end of white minority rule back in 1980. He was forced to resign in 2017 by a military coup after leading Zimbabwe to the brink of economic ruin. Robert Mugabe, dead at 95.Tyson Foods is fishing for a new source of profit. The meat company investing in a start-up called New Wave Foods that makes plant-based shrimp. Fake shrimp could be ready for market next year but it remains to be seen if customers will bite at the opportunity.If you are flying out of New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport anytime soon, bring an extra book, charge your phone. The airport is ranked as the worst in the country for having the highest share of flights delayed or canceled. Only 64 percent of flights that departed Newark between June and July left on time.Other airports making the top five list, from a company called Air Help, are Chicago's O'Hare, New York's LaGuardia, Denver International and Dallas/Fort Worth International. Now you know.Target is causing a big sensation with a small concept. That's right. It's mini stores are taking off, very popular, helping the company blow past earnings estimates recently. New data from placer.ai shows the mini stores have given Target an edge over Walmart when it comes to attracting customers, earning more than $100,000 a year. And that's because the retailer is placing the stores in higher earning neighborhoods.Target has 100 of these small stores with plans to open more. Take a look at shares -- up 64 percent this year. I just went into the small Target by Penn Station. It's perfect. It's all you need, in and out, one, two, three.BARTIROMO: Cheryl who is having way too much fun in Hawaii -- a week ago said -- she loves Target. It's so funny. And then we have these great numbers. I'm like she's the new indicator in terms of where to shop.SIMONETTI: It's not the only target, all right.Let's see if she won in Hawaii. We'll ask her on Monday.BARTIROMO: Thanks Lauren.Taking a look at Lululemon meanwhile expectations. The stock is up this morning in the pre-market. Up better than 5 percent move. Giving a positive sales and profit outlook for the current quarter after exceeding current expectations -- That's one to watch this morning with the 5 percent move on Lululemon.Coming up Hong Kong unrest. The city braces for yet another weekend of protests despite the withdrawal of the controversial extradition bill.I'll be speaking with Hong Kong tech tycoon and democracy advocate Jimmy Lai straight ahead.Then the global effects of technology, a new study by IBM funds millions of workers around the world will need to be reskilled because of artificial intelligence. The step by step strategy to close the skills gap. Coming up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.We're focused on jobs in America this morning. A new study from IBM's Institute for Business Value finds that 120 million workers across the world will need retraining in the next three years because of artificial intelligence and intelligent automation.Joining us right now is IBM's chief human resources officer, Diane Gherson. Great to see you -- Diane. Thanks so much for being here.DIANE GHERSON, CHIEF HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICER, IBM: Thank you.BARTIROMO: So tell us about the report that IBM is out with this morning on workers.GHERSON: Well look, the report covered about 5,000 different executives and different countries, in companies around the world. And what it found was last time we studied it the top two skills that people were looking for were computer science skills, software skills and then STEM skills. That's dropped now to like number six and number eight.And what's happened is companies are starting to realize we actually need soft skills too. And those are the ones who are the most in demand. We need a combination. Now we have more hybrid skills.And so that was the big finding I think from the study.BARTIROMO: You know, one of the people who we've spoken with is Kai-fu Lee, former president of Google China. He says as a result of AI, machines are going to replace 40 percent of jobs in the next decade. That's a scary number.GHERSON: You know, all jobs are going to change. There are new jobs being created all the time because of AI. So it's not clear. I think there are many studies that would suggest that it's not going to be quite that big. But I think the key is every job is going to change.LONSKI: You know, looking at my own field, I can't help but mention that artificial intelligence has not done a very good job of predicting where the economy is going or what's going to happen in financial markets because I don't know of one AI program or technique that predicted that the Fed's next move late last year would be to cut rates.There's a lot of question marks as far as how far you can take AI at this point in time. How many jobs might be lost to it. But that's not saying that economists did a better job than AI did at predicting what's happening in the market.GHERSON: Right, right.The economists' legacy is (INAUDIBLE) nothing so great.BARTIROMO: Well, I mean the AI machines are, you know powered machines are expected to take the job, the things that are reliant on data. So you know, you've got a lot of data like, you know gauging your eligibility for a mortgage even reading the mammography, a radiology report.These are some of the things that some people say a machine could do faster and more effective. So you've got a list of reminders that are needed for 2018 in your new study. Go through some of those skills that people need so the Fed cannot just survive but thrive in this new normal of new text.GHERSON: Well, certainly data analysis is really important. data, science and that, you know I think so many people in their jobs are moving data around. Evaluating data there. They're moving from one spread to another.There are so many jobs, they're doing that and that is going away without emission right. So Joanie -- what's your take on this. He's got flexibility. Adaptable to change, ability to prioritize time management.These are the skills that IBM says you need.COURTNEY: Yes. And I think one of the things that we're seeing because we do a lot of employment staffing in logistics and manufacturing -- is one of the most important skills to have is that ability to learn because to your point, the jobs are changing so much, so even in manufacturing or logistics or warehouse, you know a forklift driver, they need to be able to work with --BARTIROMO: Yes. But you said manufacturing. It's the white collar jobs that are under attack in my view, in the near term, because of AI. You're talking about white collar jobs like getting a mortgage, like reading a mammography, but the things that machines are doing so effectively.GHERSON: But all jobs are --BARTIROMO: Ok. All jobs -- fine.GHERSON: All jobs are changing, not all lies. I mean even the blue collar jobs are really changing. They need to work with robots in the warehouses and so it really is every single job. So those skills and the ability to learn and be open to embracing new skills --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's right, that's right.GHERSON: It's so important.COURTNEY: They call it learning agility or mental fluidity, that has become really important. I think in the more industrial age, consistent was a No. You learn the rules you knew who to do things.GHERSON: Now what were saying is actually I want you to be open to new ideas. And adapt on the fly. That's a whole different side of important of softskill.BARTIROMO: Yes. Really good stuff. Diane -- thanks very much.GHERSON: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Good to see you. Diane Gherson -- HR at IBM.Stay with us, our special jobs in America coverage begins this morning at 8:00 a.m. Eastern. Coming up, Hong Kong unrest, the region bracing for yet another weekend of protests.

Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Friday, September 6th. Your top stories right now 7:31 a.m. on the East Coast.It is jobs Friday today, the August jobs report is due out in an hour from now. We are expecting 158,000 jobs created in the month of August with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.7 percent. Our special coverage of jobs begins at the top of the next hour, 8:00 a.m. Eastern.Meanwhile, going into the report we've got a pretty good rally underway. Take a look, we're at the highs of the morning right here, Futures indicating a gain of about a hundred points right out of the gate for the Dow Industrials, a third of a percent. S&P Futures up 10-1/2 and the NASDAQ Futures higher by 22.This on top of yesterday's big rally. The major indices finished up across the board largely due to U.S. and Chinese officials confirming that a fresh round of face-to-face trade talks will happen in early October. Dow Industrials were up 372 points yesterday. Check out the NASDAQ, it was up 140 points, one and three quarters percent.European Indices this morning not so strong. Take a look, FT-100 down 5- 1/4. CAC Quarante is now positive but just by four points and the DAX Index in Germany is up 63 points. Now we did get German industrial production out this morning, it was down in the month of July as Eurozone growth fell by 50 percent in the second quarter. The latest signs of slowing economic growth in Europe, the Eurozone having a hard time generating any growth.Asian markets this morning look like this. At the close, the Hang Seng Index was up two-thirds of a percent. The Shanghai Composite in China up half a percent. China cut the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves. That is a form of stimulus. It injected liquidity into the economy facing a slowdown.There is more Hong Kong chaos to report, more protests are planned for this weekend despite the withdrawal of that controversial extradition bill. This as Fitch has downgraded Hong Kong due to the continued unrest. Hong Kong tech tycoon and democracy advocate Jimmy Lai will join me in moments live from Hong Kong.Under the microscope, state attorneys general formally launching an anti- trust probe into big tech companies Facebook and Google. Their major concerns over user data, coming up.And then, 100 years in the making, the NFL's golden season kicks off with an old rivalry, the highlights coming up.All those stories coming up this Friday morning, but first, our top story this half an hour, unrest in Hong Kong. Take a look at the pictures from Sunday. The region bracing for yet another weekend of protests, despite the withdrawal of the controversial extradition bill that sparked demonstrations months ago. Earlier this week, my next guest's home was fire bombed.Joining me right now is Hong Kong tech tycoon Next Digital founder and democracy advocate, Jimmy Lai. And Jimmy, it is great to have you back here. Thanks very much for joining us.JIMMY LAI, FOUNDER, NEXT DIGITAL: Thank you, Maria, for having me.BARTIROMO: First, let me ask you about your personal story because your home was fire bombed. Are you OK? What happened? Is your family OK?LAI: Everything's OK. It was very small nuisance that we are already getting used to. You know, it's very, very small thing.BARTIROMO: It's a small thing but it feels like because you're out in front on the front lines of this, these protesters, now you've become a target. Is that -- do you believe you are a target now of the Chinese government?LAI: I don't think -- you know, it's directed by the Chinese government. I think there's some -- you know, some folks that try to appease the Chinese government or the Chinese -- the Chinese office here. So you know, some rich people give them some money to do these stupid things. I don't think that's directed from the Chinese government, no.BARTIROMO: So tell me what's happening today in Hong Kong and your reaction to the extradition bill being formally withdrawn by the leader of Hong Kong, Carrie Lam?LAI: I think the withdrawal is you know, too little too late -- too little too late. You know, Hong Kong has changed. You know, we have -- you know, we have occur you know, a lot of damage. You know, Hong Kong is totally damaged. And we have over a thousand young people arrest. We have seven lives languish. You know, we have a lot of people get hurt and broken bones and -- you know, and all that has done and now she just threw out the withdrawal. No, it's not going to have any effect. I think the resistance will go on undoubtedly.BARTIROMO: So why will the resistance go on? Tell us what the people on the ground, including yourself want. I know that one issue is the fact that universal suffrage is something you've spoken about a lot. You want to be able to elect your own leadership for Hong Kong.LAI: Well, I -- you know, I think that's the only thing we look for, because after the three-month confrontation with the government, we know that the Beijing government is not going to give us any room for freedom. You know, it's going to try to take away our freedom, our rule of law, the way of life that we have had and the only way we can do is to go on and persist, to fight for it. Or whether we can -- we can win and eventually get a universal suffrage, we don't know.But what we know is, if we don't -- if we don't fight, we will lose all we have and we will lose the freedom, the rule of law, the way of life, all that we have. We have no way but to fight.BARTIROMO: And this is important not just for the people of Hong Kong. The reason why we focus on it, really put a spotlight on it, because Hong Kong is seen by the world as an international finance hub, democracy, freedom. The idea that you can go take your company public and live by the values and be free and live by the values of the west that you've seen for the last-- for the last 20 something years.LAI: Exactly.BARTIROMO: That's why you're seeing so many young people in the streets, like they're afraid of their future.LAI: Right, definitely. Because we share the value with America, with the west, what we are fighting is the first battle of the new cold war that is going to -- is between the west and the China, it's going to be a long war. But we are fighting the first battle of this new cold war. We are fighting your battle here. Please help us.BARTIROMO: Well, you want help from -- you came on my show first about a month ago to make an appeal to the U.S. to say stand with Hong Kong.LAI: Right.BARTIROMO: Do you feel that the world is standing with you? What are you looking for people to do to help you as you just said?LAI: Well, just politically and morally support us. I think that's very important. I think the world is turning -- you know, turning their eyes to us, you know, and every day the headlines in the world is our best safeguard. You know, there's a boat vest protection for us.I think you know, the U.S., you know, your administration, even President Trump has -- you know, has -- you know, always expressed support for us and which is very good. We are very encouraged with the support, with the international support especially from the U.S., our fight will go on.BARTIROMO: Well, look, German chance --LAI: And we will win.BARTIROMO: Yes, German Chancellor Angela Merkel is visiting Beijing this week, Jimmy. She called for a peaceful solution in Hong Kong during a meeting with the Chinese premier. However, she did not meet with any activists. Is Germany showing that kind of support?LAI: Well, the activists -- well, if she needs to -- she has to meet that activists, she has to come here. Because, you know, this movement's activists is not in China.BARTIROMO: Right. And you know, I mean, the world looks at Hong Kong as a certain place, but when the handoff happened there was a promise to give Hong Kong autonomy for 50 years. You've got 28 years left.LAI: Right.BARTIROMO: Fitch has just downgraded its rating on Hong Kong standing as an issuer of long term foreign currency debt for the first time since 1995, Hong Kong was downgraded to AA from a AA+ rating and Fitch says that the recent protests are raising doubts about the region's governance.So tell us where this could go if this continues, if the -- if the autonomy continues to be threatened by the Chinese government and when did this change? Was it when China decided it wanted to have a dictator for a life or when do you think this actually started to change?LAI: Well, it has changed since -- you know, since a long time ago. I think since the last or maybe 20 years. But it changed rapidly since the ascensions, the ascendance of Xi Jinping. You know, in the last few years, you know, change a lot, we feel the encroachment on our freedom. You know, encroachment on our rule of law and the human right. You know, we feel that.If this is not going to stop, if we don't fight and stop this encroachment, I think Hong Kong is finished. Because without the rule of law, we won't have the financial center status and we -- you know, we will lose everything we have.BARTIROMO: Well, it is a battle of values. It's a battle over governance. You know, you've got a communist dictatorship in China. You say the questions over autonomy started with the ascension of Xi Jinping. And he is going to be in power for life, he's a dictator for life.LAI: Well, I don't think he will be in power for life. His procedure is very peccaries because he concentrate all the power himself. Also, that means he concentrate all the accountability on himself. Now he's in big trouble. You know, the economy is in big trouble. And his own party's power (INAUDIBLE) is very severe.You know, a lot of people now has lost jobs. The young people who graduate could not find jobs the most. The social mobility is going to stop. And one thing is very important is Xi Jinping is the most excellent dictator of the human history because of the electronic device control of recognized people's face where you go, where have you bought, who are you with, what have you talked. You know, all that, if you do something wrong, they don't allow you to open a bank account, they don't allow you to buy an air ticket, a train ticket. They don't allow you into the public places. All that suppression is unprecedented. People never had such a suppression on them.And this has create discernments and resistance, they'll now suppressed. If the economy goes down and trigger that emotion can explode, that would be big problem for China.BARTIROMO: Yes, this is a really important point that you're making because China has used facial recognition technology in an unprecedented way states sponsored facial recognition.LAI: Exactly.BARTIROMO: So they know who's at those rallies and whatever you do you'll get a score at the end of the year, that score will tell you if you can take a train ride. If you're smoking too much, you get a bad score.Jimmy, are you -- very quickly here Jimmy, we're going to jump. But are you afraid for your own life after what you've just said in this interview, are you afraid of getting -- being the target?LAI: No, I'm not thinking about this. If I think about this, I would let fear frighten me. That's what the Chinese communists want. I don't think about the consequences, I just -- I just think what's right to do and now is the ethical time for us to do something great.BARTIROMO: OK.LAI: And I think something great is going to happen.BARTIROMO: Jimmy Lai fighting the good fight, we are watching you on from across the world, thank you so much. And good evening to you.LAI: Thank you so much for having me.BARTIROMO: It is 7:43 in the evening in Hong Kong. Jimmy Lai, thank you so much coming to us live.Coming up, love on Facebook. The social media giant embraces an online dating app. The privacy concerns there. And more on facial recognition, coming up.Plus, jobs in America, August employment numbers are out in under an hour. Our special coverage begins in 15 minutes' time. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Facebook looking to rev up your love life, launching its Facebook dating app. Deirdre Bolton takes a look for us this morning.DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: So it sounds easy enough. But we just have to remember, Facebook has had scandal after scandal about how they manage their data. I mean, we recall earlier this summer where the company has to pay $5 billion, a slap on the wrist and a drop in the bucket honestly for Facebook for how it handled that whole Cambridge Analytica.But I digress, let's focus on Facebook dating. We are the 20th country where it is rolling out. So 19 before us. Dare I say, they tried it in a little bit more of experimental ways, Colombia, Canada, Thailand. So we're number 20 on the list.Here it comes. It is free. And then if we of course don't remember what Facebook already has, for most of us, a ton of information about us. But they do promise not to suggest to friends that you're already connected to.However, if somebody has expressed interest in you, you will be notified about that. But essentially they're not going to plague you by suggesting, you know, your neighbors.The other thing they're trying to advertise is that if you have an interest -- for example, if you're a dog lover you can filter your matches by something called dog spotting, you know, so that in theory you're going to get a few basic characteristics in common.BARTIROMO: Are they going to release information about --BOLTON: You have to opt in.BARTIROMO: OK.BOLTON: So they're trying. And they got two billion users. And I should say, the stock is absolutely 45-1/2 percent, the best performing fang year- to-date, S&P 500 as we know up around 18-1/2 percent. So love them or hate them, the stock is performing very well. They're -- you know, they're trying to take on Tinder and Bumble, and be young and hip and cool. Integrate Instagram a little bit more to keep the young ins.BARTIROMO: What do you think, John?LONSKI: Well, you know, I don't care about the safeguards but if you're married do not use this application. Now, this is a warning.COURTNEY: Good advice, John.BOLTON: John, honestly that sounds like Jonny (INAUDIBLE) come on, John, what are you doing up here? Don't smoke in bed.LONSKI: But you know what? It makes so much sense that Facebook would get into this space. I mean, I think they're looking for -- they've been looking at, you know, jobs, right, and --BOLTON: Yes, they have to be relevant for the next generation. But the worst thing people say about them is that the grannies are you know, hook - - sort of suggesting that you look at their grandkids. They need an image makeover and I think this is one step, at least Facebook is hoping in the right direction.BARTIROMO: What's that feature, secret crush?BOLTON: Oh, that's -- yes, you can express a secret crush and then it's sort of mutually, but they say the other person has to be opted in for that person to receive your message of a secret crush.BARTIROMO: The secret crush, OK. Deirdre, thank you. We'll be watching this one. Deirdre Bolton.Coming up, the NFL's 100th season kicks off with its oldest rivalry, all the highlights from across -- from the Packers, Bears face off, next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The NFL kicking off its 100th season. Rivals Green Bay and Chicago go head to head. Jared Max with the highlights now. Jared, Good morning.JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Good morning, Maria. The NFL with the centennial season kickoff a matchup between teams that first met in 1921. The Bears at home against the Green Bay Packers and kind of a snooze fest. (INAUDIBLE) far from (INAUDIBLE) only one touchdown in the game. Aaron Rodgers who sat out the entire preseason would connect for a short touchdown with Jimmy Graham in the second quarter. Rogers threw for 203 yards. And it was a late game interception by former Bears safety Adrian Amos that sealed the win for Green Bay. The final was 10-7. First time since 1932 Packers beat the Bears on the road scoring so few points.Monday night the Raiders will host the Denver Broncos. But don't expect to see new Raiders receiver Antonio Brown on the field. The Raiders reportedly plan to suspend Brown and word is they may try to void over $30 million in his guaranteed contract. Why? Well, aside from missing most of training camp with frost bit in feet, and then not agreeing to wear a league sanctioned helmet.Brown is reported to have shouted at the Raiders general manager, Mike Mayock at practice Wednesday to threatened to punch him in the face some say. Brown kept out of practice. Yesterday, Coach Jon Gruden, are you having fun with A.B. yet?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JON GRUDEN, COACH, RAIDERS: I'm emotional about it. I hope you -- I hope you understand why. I think a lot of this guy. I think Antonio is a great receiver and I think deep down he's a really good guy. So I'm frustrated. I'm not going to say any more about it. I hope it all works out.(END VIDEO CLIP)MAX: Deep down he's a really good guy. Well, Sunday, football fans, we have a great lineup in the early games. Vikings hosting the Falcons, the Redskins are at the Eagles, the defending NFC champion Rams visit the Panthers and of the late games, Ezekiel Elliott back with the Cowboys at home against the Giants. The Lions will be in Arizona and the Buccaneers host the 49ers.Maria, the 100th NFL season is under way.

S&P is up 12 and the NASDAQ up 25 points a third of a percent.This on top of yesterday's big rally, the major indices finished up across the board, largely due to the U.S. and Chinese officials confirming a fresh round of face-to-face trade talks are now set for --Load-Date: September 7, 2019End of Document

EDGE OF A NEW EPOCHStates News ServiceSeptember 12, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 5448 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS):Bob Schieffer: I'm Bob Schieffer.Andrew Schwartz: And I'm Andrew Schwartz of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and this is The Truth of the Matter.Bob Schieffer: This is the podcast where we break down the policy issues of the day. Since the politicians are having their say, we will excuse them with respect and bring in the experts, many of them from the CSIS, people who have been working these issues for years.Andrew Schwartz: No spin, no bombast, no finger pointing. Just informed discussion.Bob Schieffer: To get to the truth of the matter on this episode, we'll talk with one of Washington's true wise men, a former Deputy Secretary of Defense and now CSIS' CEO, John Hamre. Dr. Hamre, thank you for joining us on this inaugural broadcast of The Truth of the Matter.Andrew Schwartz: It's always good to have the boss on the first episode.Bob Schieffer: So what I want to start with you is, is the question, what do you see as the most important issues today?John Hamre: Well, I'm limited because of my own personal background and interest about foreign policy and defense policy, but it's my view that we're at a profound pivot point in American history. We've only had five historical epochs of foreign policy in American history. I think we're on the edge of a new one. The last epoch was the Cold War period, and it was as great competition between Western liberal democracies, and authoritarian, in this case, communist states, authoritarian governments. We prevailed over that through luck and having chosen the right values, I think, for society, I think the last 30 years have been anomalous. I don't think the last 30 years were representative. I think it was just to kind of the momentum of the Cold War, but I think we're now on the edge of this brand new one, and the question is, "Does America want to be an international leader, or are we getting tired of it?"John Hamre: You know, there's a very strong theme in America that we've paid too high a price. We were the suckers. We did this global good, common good for everyone by providing an international environment, and we paid the price nobody else did. That's a very common theme that you're hearing now, and we could be on the edge of the more traditional pattern of American foreign policy, which is to pull back into kind of our own world. We did that from 1820 until 1898. That was a period of where we just pulled back. We weren't interested in the outside world. Then from 1920 until 1941, we pulled out. There was a period of isolationism, and are we coming back to that? And what kind of a world does that mean for us? That's what I'm quite concerned about, because I think that's a profoundly different world. I think the problems, every problem in the world today is horizontal and all the governments are vertical.John Hamre: So how do you solve a complex problem when you wait for it to show up on your shore? Ebola is a good example. We didn't do anything about the Ebola crisis in Africa until somebody brought it back to the United States, and then we went crazy. We need to be thinking in different ways, but I don't know that America and America's politicians are thinking about it this way. I think there's a hunkering down and a quest for simplicity in a world that's even more complicated than it's ever been.Bob Schieffer: I've heard people say in the past that in times when there is a foreign threat to the United States, Americans pay attention to foreign issues and news coming in from other places, but when that foreign threat seems to go away, we turn inward, and that's when we have these periods of sort of isolationism, as it were, and after the Soviet Union came apart, of course, we began looking inward more than we had before. But now it seems to me the world has changed since then. China is a rising power. I hear some say that the most important issue facing this country is managing the China relationship, and how do we do that now?John Hamre: I think there's a lot of truth to what you said. We have tended to have outside threats that have shaped our foreign policy, and I think right now there is a great debate going on: "Is China a great threat?" And there are very strong voices in America that want to make it the next Soviet Union. I think that's misreading history. I don't think there's a question that China is feeling more confident, and is getting stronger, and is trying to prepare international institutions that are more favorable to their interests. Part of that's our fault. I mean, we did not choose to modernize, for example, the international financial institutions, so if you look at the international financial system, the world bank, the IMF, et cetera, they're dominated by us and the Europeans. Well, 60% of the global GDP is now in Asia, so we've got a mismatch between the global structure that we created and today's reality.John Hamre: I'm not surprised that China wants to find a way to have a stronger voice, and it should if we're going to do that, but there are other people in town that view this that China's the great threat, we're going to be fighting World War III, and we shouldn't be helping them get ready. And I think that's going to be a battle for us, and we don't have clear voices on this in the United States these days.Andrew Schwartz: Are we in an era of strategic competition with China?John Hamre: Well, yes. We are, and I think we should properly define it. It's partly economic, but very much it's a political competition. I mean, our form of government, the government is meant to be a balancer between the rights and privileges of individuals versus the needs of society, and we're always balancing back and forth trying to get that roughly right. And we'll get in the middle of great debates, and it takes us a while to get that sorted out. Civil rights took many years. Some say it's even going on now. Certainly the whole question of how we treat transgender people in America is a very contentious issue, but the government is trying to basically find that balance between what individuals want and what society needs.John Hamre: But in an authoritarian government, China, a small group of people ... Now, it's 80 million, you know, the Communist Party-Andrew Schwartz: Communist Party members.John Hamre: The smaller group of people are deciding what to impose on both, on both individuals and on society. That's the real competition between us in my view. It's not just this economic competition. Now, it has economic dimensions, but the real issue is, do we understand the significance of this competition that we're in now? This larger sense of, "How do society and people and liberty get connected?"Andrew Schwartz: Dr. Hamre, our strategic engagement with China, and with all of Asia really that we've engaged with over the past several decades, since the end of World War II, has been based on economic prosperity for them and for us. And that's kept the peace for the most part, but now things seem to be shifting a bit, and there seems to be a bit of parallel competition between us and China in terms of economy, in terms of security. What do you think about this, and where do you think it's headed?John Hamre: Well, it was an anomaly of history that the biggest power in Asia was not an Asian country at the end of World War II. It left us in that role, and we initially tried to create something like a NATO. You know, it didn't work. There are just too many unique historical dimensions in Asia.Andrew Schwartz: There was no Alliance. We protected-John Hamre: No. It was-Andrew Schwartz: We defeated and then protected Japan.John Hamre: And the rivalries between Japan and Korea, between Japan and others, China, et cetera, were too complicated to put into a treaty structure. So what we did instead was to enter into a series of reassuring partnerships with everybody in the region, some formal alliances and some informal partnerships, but our goal was to make sure that it was an environment free of intimidation so that everybody could prosper. And we had a much more mature view about how to deal with China.John Hamre: We never tried to create a containment strategy for China. Our strategy was just the reverse. Engage China in every possible way, bring them into the international system. They'll realize what a mistake they made by embracing communism, and they'll become like us. Well, now we're starting to realize that isn't true.Andrew Schwartz: It didn't work.John Hamre: It certainly has prospered everyone by having them becoming part of international economic orders. It was good for us, but we're now realizing they have honest, legitimate but challenging national interests, and they've got their set of hotheads that are defining that we're the problem, and now we're in that, "How are we going to manage two great complex countries that have a lot of scratchy tension points?" But I can't imagine that it's going to be good for either of us if this turns into war.Bob Schieffer: which brings me to the places where they are confronting us. The South China Sea, for example, where you have these artificial islands being built out there, and then China is saying, "This belongs to us." There's no question they're also stealing our technology and have been for a long time, and there are human rights issues. This whole face recognition, the technology advances we're seeing now. How do we handle those things?John Hamre: Each one of them is a very profound problem, and each one of them will have to have a well-crafted strategy to deal with it. I think one of the most difficult problems is the way that China is using advanced technology, face recognition, artificial intelligence, to create an efficient police state, to control everything and everybody, this surveillance state, and of course this just gets fundamentally to the difference between our system, our form of government, and theirs. You know, they're intimidated and threatened by individuals with free thinking. We think it's our responsibility to give space for people like that and to help them prosper. So we have fundamentally different perspectives on this.John Hamre: I think the only thing to do is to call it out, show it for what it is. I personally think that are an enormous number of talented young Chinese that are not going to want to have their lives governed by some third tier security goon in the public safety commission that's going to decide whether they get to a college education or not. I just can't believe that this remarkably talented group of people are going to put up with that. So we ought to call that out. I mean, I think we ought to be [crosstalk 00:11:42].Andrew Schwartz: Especially if they're-John Hamre: Like the Uygurs is the case right now where this is a big deal.Andrew Schwartz: The Uygurs who are the ethnic minority in China?John Hamre: Ethnic minority, Western China. They feel that their culture is being completely destroyed. By the way, China they did have some serious domestic unrest 10 years ago, but the solution is, is, "We're going to erase the distinctiveness of their culture." And obviously people feel threatened by that and want to fight back.Andrew Schwartz: And Uygurs can't walk two feet without being under surveillance where they are.John Hamre: On the South China Sea, it's ... Look, this went to the International Court of Law of the Sea Tribunal, and a uniform ruling against China, and China said, "To hell with it." Well, that's not something that we can accept, and I think we should be standing up for those that have legitimate territorial claims in a process that we helped to establish. It's one of the great shames that America's never ratified the Law of the Sea. I mean, because of wacky domestic American politics, but it is in our interest to see normal procedures to handle what's right now a lawless place. The open seas are a lawless place. There's illegal fishing. There's illegal trafficking of-PART 1 OF 3 ENDS [00:13:04]John Hamre: There's illegal fishing. There's illegal trafficking of people. There's illegal abuse of natural resources. This isn't collectively in our interest. Again, it comes back how is America going to be involved in this next phase? Are we going to be an international leader or are we going to retreat? I think that becomes the big challenge.Bob Schieffer: Well, as someone said, we're seeing two ideas here. China is building roads and bridges all over Asia. We're building a wall.John Hamre: Yeah, and lots of sports stadiums inside our wall so we can ... We're becoming a recreational society, and they're making strategic investments in their future. There's a real challenge, and we really do have to look honestly and hard at ourselves, at our own priorities. Are we still willing to sacrifice for big things? That's a real question, I think, in America these days.Andrew Schwartz: Are we really competing with China if we're not building roads and bridges and infrastructure all over the world? How are we competing if we're only building stadiums inside our own borders?John Hamre: Right. I mean I think we compete effectively in other ways. I think we compete with the nobility of ideas that are good for everybody. I mean when you hold out, as a premise of your society, that it's the responsibility of government to provide everybody's human potential to be realized, being open about society, remove the barriers to personal progress, that's been our history, and that's why I think the rest of the world embraced much of our leadership in 1947, '48 because of that.John Hamre: But in, well, the last 10 years, a lot of people have questioned whether we have double standards, that things that we condemn others for we say, "Well, but that, we have a reason why we have to do that." I thought that was the tragedy of Guantanamo and of Abu Ghraib. We basically said, "These guys are so bad, we're going to bend our own values to deal with it." Well, ultimately, that was very corrosive. It led lots of people in the world to conclude that we were hypocritical about the values that we espoused. I think we need to return to those values.Bob Schieffer: Let me ask you about this whole situation with Huawei and whether we ought to be a part of it. Explain to us exactly what this company is, what they offer, and what are the issues here?John Hamre: Well, I think it's like those Russian dolls. There's one inside another inside another. First of all, Huawei is a hugely successful private company in China, but we have to understand that private companies are not private in China the way they are in the United States. Huawei enjoys the status of being a flag bearer for China, so it enjoys great privileges. It doesn't have to go to competitive finance markets to get money. It can go to the government. It receives intelligence support. So the government knows exactly when they go in ... when Huawei goes into a negotiation, their intelligence service is telling them exactly what the other guys is thinking and going to do. Huawei enjoys access to technology that has been stolen by Chinese intelligence sources. So it's not a level playing field.John Hamre: If you are comparing a Huawei against a Siemens or an Erickson. Companies that are Western companies, they have to develop sophisticated technology, but they do it inside rules that we establish where we simply create a fair marketplace and they have to with their own imagination decide what to build and how to be successful at it. And this is a different model. Now, the most inner element of dispute about Huawei is that because Huawei has benefited so much from Chinese government technology support and that it is a Chinese government entity it will spy on everybody else in the world for China. It provides hardware that on which the fifth generation of internet technology operates. So that means that they can sit there and say, "Well I like that piece of message, I'm going to send that, a copy of that over to my friends in Beijing." That's sort of a concern and I think that is a legitimate concern.John Hamre: We do know of connections between Huawei and the Chinese intelligence services. And in many ways that's the core of it the dispute. But there's a much larger issue which is this is an example of the great competition that's coming. China wants to dominate 10 major technologies in the future and they'll pick one company and they'll put all of the resources of the government behind that one company so that it can win. In the West we don't pick companies to win. We say we're going to ensure that the markets are fair, we're going to give tax subsidies for research maybe, but you decide what you're going to invest in and it's up to you. We don't have a Huawei competitor in the United States. The closest thing to a Huawei competitor is Samsung, a Korean company and Erickson, a little bit different degree. But that's because our companies have decided they don't want to be the aggregator of the full product, they are going to be making components and big elements of Huawei's system is actually American technology.John Hamre: So we have an immediate issue which is Huawei as an agent of espionage. That's one issue. I think we have a larger question and that is how do free enterprise societies like ours compete against state enterprise countries and this is a state enterprise effort with all of the resources of the government put behind one company and we're saying, how do we establish fair ground rules for that one company to compete in our markets? We can't compete in China because they preclude that. Do we let Huawei into our markets and under what terms? That's the debate that we're having.Bob Schieffer: And basically the president at this point has said he does not want American companies to deal with Huawei. Is that?John Hamre: Two things. For several years we've been blocking Huawei from selling things in the United States. Although there's a fair number of smaller internet exchanges around the country that have Huawei equipment because it was cheap. The advantage is that their products have been fairly cheap. Well that's because they don't have to pay for the cost of money. For example, they don't have to worry about a research department because they've got the government helping them with that. So they've-Bob Schieffer: And they stole the intellectual property.John Hamre: And they stole a lot of the intellectual property. In their own right they've been a creative company. But what the president most recently did was he said, "We're not going to let Huawei have access to our technology." And right now Huawei's 5G technology does depend rather extensively on American technology. So this is really a blocking action that would be very hard for Huawei. Now what they'll do is they will start investing in to have that capability organic in to China. So this strategy of blocking them is a temporary success. It will not be a permanent success. It's just what happened for example, on space launches. 15 years ago we blocked any American company from participating with China on space launch and it led China to develop the most successful space launch booster in the country or in the world this day. So I mean we have to think about this dynamically, not just as a standoff, a onetime standoff.Bob Schieffer: If we use their equipment and so forth, won't they find a way to get a back door into that equipment? So they'll know what's happening in our national grid. They'll know what's happening and everything.John Hamre: Yes. That's the threat, that's absolutely the threat. But there are other ways that they are conducting espionage to get into our networks as well. So it is a very real issue. I really do think it has to be treated as a national security issue. Do I think that it solves our vulnerability, our cyber vulnerability? Not at all. It's a big piece, but it does not solve it.Andrew Schwartz: Dr. Hamre, let me ask you this a little bit of a different way. What is it that we're actually competing for with China and if we're competing with them, what's the desired outcome? What's the plausible desired outcome of this competition?John Hamre: This is again not unlike what we confronted in 1946, '47, '48. At that time, the Soviet Union was putting forward a view of the world under communist principles. But again, as an authoritarian government, the government small group of elites would dictate the future of your life, my life, society's wellbeing. I mean small group, authoritarian government. And we thought that was dangerous for us and we held out a vision for a fairly open world of a rule of law, due process, transparency and accountability, a free press. The kind of world that we have enjoyed and we felt was going to be favorable for everybody else in the world. Who are we competing against?John Hamre: Because remember this was also occurring at a time when the European empires collapsed and all of a sudden within a narrow period of about five years, there were 80 new countries on the world stage that previously had been colonies and now they were going to become independent free countries in the international order and the question is who got their loyalty? Were they going to be loyal to an authoritarian mobilization world. Were they going to be loyal to a liberal international, democratic world.John Hamre: That was the competition that we had with them. And I think that the strategy to create things like the World Bank, the IMF, the United Nations, which was crucial for that, it gave them a place to be in the world. What it was the long-term based on the values that we cherish. That was a great strategy at the time. So how are we competing now? Who are we competing with now? Either we're competing for the future of countries in Africa, South America, in the Middle East. I don't think there's any question that China is preparing the foundations for a competing international economic order. I think they are.John Hamre: They're not rejecting the opportunities that we'll give them and insist that we dominate, but the world that we created, the Bretton Woods world is still dominated by us in the Europeans. We haven't really opened it up adequately, but so we have these two worlds that are emerging and I think we're going to be competing to say where does the rest of the world want to affiliate? Do they want to affiliate with a state capitalism authoritarian mobilization model or do they want to affiliate with a democratic rule of law free enterprise model? That's I think the stakes.Bob Schieffer: What do you see as the most serious danger point in the world today? Would it be North Korea?John Hamre: I don't think so. I think that North Korea is a country that has so few real capabilities, but they are genius at intimidating neighbors. They know that if they were to use nuclear weapons in any sense, it would end their civilization. I think they know that. So it is a criminal family that's controlling a country. And the question is how do they transition? I think they are so proud ethnically, they don't want to be a province of China. So they want to have their independence. The question is can we manage the future in a way where the two Koreas come together in some predictable but-PART 2 OF 3 ENDS [00:26:04]John Hamre: -gather in some predictable but safe way. I think that's where we're struggling with right now. These are going to continue to do provocative things, but I don't think ultimately, they'll be profoundly dangerous to us.Bob Schieffer: And what about Iran?John Hamre: My own personal view is that, and I know this will be controversial, I think we overstate the threat of Iran. Iran has an economy the size of Maryland, the State of Maryland. It's a deeply fractured society, deep, deep ethnic divisions in society. Profound alienation of the young people who don't see a future for themselves in a society where the mullahs and their patronage networks have closed off opportunity. Iran is traditional military sense, fairly weak, but they are extraordinarily clever at giving themselves flexibility into the future. And they take advantage of that. They've unhinged much of upper Mesopotamia because we go into Iraq and we overthrow Saddam and they see opportunities everywhere and they're very good at that.John Hamre: Do they offer a model to the world that everybody else wants? No. Do they offer technology to the world that everybody wants? No. Do they offer a unique manufactured goods that everybody's craving to buy? No. I think we overstate the threat of Iran. We haven't managed Iran well. So I think being smart, I think we can do some important things. But I think we ought to start with an objective look at the risk that Iran presents to us. I don't think that's in our popular imagination.Andrew Schwartz: And they too don't want their civilization to end.John Hamre: No, they're very proud people. I mean 5,000 years civilization, but we have not found a stable basis going forward. And it's partly, that's been us. And partly that's been them. And so we have to stay forceful but threatening to destroy them is not going to be a viable solution.Bob Schieffer: But then you come to Afghanistan where one has to wonder. They don't seem to be afraid to put their civilization on the line.John Hamre: Well, we go into Afghanistan with very noble aspirations and then we turn it into a quest for universal goals of democracy without really understanding it. And now we're right on the edge of abandoning them after having invested for 18 years. And I think the starting point I think with Afghanistan is that there are two power axes that intersect Afghanistan. One power axis is Pakistan, the Taliban, and it was Saudi Arabia. It's not so clear that Saudi Arabia is part of it now, but China's stepped in. So you've got a China-Pakistan-Taliban axis. The other axis is an Indian-Iranian-Russian axis. Those were the two power axes that intersected in Afghanistan. And everybody in Afghanistan was kind of affiliated with one or the other.John Hamre: And the fact that the rivalries that the outside countries had got manifested by battles inside and vice versa. And here we go, stumbling in not aware of much of this and think we're going to just give them democracy on a platter and it's all going to work out just fine. We never really developed a coherent strategy. We had one for a brief period when Ambassador Khalilzad was first our ambassador there, he went around to all of the neighboring countries and he basically gave them all the same message, which is there are three options: one is you win, but the reality is that you won't win because the other countries are going to block you. So you don't get to win.John Hamre: Second option is we just pull out immediately and you have total chaos and you've got a mess on your hands for years. Okay, we can do that. The third option is work with us, help us develop a legitimate government in Kabul that can properly represent and guard your core interests and create a political process to reconcile these competing interests. And that was a winning formula. And initially we had a strategy and Zal Khalilzad was the architect of that, but then we yanked him out. We put in other diplomats that didn't understand it. We became distracted because we went to war in Iraq. We really lost our focus and now it's too late.John Hamre: Is it possible to create that sort of a framework again? I don't know. I don't think that it made sense for us to negotiate only with the Taliban and then say, "Okay, but now you work it out with the government in Kabul. Well, what were they going to work out? I mean, because we already said we were going to leave. I mean it seemed to be a very flawed strategy. President Trump has said he wants out. I understand that. Every American wants out. But under what terms? And how will we do that?John Hamre: There is a potential pathway, but it involves all of these neighboring countries being brought in to help find a solution that everybody can live with. Because everybody there has core interests in Afghanistan and we don't. So it seems to be, we've got to understand those core interests and then find a way where we'll create a mechanism where those interests are honored. So it's possible, but you can't do it by just simply announcing we're going to negotiate a deal with one faction and then we're just going to pull the hell out of there.Bob Schieffer: Final question I suppose, but what do you think is going to happen next? What's the next thing we're going to have to worry about?John Hamre: The next thing we're going to have to worry about? Well, I've always had this fear that President Trump will just say, "Let's pull our troops out of Korea. We've been there for 60 years. They're strong. They can defend themselves. We don't need to be there any longer, and I'm the only president that can bring peace to Northeast Asia." And I think that's a great confusion because the reason we have troops in Korea today is not because of North Korea. It's because of China. We have decided it's in our core interests for Korea to be the champion of democracy, rule of law, transparency, accountable governments. That model of how to organize society, where the government is the balancer between public interests and private interests.John Hamre: We stayed there to create a really a wonderful prosperous, glowing democracy and they're in a neighborhood where they got Russia to the North, they've got China around them.John Hamre: We're there because we are championing those values. Simply saying, "We've finished, it's all done. We're pulling out" means that we are throwing in the towel in the great investment of the post-Cold War period where we made an investment in democracy and free enterprise and societies of opportunity. It helped create that in Korea and instead put them into the position of having to find their own way against an overwhelmingly powerful China, and a not so powerful, but sometimes pernicious Russia in the far East.John Hamre: And that's my worry is that we don't properly understand what's at stake in Korea.Andrew Schwartz: Because our investment there is still obviously bearing great returns.John Hamre: Yes. Well if what you value is vibrant societies of liberty and opportunity and that that's in a broad sense going to be good for us. I think it has clearly been good for us, but that's the debate that Americans are having. That's this debate. Have we been suckers? We've paid the price, they've gotten the benefit, and we just ought to pull out and they're on their own. I personally think that's profoundly wrong. But we have a lot of work to do to convince Americans that that is a strategy that's good for our future.John Hamre: It's not just altruism, it's concretely at our advantage to have countries around the world that share our values. It's good for our economy, it's good for our citizens, and it's good for a peaceful world.Andrew Schwartz: Well, whatever happened to the notion that for us to be active in the world and engaged in the world keeps away the problems of the world from our shores?John Hamre: I think that the recession took away an awful lot of our confidence. Again, I kind of come back, it's very simple minded analogy of all the problems in the world are horizontal and all of the governments are vertical. And if you want to solve a problem, as big as we are, we can't solve a problem just when it comes to American soil, whether that's pollution or drugs or infectious disease or human trafficking. I mean, it's far harder for us to solve any of those problems that affect us if we're just doing it when we wait until they come here.Andrew Schwartz: Right.John Hamre: And the questions we have to start rebuilding a sense that partnering with other people in the world, partnering with a constructive agenda, looking deep at root causes, not just things you don't like, but the causes of things you don't like, and working on them is our long-term strategy. And we aren't there yet.Bob Schieffer: Dr. Hamre, thank you for giving us the truth of the matter. I'm Bob Schieffer.Andrew Schwartz: I'm Andrew Schwartz.

PayPal finds a way into China's huge business of digital paymentsCNN WireSeptember 30, 2019 Monday 8:52 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 516 wordsByline: By Clare Duffy, CNN BusinessDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  As western companies jockey for a way into China's enormous digital payments business, PayPal has clinched a license to provide digital payment services in China, following its acquisition of a majority stake in a Chinese payments company.China's central bank has approved PayPal's acquisition of a 70% equity interest in GoPay, the companies announced Monday. PayPal says this makes it the first foreign firm licensed to provide digital payment services in China. The terms of the deal, which is expected to close by the end of 2019, have not been disclosed, a PayPal spokesperson said. GoPay is a small Chinese payments provider that functions similarly to PayPal --- it allows merchants to accept non-credit card payments straight from their websites. American payment and credit card companies have for years been trying to break into the world's second largest economy, where the growing middle class means a growing market of consumers seeking lending, credit card and money transfer services. In recent years, the Chinese government has opened the door to foreign firms to start applying for licenses to launch payments networks in the country, but the approval process has been slow-going. By taking on majority ownership of GoPay, PayPal acquired access to the Chinese firm's license to provide online payment services. "We look forward to partnering with China's financial institutions and technology platforms, providing a more comprehensive set of payment solutions to businesses and consumers, both in China and globally," PayPal CEO Dan Schulman said in a statement on LinkedIn. The deal opens the door for PayPal to process digital transactions in China --- which are estimated to total in the trillions. But it may not be an easy market to break into. Chinese digital payments services Alibaba's AliPay and Tencent's WeChat Pay have dominated that market, in part by making it easy for merchants to use their services and accept payments from mobile phones rather than setting up the infrastructure to accept credit card payments. As of last year, more than 8 million brick-and-mortar stores in China accepted AliPay. The licensing requirements have made it difficult for American companies to operate in the country, while benefiting Chinese companies.Only one other American company has successfully made inroads in the market. Last year, American Express received preliminary approval from the People's Bank of China to start building out a domestic clearance and settlement network through its joint venture with Chinese partner LianLian group.In every other market in the world, American Express processes transactions through its own, Arizona-based network. But in China, it's had to rely on the state-controlled payments giant China Union Pay to process transactions. The preliminary approval it received last year will allow it to build out its own network to process payments on AmEx branded cards.Mastercard and Visa have also tried to offer such services in China.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Professional "Hearthstone" player banned for expressing pro-Hong Kong viewsThe Quad: West Chester UniversityOctober 14, 2019 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: ENTERTAINMENT; Pg. 1Length: 797 wordsByline: Edward ParkBodyOn Oct. 8, 2019, professional "Hearthstone" player Blitzchung was banned from playing in competitive Hearthstone for one year after expressing pro-Hong Kong sentiments in an interview.At the end of an after-match interview, Ng "Blitzchung" Wai Chung, while donning a gas mask, said as a rough translation, "Liberate Hong Kong. Revolution of our age" - an obvious reference to the Hong Kong protests for freedom against China. After this statement, he was banned for one year and all of his earnings for that season were revoked. The two casters that were involved in his declaration on stream were also fired for their involvement.That was the start of a whirlwind of backlash. Blizzard fans from all over the world shouted in outrage over the ban. Players from all over the globe began to burn their games and delete their Blizzard accounts in rebellion to this decision.Even Blizzard's own staff became involved with deleting their own Blizzard accounts, including ex-Blizzard employee Mark Kern - the team lead of "World of Warcraft," "Diablo Two" and "Starcraft." He concluded his declaration to stop playing with this, saying, "until Blizzard reverses their decision on Blitzchung, I am giving up playing Classic WoW." From those still inside the company, there was a protest around the infamous orc statue at Blizzard's studio. The employees there carried umbrellas calling to the Umbrella Movement, which made the umbrella a symbol of rebellion against China. Many within the company are angered by the fact that it seems Blizzard can't even keep to their own values.The orc statue itself was also marked in protest. For every cardinal direction a core value of the company is written. Two of those values, "Think Globally" and "Every Voice Matters" were covered with tape and paper in a photo supposedly taken by a Blizzard employee who said, "Not everyone at Blizzard agrees with what happened."It gets even crazier. After this incident, people began creating pro-Hong Kong versions of characters, the most popular of whom being Mei from "Overwatch." Designs of her plastered in Pro-Hong Kong advocacy have become widely accepted and publicized. If you were to search for "Mei Overwatch" right now, it is currently covered in redesigns of the character wearing a gas mask and carrying an umbrella while the phrase "liberate Hong Kong" is all over her face and outfit. The goal of this is to remove "Overwatch" from search engines and computers all over China.As much as the outrage is warranted, let's take a step back and think about why Blizzard decided to appease the Chinese government. China at the current moment is a powerhouse of a market for many forms of media. That is why certain movies and games directly appeal to that market. A good example of this is while the "Warcraft" movie was critically panned and bombed at the box office here, it was a massive success in China. That is why companies bend over backwards to make sure that their products make it to Chinese hands. There is a huge amount of profit to be made when your products appeal to China.That being said, the most ironic thing about Blizzard of all people being involved in this appeasement rigmarole is that it is an American company that bends to the will of a Communist nation. All the values of free speech and freedom of the press are completely ignored when there's money to be made in a place where such things are not rights.Blizzard has spent much of its time cultivating an image of acceptance and diversity. Tracer and Soldier 76 being gay, and other characters within other universes being more accepting of others, has made them the go-to brand for people who want freedom to express themselves.This message now seems so ironic as Blizzard bends over backwards to censor the very people they have taught us to respect. They have told us to love and care, while simultaneously agreeing with the Chinese government that yes, these people must be silenced.As of writing this, Blizzard has remained in absolute silence, perhaps in the hope that this whole debacle will blow over with time. The only sign of action is the message posted on a Chinese social media website where they said that the individuals responsible "dishonored" China. There are also rising beliefs that, as people try to delete their Blizzard accounts, Blizzard actively closed channels of deletion for an account.Blizzcon, Blizzard's own event and announcement hub, is right around the corner. Starting Nov. 1-3, it is next to absolute certainty that protests against their decision to ban Blitzchung and the casters will be broadcasted all over Blizzcon where there is little that can silence them.All we can do now is wait and see.Edward Park is a second-year student majoring in English education.

CHINA MULLS VISA CURBS ON U.S. NATIONALS WITH HUMAN RIGHTS, INTELLIGENCE BACKGROUNDStates News ServiceOctober 10, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 888 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Authorities in China are considering limiting visas issued to U.S. nationals linked to 'anti-China' organizations including rights groups and U.S. intelligence agencies, Reuters news agency reported.The country's ministry of public security is mulling rules that will limit the ability of anyone employed, or sponsored, by U.S. intelligence services and human rights groups to travel to China, the report cited anonymous sources as saying.The news emerged after the U.S. announced visa restrictions on Tuesday restricting visas for Chinese government and ruling Chinese Communist Party officials deemed responsible for the detention or abuse of Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR)."This is not something we want to do but we don't seem to have any choice," Reuters quoted one source as saying.Employees of U.S. military and CIA-linked institutions and rights groups would be added to a new visa blacklist under the new rules, the source said."The plan has been widely discussed by senior police officers over recent months, but made more likely to be implemented after the Hong Kong protests and the U.S. visa ban on Chinese officials," the source said.The plan also comes after Washington added Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co and 70 affiliates to a list companies that are banned from acquiring components and technology from U.S. firms without U.S. government approval.Difficulty entering Hong KongArthur Ding, who directs the Institute of International Relations (IIR) at Taiwan's National Chengchi University, said the plans are likely more of a threat at this stage."China likes to think it is a superpower, and so it is likely to take counter-measures against some practices it sees as unfavorable," Ding said. "[This would mean that] certain groups in the U.S. that promote democracy around the world would have difficulty getting into Hong Kong.""I don't think this is going to make much difference to anything," he said. "As we've seen recently with the NBA, wherever China tries to move the lines of [ideological] battle to Western countries, there will always be a backlash in those countries."Joseph Cheng, former politics professor at Hong Kong's City University, said the reported counter-measures are also a part of the ongoing trade war between Beijing and Washington."If the U.S. sanctions Chinese officials in the name of human rights, then China has to prepare a list as a counterattack," Cheng said.The news has 'leaked' to the media as the U.S. Congress gears up to review the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which -- if passed -- will require Washington to review the city's human rights record and potentially deny visas or freeze the assets of those held responsible for rights abuses in the city.The bill has attracted strong bipartisan support since its introduction earlier this year. It has now cleared the committee stage, and is expected to go to a vote soon, possibly this month.Even if it passes, there will still be a delay in implementing sanctions against Hong Kong officials, Cheng said."There will be a delay during which the U.S. government will submit a report to the U.S. Congress assessing the state of democracy and human rights in Hong Kong," Cheng said.Hong Kong has barred foreignersChina's foreign ministry responded on Thursday to the Reuters report by saying that China welcomes U.S. nationals from all walks of life to visit China and interact and meet with its people.It said recent visa restrictions by the U.S. had placed obstacles in the way of such contact, and called on the U.S. to "put an end to its cold-war mentality and seek to build bridges between the two countries, rather than walls."The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday also cited the mistreatment of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in its decision to add 20 Chinese public security bureaus and eight companies to a trade blacklist, including the world's largest maker of video surveillance gear, Hikvision, and the world's most valuable artificial intelligence startup, SenseTime.The United States is also moving ahead with discussions on possible restrictions on capital flows to China, with a focus on investments by U.S. government pension funds, Bloomberg reported.Last April, a number of prominent Chinese scholars had their U.S. visas revoked, while new legislation banned anyone previously employed by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) from student or research visas.Currently, U.S. nationals need a visa to enter the People's Republic of China, with the exception of Hong Kong, where they are given visa-free tourist access.Immigration authorities in Hong Kong have, however, denied entry to foreign nationals who present themselves at the border if they are deemed politically sensitive by Beijing.Immigration authorities have denied entry to a British journalist who gave a platform to a pro-independence politician at the Foreign Correspondents' Club, and to a U.K. ruling Conservative Party rights activist.They have also denied entry to former members of the pro-democracy movement in China, and Taiwan activists who have supported the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement.Reported by Gao Feng for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by the Cantonese Service.

Sen. Rick Scott to International Olympics Committee: Stand Up for Human Rights; Don't Host Olympic Games in Communist ChinaTargeted News ServiceOctober 17, 2019 Thursday 8:13 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 667 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Rick Scott, R-Florida, issued the following news release:Today, Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to the President of the International Olympics Committee urging the Committee to reconsider its decision to host the 2022 Winter Olympics in Communist China.Read the letter HERE (https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2019-10/191017-Thomas%20Bach%20IOC.pdf) or below.October 17, 2019To: Mr. Thomas Bach, President, International Olympic Committee, Chateau de Vidy, Case postale 356, 1001 Lausanne, SwitzerlandDear Mr. Bach:As we approach the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, I write to you with grave concern about the decision by the International Olympic Committee to allow a Communist regime to host a global sporting event that attracts athletes and spectators from all across the world.Last week, the world watched while Communist China pressured the NBA to censor themselves over a tweet supporting Hong Kong citizens who are fighting for their freedom. The NBA, an American organization, was quick to kowtow to the Chinese government in fear that speaking out would cut into their profits. If Communist China has the ability to censor the NBA from speaking about anything that may offend President Xi, what will they do to athletes from around the world? Will this regime start censoring or restricting participating athletes? What about the press? Will their broadcasts be censored to appease President Xi?The NBA is just the tip of the iceberg. For far too long the world has turned a blind eye to this regime's oppressive tactics. Communist China is not trying to hide their intentions anymore. President Xi is a human rights violator and suppressor of free speech. President Xi's China has set up a surveillance infrastructure masked as technology "businesses" like ZTE and Huawei. The United States has already stopped the sale of these state-sponsored products to prevent the Chinese from stealing data of residents and visitors in the United States. I implore you to look closely at the global security threat these Communist Chinese companies pose. The 2022 Olympic Games in Beijing will provide the Chinese government full access to a global array of dignitaries, athletes, corporations, and governments when someone simply turns on their phone, or connects to the Wi-Fi in the hotel. That sort of totalitarian surveillance must be avoided at all costs.Time after time, Communist China has made and broken its promises. Communist China is stealing our technology, and refuses to open their markets to foreign goods as required by their agreement to be part of the WTO. They are militarizing the South China Sea, even after they promised President Obama they would not. They continue to attack religious freedom by detaining more than one million Uyghurs, a Muslim ethnic minority group in Communist China, in internment and re-education camps, and have not lived up to the agreement to give Hong Kong autonomy and freedom. I recently traveled to Hong Kong and met with many courageous individuals fighting for their basic freedoms that Communist China promised during the handover. As they continue to fight for democracy, the Communist government in China has turned Hong Kong into a police state as a way to force their citizens into compliance with Beijing's rule of law.The International Olympic Committee is now faced with an important decision. If Communist China continues breaking promises, violating human rights, and oppressing the people of Hong Kong, then Beijing should not be allowed to host the 2022 Winter Olympics. The Olympic Games are an incredible opportunity to allow the world's best athletes to represent their countries, and should not be hosted by Communist China and President Xi, who does not value human rights. I ask this committee to stand up for freedom and urge Communist China to do the right thing, or find a new home for the 2022 Olympic Games.Sincerely,Rick ScottUnited States SenatorCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6895684 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: October 18, 2019End of Document

SECS expands partnerships with Chinese universitiesThe Oakland Post: Oakland UniversityOctober 2, 2019 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 666 wordsByline: Katie ValleyBodyAfter traveling to China from Sept. 8-13 to strengthen partnerships with three STEM-focused universities, leaders of the Oakland University School of Engineering and Computer Science are expecting an increase in the number of Chinese exchange students attending OU.SECS Dean Louay Chamra; Lianxiang Yang, distinguished professor of mechanical engineering; and Gary Barber, professor of mechanical engineering - as well as James Lentini, provost and senior vice president for Academic Affairs - took a trip to China to sign new agreements to expand partnerships with the Changchun University of Technology , Zhengzhou University of Light Industry and Beijing Information Science & Technology University .The new agreements came after being expanded last year when the SECS leaders and OU President Ora Hirsch Pescovitz met with the leaders of the universities in China.While at CCUT, OU signed a new Agreement for American Semester Abroad Program that will host up to 35 undergraduate or graduate students. With ZZULI, OU signed a Memorandum of Understanding for a new joint institute to implement Engineering and Computer Science programs at ZZULI sponsored by the Chinese Ministry of Education.Leaders visited BISTU to discuss existing programs and also share ideas about new joint programs. Two-hundred students and parents also attended an opening ceremony for the OU-CCUT international program to learn more from a panel of OU and CCUT professors and administrators.For international students who are part of the exchange, the programs consist of either a three-week summer camp with hands-on experience in engineering and computer science or a one-year exchange where students then finish their degrees in China. Chamra said a top benefit of the exchange program is students pay OU tuition when attending.OU's partnerships with China bring in around 40-50 students each year. At least 30-40% of these exchange students pursue graduate degrees at OU, according to Chamra. OU is also establishing a graduate student exchange program, where students take classes in China for one year then transfer to OU for another year, earning them degrees from both institutions.Currently, the SECS has about 300 students from China out of the 3,600 total students. Many other SECS students agree the partnerships will offer exchange students a beneficial opportunity.Savonna Sou, junior, said the program is a great step for future STEM workers to heighten their technical skills through learning."The learning techniques of engineering over there translate into ours," he said. "We're just getting a variety of different types of engineering advances, even learning about history about [China's] advancements, and also taking part in how we can change our engineering to either better theirs and then apply it to ours, or just better ours by using their advances."David Huang, sophomore, said even other SECS students can benefit by building friendships with exchange students."China is currently the world's largest manufacturer, and having these partnerships with Chinese universities will allow students here to potentially network with Chinese students who will get to work in these manufacturing firms," Huang said.The OU SECS offers a unique program for students that focuses mainly on practice and theory with much out-of-the-classroom experience. According to Chamra, 95% of students find jobs after graduating, with an average annual salary of around $70,000.With the expanding partnerships, Chamra said other SECS students have the opportunity to learn about cultures other than their own."Everybody knows about the tensions between our government and the Chinese government, and I really think the strength of these agreements and bringing Chinese students to our campus make us better people by understanding each other, talking to each other - and that cultural difference is very important to talking one-one-one - and that's the power of having a diverse student body at Oakland University."Load-Date: October 2, 2019End of Document

The Latest Free Speech DebatesThe Scarlet: Clark UniversityOctober 26, 2019 SaturdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINIONS; Pg. 1Length: 755 wordsByline: Malcolm JacobBodyThe line between professionalism and political rhetoric has never been clear-cut. Common means of distributing information, such as TV broadcasts and the Internet, can be used to spread messages to thousands of viewers at once. When is the proper time and place to make politically or socially charged statements? And do such statements violate the contracts between parties, or perhaps the unwritten rules? This is not a new topic of conversation in the United States.But it becomes even more complicated when this issue crosses national boundaries and involves cases of human rights. In particular, there are two recent incidents that demonstrate the risks posed by making political statements. Critics see these happenings as more than just rule-breaking: they see them as signs that American companies are censoring free speech and selling out to foreign governments.The first incident comes from the world of video games. On October 6, during the conclusion of a tournament of the game "Hearthstone," winner Ng Wai Chung (known by his handle "Blitzchung") made a statement on the live stream expressing support of protestors in Hong Kong. Immediately following this, the company Activision Blizzard decided to strip Chung of his prize money, and also suspend him for twelve months.Since these steps have been taken, there has been considerable debate over the company's motive behind their decision. In an official statement Blizzard cited a violation of one of the competition rules, which states that participants may not engage in action that "brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image". Such a violation would result in a removal from the competition and of any reward.However, an important part of this conversation is Blizzard's financial ties to China. For one, the company earns about 12% of its profit from the Asia Pacific market. Additionally, it has been noted that the Chinese company Tencent owns 5% of Activision Blizzard. So, the question is, was the video game company simply enforcing its rules, or was it suppressing free speech in order to preserve a portion of its revenue? Regardless of the answer, Blizzard's actions have been criticized by U.S. lawmakers from both major political parties.A second, similar incident started on October 4, and it stemmed from a single tweet. Daryl Morey, general manager of the NBA's Houston Rockets, posted on Twitter showing his own support of the Hong Kong protestors. This led to an avalanche of response from a number of parties. For one, several Chinese businesses cut ties with the league, as well as the previously mentioned Tencent, a major broadcasting company. This is also true for the Chinese Basketball Association, whose current president is Yao Ming, a Hall of Famer and former Rockets player. One more prominent critic is Taiwanese-born Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai, who referred to the protesters as a "separatist movement."For Morey, there are no immediate repercussions from his statement. He removed his post and released an apology addressed to all viewers in China, but this did little to quiet global reactions on either side. The league issued a similar statement but has not outright condemned the manager. It's been suggested that the Chinese government asked the NBA to fire Morey, but this claim has been denied.Added to this already messy situation is a bit of satire from Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of "South Park". A perfectly timed recent episode of the TV series mocked the efforts of American businesses to appeal to the Chinese government. When China removed the series from major platforms, effectively banning it from the public, Parker and Stone issued a mock apology. The statement read in part: "Like the NBA, we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts. We too love money more than freedom and democracy."Recently, Blizzard decided to reinstate Chung's prize money and they shortened his suspension time. As for the NBA, commissioner Adam Silver stated that the league has already lost millions of dollars in the wake of Morey's statement.The historical context to the Hong Kong protests is too deep to be fully covered in a short article. What's happening on our own soil is that people from the sports and video game communities are now showing their support of the protestors. Regardless of how you feel about political statements in broadcasting, you can't deny that it generates response and discussion from the public.Load-Date: October 27, 2019End of Document

NATIONAL DAY ARRESTS, FORCED SINGING OF CHINA'S PRAISES RANKLE TIBETANSStates News ServiceOctober 3, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 492 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:China arrested Tibetans for sending money and forced elderly Tibetans to sing patriotic "red" songs praising the country in the run up to Oct. 1 National Day celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China, a Tibetan-American recent visitor to the region told RFA on Thursday."The arrests began in July leading up to Oct 1st National Day. Those arrested include Tibetan retirees on charge of corruption," said Lhundup Dorje, who returned the U.S. after a recent visit to Lhasa, the Tibetan regional capital."Even several Tibetan youths who sent money to their siblings in India via red envelop through WeChat are among the arrested," he said, referring to the money transfer service of the popular Chinese communications app."One Tibetan youth who sent money via red envelop was arrested and beaten because his money contribution was a prayer offering to the private office of the Dalai Lama for a deceased person," said Dorje.Dorje's account matched a report issued last month by a Tibetan advocacy group, which said Chinese authorities had tightened controls in Tibet ahead of Oct. 1, hoisting Chinese flags on monastery roofs and forcing monks to sing songs praising the ruling Communist Party.In the run-up to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Tibetans are also being coerced to attend events promoting government policies and are hanging scrolls with pictures of senior Chinese Communist Party leaders on the walls of private homes, London-based Free Tibet said in its report.Dorje told RFA's Tibetan Service that "all Tibetan retirees were ordered to practice singing patriotic songs [called red song] praising the motherland.""And all along the roads in Lhasa, and everywhere Chinese flags were flown high" he said."All Tibetan government officials, retirees and school students refrained from going to the Jokhang Temple in central Lhasa during the lead up to the anniversary for fear of offending the communist government.""The Chinese government even warned Tibetan parents, that their kids will be removed from schools, and government would stop giving subsidies to those Tibetan find worshipping and visiting the Jokhang Temple during the 70th anniversary," said Dorje.Tibet's exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama fled Tibet into exile in India following a failed 1959 national uprising against rule by China, which marched into the formerly independent Himalayan region nine years earlier.Chinese authorities have maintained a tight grip on Tibet and on Tibetan-populated prefectures of Chinese provinces ever since, restricting Tibetans' political activities and peaceful expression of ethnic and religious identity, and subjecting Tibetans to persecution, torture, imprisonment, and extrajudicial killings.Reported by Yangdon Demo for RFA's Tibetan Service.

3 reasons why Activision Blizzard punished an esports star for backing Hong Kong protestersBusiness Insider USOctober 14, 2019 Monday 01:33 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 842 wordsByline: tmohamed@businessinsider.com,  (Theron Mohamed)Highlight: The video game giant risked alienating a joint-venture partner, an investor/collaborator, and regulators in China.BodyAntoine Antoniol/Getty Images• Activision Blizzard stripped a "Hearthstone" champion of his prize money and slapped him with a yearlong ban from competitions after he voiced support for anti-government protests in Hong Kong.• The video game giant quickly scaled back the punishment following fierce backlash, and insisted its relationship with China didn't factor in its decision.• However, it relies on local partner NetEase to operate in the key growth market, its games require regulatory approvals to be sold in China, and Chinese entertainment titan Tencent is an investor and close collaborator.• Watch Activision Blizzard trade live on Markets Insider.Activision Blizzard stripped a "Hearthstone" champion of his prize money and            slapped him with a yearlong ban from competitions after he voiced support for anti-government protests in Hong Kong.The video game giant quickly scaled back the punishment following fierce backlash, restoring the esports player's winnings and halving the length of his ban, and said its relationship with China didn't factor into its decision. However, there are several reasons to think it did.Professional gamer Chung "Blitzchung" Ng Wai shouted "Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age" in Chinese during a post-match interview after winning a "Hearthstone" tournament in Taiwan last week. Activision Blizzard said the comments broke the competition's rules by referencing events outside of the game, and emphasized it wasn't taking a side in the face off between Hong Kong demonstrators and China."We have these rules to keep the focus on the game and on the tournament to the benefit of a global audience, and that was the only consideration in the actions we took," the company said in a statement. "The specific views expressed by blitzchung were NOT a factor in the decision we made. I want to be clear: our relationships in China had no influence on our decision."It continued: "If this had been the opposing viewpoint delivered in the same divisive and deliberate way, we would have felt and acted the same."Still, Activision Blizzard has three big reasons to worry about upsetting China.(1) It could lose access to a key growth marketActivision Blizzard relies on a local partner to operate in China. Letting Blitzchung's comments go unpunished risked endangering its access to a key growth market.The company generated just under $400 million in sales in Asia-Pacific in the first half of this year, or about 12% of its total revenue for the period, its latest earnings show. It also expanded its decade-long joint venture with Chinese partner NetEase, which operates and secures government approvals for games such as World of Warcraft. Operations chief Collister Johnson pointed to the "substantial value and opportunity for Blizzard's content in China" on the group's earnings call in February.(2) Chinese regulators could pull its games off the marketActivision Blizzard spelled out the risk of angering Chinese regulators in its latest annual report."To operate in China, all games must have regulatory approval," it said. "A decision by the Chinese government to revoke its approval for any of our games or to decline to approve any products we desire to sell in China in the future could have a negative impact on our business."The company highlighted China's suspension of game approvals between March 2018 and January 2019, which made it unclear if and when its new products would be approved for release. It also pointed to uncertainty around how China regulates mobile and online games. (3) It could alienate a key investor and partnerBacking Blitzchung risked alienating Tencent, the Chinese entertainment titan that holds a 5% stake in Activision Blizzard.One of Tencent's studios built Call of Duty Mobile, an upcoming mobile game set to bring one of Activision Blizzard's biggest franchises to tens of millions of Chinese smartphone and tablet gamers. Activision Blizzard plans to leverage Tencent's "massive network, broad distribution channels and local marketing expertise" to ensure a successful launch, Johnson said on an earnings call in August.Tencent sided with the Chinese government just last week. After the general manager of the Houston Rockets tweeted in support of the Hong Kong protesters, prompting the basketball league's president to defend his right to free speech and decline to apologize, Tencent            suspended online broadcasts of all pre-season NBA games.While Activision Blizzard insists its relationship with China wasn't a factor in its decision to sanction blitzchung, its reliance on two local partners and approvals from Chinese regulators mean it had a lot to lose by not punishing him.NOW WATCH: Super-Earths are real and they could be an even better place to live than EarthSee Also:• The best checked luggage you can buy• A lawyer who represents cruise-ship workers reveals one thing passengers do that's terrible for some crew members• Here's why JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs say 2019 is the year climate change is at the top of investors' mindsLoad-Date: October 14, 2019End of Document

SHOULD GOVERNMENT REGULATE GOOGLE?States News ServiceSeptember 13, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 4476 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Independent Women's Forum:featuring Beverly HallbergOn this episode of She Thinks, we talk big tech and privacy. With a bipartisan group of Attorneys General across the nation announcing an antitrust investigation into Google, we consider what it means for companies like Facebook and Amazon to bear federal regulations. Will it stifle competition? Or are these companies so large that theyve already pushed out competitors? Its a complex issue, but fortunately we have Roslyn Layton to break it down for us.Roslyn Layton is a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, where she focuses on evidence-based policy for information, communications, and digital technology industries. Using empirical methods, she assesses regulations and policies for digitally connected domains such as mobile wireless, telecom, cable, internet, among others. Dr. Layton is also a visiting researcher at Aalborg University in Copenhagen Denmark and a vice president at Strand Consult.Beverly H.:And welcome to She Thinks, a podcast where you're allowed to think for yourself. I'm your host, Beverly Hallberg, and on today's episode we delve into the issue of big tech and privacy. With a bipartisan group of attorneys general across the nation announcing an antitrust investigation against Google, what does this mean for companies like Facebook, Amazon, and others if the federal government steps in to regulate? Will that stifle competition or are these companies so large that they've already pushed out competitors? It's complex, but fortunately we have Roslyn Layton to break it down for us today.Beverly H.:Roslyn Layton is a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute where she focuses on evidence based policy for information, communications, and digital technology industries. Using empirical methods she assesses regulations and policies for digitally connected domains such as mobile wireless, telecom, cable, internet among others. Dr. Layton is also a visiting researcher at Aalborg University in Copenhagen, Denmark and is a vice president at Strand Consult. Roslyn, thanks so much for joining us today.Roslyn Layton:I'm thrilled to join you, Beverly. Thank you so much.Beverly H.:And I think technology is a wonderful thing. You are a tech guru. You are actually joining us today from Copenhagen. I know it's later there, so thank you so much for joining us on this episode. But isn't technology wonderful where we can even have this conversation while we're in different countries?Roslyn Layton:It's true. It is. I mean I've been able to work all over the world and work with people because broadband is so excellent and it's getting better all the time. It's really a wonderful success story, and you don't know how great you have it until you go abroad actually. But any case, you and I today, we're using our mobile technologies probably, and I listened to your podcast when I'm on the go, so I love it.Beverly H.:And I didn't tell you, I was going to ask you this question, but something that I was reading, your introduction I thought of is that while you and I have worked together in the past and you're a friend of mine, I have to admit that even though I've worked with people in the tech industry focusing on researching the policies of big tech, I don't meet many women in this industry. So you're one of the few women that I know that works in this industry. How did that come about? Why was this an interest for you and what is it been like being a woman working in this field?Roslyn Layton:It's such a great question, and I would just say to those listener women who want to get into tech, go for it. Because you know what? Honestly, being a woman is an advantage. And the other part is who uses technology is women. But in my personal story, I have reinvented myself many times. I've had a long career doing different things, but I knew that at maybe in my thirties I got an MBA. I knew I had to change careers. I had worked with nonprofit organizations and I worked in the financial industry and I got an MBA. I worked for Titan India. I went back to California. I actually was working in Silicon Valley, so I had a great experience. And then I was recruited to Denmark to bring my Silicon Valley skills to a new place.Roslyn Layton:But as I went along, I was very much involved in kind of startup culture, and what I realized what was missing was the thinking is so much like make it happen. Things had to be very fast. And I thought, gee, if you could step back and think of strategy for a moment. So in Denmark there's a wonderful thing called the Industrial PhD Program, and that I went to a study business economics. I studied a very controversial issue called net neutrality. I looked at 50 countries around the world and what happened with their internet regulation before and after. And that was really ... opened my mind and my world to the policy area, and it's made me love the American constitution because I've learned so much about the US because I've lived abroad. But what I can boil all of that down for you is that regulation tends to reward the largest companies because they are generally asking for regulation and they can protect their market position.Roslyn Layton:And when it comes to the internet, we have seen a lot of success with what's called multi-stakeholder or bottom up kind of solutions where you have different stakeholders working together. And I learned that in my research where I saw that the countries that had the most heavy handed regulation, you saw very little startup activity, very little disruptors. And of course where we've seen the entrenchment of the large companies were where ... sorry, the opposite. So where you had a multi-stakeholder model, you had a lot of local innovations. So for example, here in Denmark they manage the net neutrality issue through self-regulation. In most of the Nordic countries, they've been very innovative, making local innovation.Roslyn Layton:But in the cases where they had a heavy handed approach, you don't find ... what's interesting is we were told we need to regulate the internet, but no one else has been able to come up with the other Google or something on Facebook, except in China where there are no rules at all for net neutrality. So in any case, my PhD was really ... it pushed back against a lot of conventional wisdom and so I take that approach very much because we have everyone in Washington, they all want to regulate their competitors. And when the largest companies come in and say, "Oh please regulate us," then you really have to have some concerns.Beverly H.:Well obviously because they have a vested interest in that. And I do want to get into that more, but I want to take a step back. I think often this world of big tech can ... it's a lot to sift through if you don't deal with it day in and day out. We know that there is something significant going on because 50 state attorney's general are making an investigation into Google across this issue, the issue of privacy, but can you take us a step back and say when it comes to privacy, what is it that people are referring to? What are the concerns?Roslyn Layton:Well, that's a great question, Beverly. I'm really glad you asked that because if you listen to the debates or what you read on the news, they are jumbling a lot of terms together. They'll say data privacy, data protection, data security, every single one of those terms has a very different meaning and extremely different legal implications and they all get thrown around and they're not the same thing. And so just to put this in perspective, in Europe, this giant new regulation called the General Data Protection Regulation, the word privacy is not in that text. With all the words in it, there's nothing about privacy. It is about regulating the conduct of business. It's about regulating information. It has nothing to do with privacy. Now, privacy in the United States actually has a very long history over 200 years going back to before the founding and the first laws that were adopted in the United States had to do with protecting people from the government.Roslyn Layton:So how the census was conducted, protecting the posts, making sure that your mail wasn't read, laws about people eavesdropping on you. So actually the privacy tradition in the United States is very strong largely about the administrative state. In our laws in the US we have over two dozen laws regulating privacy with regard to business, different industries. That goes back to the '70s, and where people had a lot of financial information, we have a lot of active ... people had credit, the early days of credit. And when it was time to move that away from punch cards and so on onto computers, it was necessary to make a kind of framework. So the interesting thing is in terms about the protection of data and how it's treated, the United States has a long tradition of doing that. But what we did was evolve what you would call a trust based or risk based approach, where we didn't do what the Europeans do, which says every single thing needs to be regulated by the state.Roslyn Layton:We said, "Let's evolve this based upon where the need is necessary. Financial information, health information, children and information." So that's been important for the permission less innovation we have in our country because we didn't assume that just because you collect personal information that it's a problematic. So we have allowed firms to emerge, that's been vital for the internet. And so now we're at a point, in fact, we've been there for 20 years, it's just Congress keeps ... it becomes difficult to make the deal or what have you, but we know that now we have to do something about the digital space and that's where- [crosstalk 00:09:19]Beverly H.:And can I jump in here in a question on that? So when we want to think about privacy, should we say, "Okay, privacy first of all is about people and how people are treated in relation to the companies that they opt in to use." So let's use Facebook. That's an easy example. And Facebook should adhere to their policies on how people's data is being used. That's when they get into trouble is when they sell it to a third party without your consent, therefore breaking the privacy policy that they have with you. So that is very separate than what's going on with the competition and the regulation. Correct?Roslyn Layton:Right. So yes, I appreciate that you highlight that because that's already covered. So we have the Federal Trade Commission, which just fined Facebook $5 billion, a huge fine, but that was for what's called a violation ... we have rules about unfair and deceptive practices. So take privacy off the table. If you make a contract with a person or a terms of agreement and you do not represent what you're going to do or you do the opposite or you don't disclose, that is an unfair or deceptive practice. So you don't have to make new laws to address that. And so that has been there.Roslyn Layton:Now there were other issues with Facebook because they had a previous consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission, so the question was did they violate it? And that of course enables the FTC to make the kinds of investigation and fines that they did. So that is one issue, unfair and deceptive practices. We have a hundred year tradition on that. It's very important in American law and jurisprudence and so forth. But the other issue is now, can you say the second part? I'm sorry, what's [crosstalk 00:11:00]Beverly H.:Well, just let's now get into what ... yeah, what are we now getting into when it comes to regulate the companies any further? Like you were saying earlier, a lot of these terms get used in different ways and they have very specific meanings and people I think are careless in how they use it. What's being talked about right now when it comes to the attorneys general is not about the privacy of people, it's how do we regulate these companies. Correct?Roslyn Layton:Right. So I'll be honest with you, when I have ... I'm still trying to get a copy of the materials, but I've watched the 50 attorney general stood on the steps of the Supreme Court and each one of them had kind of different reasons. So there's not a specific reason and they're not even describing it. But what is significant is not since really the tobacco kind of litigation have we had attorneys general on both sides and 50 of them, all but California and Alabama, so also Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico's AG have joined, but they all kind of have a different beef against Google. Now I would say this. On their own, a lot of attorney general have tried to go after Google for things like Affirm was on the Google search engine and then they fell to page three and all their business dried up.Roslyn Layton:So that again could be a deceptive practice with Google not disclosing how their algorithm works. So the challenge here is that you have a lot of antitrust action. You've got the Department of Justice, they have launched an investigation, you have Congress looking into it. So I would guess I would say there's a laundry list of people upset with Google. And to be honest with you, I mean a lot of us in the policy community have been trying to highlight these issues for years and no one would really listen. And so now it's a bit after the fact and everyone ... there's a lot of things we're concerned about, what's going on in China and so forth. But the world has changed even in the last decade. So for example, do you really want to break up Google and Facebook and Amazon and then just give a gift to the large Chinese companies?Roslyn Layton:So maybe we are not happy about some of these American companies, but who do we want people in Thailand? Do we want them to use American companies or Chinese companies when they go online? So I think the issue is now there's even more at stake. It's very complex. There's also challenges because for example Apple is putting cloud data in China where the Chinese government and military can look at it. So that's a concern, that Google has worked with ... has done some projects with the Chinese government. That's a concern. So it's a very difficult, extremely difficult question. And in many respects, sometimes it doesn't line up to traditional antitrust analysis. So for example, consumers don't necessarily pay more out of their pocket. Right? You don't pay to use a search engine. But we are considering now, well, do we give too much of our information?Roslyn Layton:We don't know how it works. It's very opaque. The other issue is the companies are extremely innovative. So in a anti-competitive situation, innovation would be reduced, but that's not the situation now. We have a lot of innovation today. So I'll just wrap up on this one point just to show you how complex it is, because I used to be ... I was working in the field where we worked in digital advertising and analytics. A lot of the attorney generals think that because your advertisement appears high, did you pay more for the advertisement? That's not necessarily the case. Some of the best advertisers, they pay very little for their keywords because they have made a quality advertisement. It's very relevant for the user's query.Roslyn Layton:So in fact the bad advertisements get penalized by paying a higher price. So it actually rewards advertisers who make quality advertising that users click through, that they resolve, that they get what they're looking for. So the other part of this is that users get a lot of utility out of Google. Now there's definitely concerns with the operating system, there's concerns about business practices with vertical integration and so on. But it doesn't always match up to what the traditional antitrust analysis would look for.Beverly H.:And that's why I think it's good that even as we're thinking about, okay, what leads to innovation, what increases competition, we can actually look to Europe and some of the rules, you called them, I think they are known as GDPR is what they're known as there, is some of the privacy rules that they institute. And of course they deal with privacy differently outside of America, but what have you found when it comes to the small or medium sized firms that are trying to grow in comparison to these larger companies? Because like you were saying, these large companies tend to want these types of regulations because it benefits them somehow. Correct?Roslyn Layton:Right, exactly. Well, as I told you in my PhD when I studied this net neutrality policy, all the countries that adopted the hard rules, Google, Apple, Facebook, all the big American companies increased their traffic and revenue in those countries. And it's not surprising of course, they've always been asking for, "Well please regulate the internet in our favor." But what we've seen in Europe, and it's not just this latest policy of GDPR, it's been the history of the EU, is that they've always felt that they could manage innovation from the desk of the bureaucrat. Right? So they thought, well, we didn't like Google so the government will fund our own search engine and it will ... And France and Germany tried to create a competitor to Google, it didn't fly because there's something about ... every single day you have to have the test of the users and do they like your service or not and you have to respond to the marketplace.Roslyn Layton:So the European attempts to make innovation to compete with Silicon Valley have not really been successful. There's other barriers within the European Union. Americans forget that our whole nation was founded on being a single market. We have a common language and currency. We have interstate commerce and the European Union is still trying to resolve that. They have 17 currencies and 24 languages and so even with all the regulations they make to try to make it a single place, it still doesn't work. And that has a lot to do with restrictive regulations that say you have to treat every single piece of information as if it is a piece of property, that it has to be ... if you don't care whether it's sensitive or not, whether it's valuable or not.Roslyn Layton:So you don't get a lot of risk taking. The sad thing about the EU would be in the last ... you haven't seen small and medium sized companies grow. But the amazing thing with this GDPR is they promise that policymakers said, "Oh, we're going to go after the American companies and we'll see a level playing field and new European innovation will come." That hasn't happened. A year later, American companies, Google, Facebook, Amazon, they have more market share today than they did a year ago because the cost of the GDPR, it's several million dollars to upgrade the systems, to hire all the people to do all the reporting and so on. So small competitors, small advertising competitors have exited the market. They have closed down. They've stopped serving the EU. To put in perspective, 1000 media from the United States, they no longer serve European Union. From my desk in Copenhagen, I cannot get the Chicago Tribune.Roslyn Layton:They decided they're not going to make their site available in Europe because the regulations are so onerous. Now if you tried to do that in America would it violate our first amendment, free speech where the government is essentially regulating speech. So this is really what the lesson is is that you have to be careful with the regulations you adopt because you end up rewarding the largest players. So for example, Microsoft, they're around the world saying, "Oh we have to make GDPR everywhere." Well of course because they're already compliant and they don't want a new software company to challenge them on that because they have the market position.Beverly H.:And I want to talk a little bit just about our elected officials that have to make decisions on this. I find that whether somebody is Republican or Democrat, they're looking at big tech and trying to figure out what is the solution and what do we do about some of these issues that we're coming across. And I'm curious from you as somebody who's testified on the hill, both in the House and the Senate, what has it been like educating members of Congress on the issues of big tech? Like you were saying, it's such a complex issue, and they're being approached with different ideas on how to deal with it. Are they really taking the time to research this as much as possible? And of course they have different expertise, different members of Congress, but I just find in some ways it's kind of ironic that members of government are making these decisions when it's very much outside of most of their wheel of expertise. It's very different than traditional policies that they're used to.Roslyn Layton:Yeah. Well that's a great point, Beverly. Well first of all I'd say is the media will definitely like to highlight the conflicts in Congress between the parties and of course that's part of their shtick to do that. But personally I find it very gratifying to work on this issue because there's a lot of bipartisanship. And just given that privacy is something everybody cares about, they understand what's at stake. And I'm very heartened because I think honestly all of the testimony that I've prepared, the representatives and senators, they have asked extremely insightful questions and their staff people, they're very knowledgeable. They asked very good questions. And personally I'm okay that they have been deliberant about it. And in fact, I find it's the most encouraging thing of everything. And I'm much more encouraged by Congress than the AGs, for example, because they are more measured in what they look at and they know what's at stake.Roslyn Layton:I think that it's surprised a lot of people that the GDPR has not been this Nirvana that they expected and they're very concerned if they adopt regulation, it's going to hurt small business. We have literally millions of small startups in the United States. Last year, 40,000 new internet startups going and then just add that over the two decades that we've had, so they're very concerned about what they adopt. Now, that being said, and you would know this, Beverly, is there's a lot of cowboy ... I don't know what you'd call them, renegades in California who somehow they want to do their own kind of GDPR and they've passed a law, it would be coming in place in January and that is very destructive. It is. It's essentially a grab bag. It came together in a week and now we really have to do something because California being a large state and so many American companies are selling into California, that it can in many ways set the tone for the whole country.Roslyn Layton:So it's really important that Congress does kind of bring the country back to its senses and look at and make the proper framework for internet what you would call information privacy. Because if we don't want to go with what California is doing, it is disastrous. Already the minimum cost to comply with the whole laundry list of what the California legislature wants, it's a minimum of $100,000. And that's more than companies will spend on the entire IT budget. So many of us are very concerned about California, especially because of what we've seen in Europe and so we don't want that to happen to the rest of the internet economy. So it is a big deal.Beverly H.:And so when you talk about internet privacy, so this angle, is there something that we need to change legislatively to ensure that that remains or would it just be keeping status quo? So just kind of finally in wrapping up, what should we be looking towards Congress? What should they be doing or not doing as a whole?Roslyn Layton:Right. Well, the most important thing is Congress can preempt California. So it can create a national law, which it should because it's interstate commerce, that the California ... it will preempt what California is trying to do. And as you know, we have certain areas of our constitution where we have a federal policy that will supersede the state policy. So that's very important so that we don't destroy the internet economy for the rest of America. That is one area. But the other thing is we have an excellent organization called the National Institutes of Standards and Technology, and the actual technology of privacy is codified in certified standards.Roslyn Layton:There are actually standards that are written down that are ... what would you say, official or certified by different standards organizations, American Institute of Standards and so on, Global One, American One, and we can be able to say to the various companies that you can choose your standards and then we'll give you a safe harbor to transition to them and that you can disclose which standards that you use so that people will know. And then we can be able to have an internet economy that works with a set of standards that have been agreed to that are disclosed.Roslyn Layton:If you violate the standard, it's very clear, the standard is written. And that is a much better way for the companies to, where any organization can figure out which amount of risk that they want to take for the users to decide and that would be a great direction to go.Beverly H.:Well Roslyn, I always appreciate chatting with you because I personally learned so much. So thank you. I'm sure if it's helpful to all of those who are listening and for joining us when it's really late in Copenhagen. So I appreciate you taking the call. Thank you so much.Roslyn Layton:Anytime. Take care.Beverly H.:And thank you all for joining us. If you have more interest in the topic we discussed, you can of course follow Roslyn on Twitter. Her handle is RoslynLayton, and that is spelled R-O-S-L-Y-N, L-A-Y-T-E-N. And of course you can check out iwf.org for all issues related to big tech.Beverly H.:I also wanted to let you know about a great podcast you should subscribe to in addition to She Thinks. It's called Problematic Women, and it's hosted by Kelsey Bolar and Lauren Evans, where they both sort through the news to bring stories and interviews that are of particular interest to conservative leaning or problematic women, that is women whose views and opinions are often excluded or mocked by those on the so called feminist left. Every Thursday hear them talk about everything from pop culture to policy and politics by searching for Problematic Women where ever you get your podcasts. Last, if you enjoyed this episode of She Thinks, do leave us a rating or a review on iTunes, it does help. And we'd love it if you shared this episode so that your friends know where they can find more She Thinks episodes.

US bars Chinese officials for crackdown on Muslim minoritiesAssociated Press InternationalOctober 9, 2019 Wednesday 2:30 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 300 wordsDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - The Trump administration on Tuesday slapped travel bans on Chinese officials involved in a massive crackdown against Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in its west.The State Department said it would not issue visas to Chinese government and Communist Party officials believed to be responsible for or complicit in mass detentions and abuses in western Xinjiang province. It did not identify the targeted officials or say how many were affected by the ban, which can also be applied to their immediate family members.In a statement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged China to halt its "campaign of repression" in the region, release all those arbitrarily detained and stop trying to coerce members of Chinese Muslim minority groups residing abroad to return to China."The protection of human rights is of fundamental importance, and all countries must respect their human rights obligations and commitments," Pompeo said. "The United States will continue to review its authorities to respond to these abuses."The announcement came a day after the Commerce Department blacklisted Chinese government agencies and a number of Chinese companies that develop facial recognition and other artificial intelligence technology the U.S. says is being used to repress Muslim minorities. The blacklist effectively bars U.S. firms from selling technology to the Chinese companies without government approval.China is estimated to have detained up to 1 million Muslims in prison-like detention centers in the region. The detentions come on top of harsh travel restrictions and a massive surveillance network equipped with facial recognition technology. China has denied committing abuses in the centers and has described them as schools aimed at providing employable skills and combating extremism.Load-Date: October 9, 2019End of Document

China State TV Suspends NBA Broadcasts as Houston Rockets Tweet Dispute DeepensTheStreet.comOctober 8, 2019 Tuesday 5:36 AM EDTCopyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 668 wordsByline: Martin BaccardaxHighlight: China's state broadcaster said Tuesday that it will no longer televise NBA games, cutting off the league from its second-largest market, as the row over a Tweet from the Houston Rocket's general manager threatens to overshadow the upcoming season.BodyChina's state broadcaster said Tuesday that it will no longer televise NBA games, cutting off the league from its second-largest market, as the row over a Tweet from the Houston Rocket's general manager threatens to overshadow the upcoming season.The CCTV Sports channel of China Media Group said it will suspend NBA broadcasts, which attracted some 800 million viewers last year, after league Commissioner Adam Silver defended Daryl Morey for sending a Tweet earlier this week -- for which he later apologized -- that expressed support for the ongoing pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong. Tencent Holdings  , which cut a deal to broadcast NBA games online in 2015, and renewed it for a reported $1.5 billion in July, said it would join the CCTV blackout."I think as a values-based organisation that I want to make it clear ... that Daryl Morey is supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression," Stern told Japan's Kyodo news agency Tuesday ahead of an exhibition game between the Rockets and the Toronto Raptors in Tokyo. "I accept that it is also Chinese governments' and Chinese businesses' right to react to those words and, at least from my long-time experience in the NBA, it will take some time to heal some of these issues."1/ I did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China. I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives. - Daryl Morey (@dmorey)  The Houston Rockets, purchased by hedge fund billionaire Tilman Fertitta in 2017, have a long history with basketball in China, linked in part to its decision to draft Yao Ming, one of the country's greatest sporting heroes, in 2002.The move not only introduced Yao, a 7-6 phenomenon who ultimately played nine years with the Rockets while earnings eight All Star recommendations, to an American audience but also marked the first major bridge between the U.S. and China, where professional basketball is now a $4 billion enterprise and more than 300 million people currently play the game.The NBA's account on Weibo, the popular online chatroom, has more than 33 million followers, far more than its official Twitter account, and videos from last year's playoffs were watched some 2.9 billion times in the China market.With so much at stake for both the league and many of its star players, who earn lucrative sponsorship dollars in the world's second-largest economy, the NBA moved swiftly to distance itself from Morey's Tweet, noting it was "extremely disappointed in the inappropriate remarks" while adding it has "great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together".That response, however, drew sharp criticism from several U.S. lawmakers, including Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who accused the league of putting profits before principle."The NBA wants money, and the Communist Party of China is asking them to deny the most basic of human rights," Sasse said in a statement. "In response, the NBA issued a statement saying money is the most important thing."The league's most-decorated franchise, the Los Angeles Lakers, is scheduled to play an exhibition game this Thursday in Shanghai against the Brooklyn Nets, which is owned by the founder of online e-commerce giant Alibaba Holding Co.  Joseph Tasai."Supporting a separatist movement in a Chinese territory is one of those third-rail issues, not only for the Chinese government, but also for citizens of China," Tasai wrote on his Facebook page."The one thing that is terribly misunderstood, and often ignored, by the western press and those critical of China, is that 1.4 billion Chinese citizens stand united when it comes to the territorial integrity of China and the country's sovereignty over her homeland. This issue is non-negotiable," he added.Load-Date: October 9, 2019End of Document

Huawei security chief: Blocking one company doesn't address full security riskFierceWirelessSeptember 18, 2019Copyright 2019 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 1131 wordsByline: Bevin FletcherHighlight: At this year's Competitive Carriers Association (CCA) annual convention, both FCC officials and Huawei executives were on-site addressing network security in front of audience members including some rural wireless carriers that stand to be impacted by ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China. BodyPROVIDENCE, Rhode Island—At this year's Competitive Carriers Association (CCA) annual convention, both FCC officials and Huawei executives were on-site addressing network security in front of audience members, including some rural wireless carriers that stand to be impacted by ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China.Huawei was put on the U.S. Commerce Department's Entity List in May due to national security risks, effectively blacklisting the Chinese telecom equipment giant and certain affiliates from purchasing certain technology and components from American companies. The Trump administration has also pressed global allies to exclude Huawei from next-generation 5G networks, raising concerns that the Chinese government could use the vendor as an apparatus for attacks or cyberespionage.Huawei has consistently denied allegations, and the company's chief security officer Andy Purdy told FierceWireless that Huawei has gotten caught up in the broader trade dispute between the U.S. and China at “no fault of our [Huawei's] own,” and that the company recommends developing an approach that addresses security risks posed by all vendors.“Blocking [Huawei] isn't going to make America safer, you need a comprehensive approach,” Purdy said, adding Huawei encourages efforts like those by the European Union through ENISA (European Networking Information Security Agency), which is working to create broad risk mitigation mechanisms.He also said there are multiple governments in the world that have the ability to “virtually implant hidden functionality in hardware or software that's very difficult to find.”“There needs to be testing in place to make sure that whoever's equipment it is, has not been tainted by the conduct of some hostile government or some other hostile sophisticated malicious actor,” Purdy said. “Blocking one company doesn't help you address that very real risk."Starks calls out HuaweiIn the U.S., Huawei already supplies telecom equipment for about 40 rural wireless companies, and the government is weighing options for how to identify and fix insecure equipment, including a so-called “rip and replace” method, which could cost between hundreds of millions to more than a billion dollars.FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks has taken the leadat the agency in addressing this issue, and held a workshop over the summer to gather input from stakeholders on approaches, including funding for smaller operators who may be unable to shoulder the economic burden. The government is also considering withholding federal funds from operators that use network equipment deemed as potentially risky.While speaking at a CCA keynote on Tuesday, Starksacknowledged that stretching out the replacement timeline, and letting insecure equipment simply age out of service could save millions.“We must weigh this potential savings, however, against the possible risk to our national security while this equipment remains in place,” Starks said. He also called out concerns over Huawei specifically.“Experts say that the equipment made by Huawei and other Chinese manufacturers presents serious security vulnerabilities. According to these experts, Huawei software does not have the same consistency from installation to installation as its competitors. Programming variations make it difficult or impossible even for Huawei to know exactly what software is deployed in a given build, and whether the equipment will accept software updates,” Starks said. “Security experts tell us that this ‘bugginess' in Huawei software means that it has ‘front doors' accessible by both the company and by bad actors familiar with exploiting inconsistencies and flaws in Huawei code.”Huawei's defenseHuawei, for its part, sponsored a seminar at the event titled “Let's Collaborate to Make America's Communication Networks Safer,” where panelists stressed the need for consistent rules and standards for securing telecom networks.Speaking at the session, Purdy said there is a need to create better monitoring capabilities in general and greater transparency, and pointed to efforts by GSMA and 3GPP working with operators and equipment vendors to create standards and a certification process for next-generation telecom equipment.“As part of transparency, in our space when equipment vendors are working with operators to service the equipment or service the networks there are methods that can be used and should be used that make it quite clear to both the telecom operators and the governments if necessary that there is limited ability of the equipment vendors to access any data that they're not supposed to access or to turn over that data to anyone they're not supposed to turn it over to,” said Purdy. “Methods that provide both assurance and transparency are absolutely essential as part of verification and conformance.”He said the company is hopeful for efforts in other countries like Germany and Europe to create global measures for knowingand being able to test and ensure trustworthiness of products and services. The U.K. notably is still deciding whether to bar Huawei equipment from its own 5G networks.RELATED: CCA members look for answers amid U.S. crackdown on HuaweiSpeaking to FierceWireless, Purdy said that he thinks due to the U.S.-China trade dispute Huawei hasn't been able to engage in discussions with the U.S. government that would otherwise normally take place to potentially resolve the company's situation.When asked what those talks would entail, Purdy said: “We would have discussions with them about what real cybersecurity risk is, what's necessary to be done about it, and talk about proven mechanisms to address risk, such as those that allow Nokia and Ericsson to do business in the United States in a fairly unrestricted way because they have government monitored risk mitigation agreements in place, and we'd like to talk to the government about whether something like that could be developed for us.”Earlier this year the FCC denied an application from a different Chinese entity, China Mobile, which was seeking authorization to provide telecom services in the U.S. That application was denied on the grounds of national security risks related to influence by the Chinese government on recommendations from U.S. security officials and found that a risk mitigation agreement would not be effective against threats because of the company's ties to the Chinese government.In his keynote, Starks noted the FCC is now also reviewing the existing authority of two other Chinese telecom carriers to determine if they present the same type of threat.Resolution between the U.S. and China remains to be seen, but Purdy said he thinks that once that happens it's likely the U.S. will “finally be willing to talk to [Huawei], and we look forward to that.”Load-Date: September 19, 2019End of Document

China will release 10,000 tons of pork from its national reservesCNN WireSeptember 17, 2019 Tuesday 11:45 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 438 wordsByline: By Laura He and Serenitie Wang, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  China will release 10,000 metric tons of pork from its central reserves this week in a bid to stabilize soaring pork prices and cope with a swine fever crisis that has wiped out roughly one third of its pigs.The frozen pork will be auctioned online on Thursday afternoon, China Merchandise Reserve Management Center, a state-owned company that manages the reserves, said in a statement on Tuesday. The pork is imported from the United States, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Germany, France and Chile. Major suppliers include American firms Smithfield, Clemens Food and Seaboard, as well as Denmark's Danish Crown.The order to release the reserves came from several Chinese government bodies including the Ministry of Commerce and the Agricultural Development Bank of China, the reserve management center said.Companies interested in the online auction need to sign up with the center in advance and be vetted by the Commerce Ministry before Thursday. Each bidder can only buy up to 300 tons. China Merchandise Reserve Management Center stores and manages China's central reserves of resources that the country considers strategically important, including frozen pork, live pigs, other frozen meat and sugar. The Chinese pork market --- the world's largest --- has been ravaged by an outbreak of African swine fever. China has lost more than 100 million pigs in the last year, either because of disease or because farmers don't want to restock pigs after they die. The decline has driven pork prices up nearly 50% in the last year.Pork is a staple of the Chinese diet, and the decision to boost supplies comes as the country prepares to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China early next month. Releases from the reserves are often timed to coincide with major festivals. At least four Chinese cities or provinces that are home to roughly 130 million people have already released some of their local reserves of frozen pig meat in the past few weeks. But Thursday will be the first time since January that China's central government has tapped into its reserves.Using government reserves is not the only way China is dealing with the worsening pork crisis.Officials have handed out subsidies worth about 3.2 billion yuan ($452 million) to low-income families who may struggle to afford pork at current prices.Chinese authorities have also asked local governments to free up money that could be used for artificial insemination technology, a way to encourage farmers and producers to breed more hogs. TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Journalists are required to register with the app.• The exam will have five sections. • Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.Chinese journalists will soon have to prove their knowledge of President Xi Jinping and Marxism before they can continue reporting. In order to receive updated press passes, more than 10,000 reporters and editors will have to pass a test.Starting next month, The South China Morning Post reports, journalists will began taking "pilot tests" through a state-run app called Xuexi Qiangguo. The app aggregates favorable articles, video clips, and documentaries that illustrate Xi's political philosophy.A notice issued in August from the Communist Party of China's media oversight office in the propaganda department says the pilot tests will occur before a nationwide exam. Of the five knowledge sections that will be on the test, at least two will be related to Xi's political philosophy, and one will be on Marxism. Photo by May James/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty ImagesIt is currently unknown when the nationwide tests will occur. Journalists from 14 state-run media organizations will have to take them before updated press passes are issued to those who pass. With the app, launched in January, the Morning Post says Xuexi Qiangguo is another way the Chinese government is using technology "to strengthen its ideological control in China."The notice from the media oversight office says journalists who fail the test will have one chance to take it again, but without passing, there is no other way to get a state press pass. When the app first launched, journalists were required to download it and register accounts with their real names.Read more: China cancels plans to visit with US farmers next weekAfter complaints, using the app - which roughly translates to "Study Xi, Strong Nation" - no longer became mandatory, but it is encouraged. The app keeps track of user data, including points that can be won by using the app, which is accessible by the Chinese propaganda department. It has been compared to Mao Zedong's "Little Red Book" in digital form.An editor who did not wish to be identified told the Morning Post that he was confident he'd be able to pass the test."I'm very good at this kind of stuff - I cover it every day pretty much," he said.

US businesses are trying to please America and China. That's proving difficultCNN WireOctober 8, 2019 Tuesday 1:49 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 407 wordsByline: By Christine Romans, CNN BusinessDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  Doing business in China's coveted consumer market comes with very big moral concessions for American companies. If history is a guide, profit motive will trump principal.The NBA has found itself in a conundrum similarly faced by airlines, hotel chains, retailers, tech companies and virtually any company that wants to do business in China: Toe the Communist party line on Hong Kong protests, Uyghur Muslims, Taiwan's independence claims and Tibet --- or face threats of losing access to the market."If you are doing business in China, your political views will be sanitized..." in line with China's wishes, said Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, on CNN's "New Day" Tuesday.Before these Hong Kong protests, the most visible flashpoint has been Taiwan. Airlines quickly caved to Chinese demands to change drop-down menus and maps to read "Taiwan, China" rather than simply "Taiwan." Taiwan is a self-ruled democracy that Beijing insists be treated as part of mainland China. China's aviation authority demands Hong Kong and Macau must also be clearly labeled as part of China.At the time, the US government called China's language police "Orwellian nonsense." The White House "will stand up for Americans resisting efforts by the Chinese Communist Party to impose Chinese political correctness on American companies and citizens," according to Reuters.But the companies themselves rarely stand against the Chinese government: Gap last year apologized for a T-shirt with a map of China that did not include Taiwan. Tech blogs noticed this week that Apple is hiding the Taiwan flag from its emoji keyboard for users whose iOS settings are Hong Kong or Macau. Last year, a Marriott employee was quickly fired, and Marriott apologized, for liking a social media post about Tibet. It goes beyond just swallowing your democratic principles to sell T-shirts or plane tickets. It's a major concern for China hawks who say the regime uses American technology at odds with American human rights standards --- say, to track Hong Kong protestors or to monitor and detain Muslim minorities in the remote Northwest of the country. China claims it is combating terrorism. The Commerce Department sees otherwise and has added 28 Chinese companies to its list of banned exports, trying to keep American companies from helping China's police state.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

On China's National Day, USCIRF Urges U.S. Government to Take Action on Religious FreedomTargeted News ServiceOctober 1, 2019 Tuesday 7:21 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 429 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom issued the following news release:Today marks the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China, also known as National Day. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) continues to urge the U.S. government to take decisive action against the Chinese Communist Party's ongoing campaign of repression against Uighur Muslims, Tibetan Buddhists, Christians, Falun Gong practitioners and other religious groups."Communist China's actions represent a wholesale assault on the very idea of independent religion," said USCIRF Commissioner Gary Bauer. "Hundreds of thousands of Chinese citizens are being locked up or harassed simply because they choose to believe in a god other than Xi Jinping. Now is the time for the U.S. government to use all the tools at its disposal, including targeted sanctions and visa bans, to hold the Chinese officials responsible for this campaign of repression accountable.""USCIRF remains extremely concerned about worsening religious freedom conditions in China and the lengths to which the Chinese Communist Party goes to deny and deceive the international community about its appalling human rights record," added Commissioner Tenzin Dorjee. "Harassing, disappearing, interning, and imprisoning people is no way to treat peaceful religious believers. The U.S. government cannot turn a blind eye towards these violations."In its 2019 Annual Report, USCIRF recommended that the U.S. government use its authority under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act and International Religious Freedom Act to enact targeted sanctions and visa bans against Chinese officials responsible for these abuses, especially Chen Quanguo, the Communist Party Secretary of Xinjiang. USCIRF recently released a report documenting how the Chinese government uses surveillance cameras, biometric technology and artificial intelligence to monitor and harass religious communities.* * *The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) is an independent, bipartisan federal government entity established by the U.S. Congress to monitor, analyze and report on threats to religious freedom abroad. USCIRF makes foreign policy recommendations to the President, the Secretary of State and Congress intended to deter religious persecution and promote freedom of religion and belief.

AT 25, BRANDEIS INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS SCHOOL HAS FOUND ITS NICHEStates News ServiceSeptember 16, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1715 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: Waltham, MA BodyThe following information was released by Brandeis University:A view from inside the World Court at Brandeis International Business SchoolBy Frank Gibney Jr.Peter Petri, the Carl J. Shapiro Professor of International FinanceBrandeis International Business School celebrates its 25th anniversary with an all-alumni reunion Sept. 20 through 22.In the late 1980s, in the wake of the Latin American debt crisis but before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the spectacular crash of Japan's economy, Peter Petri had a palpable sense that transactions around the world were speeding up and beginning to intertwine, often with unintended consequences for corporations and countries.The world was changing fast, recalls Petri, then an associate professor of economics at Brandeis. The third world was becoming the developing world. Parts of the developing world were soon developed. If mighty Japan was in trouble, other East Asian economies were surging ahead. Latin America, too, was on the move again.Nothing less than an economic earthquake was underway, Petri says. The economic imbalances, not to mention the social and political upheaval, begged for new rule books for business policy and the analysis of business opportunities.A graduate professional school focused on the world's rapidly interconnecting economies could add value, Petri and some of his economist colleagues believed. We wanted to explore the workings of the global economy, and design a comprehensive and intellectually demanding program on the practical implications of all this change, he explains.The question was how to leverage the Brandeis economics department's strengths in the new international arena. Petri and his colleagues didn't want to create a traditional read Harvard business school. In that arena, a tiny upstart would struggle to compete for students. Also, Petri says, we saw general management as a genteel field that belonged to the Establishment.Students at the Sachar International Center in 1994After much discussion, Petri and his colleagues determined their approach. Finance was the quickest way to get to the nuts and bolts of how the world was changing, he says.Advocating an ambitious business curriculum focused on globalization before that trend's economic significance was recognized as critical was initially a hard sell. But today Brandeis International Business School, which celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, is well-positioned to explore and troubleshoot the systemic shortcomings, rolling crises and collateral effects caused by societies grappling with rapid change.Consider these examples: The European Union deals with a refugee influx and ultra-nationalist, authoritarian governments on its fringes. Britain has elected a volatile former journalist as its prime minister. Russia seems to lurk everywhere, particularly in cyberspace, conducting proxy attacks on Western financial and political systems. Traditional currencies are being threatened by blockchain technology. The United States and China, the world's two most powerful economies, are engaged in a slugfest over a massive trade imbalance and bragging rights to next-generation technologies in sensitive areas like artificial intelligence and cellular communications.The International Business School's founding was prescient if anything presents a challenge for the leaders of countries and companies, it's negotiating economic interdependence in a digital world that was unimaginable 25, or even 10, years ago. And its brand is rooted in scrappy hard fields, such as the economics of exchange rates, new financial instruments, data analytics and fintech.The Lemberg Program in International Economics and Finance, the business school's earliest direct ancestor, was launched informally in 1987 in an entrepreneurial atmosphere, with Petri as its founding director. It offered a master's degree to an initial class of 12. In 1994, the Lemberg Program and a new PhD program were institutionalized as the Graduate School of International Economics and Finance, with Petri as dean. Fifty students from a handful of countries were enrolled, including many Fulbright Scholars, a practice that continues today.In 2003, the school was renamed once again, as Brandeis International Business School. As it grew, it added faculty at the frontiers of the new world of business, including Stephen Cecchetti, the Rosen Family Chair in International Finance, formerly chief economist at the Bank for International Settlements; former faculty member Catherine Mann, who was chief economist at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development; and associate professor of finance Anna Scherbina, a senior economist at the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers and an expert on cybersecurity analysis.This fall, the International Business School welcomed an entering class of almost 300 students representing 100 countries now, that's globalization.Petri, the Carl J. Shapiro Professor of International Finance, and a nonresident scholar at the Brookings Institution, is disarmingly relaxed for someone who is often trying to solve several multilayered trade puzzles at the same time. His work extends far beyond Waltham to Washington, D.C.; Europe; and Asia particularly Japan and China where he strategizes with counterparts and policymakers.China's economic development in recent decades enabled it to leapfrog directly into the digital era, leaving many international analysts scratching their heads. In response, the business school curriculum by emphasizing experiential learning and a familiarity with globalized, data-driven transactions is producing adept, innovative corporate and government economists, and investment managers.Photo/Mike LovettDean Kathryn Graddy, the Fred and Rita Richman Distinguished Professor in EconomicsThese alumni now work everywhere London, Shanghai, New York City, Hong Kong, Berlin and Tokyo, to name just a few crossroads of global decision making. In an environment like this, it's very important to continue expanding relationships around the world, says Kathryn Graddy, the Fred and Rita Richman Distinguished Professor in Economics, who became dean in 2018. Whether it's China, India or Japan, this is when we double down.Graddy is already laying a foundation for the next 25 years. We are academically rigorous, experiential and global, she says. The International Business School's quantitative strength has been reinforced: All its programs are now STEM-designated, enabling eligible international students to work in the U.S. for up to three years after graduation. The curriculum includes the Hassenfeld Fellow Overseas Immersion Program, which offers students hands-on experience at companies around the world, a feature not found at many business schools.Though seemingly counterintuitive for a school Graddy calls Brandeis' global arm, its core mission can be summed up by an adjective rarely applied to business schools: human. We care deeply about preparing individuals to be global leaders, Graddy says.The humanistic focus dates back to the school's early days. Board of Trustees member Lan Xue '90, MA'91, who graduated in the Lemberg Program's second class, came to Brandeis as an undergraduate through a Wien International Scholarship. Today, she runs a billion-dollar global hedge fund from Hong Kong and Shanghai. Xue has given Brandeis $1 million for student scholarships. One part of American culture I value a lot is the idea that you pay it forward, she says. I'm now in a position where I can contribute to what I hope will be a boost for the next generation.Chinese students represent the single largest international group at the business school; at Brandeis generally; and at U.S. universities, where, this year alone, 360,000 Chinese men and women are enrolled. For the most part, the Chinese students who came to Brandeis in the 1980s had little money, relying on Chinese government funding or scholarship programs like the Wien to pay for their education. Most enrolled as undergraduates. By the late 1990s, the number of Chinese students entering Brandeis was greater, and most were going directly to the business school.Petri who, while consulting in Asia for the World Bank, had met many high-performing U.S.-educated Chinese officials realized China could be a key area of focus for the school. Today, in fact, a couple of International Business School alumni work within the World Bank's top tiers. More than that, business school alumni have been spreading the word about Brandeis in China for 25 years, attracting Chinese students to IBS as well as to graduate and undergraduate programs in scientific research and computer science.So far, more than 1,400 Chinese alumni most of them International Business School graduates have returned to China. President Ron Liebowitz hopes to establish a presence in China, to add cohesion to the alumni community and ease future graduates' transition to the workforce. In addition, he says, he'd like to see more Brandeis undergraduates study abroad in China.To underscore his interest, Liebowitz made his first trip to China in April, returning again in July for a working vacation. As the U.S. and China try to negotiate a difficult time in their relationship, the Chinese seem very appreciative that we are making the effort to be in China, says Graddy.During the April trip, Liebowitz presented Roberta Lipson '76, who exemplifies the ever-expanding range of business opportunities in China, with the 2019 Asper Award for Global Entrepreneurship. In 1994, Lipson co-founded what has become one of China's largest networks of private hospitals and modern health-care facilities. In July, her company, United Family Healthcare, was acquired by New Frontier Corp. and will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.At the end of the award ceremony, in front of a predominantly Chinese audience of 150 International Business School alumni, parents and friends, Lipson's acceptance remarks were characteristically modest. Brandeis gives its students the opportunity to pursue their passions, she said in colloquial Mandarin. For that, I am forever grateful.Frank Gibney Jr. is a writer and editor.

Canada bids rare earths to U.S., seeks to compete with ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 1, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 335 wordsBodyCanada is a strong ally for the United States and could leverage the trade war with China to become the main supplier of rare earths currently imported from Asia.Us trade dependence on China is imminent and it is inescapable that Donald Trump's declared government-driven trade war poses risks to the US market, so it has intensified efforts to lessen its ties with the Asian giant.In this context, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau presented President Donald Trump with the possibility of seeing Canada as his ally and source of rare earth import that is necessary for modern technology.  "It is in our interest to ensure that we have reliable supplies of these important minerals," he said.China controls more than 90% of the global supply of these minerals used in intelligence phones, solar panels and even military technologies. It is also the world's leading producer and refiner.In the midst of a trade war between Washington and Beijing, the Chinese government has made it understanding that it could block its rare earth exports, which are much required in state-of-the-art American industries. By 2010, China had already halted its rare earth exports to Japan due to a territorial dispute.Canada and China's trade relationship has also been tense disregarded in recent times with the arrest of a Chinese leader Huawei on extradition request by the U.S. government.Canada and China's trade relationship has also been tense disregarded in recent times with the arrest of a Chinese leader Huawei on extradition request by the U.S. government.In May 2019, rumors of a trade war between China and Canada came to strength when Canadian Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau announced he had received reports of the suspension of pork export permits to two companies and months previously the canola export blockade was announced.The arrest of Meng Wanzhou, a high-ranking executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei, and daughter of the firm's founder, may have been behind that decision, some experts say.Load-Date: October 3, 2019End of Document

It's time for China to realize its influenceWestern Courier: Western Illinois UniversitySeptember 18, 2019 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINIONS; Pg. 1Length: 318 wordsBodyWhen President Donald Trump ran for office in the 2016 election, one of his many criticisms was the relationship between the United States and China. Trump would constantly criticize the way China manipulated its currency, was involved in intellectual property theft against U.S. products and engaged in unfair trading practices.From then on, Washington and Beijing would reply in an exchange of tariff increases from products pertaining to agriculture and computer software. China has been a key trading partner to the U.S. for over a decade; its rise in the global market has had a significant effect in modern times, but some people are starting to view the country as more of an adversary.From an economic standpoint, the increase in China's influence will be felt immensely in international relations. According to Chinese estimates, China is expected to be an economic superpower by 2035, surpassing the United States.One reason this makes it increasingly difficult for other nations is the fact that China still regards itself as a developing country. In October 2017, Chinese President Xi Jinping stated that China was both "strong" and "great" 26 times, but still regarded China as "the world's largest developing country."This approach by China draws countless criticism from countries like the U.S., who complain that the Chinese government makes it increasingly difficult to be partners with such limited and controlled markets and high tariffs; this results in the U.S. having large deficits in imports. As a result, the Trump administration has retaliated against China's practices by increasing tariffs on their behalf, to the dismay of China.China's unwillingness to accept the responsibility as being the second largest global economy by refusing to allow more access to their markets only negatively affects nations who are denied such production capabilities that China is unwilling to share.Load-Date: September 19, 2019End of Document

CHINA: RELEASE SUPPORTERS OF HONG KONG PROTESTSStates News ServiceOctober 3, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 949 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Chinese authorities should immediately release activists detained in China for peacefully voicing support for the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, Human Rights Watch said today. Authorities should also cease harassing activists, students, and their families for sharing protest-related information on social media, and allow mainland Chinese to participate in peaceful protests in Hong Kong."Mainland authorities fear that the protests in Hong Kong could inspire challenges to the government, prompting Beijing to suppress any signs of support for the Hong Kong protesters," said Sophie Richardson, China director. "Mainlanders' support for democracy shows that this is a value shared by people on both sides of the border."Mainlanders' support for democracy shows that this is a value shared by people on both sides of the border.Sophie RichardsonChina DirectorSince early June 2019, massive street demonstrations in Hong Kong, initially about proposed changes to the laws that would allow extraditions to mainland China, have evolved into a movement for universal suffrage and police accountability. Mainland authorities have strictly censored related news and launched a disinformation campaign that falsely frames Hong Kong's protests as a violent and extreme separatist movement instigated by foreign governments.Mainland authorities since June have detained and harassed dozens of activists and netizens who showed support for the protests, and warned students and others not to participate in them.Mainland activists who remain detained in relation to the Hong Kong protests include:Quan Shixin: On July 25, Beijing authorities detained Quan Shixin, accusing her of "picking quarrels." Quan was formally arrested a month later. She had criticized the Chinese government and expressed support for the Hong Kong protests on Twitter. In September 2018, Quan was detained for 10 days for her tweets criticizing Chinese Communist Party leaders.Ba Luning: On August 14, police in Shandong province detained Ba Luning on suspicion of "picking quarrels." Ba had sent messages to private WeChat group chats, voicing his support for the Hong Kong protests.Lai Rifu: On September 15, Guangzhou police detained Lai Rifu on suspicion of "picking quarrels." Lai had earlier shared "Glory to Hong Kong," a song composed during the protests that has become the unofficial anthem of the pro-democracy movement, on his WeChat and Facebook accounts.Chen Yunfei: On September 19, police in Sichuan province detained Chen Yunfei, an artist and activist, on unreported charges. Chen had in days prior spoken to foreign media and tweeted about the protests. Chen had been released from prison in March after serving four years for his social media posts critical of the Chinese government and his various performance art projects.Under article 293 of China's Criminal Law, the crime of "picking quarrels" carries a sentence of up to five years in prison for first-time offenders. The offense is broadly defined to include online behavior and is frequently used by authorities to criminalize peaceful criticism of the Chinese government.The authorities have detained for days and released an unreported number of activists and netizens for their Hong Kong protest-related speech. In August, Guangdong authorities detained activist Hu Haibo for 15 days after he returned from Hong Kong, where he participated in the protests. Police had earlier followed him to Hong Kong, a friend of Hu's said.Beijing-based artist Hou Zhihui was detained in August for 37 days after he posted on Weibo criticism of Fu Guohao, a reporter for the Chinese state media who was beaten by protesters at Hong Kong's airport. In September, Hangzhou-based democracy activist Mao Qingxiang was detained for seven days for his WeChat posts about Hong Kong.Police across China have also harassed and summoned for questioning numerous activists, intellectuals, and regular social media users. Chen Simin, a Hunan-based activist, received daily phone calls from the police after he posted online selfies of himself covering his right eye, a gesture of solidarity for a Hong Kong woman who suffered an eye injury during a clash between the police and protesters. After Beijing-based human rights lawyer Chen Qiushi posted videos of himself at protest scenes in Hong Kong, the police called and forced him to return to the mainland by threatening his family and friends. Chen's Weibo account was also removed.Human Rights Watch has also learned that Chinese authorities have warned mainland students studying in Hong Kong not to participate in the protests. While in the mainland for summer break, police forced some students to sign pledges stating that they would not go to the protests upon returning to Hong Kong. Some received phone calls and text messages from the police ordering them to stay away from "illegal mass protests and street violence" and to "love the country, love Hong Kong." Some students' parents received warnings as well.Chinese authorities have also harassed family members in China of mainland students in Australia for their activities supporting the Hong Kong protests, the media reported.Previously, Chinese courts had handed down harsh sentences to a number of Chinese activists for peacefully voicing their support for Hong Kong's pro-democracy Umbrella Movement in 2014."Mainland activists and netizens have braved great risks to show solidarity with Hong Kong people protesting for universal human rights," Richardson said. "Governments around the world should support them by speaking out for basic rights and against Chinese government repression."Load-Date: October 4, 2019End of Document

Mao Zedong, the bloodthirsty communist leader who became an object of worshipCE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 1, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1439 wordsBody       Mao Zedong (Sovfoto/Universal Images Group/Shutterstock (3826953a)) (Sovfoto/Universal Images Group/Shutterstock/)Mao was just ten years old when the first, timid translation of Marxist theory appeared in China, in 1903. It was just a fragment of Marxism, a simple quote from the Communist Manifesto, taken from a Japanese book entitled Contemporary Socialism that addressed the history and development of that ideology. Other books and articles followed this fledgling publication, but it was only in 1908 that Engels' entire preface to the 1888 edition of the Communist Manifesto was published in a magazine called Justice of heaven. In East Asia, socialist ideas entered Japan initially, especially in Christian circles. Chinese students in Japan returned to their country bringing socialist and communist ideas with them. Chinese students in Paris also embraced anarchism and imported it into their country. It was from Tokyo and Paris, before Moscow, that socialism, communism and anarchism came to China. Young Mao's subsequent exposure to Marx and Engels' ideas would have a profound and lasting impact on him and, eventually, throughout China. "Communism is not love," Mao concluded after his immersion in studying this doctrine, "Communism is a hammer used to crush the enemy."Mao's adherence to communism was not due to ignorance or lack of options. As a child he learned Confustianism and classical Chinese literature. He mown slither with the full Mirror for Government Aid, by Zizhi Tongjian (11th century), and with Essential Things about Countries and Regions to Study History, by Tushi Fangyu Jiyao (17th century), as well as with non-canonical Chinese classics such as The Three Kingdoms , The Margin of Water and Journey to the West. As a teenager he read about Napoleon, Peter the Great, Wellington, Lincoln and George Washington. As a young adult he dabbled in The Spirit of the Laws of Montesquieu, The Social Contract of Rousseau, The Wealth of the Nations of Smith, The Origin of Darwin's Species as well as texts by John Stuart Mill, Herbert Spencer and Thomas Huxley, translated from English by Chinese academics who studied in England or taken from Japanese translations. A copy of Mao's library that survived with his annotations was the Chinese translation of a system of ethics by the philosopher Friedrich Paulsen. One of her notes reads: "Let destruction play the role of a mother who gives life to a new country." So Mao had contact with Western ideas about democracy, freedom, the individual, the free-market economy, legality and the relationship between government and governed. But he was seduced by Marxism, and at an early age he already proposed to apply "extreme communism" in China with his "methods of class dictatorship".In 1920, Mao opened his own cultural bookstore in the city of Hunan, which sold leftist, socialist and Marxist texts, as an introduction to The Capital, a study on New Russia, The Soviet System and China, as well as the Chinese magazine Mundo de los Workers. The business prospered and opened another seven branches. The following year, at twenty-seven years old, he co-founded the Chinese Communist Party. From now on, China's fate would change completely. For the next three decades or so, Mao fought in his country's civil wars, dealt with Joseph Stalin, ran sideways to his adversaries, fought against the Japanese, formed several families, overcame challengesimposed by the communist government in some Chinese locations. All this, as one historian noted, was before he seized power in his country. Once he took control of China, this Great Timonel subjected his hundreds of millions of subjects to an entirely avoidable mass famine, a deranged cultural revolution, an exalted cult of his personality, failed socio-economic experiments and various personal whims for nearly three decades that left the paranoid, terrified and exhausted population.The Chinese leader was willing to cause great human devastation on an inconceivable scale in order to achieve his economic goals and realize his political fantasies. His recipe for the "Great Leap Forward" and his "Cultural Revolution" caused the death of between 45-60 million people. "It might well have to die half of China," said Mao, indifferent to the colossal suffering he was causing. His contempt for life (other) was expressed in his singularly eloquent phrase: "When theologians speak of the day of the Last Judgment, they are pessimistic and terrify people. We say that the end of humanity is something that will produce something more advanced than humanity. Humanity is still in its infancy."Not even the animal kingdom escaped its destructive wand. Unusually, Mao accused the sparrows of devouring the grains that could feed Chinese children and incited farmers to attack them. Rural China thus experienced a massive anti-sparing crusade that was implemented through a war of sounds. The peasants banged their pans noisily to keep the birds scared in the air as their children broke their nests in the trees. The result of this national campaign was successful: millions of sparrows fell to earth dead of exhaustion. This absurd hunt brought an unanticipated consequence by Big Timonel. In the absence of sparrows, the insects that damaged the crops had the free way to decimate them, and with the ruined crops the peasants were starved to such an extent that cannibalism occasionally emerged.While the animal kingdom and the human race suffered the consequences of their policies in China, Mao took the time to write. Indeed, it would be perfectly reasonable to argue that had he not entered politics, he could have been an essayist and a poet of scale. Mao wrote from a young age, reflecting through the pen his many political and personal experiences. After the fighting, he wrote; after the separations of their wives, he wrote; after his partisan triumphs, he wrote. Mao was a serious ideologue and creator of captivating phrases that resonated in almost every confines on Earth. As the British journalist Daniel Kalder noted, as well as the commercial slogan Just Do It! is universally recognized today, many of Mao's linguistic creations achieved worldwide fame in his time, especially, but not exclusively, among his Fans. Among them: "Revolution is not a banquet", "Political power is born from the barrel of a weapon", "A single spark can burn the meadow", "All reactionaries are paper tigers", "Marxists are not fortune tellers" and "The sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie ".Such was the number of hoses, reflections, poems, articles and speeches written and delivered by Mao, that in the mid-1960s the Chinese government decided to bring them together in a single official compendium. He was known interchangeably as Quotes from Chairman Mao, The Little Red Book or The Book of the Red Treasure. With Mao still alive in the 1960s, more than one billion copies were printed in China alone, a garrison that surpassed the local population of the(750 million). Soon, the Chinese communist regime initiated translations into foreign languages. By 1971, the summit literary work of Maoism counted 110 million copies spread over thirty-six different languages. Guerrilla movements, especially in Peru, Nepal, Cambodia and India, launched violent insurrections inspired by their ideas. His influence was noted from Tanzania to Albania, from Italy to Yugoslavia and from Moscow to California. He ideologically swept the Third World and romantically seduced intellectuals such as Julia Kristeva, Jean-Paul Sartre, Michel Foucalt and Alan Badiou. It is estimated that his compendium is the most read text in history, second only to the Bible.The Aesthetic Mao with the sun's rays rising behind his smiling face was reproduced in series and all of China was covered in posters with its radiant image. Gold statues that corporatize it were located in the streets, squares and universities of the cities. His face was printed on billions of pins so that the Chinese could nail them to their clothes, close to their hearts. National banknotes, keychains, lighters, yo-yos, watches and cards in millions of quantities carried their face printed on them. Talismans with his image hung from the mirrors in taxi drivers' cars and his figure appeared on home altars. Mao's biographies have been extremely popular and sold large quantities of copies.His Red Book and his figure's merchandising were a successful capitalist business. Not bad for a communist.The author is Professor of World Politics in the career of International Relations at the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Palermo.Load-Date: October 2, 2019End of Document

Chinese snooping tech spreads to nations vulnerable to abuseAssociated Press InternationalOctober 17, 2019 Thursday 8:45 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 1323 wordsByline: By DUSAN STOJANOVIC, Associated PressDateline: BELGRADE, Serbia BodyBELGRADE, Serbia (AP) - When hundreds of video cameras with the power to identify and track individuals started appearing in the streets of Belgrade as part of a major surveillance project, some protesters began having second thoughts about joining anti-government demonstrations in the Serbian capital.Local authorities assert the system, created by Chinese telecommunications company Huawei, helps reduce crime in the city of 2 million. Critics contend it erodes personal freedoms, makes political opponents vulnerable to retribution and even exposes the country's citizens to snooping by the Chinese government.The cameras, equipped with facial recognition technology, are being rolled out across hundreds of cities around the world, particularly in poorer countries with weak track records on human rights where Beijing has increased its influence through big business deals. With the United States claiming that Chinese state authorities can get backdoor access to Huawei data, the aggressive rollout is raising concerns about the privacy of millions of people in countries with little power to stand up to China."The system can be used to trail political opponents, monitor regime critics at any moment, which is completely against the law," said Serbia's former commissioner for personal data protection, Rodoljub Sabic.Groups opposed to Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic say police are leaking video of protests to pro-government media, which publish the images, along with the identities of participants. Vucic himself has boasted the police have the capability to count "each head" at anti-government gatherings. During a recent rally, protesters climbed up a pole and covered a camera lens with duct tape scrawled with the word "censored."Serbian police deny any such abuse of the Huawei system, which will eventually encompass 1,000 cameras in 800 locations throughout Belgrade. Huawei said in a statement that it "complies with all applicable laws and regulations" in Serbia and anywhere else it does business.While facial recognition technology is being adopted in many countries, spurring debate over the balance between privacy and safety, the Huawei system has gained extra attention due to accusations that Chinese laws requiring companies to assist in national intelligence work give authorities access to its data.As a result, some countries are reconsidering using Huawei technology, particularly the superfast 5G networks that are being rolled out later this year.Still, Huawei, which denies accusations of any Chinese government control, has had no trouble finding customers eager to install its so-called Safe Cities technology, particularly among countries that China has brought closer into its diplomatic and economic orbit.Besides Serbia, that list includes Turkey, Russia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Angola, Laos, Kazakhstan, Kenya and Uganda, as well as a few liberal democracies like Germany, France and Italy. The system is used in some 230 cities, exposing tens of millions of people to its screening.In a promotional brochure, Huawei says its video surveillance technology can scan over long distances to detect "abnormal behavior" such as loitering, track the movement of cars and people, calculate crowd size and send alerts to a command center if it detects something suspicious. Local authorities can then act upon the information they receive.In one case advertised on its website, the company says a suspect in a hit-and-run accident in Belgrade was later discovered in China with the help of face recognition data shared by the Serbian police with their Chinese counterparts.In view of the cybersecurity accusations leveled by the U.S. and international rights groups against Huawei, the relationship between China and countries that use the company's technology is coming under renewed scrutiny.China's influence in Serbia, a European Union candidate that Beijing views as a gateway to the continent, has significantly expanded in recent years through Beijing's global Belt and Road investment programs. The populist Serbian regime has been keen to develop closer ties and the country's fragile democracy allows China's economic interests to grow relatively unchecked, without raising too many questions about human rights, environmental standards or transparency.China's state investment bank has granted billions of dollars in easy-term loans to build coal-powered plants, roads, railroads and bridges. Chinese police officers even help patrol the streets of Belgrade, a security presence officially billed as assisting the growing number of Chinese tourists who visit the city.It's a similar story in Uganda, where China has invested heavily in infrastructure like highways and a hydropower dam on the Nile.When longtime President Yoweri Museveni launched a $126-million project to install Huawei facial recognition systems a year ago, he said the cameras were "eyes, ears and a nose" to fight rampant street crime in the sprawling capital, Kampala. Opposition activists say the real goal is to deter street protesters against an increasingly unpopular government."The cameras are politically motivated," said Joel Ssenyonyi, a spokesman for the musician and activist known as Bobi Wine who has emerged as a powerful challenger to Museveni. "They are not doing this for security. The focus for them is hunting down political opponents."In neighboring Kenya, the government has also renewed its focus on public safety after a spate of extremist attacks. It has been pushing to register people digitally, including by recording DNA, iris and facial data. To do so, it turned to China, which helped finance the installation of surveillance cameras in Kenya as far back as 2012.The Kenyan government wants to pool into one database all the information from public and private CCTV cameras, including those with facial recognition technology, a move that activists warn would vastly expand its surveillance powers in a country that does not have comprehensive data protection laws.A growing number of countries are following China's lead in deploying artificial intelligence to track citizens, according to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The group says at least 75 countries are actively using AI tools such as facial recognition for surveillance - and Huawei has sold its systems in 50 of those countries, giving it a far wider reach than competitors such as Japan-based NEC and U.S.-based IBM."It's very unclear what safeguards are being put in place," said Steven Feldstein, a Carnegie Endowment fellow who authored a report on the issue. "Where are images being stored? How long are they being stored for? What kind of accountability procedures will there be? What type of operations will be linked to these surveillance cameras?"Huawei said in an emailed statement that it "complies with all applicable laws and regulations in our countries of business. This is the most fundamental principle of our business operations. We are dedicated to bringing people better connectivity, eliminating digital gaps, and promoting the sustainable development of our societies and economies."In Belgrade's bustling downtown Republic Square, high-tech video cameras are pointed in all directions from an office building as pedestrians hurry about their everyday business.With public authorities disclosing little about how the cameras work, a rights group has set up a tent to ask pedestrians whether they know they are being watched."We don't want to be in some kind of Big Brother society," said rights activist Ivana Markulic. "We are asking: Where are the cameras, where are they hidden, how much did we pay for them and what's going to happen with information collected after this surveillance?"___Associated Press writers Jovana Gec in Belgrade, Serbia; Rodney Muhumuza in Kampala, Uganda; Tom Odula in Nairobi, Kenya, and Matt O'Brien in Providence, Rhode Island, contributed to this report.Load-Date: October 18, 2019End of Document

Assistant Secretary of State Ford Issues Remarks at Multilateral Action on Sensitive Technologies ConferenceTargeted News ServiceSeptember 11, 2019 Wednesday 8:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4366 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Department of State's Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation issued the following remarks by Assistant Secretary Christopher Ashley Ford at the Multilateral Action on Sensitive Technologies conference:"This Multilateral Action on Sensitive Technologies (MAST) process is still quite a new one, but it is very promising - a valuable opportunity for likeminded countries to compare experiences and improve coordination on common technology-transfer threats intimately linked to our common security in a geopolitically challenging world. I have spoken before about the importance of cultivating "coalitions of caution" in high-technology engagement with the People's Republic of China (PRC) - and indeed in any engagement with our strategic competitors - and MAST is a good example of one of the ways in which this can be done. All your governments should be congratulated for coming together for this second annual plenary conference as a part of the ongoing MAST process. I hope you have found it as interesting and informative as we have.I. The Huawei Challenge"As my contribution to this event, I would like to say a few words about the Chinese technology giant Huawei, which has been in the news quite a bit recently, since it was placed on the U.S. Department of Commerce's "Entity List," which imposes restrictions upon U.S. commercial engagement with specified persons and entities. Huawei was nominated to be put on the Entity List by my bureau early this year, after it was indicted by the U.S. Justice Department in January 2019 for theft of trade secrets, attempted theft of trade secrets, conspiracy wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, as well as for bank fraud and conspiracy to commit bank fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) in illegally assisting Iran with sanctions evasion. The first tranche of the Huawei parent and its affiliates (69 entities) were duly placed on the Entity List in May 2019."A company may be placed on the Entity List when there is "reasonable cause to believe ... that the entity has been involved, is involved, or poses a significant risk of being or becoming involved in activities that are contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States," and indeed the U.S. Government did put Huawei on the Entity List for sound national security and foreign policy reasons. Nevertheless, there seems to have been some confusion on the part of those who imagine that our problems with that company are at root only economic or commercial, stemming merely from more general U.S. trade and tariff disputes with China. This confusion is compounded by the Chinese and Huawei propaganda machine as well. But this is far from being the case: unfortunately, Huawei also presents deep national security and foreign policy problems."Since we are here at this important MAST Conference to share perspectives on how to meet national security and foreign policy challenges related to potential transfers of sensitive technology, therefore, I am pleased to be able to have this opportunity to offer some more insight into the national security and foreign policy reasoning behind Huawei's listing. There will of course still be some limits upon what I can recount to you here, but I will offer you today as much information as I can."The facts do not paint a pretty picture. Nevertheless, I hope I will be able to convey to you the depth and seriousness of the Huawei problem.II. Tools of Communist Party Influence and Control, at Home and Abroad"The first thing to remember is that the challenge presented by Chinese technology giants such as Huawei is not, first and foremost, a specifically "technical" problem, though it naturally has important technical aspects. At its core, it is a political and a geopolitical challenge."Though they may have formally private ownership and operate in the national and in the international marketplace, global Chinese firms - including Huawei - are in key ways not genuinely private companies and do not make decisions entirely for economic and commercial reasons. Whether de facto or de jure, such giants can in some important respects or for some purposes act as arms of the state - or, more precisely, the Chinese Communist Party, to which the Chinese state apparatus is itself subordinate."Irrespective of their ostensibly private, commercial status, all such firms are subject to a deep and pervasive system of Chinese Communist Party control. This control is not limited merely to the possible establishment of Chinese Communist Party cells within a company's workforce and management structure - a development employed for many years by the Chinese Communist Party in China, but which has been expanding under Xi Jinping and is even being extended to foreign-owned companies operating in China - but also includes a formidable arsenal of state- and Party-manipulable pressures and incentives. There is also a deep bench of expansively-worded Chinese laws that require cooperation with state officials in virtually all matters, a heavy-handed security apparatus in no way shy about using such coercive tools, and a Party-run judicial system that precludes effective legal recourse to anyone with whom the Chinese Communist Party disagrees."I will address this issue more in a moment, but suffice it to say that on balance the Chinese technology giants are not purely private actors, but instead function as at least de facto tools of the Chinese Communist Party when it matters most. The Chinese Communist Party uses them as instruments not only for making money but also for pursuing the Party-State's agenda and fulfilling its strategic objectives. In their international engagements, moreover, projects undertaken by firms such as Huawei are subsidized by the government with massive lines of credit and long-duration loans with generous grace periods from state-owned banks in order to undercut competition and penetrate foreign markets more deeply. Clearly, more than commercial and economic interests are involved, and these firms are - among other things, to be sure, but for present purposes quite crucially - instruments of China's geopolitical strategy."It is important to remember all this, because when push comes to shove with the nominally private Chinese technology firms - that is, when Chinese Communist Party authorities really want them to do something - they too will almost certainly act, and must therefore be treated, as the functional equivalent of state-owned enterprises. This is critical, inasmuch as their non-separateness from the Chinese Communist Party's authoritarian governance system makes these companies enablers for and instrumentalities of Party power."It is not surprising, then, that the Chinese technology giants have become deeply enmeshed in Beijing's system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally. Their role on behalf of the Party apparatus begins within China itself, where technology firms have helped the Chinese Communist Party construct an entirely new, modern model of authoritarian police state."Back in the days of Mao Zedong, the iron grip of pervasive Party social and political control in China had to be maintained with the help of sons who would rat out their fathers for ideological nonconformity, students who would denounce their teachers for political crimes, neighborhood mutual-vigilance committees, public self-criticism sessions, mass imprisonment, and secret executions for which families would be sent a small bill to cover the cost of the bullet. By contrast, the Chinese regime's social control techniques in this era of Big Data are growing vastly more sophisticated and in a sense even more deeply pervasive than ever - with a goal to construct an almost literally omnipresent surveillance state with sweeping opportunities for forms of electronically-facilitated coercion that are both exquisitely tailored to individual citizens and massively scaled for a population of more than a billion people. This is the frightening information-managed dystopia described by Samantha Hoffman as "Techno-Enhanced Authoritarianism.""China's technology "national champions" are the standard-bearers for the surveillance and information-facilitated coercive technologies that are making this oppressive police state possible, and jurisdictions such as the oxymoronically named Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region are where the pilot programs and proof-of-concept studies for these technologies of repression are being developed and carried out. These technologies are vital to China's repressive campaign against Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other members of Muslim minority groups, resulting in the detention of at least one million individuals in internment camps since April 2017. These companies have helped the Chinese Party-State develop these tools, they are working with Chinese Communist Party authorities to test these grim methods on China's own population, and through their foreign engagements they are making the export of such techniques into a key component of how Beijing is promoting and expanding its own repressive governance model worldwide."A few years ago, under Hu Jintao, Chinese officials began to express increasing interest in promoting their distinctively oppressive "operating system" as a mode of governance to compete with, or even displace, Western-style liberal democracy around the globe. Under Hu, this was spoken of as China's dream of a "harmonious world," modeled generally on the "harmonious society" the Chinese Communist Party claimed to have created at home. (In this context, of course, invocations of "harmony" signal a commitment to suppressing disharmony -- that is, disagreement with China and its ruling Party.) These days, Xi Jinping is more likely to speak -- as he did at the 19th Party Congress -- of how China offers a new model of modernization for the world: the "China Dream" or the "China Model" of authoritarian, state-managed capitalism. Though the terms differ, however, the basic idea is the same: China seeks to shape the world consistent with its authoritarian model - gaining veto authority over other nations' economic, diplomatic, and security decisions."Significantly, the modern "China Model" is built upon a foundation of technology-facilitated surveillance and social control. These techniques for ruling China have been - and continue to be - in critical ways developed, built, and maintained on behalf of the Party-State by technology firms such as Huawei, Tencent, ZTE, Alibaba, and Baidu. As these companies export their products and services to the rest of the world, the security and human rights problems associated with this "China Model" are progressively exported with them. Already, it has been reported that Ecuador, Venezuela, and Pakistan, among others, have become customers for such firms' repression-facilitating technologies."So this is the geopolitical context for understanding our specific concerns about companies such as Huawei. Countries that choose Huawei technology are opening the door to Chinese access to their domestic networks and local companies, as well as potential surveillance by Chinese officials, posing a potential threat to their national security and economic well-being.III. China's Mil-Civ Fusion Connection"The Chinese system of "military-civil fusion" (MCF) presents an additional layer of problems. Military-civil fusion is a national-level Chinese effort led by Xi Jinping himself that seeks systematically to break down - and indeed to routinize the breaking down of - barriers between China's civilian and military sectors. The objective of this is to help build up Chinese power and ensure, among other things, that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is in a position to maximize its global geopolitical power by taking advantage of the "Revolution in Military Affairs" that Chinese officials envision arising out of modern advances in areas such as nuclear technology, aerospace, aviation, semiconductors, cloud computing, robotics, and "Big Data" processing."From a technology-transfer perspective, the implications of military-civil fusion are, unfortunately, quite clear. As I pointed out last year,"If any given technology is in any way accessible to China ... and officials there believe it can be of any use to the country's military and national security complex as Beijing prepares itself to challenge the United States for global leadership, one can be quite sure that the technology will be made available for those purposes - pretty much no matter what.""From the perspective of dealing with China's technology giants, the problem is therefore even worse than simply helping to enable the Chinese Communist Party's human rights abuses at home and the export of repressive governance abroad. Military-civil fusion also means that it is very difficult and in many cases impossible to engage with China's high-technology sector in a way that does not entangle a foreign entity in supporting ongoing Chinese efforts to develop or otherwise acquire cutting-edge technological capacities for China's armed forces."The augmentation of those armed forces is itself intimately tied to the Chinese Communist Party's strategic agenda of refashioning the current global order into a more Sinocentric form. For this reason, involvement with technology giants such as Huawei necessarily entails some degree of assistance for this agenda.IV. Compelled to Cooperate"So that is the strategic context for our concerns, and one of the reasons why we should all worry about becoming involved with the big Chinese technology firms. On the one hand, these firms export a repressive model of governance that is contrary to our democratic values. On the other hand, these firms are used by China to advance its military modernization program, which is quite contrary to security interests we all share. It is worth stressing, moreover, the degree to which these companies' involvement in support of the Chinese Communist Party's repressive domestic and revisionist global agendas is not optional."Firms such as Huawei, Tencent, ZTE, Alibaba, and Baidu have no meaningful ability to tell the Chinese Communist Party "no" if officials decide to ask for their assistance - e.g., in the form of access to foreign technologies, access to foreign networks, useful information about foreign commercial counterparties, insight into patterns of foreign commerce, or specific information about the profiles, activity, or locations of foreign users of Chinese-hosted or -facilitated social media, computer or smartphone applications, or telecommunications. Such aid may not necessarily occur routinely, but it certainly can occur - and presumably will - whenever the Party considers this useful and cares to demand it."Huawei officials have claimed publicly that Chinese law gives the "government" no authority to do things such as compel a firm to install cyber "back doors" in software code or hardware architectures, or to install "listening devices" in equipment. But even if you put aside that company's cute rhetorical slight-of-hand in making this claim - since, technically speaking, the supreme authority in China is not the "government" but rather the Communist Party - this claim is simply untrue. Multiple Chinese laws, in fact, require companies to cooperate unconditionally with the Chinese Communist Party's security apparatus in order to "guarantee state security." The National Intelligence Law, for instance, requires all entities in China to cooperate with its intelligence services, and covers both private companies and state-owned enterprises. Analogous provisions exist in China's National Security Law, Counter-Terrorism Law, and Cybersecurity Law."Accordingly, if a Chinese technology giant has access to your technology, your information, or your networks and the Party comes asking, the only answer the company can give is "Yes." This is, unfortunately, a fact of life in the high-technology police state that is the modern PRC. If the U.S. government, by contrast, asked Google or Facebook for all of their user information, we would almost certainly be challenged by lawsuits - rightfully so given our respect for privacy and rule of law.V. Huawei in Context: The Malign Ecosystem of Chinese Tech Giants"Nor is this merely a hypothetical concern, for across the malignant ecosystem of China's technologized authoritarianism there is a deep record of cooperation and collaboration between companies such as Huawei, ZTE, Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu and the state security bureaucracy."Even speaking only about Huawei, that company has partnerships with the PLA, the Ministry of State Security, and military research institutes of Chinese state-owned enterprises, and it has lied about these ties and denied knowledge that its employees support joint research projects undertaken with such organizations."The Wujiang Public Security police, for example, have apparently already used the Huawei 820 mobile police terminal to inspect more than 450,000 Chinese citizens and more than 80,000 vehicles since 2016, and have reportedly discovered and "disposed of" more than 100 illegal "personnel" - whatever might be meant by that disturbing phrasing. Huawei's own documents brag that it is, among other things, providing "social stability" solutions in support of local officials in Pingan."Huawei and other Chinese tech companies such as Tencent, ZTE, Alibaba, and Baidu are thereby used to reinforce the government's surveillance efforts."Huawei is also an important player in Beijing's ongoing military-civil fusion effort to make available to the Chinese military any and all technologies it wants from among those to which the country's civilian sector may have access. According to a December 2018 article published on the National Military-Civil Fusion Public Platform administered by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, products and technologies from Huawei, Tencent, Alibaba, Xiaomi, Lenovo, and other companies have already been used in the research, production, and repair of weapons and equipment for the PLA. These companies have also provided support services for China's military industry in areas related to electronics, aerospace, shipbuilding, and weapons -- all of which, incidentally, are key military-civil fusion target areas when it comes to foreign technology acquisition --to enhance the core competitiveness of China's national defense science and technology sectors."China's military-civil fusion highlights the troubling lack of any clear separation between government, national strategies for military modernization, and the companies that are implementing and enabling those strategies to succeed. While domestic companies in many countries - including the United States - produce military equipment for their governments, these companies are not mandated under strategic guidance from the central government to go abroad seeking the technologies they cannot themselves produce, for the purposes of diverting them to military programs. Nor are such firms required by law to do so. Indeed, this would be in stark contravention of basic end-user commitments that govern trade in strategic technologies amongst advanced countries. As befits governance in a free, democratic society, U.S. policies and implementation of legal frameworks are subject to independent oversight by our Congress as well as by our independent judiciary, which ensures a comprehensive web of protection and multiple levels of oversight."But things are quite different in China. China's strategy of systematic technology acquisition and diversion exemplifies the close relationship and nearly indistinguishable status - for these purposes - between its own companies and the Chinese government. This stretches across a range of issues that should be challenging for all of us here today, from companies abusing technology trade to help the government develop military equipment for the PLA under military-civil fusion, to providing the technology that enables the modern Chinese surveillance state. As a result of all this, it is, by design, increasingly difficult to separate where commerce ends and the government begins."At least as early as 2013, it is worth noting, a Huawei affiliate was providing technology to the PLA's General Staff Department, to the Beijing Military Region, and to the Ministry of State Security - as well as to the PLA's 2nd Artillery Corps, which was the name then used to describe China's strategic rocket forces. That is an alarming set of bedfellows from a U.S. national security perspective."Huawei also has strategic cooperation relationships with a number of state-owned enterprises involved with military production, such as the China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation's "719 Research Institution." In fact, Chinese military-civil fusion documentation specifically calls out Huawei's 5G work for special appreciation in support of China's push to develop its military industrial capabilities, as well as contributions by Tencent, Alibaba, and Baidu.VI.Technical Failings"It would be wonderful, of course, if all of these problems with Huawei could be avoided by some technical fix or mitigation that somehow made 5G networks purchased from that company immune to outside manipulation. Unfortunately, this does not appear to be the case, as the notable potentialities for misuse, manipulation, and abuse that are structurally built into any dealings with Huawei have proven highly resistant to technical mitigation. Recent efforts to assess Huawei issues in the United Kingdom help illustrate this point, for even Britain's high-caliber computer experts have been largely unable, over the course of a number of years, fully to address the risks and vulnerabilities created by the Huawei coding and architectures used even in the company's 4G network."Extensive work by the UK's Huawei Cyber Security Center of Excellence has demonstrated the limitations of technical mitigation, particularly related to shortcomings in Huawei's engineering processes and software that exposed UK telecommunications networks to greater risk. Remarkably, there have been consistent challenges even in doing basic vetting of Huawei computer code, since the code the company apparently provided for study and evaluation did not match the code that was found actually deployed in Huawei's routers -- suggesting that the company was either notably erratic and incompetent or that it was trying to cheat the test. Neither possibility, of course, is particularly reassuring."Moreover, the continuing problems the British have had with trying to mitigate risks and vulnerabilities in Huawei's 4G systems are likely only to be much worse with 5G networks. The distributed nature of those networks, their transition of more "core" functions to the "edge" of the network, and the use of software-defined networking and disaggregation create huge numbers of "attack surfaces" and many opportunities for inappropriate data monitoring and the introduction of vulnerabilities. All of this makes it structurally very difficult, if not impossible, truly to isolate vulnerabilities.VII. Conclusion"All in all, therefore, it is no wonder that the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence has warned that "the issue of Huawei 5G deployment must be assessed in the broader geopolitical context," and that "5G rollout needs to be recognized as a strategic rather than merely a technological choice." Specifically, it notes that "Chinese companies are not only subsidized by the Chinese government but also legally compelled to work with its intelligence services ... [and that] the fear remains that adopting 5G technology from Huawei would introduce a reliance on equipment which can be controlled by the Chinese intelligence services and the military in both peacetime and crisis.""And indeed, many countries already do see the threats presented by Huawei's growing penetration of the global 5G market, and have taken steps to secure their networks. Australia's guidance on 5G issues, for instance, warns against vendors that are "subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government." Similarly, the European Commission's 5G recommendations warn against "risk of influence by a third country, notably in relation to its model of governance." Japan and Taiwan have used procurement rules to secure their future 5G infrastructure. For its part, the Czech Republic recently hosted a conference of more than 30 countries, which issued a set of principles -- the Prague Proposals -- that urge adoption of best practices on how best to design, construct, and administer secure 5G infrastructure."In light of all this, it seems to some of us to be nothing less than madness to allow Huawei to worm its way into one's next-generation telecommunications networks - just as it seems nothing less than madness to allow other Chinese technology giants to vacuum up and expatriate personal and consumer data and to control electronic commerce in free sovereign nations. Unless the Chinese Communist Party fundamentally changes its strategies for economic development, military development, and control of its civilian population to prevent any organized opposition to its continued rule, it is difficult to see how China can change its strategies for using domestic companies to advance China's national goals. This is the fundamental insight behind the national security risks posed by companies like Huawei."If next-generation networks such as 5G are indeed the key to tomorrow's connectivity in an increasingly information-saturated and bandwidth-hungry world, this merely makes the challenge presented by Huawei and other Chinese giants all the more acute. The world surely cannot afford to turn such critical capabilities over to technologists who are subject to control and manipulation by the Chinese Communist Party."Thank you."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6851803 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: September 12, 2019End of Document

More importantly, however, the move comes just days ahead of high-level trade talks between the world's two largest economies and could spark reprisals against U.S. companies from Beijing.The high-level trade talks that begin Thursday will be only the second time senior officials from both sides have met since June.White House Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters in Washington on Monday that progress has been made ahead of the talks, adding the U.S. was open to any deal China brings to the table, after reports suggested Beijing was no longer interested in a broad-based agreement after more than a year of wrangling with the Trump administration.Contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 15 points, futures for the S&P 500 declined 2 points, and Nasdaq futures were down 0.50 points.  amid cautious trading ahead of high-level trade negotiations.2. -- Producer Price Index, Domino's Earnings Are Tuesday Calendar Highlights The  in the U.S. Tuesday includes the Producer Price Index for September at 8:30 a.m. ET.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak at the 61st National Association of Business Economics Annual Meeting in Denver at 1:50 p.m. in remarks titled "A View from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors."Earnings are expected Tuesday from Levi Strauss  and Domino's Pizza  .3. -- Chinese State TV Suspends Broadcast of NBA Games China's state broadcaster said Tuesday it  , cutting off the basketball league from its second-largest market as the row over a tweet from the Houston Rockets' general manager threatened to overshadow the upcoming season.The CCTV Sports channel of China Media Group said it will suspend NBA broadcasts, which attracted about 800 million viewers last year, after league Commissioner Adam Silver defended Daryl Morey for sending a tweet earlier this week - for which he later apologized - that expressed support for the ongoing pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong."I think as a values-based organization that I want to make it clear ... that Daryl Morey is supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression," Silver told Japan's Kyodo news agency Tuesday ahead of an exhibition game between the Rockets and the Toronto Raptors in Tokyo. "I accept that it is also Chinese governments' and Chinese businesses' right to react to those words and, at least from my long-time experience in the NBA, it will take some time to heal some of these issues."The Houston Rockets, purchased by hedge fund billionaire Tilman Fertitta in 2017, have a long history with basketball in China, linked in part to the club's decision to draft Yao Ming, one of the country's biggest sport heroes, in 2002.4. -- Southwest Pilots Sue Boeing Over Grounding of 737 MAX The pilots union of Southwest Airlines  has sued Boeing  , saying its pilots are losing money because the aerospace giant rushed an unsafe plane into service only to have the 737 MAX grounded after two deadly crashes.The Southwest Airlines Pilots Association said in the lawsuit that Boeing misled pilots and airlines by not telling them about a new flight-control system called MCAS that is now at the center of investigations into the crashes, the  reported.The lawsuit, filed Monday in state court in Dallas, could make it harder for Boeing to gain public confidence in the plane, which was grounded in March. Boeing was hoping to use pilots in a campaign to reassure travelers once regulators approve changes that the company is making to the plane, the Associated Press noted."We believe this lawsuit is meritless and will vigorously defend against it," said Boeing spokesman Charles Bickers. "We will continue to work with Southwest Airlines and its pilots on efforts to safely return the AX to service."Southwest had more MAX jets than any airline when the plane was grounded. The union said the grounding has eliminated more than 30,000 Southwest flights.5. -- Oracle Plans to Hire 2,000 Workers in Cloud Services Push Oracle  plans to hire nearly 2,000 additional workers as part of an aggressive plan to roll out its cloud computing services to more locations around the world, Don Johnson, executive vice president of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure unit, told  .Jobs will be added in the company's software development hubs in Seattle, the San Francisco Bay Area and India, as well as near new data centers, Johnson said.By the end of next year, Oracle plans to open 20 more cloud "regions" - places where Oracle operates data centers so customers can safely stash data for disaster recovery or to comply with local data storage laws, Reuters reported.

Amid the bitter trade war with China, the Trump administration recently has moved to punish Huawei further by prohibiting US companies from selling components and parts to the China tech giant. Despite the 90-day delay for the Huawei ban, the impact on the global 5G development is expected to be enormous as Huawei is still considered one of the pioneers in 5G.Following the Trump and Xi meeting at G20 last weekend, the US and China have reached a consensus on restarting negotiations and resuming exports to Huawei. It is believed that the market will be motivated in the short term, but in the long run, it is still necessary to keep eyes on the actual progress of the negotiations between China and the United State. This report provides a description of how this all began and a whole picture of these bans and looks into their causes and influences.List of TopicsBackground and reasons behind the global backlash against Huawei from the perspective of both western countries and Huawei Analysis of the impact on Huawei in other regions except the US and why most enterprise customers still hold on to the company's 5G equipment Analysis of political risks for other Chinese vendors such as ZTE if the global ban continues.Key Topics Covered:1.

The Commerce Department has received more than 130 license applications but hadn't granted any of them as of late August,            Reuters reported.Trump's administration barred trade with Huawei and dozens of its partners in May, accusing them of spying for the Chinese government and posing a risk to national security. The ban prevented US companies such as Google from selling components and providing software updates to Huawei without government approval. However, the prospect of mass disruption led the administration to            grant a temporary reprieve to give Huawei's suppliers and users more time to source substitute products and services.The green light may be largely symbolic, as US firms have still supplied goods to Huawei in recent months by producing them overseas or not labeling them as American-made, the Times reported. The move may be intended to ease tensions between the US and China, as senior officials from both nations are meeting this week in an attempt to strike a trade deal.The policy shift wasn't official at the time of writing.

The S&P 500 (-0.8%) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.5%) declined less than 1%, while the Nasdaq Composite (-1.5%) and Russell 2000 (-1.6%) underperformed amid weakness in the technology and energy stocks.It was a wild ride to say the least. Stocks opened higher, lifting the S&P 500 up as much as 0.5% and back above the 3000 level, amid news that China was purchasing more U.S. soybeans and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin confirming trade talks will resume in two weeks. None of these developments was particularly surprising.That advance proved short-lived as stocks began an orderly retreat following a weaker-than-expected consumer confidence report for September and President Trump's speech at the UN General Assembly. In his speech, President Trump delivered tough-sounding remarks on China and Iran, particularly outlining China's dishonesty and warning countries to not subsidize Iran's "blood lust."Selling accelerated, sending the major averages well into negative territory by midday, after reports surfaced that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was planning to formally announce an impeachment inquiry on President Trump at 5:30 p.m. ET. Mr. Trump said he will release a full unredacted transcript of his conversation with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky.The S&P 500 energy sector (-1.6%) led the sectors in losses as oil prices ($57.32, -1.30, -2.3%) weakened. The communication services sector (-1.3%) and the trade-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-1.7%) showed relative weakness after a strong start. The defensive-oriented utilities (+1.1%) and consumer staples (+0.2%) sectors were the lone sectors to finish in positive territory.Notable laggards included FAANG components Facebook (FB 181.28, -5.54, -3.0%), Amazon (AMZN 1741.61, -43.69, -2.5%), and Netflix (NFLX 254.59, -11.33, -4.3%). An earnings miss from AutoZone (AZO 1096.63, -50.63, -4.4%) weighed on the stock.U.S. Treasuries resumed their recent advance amid the political uncertainty and concerns about trade and growth. The 2-yr yield declined six basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield declined seven basis points to 1.64%. Interestingly, the 10-yr yield is now down 27 basis points from its high on Sept. 13. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.3% to 98.32.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for September, the FHFA Housing Price Index for July, and the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for July:The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for September dropped to 125.1 (Briefing.com consensus 134.0) from a downwardly revised 134.2 (from 135.1) in August.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects burgeoning anxiety among consumers about the impact of tariffs and trade tension. That hasn't translated into a retrenchment in consumer spending yet. If confidence continues to wane, though, the market will start to assume it is going to show up in weaker levels of discretionary spending activity, which would be bad for growth prospects.The FHFA Housing Price Index for July increased 0.4% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in June.The S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for July increased 2.0% (Briefing.com consensus of 2.3%) following a revised 2.2% increase in June (from 2.1%).Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for August and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite +20.5% YTDS&P 500 +18.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +14.9% YTDRussell 2000 +13.7% YTD16:21NKE NIKE beats by $0.15, beats on revs; guides on the call (87.18 -0.51)Reports Q1 (Aug) earnings of $0.86 per share, $0.15 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.71, up 28% as shares outstanding fell 2% and net income increased 25% to $1.4 bln.

North America sales ex-FX +4%, EMEA +12%, APacLatAm +13%; footwear +11%, apparel +9%, equipment +11% Gross margin increased 150 basis points to 45.7 percent primarily due to higher average selling prices and margin expansion in NIKE Direct, partially offset by impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs. Inventories for NIKE, Inc. were $5.8 billion, up 12 percent compared to the prior year period, reflecting strong consumer demand globally, and to a lesser extent, the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.16:21CTAS Cintas beats by $0.17, beats on revs; guides FY20 EPS above consensus, revs in-lineReports Q1 (Aug) earnings of $2.32 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.17 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.15; revenues rose 6.7% year/year to $1.81 bln vs the $1.79 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The study evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of BLINCYTO (blinatumomab) compared to conventional consolidation chemotherapy in pediatric patients with high-risk, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at first relapse. Enrollment was terminated early due to encouraging efficacy in the BLINCYTO arm and was based on a recommendation from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). Follow up will continue as prescribed per protocol. In addition, a randomized, Phase 3 trial (AALL1331) conducted by the Children's Oncology Group (COG) using BLINCYTO in pediatric B-cell ALL patients at first relapse has closed to accrual for the high-risk and intermediate risk-arm based on the recommendation of the COG DMC. The DMC closure decision was based on a strong trend towards improved disease-free survival and improved overall survival, markedly lower toxicity, and better minimal residual disease clearance for BLINCYTO compared to chemotherapy. The COG DMC recommended that the AALL1331 low-risk group continue to enroll and randomize patients until enrollment goals are reached.The BLINCYTO adverse events observed in the Phase 3 20120215 and the COG AALL1331 studies were consistent with the known safety profile of BLINCYTO. These interim data will be submitted to a future medical conference and for publication.16:02AVGO Broadcom commences public offering of $3.0 bln of shares of Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (282.31 -3.15)15:45QQQ Technology stocks trounced as the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ -1.6%) breaks below its 50-day moving average (187.49 -3.01)LYFT -7.77% TSLA -7.59% SHOP -6.30% TTD -6.01% UBER -5.53% TWTR -5.03% BIDU -4.76% NFLX -4.60% WDAY -4.42% ROKU -4.26% AMD -4.11% TWLO -3.97% NOW -3.56% BABA -3.17% FB -3.19% AMZN -2.78% MU -2.50% INTC -2.34% ADBE -2.22%15:31SCANX Large cap notable movers of interest -- Pinduoduo (PDD) pulls back on convertible notes offering -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable large cap movers of interest ($10 bln - $200 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Large Cap GainersWYNN (110.65 +2.35%): Upgraded to Buy from Neutral and price target raised to $155 at Goldman, citing stabilizing gross gaming revenue and economic stimulus in Macau, among other factors.CAG (29.51 +2.11%): Consumer staples stocks show moderate relative strength.

The cash session got off to a quiet start after an uneventful overnight affair, but it wasn't long before Treasuries made a run at their highs from Monday. The New York Fed conducted two more repurchase operations today, and both were oversubscribed. The day started with a 14-day term repurchase operation, which saw total bids of $62 bln, well above the accepted amount of $30 bln. A bit later, the NY Fed conducted a one-day repurchase operation, accepting total bids of $75.00 bln, which was $5.20 bln below the total submitted amount. Treasuries approached yesterday's highs during the first hour of the session, rallying to fresh highs after the Consumer Confidence Index for September (actual 125.1; Briefing.com consensus 134.0) disappointed with the Expectations Index (95.8 from 106.4) falling to its lowest level since December. Soft economic data helped Treasuries continue their rally into the afternoon while a report that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will formally launch an inquiry into impeaching President Trump provided added support. Treasuries briefly backed down from their highs after President Trump tweeted that he will release a full unredacted transcript of his conversation with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, but they climbed to fresh high during the last few minutes of the session. Today's $40 bln 2-yr Treasury note auction was met with strong demand.

That hasn't translated into a retrenchment in consumer spending yet.

The stock market is reportedly worried that business-friendly deregulation and tax-friendly policies would be rolled back in the event Senator Warren ultimately became president. [Briefing note: There is a lot of time still in front of the 2020 presidential election, so we are merely highlighting a psychological factor that can help explain why the market sees such a headline as a negative.]There is speculation swirling that House Speaker Pelosi is considering allowing impeachment proceedings in the House against President Trump in relation to reports that he allegedly violated his oath of office when he allegedly withheld military aid to Ukraine as leverage for a request to have Ukraine investigate the business dealings in the Ukraine of former Vice President Biden's son, Hunter Biden.There has been a broad-based retreat, with cyclical sectors bearing the brunt of the selling pressure. The utilities (+0.7%) and consumer staples (+0.1%) sectors are exhibiting relative strength in a defensive-oriented trade. In turn, the Treasury market has attracted an added safe-haven bid amid the stock market pullback. The 10-yr note yield is down six basis points to 1.65%.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.7%; the S&P 500 is down 1.0%; the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.6%; and the Russell 2000 is down 1.9%.

The S&P 500, which was up as much as 0.5% today, is now down 1.0%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.7%) and Nasdaq Composite (-1.5%) have also given up gains and trade near session lows.Early gains in tech stocks had led the market to that higher open. Some attributed this to China buying more U.S. soybeans and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin confirming trade talks in two weeks. Sentiment has been delicate, though, and quickly turned after the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for September dropped to 125.1 (Briefing.com consensus 134.0) from a downwardly revised 134.2 (from 135.1) in August.Stocks steadily retreated as President Trump remained tough on China at the UN General Assembly, with selling interest accelerating in recent action amid reports that Democrats may announce impeachment details later today. Those outperforming technology companies are now among today's laggards with energy stocks extending losses.Mega-cap technology stocks within the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-1.1%) and communication services (-1.1%) sectors weigh on the market, while weakness in the semiconductor stocks drag on the information technology sector (-1.0%). The energy sector (-1.7%) is today's outright laggard as oil prices ($57.60, -$1.04, -1.8%) decline amid growth concerns.In turn, investors are assuming some defensive positioning in U.S. Treasuries and stocks within the S&P 500 utilities (+0.7%) and consumer staples (+0.1%) sectors.The increased demand for Treasuries has extended the recent slide in yields. The 2-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield is down six basis points to 1.65%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.2% to 98.37.Netflix (NFLX 255.25, -10.63, -4.0%), which is now negative for the year, is down another 4% today. Pivotal Research Group cut its NFLX price target to $350 from $515, citing several reasons including higher content costs and competition.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for September, the FHFA Housing Price Index for July, and the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for July:The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for September dropped to 125.1 (Briefing.com consensus 134.0) from a downwardly revised 134.2 (from 135.1) in August.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects burgeoning anxiety among consumers about the impact of tariffs and trade tension. That hasn't translated into a retrenchment in consumer spending yet. If confidence continues to wane, though, the market will start to assume it is going to show up in weaker levels of discretionary spending activity, which would be bad for growth prospects.The FHFA Housing Price Index for July increased 0.4% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in June.The S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for July increased 2.0% (Briefing.com consensus of 2.3%) following a revised 2.2% increase in June (from 2.1%).12:54SPY The recent leg lower in the stock market has been attributed to increased chances of impeachment proceedings coming from Democrats (295.40 -2.81)As we pointed out in out early morning reading summary this morning, The Washington Post reported last night that President Trump ordered his administration to hold aid to Ukraine prior to phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, where Mr. Trump allegedly pressured Mr. Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is considering allowing impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump and will meet with her caucus today at 16:00 ET.Growth stocks continue to come under pressure and oil is down nearly 2%.Energy XLE -1.7%, biotech XBI -2.7% and software IGV -1.7% stocks are leading to the downside while defensive oriented utilities XLU +0.8% and consumer staples XLP +0.2% stocks outperform.Nasdaq 100 QQQ -1.3%, S&P 500 SPY -0.8%, DJIA DIA -0.6%.12:49TPC Tutor Perini enters into contract amendment involving San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency Central Subway project (13.79 +0.01)The co reports that it has entered into a contract amendment involving the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency Central Subway project that provides for the Company to receive $31.2 million in resolution of previously unpaid amounts for the delays that the project experienced as a result of unexpected site conditions and owner-directed changes in project design. The Company has received payment of $29.7 million, which is the agreed $31.2 million amount less contractual retention as provided for in the Central Subway project contract. This payment will be included in the Company's third quarter 2019 operating cash flow.Neither the amendment nor the payment will have an impact on the Company's third quarter earnings, in light of the amount of estimated collections related to these delays on the Central Subway project previously recorded by the Company in its contract assets. The Company is continuing to negotiate additional unresolved amounts on the Central Subway project and currently anticipates that these could be concluded by the fourth quarter of 2019, although the Company cannot predict the outcome of the ongoing discussions.The Central Subway project is not one of the five resolved matters on which the Company reported in its Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 10, 2019. The Company continues to expect the near-term collection of the remaining $24 million from the resolution of those other five matters, though some or all of the remaining amount may be received after the end of the third quarter.12:24SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Fresh Del Monte Produce (FDP) gains following index change announcement -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersFDP (35.39 +15.69%): Reaches a 52-week high after being designated to join the S&P SmallCap 600, effective September 30; co will replace Cray (CRAY) in the index upon that company's acquisition by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE).GOGO (6.47 +7.12%): The stock, which has pulled back in recent sessions after establishing a ten-month high last Wednesday, ticked off its lows yesterday leading into the close following favorable commentary out of William Blair.OSTK (11.89 +6.25%): Sees continued volatility after dropping by circa 25% yesterday and circa 43% over the past week.

GAAP revenue increased 16% yr/yr to $244 mln. The company now estimates that its FY20 total company non-GAAP revenue growth will land within a range of 23-25%. While this guidance is in-line with consensus, it represents a reduction at the mid-point from the company's outlook as issued during its first quarter report in June, when it expected total company non-GAAP revenue to grow between 23-27%.Today's move pulls the stock's year-to-date performance back into negative territory and brings the stock to levels not touched since 2015.11:41SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (71) outpacing new lows (27) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ACGL, ACRE, AEE, AEP, ALL, ATAX, ATO, AUDC, AXS, BLD, BZH, CACI, CDE, CELG, CIM, CIO, CMS, CNA, CPT, D, DLTR, DTE, DUK, ED, EIX, ENTG, ES, ETR, EVRG, FE, FND, FR, GPI, HALL, HELE, ICHR, IDA, JBL, JCI, KBH, KKR, KLAC, KSU, LEN, LHX, LNT, MAA, MDT, MDU, MHO, MPW, MTH, NEE, NFE, NTRA, NWE, OGE, OGS, OHI, PEG, PG, PHM, RE, RNR, SEDG, SO, SUI, TERP, THG, TYL, WMTStocks that traded to 52 week lows: BTU, CHWY, CLVS, EIGI, EZPW, FDX, FLDM, FTCH, FVRR, HCC, INVA, IRBT, KLXE, LVGO, LYFT, MYOV, NESR, PRQR, SNDL, SRPT, SSTI, TEUM, TPB, URGN, WMGI, WORK, XOGThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: CLCT, CWCO, LOOP, MGEE, OTTR, UEIC, WSBFThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: CRNX, ELOX, FULC, KALV, MANUETFs that traded to 52 week highs: ITB, PALL, PFF, TAN, XLU11:30BONDX New SupplyTreasury Auction Preview$40 bln 2-year Treasury note auction (results at 13:00 ET) Prior auction results: High yield: 1.516% Bid-to-cover: 2.60 Indirect bid: 47.1% Direct bid: 20.4% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.337% Bid-to-cover: 2.56 Indirect bid: 47.0% Direct bid: 17.8%11:22MJ ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (-3%) falls to multi-year low as cannabis stocks continue to come under pressure (22.32 -0.67)IIPR -7.99% CTST -7.12% GTBIF -5.88% ACRGF -5.68% TRPX -5.47% CRON -5.51% TGODF -5.20% CWBHF -5.20% PYX -5.44% NTEC -5.00% CRLBF -4.70% VVCIF -4.57% GGBXF -4.24% ACB -3.77% CGC -3.83% IGC -3.57% TLRY -3.76% SPRWF -3.43% APHA -3.31% MMNFF -3.03% KERN -3.00% OGI -2.87% CURLF -2.74%The sector peaked as a sell the news response to recreational legalization in Canada played out one year ago.

Findings were consistent with previously presented results. The final analysis of the primary endpoint showed that in the OLYMPUS intent-to-treat population, 42 of the 71 patients (59 percent) achieved a CR. Forty-one patients entered follow-up, which is still ongoing. Durability of response was determined by Kaplan-Meier to be 89 percent at 6 months and 84 percent at 12 months after primary disease evaluation (PDE). The estimated median time-to-recurrence was 13.0 months. Thirty four of the 71 patients treated in the study were initially characterized by the treating physician as having endoscopically unresectable tumor at baseline. Twenty of 34 patients (59 percent) achieved a CR at the PDE assessment and 12-month durability was identical for this subgroup. The Company also presented interim results from the Phase 2b OPTIMA II trial of investigational UGN-102 (mitomycin gel) for intravesical instillation for patients with intermediate risk LG NMIBC, defined as those with one or two of the following criteria: multifocal disease, large tumors and rapid rates of recurrence. The single-arm, open label study trial recently completed enrollment of 62 patients at clinical sites across the U.S. and Israel. Patients are treated with six weekly instillations of UGN-102 and undergo assessment of CR (the primary endpoint) four to six weeks following the last instillation. In an interim cohort of 32 patients, 63 percent (20/32) achieved a CR. CR at PDE was 63% (20/32). In the interim data from OPTIMA II, the most common adverse events observed were dysuria, pollakiuria, fatigue, hematuria and urinary tract infection. The majority of these treatment-emergent adverse events were characterized as mild or moderate and transient.10:33SUMRX Economic Summary: Consumer Confidence below expectations in AugustEconomic Data Summary:July FHFA Housing Price Index 0.4% (June was 0.2%)July S&P Case Schiller Home Price Index 2.0% vs Briefing.com consensus of 2.3%; June was revised to 2.2% from 2.1% August Consumer Confidence 125.1 vs Briefing.com consensus of 134.0; July was 135.1The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects burgeoning anxiety among consumers about the impact of tariffs and trade tension.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.1%), and Russell 2000 (-0.1%) finished little changed.The session began on a lower note, largely in response to those weaker-than-expected PMI readings overseas. Most notably, Germany's flash PMI for September fell deeper into contraction territory to its lowest reading (41.4) since 2009. The good news was that the Markit's flash manufacturing PMI reading for the U.S. increased to 51.1 from 50.3, reflecting the continued resiliency of the U.S. economy.The S&P 500 was down just 0.3% at its session low and crossed into positive territory as soon as European markets closed for trading at 11:30 a.m. ET.

Lululemon athletica (LULU 195.18, +5.88, +3.1) rose 3% after the stock was initiated with an Overweight rating at Piper Jaffray.The U.S. Treasury market reflected some lingering growth concerns as increased demand pushed yields lower. The 2-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.67%, and the 10-yr yield declined six basis points to 1.71%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.62.

Co previously recorded an accrued liability of $18.2 million, net of insurance coverage and before advances made to plaintiffs. In September 2018, the co paid plaintiffs $7.0 million in order to stay enforcement of the trial court judgment. Because of this payment, the Company recorded this amount as a reduction of its accrued liability. After the September 2018 payment and before entering into the Final Denton Settlement, the accrued liability was $11.2 million. Co expects to record in the third quarter of 2019 an additional pre-tax charge to net income of $24.8 million.17:14KMI Kinder Morgan indicated higher after announcing Gulf Coast Express Pipeline will be placed in service ahead of schedule (20.57 -0.21)Gulf Coast Express Pipeline Project will begin full commercial in-service on September 25, 2019, delivering natural gas from the Waha area in West Texas to Agua Dulce near the Texas Gulf Coast.

The S&P 500 (-0.8%) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.5%) declined less than 1%, while the Nasdaq Composite (-1.5%) and Russell 2000 (-1.6%) underperformed amid weakness in the technology and energy stocks.It was a wild ride to say the least. Stocks opened higher, lifting the S&P 500 up as much as 0.5% and back above the 3000 level, amid news that China was purchasing more U.S. soybeans and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin confirming trade talks will resume in two weeks. None of these developments was particularly surprising.That advance proved short-lived as stocks began an orderly retreat following a weaker-than-expected consumer confidence report for September and President Trump's speech at the UN General Assembly. In his speech, President Trump delivered tough-sounding remarks on China and Iran, particularly outlining China's dishonesty and warning countries to not subsidize Iran's "blood lust."Selling accelerated, sending the major averages well into negative territory by midday, after reports surfaced that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was planning to formally announce an impeachment inquiry on President Trump at 5:30 p.m. ET. Mr. Trump said he will release a full unredacted transcript of his conversation with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky.The S&P 500 energy sector (-1.6%) led the sectors in losses as oil prices ($57.32, -1.30, -2.3%) weakened. The communication services sector (-1.3%) and the trade-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-1.7%) showed relative weakness after a strong start. The defensive-oriented utilities (+1.1%) and consumer staples (+0.2%) sectors were the lone sectors to finish in positive territory.Notable laggards included FAANG components Facebook (FB 181.28, -5.54, -3.0%), Amazon (AMZN 1741.61, -43.69, -2.5%), and Netflix (NFLX 254.59, -11.33, -4.3%). An earnings miss from AutoZone (AZO 1096.63, -50.63, -4.4%) weighed on the stock.U.S. Treasuries resumed their recent advance amid the political uncertainty and concerns about trade and growth. The 2-yr yield declined six basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield declined seven basis points to 1.64%. Interestingly, the 10-yr yield is now down 27 basis points from its high on Sept. 13. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.3% to 98.32.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for September, the FHFA Housing Price Index for July, and the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for July:The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for September dropped to 125.1 (Briefing.com consensus 134.0) from a downwardly revised 134.2 (from 135.1) in August.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects burgeoning anxiety among consumers about the impact of tariffs and trade tension. That hasn't translated into a retrenchment in consumer spending yet. If confidence continues to wane, though, the market will start to assume it is going to show up in weaker levels of discretionary spending activity, which would be bad for growth prospects.The FHFA Housing Price Index for July increased 0.4% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in June.The S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for July increased 2.0% (Briefing.com consensus of 2.3%) following a revised 2.2% increase in June (from 2.1%).Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for August and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite +20.5% YTDS&P 500 +18.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +14.9% YTDRussell 2000 +13.7% YTD16:21NKE NIKE beats by $0.15, beats on revs; guides on the call (87.18 -0.51)Reports Q1 (Aug) earnings of $0.86 per share, $0.15 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.71, up 28% as shares outstanding fell 2% and net income increased 25% to $1.4 bln.

North America sales ex-FX +4%, EMEA +12%, APacLatAm +13%; footwear +11%, apparel +9%, equipment +11% Gross margin increased 150 basis points to 45.7 percent primarily due to higher average selling prices and margin expansion in NIKE Direct, partially offset by impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs. Inventories for NIKE, Inc. were $5.8 billion, up 12 percent compared to the prior year period, reflecting strong consumer demand globally, and to a lesser extent, the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.16:21CTAS Cintas beats by $0.17, beats on revs; guides FY20 EPS above consensus, revs in-lineReports Q1 (Aug) earnings of $2.32 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.17 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.15; revenues rose 6.7% year/year to $1.81 bln vs the $1.79 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The study evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of BLINCYTO (blinatumomab) compared to conventional consolidation chemotherapy in pediatric patients with high-risk, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at first relapse. Enrollment was terminated early due to encouraging efficacy in the BLINCYTO arm and was based on a recommendation from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). Follow up will continue as prescribed per protocol. In addition, a randomized, Phase 3 trial (AALL1331) conducted by the Children's Oncology Group (COG) using BLINCYTO in pediatric B-cell ALL patients at first relapse has closed to accrual for the high-risk and intermediate risk-arm based on the recommendation of the COG DMC. The DMC closure decision was based on a strong trend towards improved disease-free survival and improved overall survival, markedly lower toxicity, and better minimal residual disease clearance for BLINCYTO compared to chemotherapy. The COG DMC recommended that the AALL1331 low-risk group continue to enroll and randomize patients until enrollment goals are reached.The BLINCYTO adverse events observed in the Phase 3 20120215 and the COG AALL1331 studies were consistent with the known safety profile of BLINCYTO. These interim data will be submitted to a future medical conference and for publication.16:02AVGO Broadcom commences public offering of $3.0 bln of shares of Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (282.31 -3.15)15:45QQQ Technology stocks trounced as the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ -1.6%) breaks below its 50-day moving average (187.49 -3.01)LYFT -7.77% TSLA -7.59% SHOP -6.30% TTD -6.01% UBER -5.53% TWTR -5.03% BIDU -4.76% NFLX -4.60% WDAY -4.42% ROKU -4.26% AMD -4.11% TWLO -3.97% NOW -3.56% BABA -3.17% FB -3.19% AMZN -2.78% MU -2.50% INTC -2.34% ADBE -2.22%15:31SCANX Large cap notable movers of interest -- Pinduoduo (PDD) pulls back on convertible notes offering -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable large cap movers of interest ($10 bln - $200 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Large Cap GainersWYNN (110.65 +2.35%): Upgraded to Buy from Neutral and price target raised to $155 at Goldman, citing stabilizing gross gaming revenue and economic stimulus in Macau, among other factors.CAG (29.51 +2.11%): Consumer staples stocks show moderate relative strength.

Soft economic data helped Treasuries continue their rally into the afternoon while a report that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will formally launch an inquiry into impeaching President Trump provided added support. Treasuries briefly backed down from their highs after President Trump tweeted that he will release a full unredacted transcript of his conversation with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, but they climbed to fresh high during the last few minutes of the session.

The stock market is reportedly worried that business-friendly deregulation and tax-friendly policies would be rolled back in the event Senator Warren ultimately became president. [Briefing note: There is a lot of time still in front of the 2020 presidential election, so we are merely highlighting a psychological factor that can help explain why the market sees such a headline as a negative.]There is speculation swirling that House Speaker Pelosi is considering allowing impeachment proceedings in the House against President Trump in relation to reports that he allegedly violated his oath of office when he allegedly withheld military aid to Ukraine as leverage for a request to have Ukraine investigate the business dealings in the Ukraine of former Vice President Biden's son, Hunter Biden.There has been a broad-based retreat, with cyclical sectors bearing the brunt of the selling pressure. The utilities (+0.7%) and consumer staples (+0.1%) sectors are exhibiting relative strength in a defensive-oriented trade. In turn, the Treasury market has attracted an added safe-haven bid amid the stock market pullback. The 10-yr note yield is down six basis points to 1.65%.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.7%; the S&P 500 is down 1.0%; the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.6%; and the Russell 2000 is down 1.9%.

The S&P 500, which was up as much as 0.5% today, is now down 1.0%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.7%) and Nasdaq Composite (-1.5%) have also given up gains and trade near session lows.Early gains in tech stocks had led the market to that higher open. Some attributed this to China buying more U.S. soybeans and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin confirming trade talks in two weeks. Sentiment has been delicate, though, and quickly turned after the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for September dropped to 125.1 (Briefing.com consensus 134.0) from a downwardly revised 134.2 (from 135.1) in August.Stocks steadily retreated as President Trump remained tough on China at the UN General Assembly, with selling interest accelerating in recent action amid reports that Democrats may announce impeachment details later today. Those outperforming technology companies are now among today's laggards with energy stocks extending losses.Mega-cap technology stocks within the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-1.1%) and communication services (-1.1%) sectors weigh on the market, while weakness in the semiconductor stocks drag on the information technology sector (-1.0%). The energy sector (-1.7%) is today's outright laggard as oil prices ($57.60, -$1.04, -1.8%) decline amid growth concerns.In turn, investors are assuming some defensive positioning in U.S. Treasuries and stocks within the S&P 500 utilities (+0.7%) and consumer staples (+0.1%) sectors.The increased demand for Treasuries has extended the recent slide in yields. The 2-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield is down six basis points to 1.65%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.2% to 98.37.Netflix (NFLX 255.25, -10.63, -4.0%), which is now negative for the year, is down another 4% today. Pivotal Research Group cut its NFLX price target to $350 from $515, citing several reasons including higher content costs and competition.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for September, the FHFA Housing Price Index for July, and the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for July:The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for September dropped to 125.1 (Briefing.com consensus 134.0) from a downwardly revised 134.2 (from 135.1) in August.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects burgeoning anxiety among consumers about the impact of tariffs and trade tension. That hasn't translated into a retrenchment in consumer spending yet. If confidence continues to wane, though, the market will start to assume it is going to show up in weaker levels of discretionary spending activity, which would be bad for growth prospects.The FHFA Housing Price Index for July increased 0.4% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in June.The S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for July increased 2.0% (Briefing.com consensus of 2.3%) following a revised 2.2% increase in June (from 2.1%).12:54SPY The recent leg lower in the stock market has been attributed to increased chances of impeachment proceedings coming from Democrats (295.40 -2.81)As we pointed out in out early morning reading summary this morning, The Washington Post reported last night that President Trump ordered his administration to hold aid to Ukraine prior to phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, where Mr. Trump allegedly pressured Mr. Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is considering allowing impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump and will meet with her caucus today at 16:00 ET.Growth stocks continue to come under pressure and oil is down nearly 2%.Energy XLE -1.7%, biotech XBI -2.7% and software IGV -1.7% stocks are leading to the downside while defensive oriented utilities XLU +0.8% and consumer staples XLP +0.2% stocks outperform.Nasdaq 100 QQQ -1.3%, S&P 500 SPY -0.8%, DJIA DIA -0.6%.12:49TPC Tutor Perini enters into contract amendment involving San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency Central Subway project (13.79 +0.01)The co reports that it has entered into a contract amendment involving the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency Central Subway project that provides for the Company to receive $31.2 million in resolution of previously unpaid amounts for the delays that the project experienced as a result of unexpected site conditions and owner-directed changes in project design. The Company has received payment of $29.7 million, which is the agreed $31.2 million amount less contractual retention as provided for in the Central Subway project contract. This payment will be included in the Company's third quarter 2019 operating cash flow.Neither the amendment nor the payment will have an impact on the Company's third quarter earnings, in light of the amount of estimated collections related to these delays on the Central Subway project previously recorded by the Company in its contract assets. The Company is continuing to negotiate additional unresolved amounts on the Central Subway project and currently anticipates that these could be concluded by the fourth quarter of 2019, although the Company cannot predict the outcome of the ongoing discussions.The Central Subway project is not one of the five resolved matters on which the Company reported in its Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 10, 2019. The Company continues to expect the near-term collection of the remaining $24 million from the resolution of those other five matters, though some or all of the remaining amount may be received after the end of the third quarter.12:24SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Fresh Del Monte Produce (FDP) gains following index change announcement -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersFDP (35.39 +15.69%): Reaches a 52-week high after being designated to join the S&P SmallCap 600, effective September 30; co will replace Cray (CRAY) in the index upon that company's acquisition by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE).GOGO (6.47 +7.12%): The stock, which has pulled back in recent sessions after establishing a ten-month high last Wednesday, ticked off its lows yesterday leading into the close following favorable commentary out of William Blair.OSTK (11.89 +6.25%): Sees continued volatility after dropping by circa 25% yesterday and circa 43% over the past week.

GAAP revenue increased 16% yr/yr to $244 mln. The company now estimates that its FY20 total company non-GAAP revenue growth will land within a range of 23-25%. While this guidance is in-line with consensus, it represents a reduction at the mid-point from the company's outlook as issued during its first quarter report in June, when it expected total company non-GAAP revenue to grow between 23-27%.Today's move pulls the stock's year-to-date performance back into negative territory and brings the stock to levels not touched since 2015.11:41SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (71) outpacing new lows (27) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ACGL, ACRE, AEE, AEP, ALL, ATAX, ATO, AUDC, AXS, BLD, BZH, CACI, CDE, CELG, CIM, CIO, CMS, CNA, CPT, D, DLTR, DTE, DUK, ED, EIX, ENTG, ES, ETR, EVRG, FE, FND, FR, GPI, HALL, HELE, ICHR, IDA, JBL, JCI, KBH, KKR, KLAC, KSU, LEN, LHX, LNT, MAA, MDT, MDU, MHO, MPW, MTH, NEE, NFE, NTRA, NWE, OGE, OGS, OHI, PEG, PG, PHM, RE, RNR, SEDG, SO, SUI, TERP, THG, TYL, WMTStocks that traded to 52 week lows: BTU, CHWY, CLVS, EIGI, EZPW, FDX, FLDM, FTCH, FVRR, HCC, INVA, IRBT, KLXE, LVGO, LYFT, MYOV, NESR, PRQR, SNDL, SRPT, SSTI, TEUM, TPB, URGN, WMGI, WORK, XOGThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: CLCT, CWCO, LOOP, MGEE, OTTR, UEIC, WSBFThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: CRNX, ELOX, FULC, KALV, MANUETFs that traded to 52 week highs: ITB, PALL, PFF, TAN, XLU11:30BONDX New SupplyTreasury Auction Preview$40 bln 2-year Treasury note auction (results at 13:00 ET) Prior auction results: High yield: 1.516% Bid-to-cover: 2.60 Indirect bid: 47.1% Direct bid: 20.4% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.337% Bid-to-cover: 2.56 Indirect bid: 47.0% Direct bid: 17.8%11:22MJ ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (-3%) falls to multi-year low as cannabis stocks continue to come under pressure (22.32 -0.67)IIPR -7.99% CTST -7.12% GTBIF -5.88% ACRGF -5.68% TRPX -5.47% CRON -5.51% TGODF -5.20% CWBHF -5.20% PYX -5.44% NTEC -5.00% CRLBF -4.70% VVCIF -4.57% GGBXF -4.24% ACB -3.77% CGC -3.83% IGC -3.57% TLRY -3.76% SPRWF -3.43% APHA -3.31% MMNFF -3.03% KERN -3.00% OGI -2.87% CURLF -2.74%The sector peaked as a sell the news response to recreational legalization in Canada played out one year ago.

Findings were consistent with previously presented results. The final analysis of the primary endpoint showed that in the OLYMPUS intent-to-treat population, 42 of the 71 patients (59 percent) achieved a CR. Forty-one patients entered follow-up, which is still ongoing. Durability of response was determined by Kaplan-Meier to be 89 percent at 6 months and 84 percent at 12 months after primary disease evaluation (PDE). The estimated median time-to-recurrence was 13.0 months. Thirty four of the 71 patients treated in the study were initially characterized by the treating physician as having endoscopically unresectable tumor at baseline. Twenty of 34 patients (59 percent) achieved a CR at the PDE assessment and 12-month durability was identical for this subgroup. The Company also presented interim results from the Phase 2b OPTIMA II trial of investigational UGN-102 (mitomycin gel) for intravesical instillation for patients with intermediate risk LG NMIBC, defined as those with one or two of the following criteria: multifocal disease, large tumors and rapid rates of recurrence. The single-arm, open label study trial recently completed enrollment of 62 patients at clinical sites across the U.S. and Israel. Patients are treated with six weekly instillations of UGN-102 and undergo assessment of CR (the primary endpoint) four to six weeks following the last instillation. In an interim cohort of 32 patients, 63 percent (20/32) achieved a CR. CR at PDE was 63% (20/32). In the interim data from OPTIMA II, the most common adverse events observed were dysuria, pollakiuria, fatigue, hematuria and urinary tract infection. The majority of these treatment-emergent adverse events were characterized as mild or moderate and transient.10:33SUMRX Economic Summary: Consumer Confidence below expectations in AugustEconomic Data Summary:July FHFA Housing Price Index 0.4% (June was 0.2%)July S&P Case Schiller Home Price Index 2.0% vs Briefing.com consensus of 2.3%; June was revised to 2.2% from 2.1% August Consumer Confidence 125.1 vs Briefing.com consensus of 134.0; July was 135.1The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects burgeoning anxiety among consumers about the impact of tariffs and trade tension.

The president has also sounded a tough stance on Iran.The pullback has been fairly orderly and most sectors are still showing modest gains, but the good trade vibes that reportedly helped boost the market at the open have been tempered.On a related note, the Treasury market has seen a pickup in buying interest after the confidence data and amid the president's speech, which is continuing at this time. the 10-yr note yield is down four basis points to 1.67%.The S&P 500 is up 0.2%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.2%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; and the Russell 2000 is down 0.6%.10:31OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:FL Weekly Sep27 41 calls are seeing interest with 1880 contracts trading vs. open int of 230, pushing implied vol up around 2 points to ~43%.

Disappointing flash manufacturing PMI readings out of the eurozone kept many buyers sidelined, but encouraging manufacturing activity in the U.S. helped abate early selling pressure. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.1%), and Russell 2000 (-0.1%) finished little changed.The session began on a lower note, largely in response to those weaker-than-expected PMI readings overseas. Most notably, Germany's flash PMI for September fell deeper into contraction territory to its lowest reading (41.4) since 2009. The good news was that the Markit's flash manufacturing PMI reading for the U.S. increased to 51.1 from 50.3, reflecting the continued resiliency of the U.S. economy.The S&P 500 was down just 0.3% at its session low and crossed into positive territory as soon as European markets closed for trading at 11:30 a.m. ET. The broader market maintained this positive disposition throughout the afternoon but faded into the close.Most S&P 500 sectors finished within 0.3% of their unchanged marks. The consumer staples sector (+0.4%) outperformed the broader market, while the health care (-0.6%) and communication services (-0.4%) sectors underperformed.Apple (AAPL 218.72, +0.99, +0.5%) and most stocks within the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+1.0%) showed relative strength throughout the day. The semiconductor space bounced back from Friday's decline following reports indicating that officials from the U.S. and China described last week's trade talks as "productive" and "constructive," respectively.In corporate news, American Express (AXP 118.25, +1.45, +1.2%) announced a 120 million share repurchase program and increased its quarterly dividend 10%. Lululemon athletica (LULU 195.18, +5.88, +3.1) rose 3% after the stock was initiated with an Overweight rating at Piper Jaffray.The U.S. Treasury market reflected some lingering growth concerns as increased demand pushed yields lower. The 2-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.67%, and the 10-yr yield declined six basis points to 1.71%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.62. WTI crude rose 1.0%, or $0.60, to $58.64/bbl.Investors did not receive any notable economic data on Monday.

The NBA-China Disaster Is a Stress Test for CapitalismAtlantic OnlineOctober 12, 2019 SaturdayCopyright 2019 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1442 wordsByline: Derek ThompsonBodyOn August 19, the definition of a company in America changed. The Business Roundtable, a U.S. lobbying group that represents nearly 200 companies, issued a statement proclaiming that the "purpose" of a business in 2019 was no longer to look out merely for shareholders. It was to protect the interests of all "stakeholders"-employees, partners, suppliers, communities, the environment, the very world itself. The group's lofty statement seemed to reorient the role of a public company from the maximization of profit to the maximization of goodness.'Twas a lovely sentiment. And it lasted about 50 days. This week, the news dunked all over the Business Roundtable's new definition.The story started, as things often do these days, with a deleted tweet. Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets basketball team, publicized on Twitter his support for Hong Kong protesters, who are demanding a variety of civil-liberty protections from mainland China and the Hong Kong police. The tweet disappeared almost immediately.But the damage was done. Chinese companies, furious over public sympathy for Hong Kong, were swift in their vengeance. They suspended licensing agreements with the NBA. They blacklisted the Rockets, historically the most popular U.S. basketball team in China, by barring them from appearing on state TV. The partnership between the NBA and China, which is worth billions of dollars over the next decade, is now in jeopardy.The NBA-so proudly progressive on a range of civil-rights issues in the U.S.-torched its reputation. The league moved swiftly to condemn Morey's advocacy for democratic rights; the NBA            discouraged players from commenting on Chinese policy; and pro-Hong Kong signs            were confiscated at exhibition games in Washington, D.C. Chinese appeasement, you might say, superseded free expression in the nation's capital."We feel greatly disappointed at [Morey's] inappropriate speech, which is regrettable," the NBA said in a statement on the Chinese site Weibo. "We take respecting Chinese history and culture as a serious matter." The sentiment expressed therein is technically known as public relations and is commonly known as bullshit. The NBA's respect for Chinese culture and American free speech extends an equal distance-the length of a licensing contract.It turns out that the business of American business is business.[           Derek Thompson: The best economic news no one wants to talk about]The NBA's mess has sparked the rarest of modern phenomena: bipartisan agreement in the United States.Republican Senator Ted Cruz condemned the league, as did his fellow Texan, former Democratic Representative Beto O'Rourke. Conservatives and liberals alike have broadly excoriated the NBA for the hypocrisy of encouraging athletes to speak out on minority rights at home while indulging a Chinese government that has put some 2 million of its Uyghur citizens in Xinjiang            detention centers.But the laser-hot focus on the NBA's sins is too narrow. Shouldn't our scorn also apply            to ESPN, whose bosses initially told employees not to overtly criticize China while covering this story? Or to ESPN's parent company, Disney, which ignores the mainland's human-rights abuses on the way to collecting hundreds of millions of dollars a year from films and amusement parks, such as            Shanghai Disney Resort? Or to the broader American film industry, which regularly            deletes scenes that offend Chinese officials or            includes new scenes and characters specifically to flatter the Chinese government?This is bigger than buckets or blockbusters: It amounts to nothing less than a global corporate conspiracy of complicity. In 2018, Marriott published an online poll that listed Tibet as a separate country, rather than a part of China. Roy Jones, a 49-year-old making $14-an-hour running social-media accounts for Marriott,            "           liked" a post by a Tibetan separatist group celebrating the online survey. Jones didn't write the survey. He knew little about China's relationship to Tibet. He was just doing his job, which was to cheer on Marriott fans on social media. But Chinese authorities were furious about the survey and the "like." Marriott's website states, "Taking care of people and putting their wellbeing above all else is in our Company's DNA." Jones was fired within a week.The same year, Mercedes-Benz            apologized for an Instagram post that quoted the Dalai Lama: "Look at situations from all angles, and you will become more open." The Chinese objected to this perfectly boring statement because the Dalai Lama supports greater autonomy for Tibet. Mercedes sells            twice as many cars in China than in the U.S. or Germany, and analysts have            concluded that "without the emergence of China, the German premium business model would be broken." So Mercedes looked at the situation from all angles and then, it would seem, selected the angle of shareholder preservation. They deleted the post and apologized profusely.The muzzling of free expression at the behest of China extends even into the academic world. Last year, The New Republic            reported on "an epidemic of self-censorship at U.S. universities on the subject of China." Many scholars reportedly feel that criticizing the country is too risky, because colleges accept so much money from Chinese institutions affiliated with Beijing.China exercises a kind of veto power over the global marketplace of speech. Every piece of content that is critical of the government, or dubious of its claims about Tibet, or Taiwan, or Tiananmen Square, or Xinjiang, is subject to grave financial punishment. It amounts to a kind of "values tariff" on the companies and individuals with which China does business. That is, rather than [x] percent tax on imported goods in China, companies must compromise [x] percent of their values to do business in China. The focus might be on the NBA today. But each firm with business there is paying the values tariff.[           Read: China bends another American institution to its will]Everybody is having it both ways.The NBA wields social advocacy as a sword within the U.S. and surrenders its outspokenness at the border. Multinational companies ask their employees to "bring their full selves to work" and then fire those employees when their "full selves" offend Beijing bureaucrats living 10,000 miles away. Academic institutions say they cherish free thought while giving Beijing sway over their employees' thinking.But if the NBA is cowardly, and Marriott is shameful, and colleges are hypocrites, then what are we, the consumers, in this equation? China is the U.S.'s largest trading partner, from which we import hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of computer parts, toys, furniture, shoes, and plastic.The American consumer is prone to ethical spasms, if not to consistency. When Equinox members discovered that one of the gym's investors was a Trump supporter, it caused a national scandal. Meanwhile, the most popular app in the world, TikTok, was built by the Beijing-based company ByteDance, which, like every Chinese tech company, works closely with the same Chinese Communist Party that tortures Muslims in Xinjiang. Does this mean that American teens are ethically required to delete the app until China shuts down its Xinjiang reeducation camps? Does it mean, by extension, that smartphone users should boycott the iPhone until Apple extricates its supply chain from China? Is there such a thing as ethical trade with China at all?The point is not that these questions demand simple answers, but rather that they're nearly impossible to resolve-at least without sacrificing painful sums of capital, moral and literal. The U.S. and China aren't just the two biggest trading partners in the world. They are the two biggest trading partners in the history of the world. International trade has increased global GDP, lifted billions from poverty, and made just about everything you can see, touch, smell, and taste more efficient to produce and therefore easier to consume. To completely sever the U.S.-China alliance would likely cause economic devastation to millions of workers, not only in the U.S., and not only in China, but also, due to the interconnectedness of the global economy, across the planet.There is no escaping the fact that the stitching of global markets has spun a quilt of moral complicity. You don't have to tweet, or talk, or run a company to pay the Chinese values tariff. It's the cost of doing business. It's the cost of doing just about anything.Load-Date: October 13, 2019End of Document

RIGHTS GROUPS CALL FOR RELEASE OF CHINESE JOURNALIST WHO REPORTED FROM HONG KONGStates News ServiceOctober 29, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1046 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Rights groups have called on the ruling Chinese Communist Party to release an independent journalist held on public order charges after she covered the Hong Kong protest movement.Huang Xueqin, also known as Sophia Huang, was detained on Oct. 17 by police in Guangdong's provincial capital Guangzhou, on suspicion of "picking quarrels and stirring up trouble," a charge that is often used to target peaceful critics of the government.Huang is currently being held in Guangzhou's Baiyun District Detention Center, where police have interrogated her about a post she made about Hong Kong's anti-extradition movement on June 10Paris-based press freedom group Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said Huang should never have been detained."RSF calls for the immediate release of Chinese independent journalist Huang Xueqin ... who covered the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong last summer and the #MeToo movement in 2018," the group said in a statement on Tuesday .It said the accusation of "picking quarrels and stirring up trouble" is often used by the regime against journalists, and carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison."Huang bravely addressed societal topics that are of the highest importance for the Chinese public and should never have been apprehended," RSF's East Asia bureau chief Cedric Alviani said.Alviani requested "her immediate release and that of all other journalists detained in China."The statement came as rights activist Yang Zhanqing testified to U.S. officials that Huang had only been allowed one visit from a lawyer, and that nothing had been heard of her since that visit.Appeal to UN and USYang called on the international community to press Huang's case at the United Nations and with Beijing."There needs to be a report made to U.N. Women about Huang Xueqin's detention, and also to encourage departments and officials of the U.S. government that have dealings with China to bring up [her] case," he said, when asked in an earlier interview what the international community should do."I would hope that they would send a formal letter, as openly as possible, to the Chinese government," he said. "If they do it behind closed doors, then the Chinese government will probably just ignore it."The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has also called for Huang's release."Chinese authorities must immediately release journalist Sophia Huang Xueqin and drop all charges against her," the group said in a statement last week.It said Huang's most recent publications on her blog include two stories documenting her participation in protests in Hong Kong, published in June, and one story on a sexual harassment case in Chengdu, Sichuan province, published in July."Huang's arrest is obviously in retaliation for her coverage on the Hong Kong protests and gender issues in China, and she should be released and allowed to work freely as a journalist," CPJ Program Director Carlos Martinez de la Serna said in a statement.Calls to the Baiyun Detention Center and to Huang's friend and lawyer Wan Miaoyan rang unanswered during office hours on Tuesday ."When CPJ called the detention center, an officer said that only family members were allowed to make inquiries about detainees, and refused to disclose any information about Huang's case," the group reported on its website.Huang, a former reporter for the New Express newspaper and the Southern Metropolis Weekly, had typically reported on rights issues in her work, and has penned articles on sexual harassment, gender, pollution and vulnerable groups in Chinese society.#metoo movementBefore being detained, she had been an outspoken member of the country's #metoo movement, and had carried out a survey of sexual harassment and assault cases among Chinese women working in journalism.Huang, 30, originally planned to study law in Hong Kong but had her travel documents confiscated in August.Barrister Chow Hang Tung of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Democratic Movement in China said the content of Huang's writing had likely made her a target for the authorities."It's getting harder and harder to find content that is unfavorable to the government nowadays," Chow told RFA. "If foreign news organizations want to report such things, then they depend on citizen journalists on the ground, but that channel of information is pretty much cut off now.""There are still a few people left in mainland China doing this kind of work, and putting information out there, and we should be paying more attention and giving more support to these people," she said.Veteran political journalist Gao Yu, who has served time in jail for doing her job as a journalist, agreed, saying that life is getting tougher and tougher for journalists in China."I started 30 years ago, at the time of the June 4 , 1989 massacre," Gao said. "Back then there were a lot of journalists reporting the truth about what happened then.""Things are pretty awful for Chinese journalists today , though," she said. "If China responded even slightly to the concerns of international organizations, the human rights situation would be different."Many women who have tried to defend human rights in China have faced persecution, including arbitrary detention, torture and inhumane punishment by medical deprivation, according to the Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) network.Huang was already under a travel ban imposed following her return from a trip to Hong Kong and Taiwan from February through August.She had previously assisted in the investigation and reporting of a number of high-profile sexual harassment allegations against professors at Peking University, Wuhan University of Technology, Henan University and Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou.Huang was present at a million-strong protest in Hong Kong on June 9 against plans to allow extradition to mainland ChinaRSF said China is the largest prison in the world for journalists with at least 120 detainees and ranks 177th out of 180 countries and territories in the RSF World Press Freedom Ranking 2019.Reported by Ng Yik-tung and Sing Man for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Xue Xiaoshan and Gao Feng for the Mandarin Service.

Chinese delegation to the U.S. in October for high-level meetingCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 17, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 364 wordsBody       The official news agency Xinhua reported that the deputy finance Minister Liao Min will lead the delegation, which arrives on Wednesday to the United States.                                                The Chinese government has today confirmed that a delegation of its own will travel to the United States in order to prepare the high-level meeting to attempt, in October, to conclude an agreement ending the trade war. The official news agency Xinhua reported that the deputy finance Minister Liao Min will lead the delegation, which arrives on Wednesday to the United States. "The visit will pave the way for the thirteenth round of high-level economic and commercial consultations in China-United States, in October, in Washington," the agency's dispatch reads. Beijing and Washington, which have been fighting for over a year a trade war, have been giving signs of appeasement. Last week, China announced that it will exclude some North American products from additional customs duties, namely industrial chemicals and pharmaceuticals, and that it would resume the purchase of soy and pork in the U.S. U.S. President Donald Trump also decided to postpone the increase in customs duties from 25% to 30% over a total of 250 billion goods imported from China. Washington and Beijing have already increased customs duties on hundreds of millions of dollars of products from each. At the heart of the trade war is Beijing's policy for the technological sector, which aims to transform the country's state-owned firms into major global actors in high-value sectors such as artificial intelligence, renewable energy, robotics and cars Electric. The United States considered that this plan, driven by the Chinese state, violates China's commitments to open its market, notably by forcing foreign companies to transfer technology and by allocating subsidies to domestic businesses, While protecting them from outside competition. Trade disputes between the two largest economies in the world also threaten the world economy: the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reduced this month's global expansion projections to 3.2%, in 2019, one tenth less than the forecasts made in April. Load-Date: September 18, 2019End of Document

USANA Health Sciences Reports Third Quarter 2019 ResultsBusiness WireOctober 22, 2019 Tuesday 8:17 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 2116 wordsDateline: SALT LAKE CITY BodyUSANA Health Sciences, Inc. (NYSE: USNA) today announced financial results for its fiscal third quarter ended September 28, 2019.Financial PerformanceThird quarter 2019 net sales were $260.6 million, compared with $296.8 million in the prior-year period, or a 12.2% decrease year-over-year. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar unfavorably impacted net sales by approximately $6.0 million for the quarter. The Company previously estimated the impact from currency to be neutral for the second half of the year. The Company's total number of active Customers at the end of the third quarter was 558,000, compared to 615,000 in the prior-year period.Third quarter net earnings were $24.2 million, or $1.09 per diluted share, compared with $31.0 million, or $1.24 per share during the prior-year period."Although we continue to face a challenging sales environment in China and other regions, we were pleased to see sales in several markets improve on a consecutive quarter basis," said Kevin Guest, Chief Executive Officer. "We offered several incentives and promotions around the world during the quarter, which positively impacted customer growth and added approximately $16 million to net sales. We also recognize, however, that we still have work to do in the Southeast Asia Pacific and Americas/Europe regions towards regaining sales momentum."Regional ResultsNet sales in the Asia Pacific region decreased by 12.9% to $208.6 million for the third quarter of 2019. On a constant currency-basis, net sales in the Asia Pacific region decreased 10.7% during the third quarter of 2019. The total number of active Customers in the Asia Pacific region decreased by 10.1% year-over-year. Within Asia Pacific, net sales:• Decreased 18.6% in Greater China (down 16.4% on a constant currency basis);• Decreased 7.6% in Southeast Asia Pacific (down 6.8% on a constant currency basis); and• Increased 17.1% in North Asia (up 24.3% on a constant currency basis).Active Customers decreased by 17.3% in Greater China and by 2.6% in Southeast Asia Pacific. In North Asia, Active customers increased by 28.2%.Net sales in the Americas and Europe region decreased by 9% to $52.0 million for the third quarter of 2019, primarily due to a 6.1% decrease in active Customers.Mr. Guest continued, "In September, the Chinese government initiated a follow-up to the industry review they conducted during the first quarter of this year. We anticipated this 100-day follow-up review and will cooperate with the government throughout this process. To date, we have not experienced the negative media environment or restrictions on meetings that accompanied the government's previous review."As we conclude fiscal 2019, we will continue to utilize strategic incentive offerings to help generate sales and customer growth around the world, although not at the same level as those offered during the previous quarter. We remain optimistic in our long-term growth potential in China and our other regions around the world, and are committed to returning momentum to the business."Share Repurchase Program UpdateDuring the quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares of common stock for $92.4 million and reported weighted average diluted shares of 22.2 million for the quarter. The Company continues to have a strong balance sheet with no debt and $182.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. As of September 28, 2019, there was $30.0 million remaining under the current share repurchase authorization.OutlookThe Company updated its consolidated net sales and earnings per share outlook for fiscal year 2019 as follows:• Consolidated net sales between $1.030 billion and $1.045 billion, previously between $1.020 and $1.060 billion; and• Earnings per share between $3.90 and $4.05, previously between $3.70 and $4.10.The Company's outlook for the year reflects:• An estimated operating margin of between 12.7% and 12.9%;• An effective tax rate of approximately 33.5%;• An annualized diluted share count of approximately 22.8 million; and• An unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately $39 million related to a stronger U.S. dollar, which was previously estimated at $25 million.Chief Financial Officer Doug Hekking commented, "During the third quarter, we generated improved operating margins when compared to the first half of 2019. Although sales from promotional activity contributed to this improvement during the quarter, our efforts to align our cost structure with sales performance also contributed to improved sequential results. We plan to continue making necessary investments to execute our long-term growth strategies, generate momentum in each of our regions, and return to operating margins in line with historical results."Internal Investigation of China OperationsAs the Company first disclosed in February 2017, it is voluntarily conducting an internal investigation of its China operations, BabyCare Ltd. The investigation focuses on compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and certain conduct and policies at BabyCare, including BabyCare's expense reimbursement policies. The Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors has assumed direct responsibility for reviewing these matters and has hired experienced counsel to conduct the investigation. While the Company does not believe that the subject amounts are quantitatively material, or will materially affect its financial statements, it cannot currently predict the outcome of the investigation on its business, results of operations, or financial condition. The Company's internal investigation is substantially complete, however the Company continues to cooperate with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States Department of Justice. The Company cannot currently predict the duration, scope, or result of the investigation.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe Company prepares its financial statements using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Constant currency net sales, earnings, EPS and other currency-related financial information (collectively, "Financial Results") are non-GAAP financial measures that remove the impact of fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates and help facilitate period-to-period comparisons of the Company's Financial Results that we believe provide investors an additional perspective on trends and underlying business results. Constant currency Financial Results are calculated by translating the current period's Financial Results at the same average exchange rates in effect during the applicable prior-year period and then comparing this amount to the prior-year period's Financial Results.Conference CallThe Company has posted the "Management Commentary, Results and Outlook" document on the Company's website ( http://ir.usana.com ) under the "Investor Relations" section of the site. USANA will hold a conference call and webcast to discuss today's announcement with investors on Wednesday, October 23, 2019 at 11:00 AM Eastern Time. Investors may listen to the call by accessing USANA's website at            http://ir.usana.com . The call will consist of brief opening remarks by the Company's management team, before moving directly into questions and answers.About USANAUSANA develops and manufactures high-quality nutritional supplements, healthy foods and personal care products that are sold directly to Associates and Preferred Customers throughout the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, China, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Mexico, Malaysia, the Philippines, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Thailand, France, Belgium, Colombia, Indonesia, Germany, Spain, Romania, and Italy.
