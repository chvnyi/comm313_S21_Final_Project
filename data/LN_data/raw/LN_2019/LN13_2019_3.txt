Hoover event examines Chinese development, demographic shiftseval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'stanforddaily_com-box-3','ezslot_1']));The Stanford Daily: Stanford UniversityJanuary 2, 2019 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 701 wordsBodyOn Monday, the Hoover Institution held a panel discussion on China's upcoming governance challenges in light of national demographic, technological and societal shifts. The event was the second in the Institution's "Governance in an Emerging World" series, taking place in Hauck Auditorium.The panel included Nicholas Eberstadt, Henry Wendt Chair in Political Economy at the American Enterprise Institute; Maria Repnikova, an assistant professor at Georgia State University; Kai-Fu Lee, Chairman and CEO of Senovation Ventures; and Elsa Kania, fellow at the Center for a New American Security. Admiral Gary Roughead moderated the event.Eberstadt began the discussion by addressing the risks China will face in light of rapidly aging population. He said that, as China's working-age population declines, the proportion of China's senior-age population will grow by 4 percent each year, putting tremendous pressure on China's "rudimentary" social welfare network, especially in rural areas.Repnikova followed with comments on how the Chinese government is adapting to the rise of social media and a growing public opinion sphere. She argued that China's censorship of social media is importantly accompanied by an increased state responsiveness to public concerns."Many people don't pay attention to the growing Chinese state's responsiveness to public concerns online," Repnikova said. "Many [Chinese] officials are assigned to open up their social media pages to interact with the public and study public opinion."Lee addressed the emergence of China as an artificial intelligence superpower, challenging the common belief that AI innovation was concentrated in the U.S."I [want to] attack three myths people have. The first is that Silicon Valley is the center of innovation in the world, the second is that the AI is some fancy technology that only the U.S. can be ahead in and the third is that China is doing anything in AI due to governmental support," Lee said. "These three are identifiably false."Lee noted that, while the United States remains ahead of China on AI research and development, China is the world's expert in the implementation and monetization of the technology. He urged that the high usage rate of Chinese AI applications contributes to the country's flourishing tech environment, where venture capitalists invest 30 percent more money in AI than its U.S. counterparts."The most valuable speech recognition companies, machine translation companies, drone companies, computer vision companies [and] facial recognition companies, are all Chinese," Lee said.More than half of the event was reserved for a question and answer session. Audience members pressed the panel on issues ranging from the future of U.S.-China relations to the ethics of artificial intelligence.For third-year management science and engineering master's student Helen Yang, the event helped place her technical education within a broader social context."I've been an engineer for so long, and I wanted to have a broader perspective about politics and business ... I found this event to be perfect for me since I have background knowledge as a Chinese," Yang said.Lulu Wang, a first-year Ph.D. student in the Graduate School of Business, said that the talk serves as "a good reminder that, [while] a lot of conversations about China treat it as one undifferentiated mass run by one centralized government, the reality is that China is very diverse.""Governance in the Emerging World" is organized by George P. Shultz, Distinguished Fellow at the Hoover Institution, who previously served as the 60th Secretary of State. The next event in the Hoover series is titled "The Information Challenge to Democracy" and will take place on Nov. 13.Contact Berber Jin at fjin16 'at' stanford.edu.While you're here...We're a student-run organization committed to providing hands-on experience in journalism, digital media and business for the next generation of reporters.

Huawei defends security record as annual sales top $100BAssociated Press InternationalMarch 29, 2019 Friday 10:47 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 902 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: SHENZHEN, China BodySHENZHEN, China (AP) - Chinese tech giant Huawei's deputy chairman defended its commitment to security Friday after a stinging British government report added to Western pressure on the company by accusing it of failing to repair dangerous flaws in its telecom technology.Guo Ping's comments came as Huawei Technologies Ltd., the biggest global maker of network equipment for phone and internet companies, announced last year's sales surpassed $100 billion despite U.S. pressure on American allies to shun it as a security threat.Accusations that Huawei, China's first global tech brand, might facilitate Beijing's spying threaten to hamper its access to global carriers that are preparing to invest billions of dollars in next-generation technology.Britain's National Cyber Security Center added criticism Thursday on a different front, accusing Huawei of "poor software engineering." The agency said in a report British researchers saw no sign that was due to Chinese government interference, but it said Huawei had not repaired flaws that might make its systems vulnerable to cyberattacks.Guo didn't respond directly to the British report's criticisms but said Huawei will work with regulators to improve security. He noted the company has promised to invest $2 billion over five years to improve its software engineering and expressed confidence British regulators will "increase their confidence" in Huawei over time."We prioritize cybersecurity and privacy protection even above our commercial targets," Guo said at a news conference. He said the British report showed Huawei products had no "backdoors" to permit eavesdropping.Huawei is, along with Sweden's LM Ericsson and Nokia Corp. of Finland, a global leader in developing fifth-generation, or 5G, telecoms. The technology is intended to vastly expand mobile networks to support self-driving cars, medical devices and factory equipment, but that makes it more politically sensitive.Huawei is at the center of U.S.-Chinese tensions over technology and accusations of cyber-spying and violating trade sanctions on Iran.The company's chief financial officer was arrested in December in Canada on U.S. charges of lying to banks about dealings with Iran. Beijing has detained two Canadians and blocked imports of canola from Canada in what is widely seen as an attempt to compel her release.Huawei's U.S. market evaporated after a 2012 congressional report labeled the company a security threat, but sales elsewhere grew rapidly. Huawei passed Apple last year as the No. 2 global smartphone brand behind Samsung and earlier passed Ericsson as the No. 1 network gear seller.Australia, Japan and Taiwan have imposed curbs on use of Huawei technology, but Germany, France and other governments are balking at U.S. demands to exclude it from 5G networks. Carriers complain that would reduce competition, raise prices and delay the rollout of 5G service.Huawei has opened testing centers in Britain, Germany and Belgium for regulators to examine its products."We welcome the European Union's attitude," said Guo. "They do not discriminate against vendors from any country."Chinese officials and some industry analysts have suggested the Trump administration might be exaggerating security concerns to hinder a competitor to U.S. tech brands.Earlier this month, Premier Li Keqiang promised at a nationally televised news conference that Beijing never would tell Chinese tech companies to spy on foreign countries.Huawei's founder, Ren Zhengfei, told reporters earlier this year the latest U.S. criticism had yet to hurt sales. But Guo said Friday the company has to spend more time talking to potential customers "to address their concerns."Despite that, Huawei's sales last year rose 19.5 percent over 2017 to 721.2 billion ($105.2 billion), according to Guo. That was driven by double-digit gains for its consumer and enterprise units, while sales of network gear to phone and internet carriers were unchanged at 294 billion yuan ($62.3 billion).Profit rose 25.1 percent to 59.3 billion yuan ($8.6 billion).Guo blamed weak network gear sales on a temporary lull in investment by carriers. He expressed confidence 5G sales will take off this year.Huawei denies U.S. accusations it is controlled by China's ruling Communist Party and says it is owned by about half the members of its 180,000-strong workforce. The company has no publicly traded shares but started issuing annual financial reports a decade ago in an attempt to appear more open and mollify Western security concerns.Guo said global sales for the first two months of 2019 rose by more than 30 percent from a year earlier. Ren, the company founder, said earlier this year's revenue target is $125 billion.Huawei has announced sales of 5G networks to a handful of carriers and contracts with major carriers in Germany and other countries for field testing. The company says it already has shipped more than 40,000 5G base stations to customers.Huawei is asking a U.S. federal court in a lawsuit filed this month to throw out a law that bars the Trump administration and government contractors from using its equipment. The company says that improperly punishes the company without giving it away to defend itself.The company's chief legal officer, Song Liuping, said he had no updates on the lawsuit."We believe the U.S. court will give us a fair judgment," said Song at the news conference with Guo.Load-Date: March 30, 2019End of Document

China won't unleash 'runaway stimulus' to revive the economyCNN WireJanuary 15, 2019 Tuesday 11:29 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 973 wordsByline: Analysis by Daniel Shane, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  China's economic slowdown is causing alarm around the world, but President Xi Jinping's government may only be willing to go so far to limit the damage.Beijing on Tuesday announced 1.3 trillion yuan ($193 billion) worth of new measures designed to stimulate the economy, including tax cuts for small businesses and reduced tariffs. It's the latest in a flurry of government efforts to prop up growth in recent months, such as boosting infrastructure spending and looser monetary policy.Weakening growth in the world's second biggest economy combined with the trade war with the United States has spooked investors and prompted warnings from top companies like Apple (AAPL). Experts question whether Beijing's measures will be enough to stimulate the economy. "It'll take a lot more to pull China out of what feels like a recession," said Scott Kennedy, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.The country's official growth rate is expected to be around 6.5% for 2018, the weakest in nearly three decades, and to drop closer to 6% this year. But many analysts are skeptical about the accuracy of the government figures and say growth may be significantly lower in reality.Plenty of signs are flashing red. In December, Chinese exports suffered a surprise decline, while annual car sales in 2018 fell for the first time in around 20 years.Preventing growth collapsingPart of the problem is that China's easing measures could be hitting the wrong targets. The central bank has gradually cut the amount of cash commercial banks are required to hold as reserves. That should mean banks have more money to lend to businesses, encouraging investment and economic activity."The problem is that [this] money doesn't flow into the real economy," Larry Hu, chief China economist at investment bank Macquarie, said in a note to clients this month. Banks are instead parking the cash in Chinese government bonds or lending to inefficient, state-run businesses, which often use it to rollover their existing debts. This money would be more effective if it was directed to private businesses, according to Hu. Rather than fueling a rebound, the central bank's recent cuts may only "prevent growth from truly collapsing," said Christoper Balding, a China expert at the Fulbright University Vietnam in Ho Chi Minh City.More stimulus incoming Burgeoning evidence that the slowdown is getting worse makes more stimulus measures all but certain. In recent months, Beijing has moved ahead with plans for billions of dollars of new railway projects and tax cuts for small businesses. Officials also say they are preparing measures to help the struggling auto industry.But Beijing's efforts won't kick in straight away."It will take several more months of easing before the economy and stock market begin to feel the benefit," said Chen Long, an analyst at research firm Gavekal. Chinese stocks had a miserable 2018, suffering from the slowdown and the trade hostilities with the United States. And until stimulus measures start having a real effect, "market momentum is going to deteriorate further," Long said.Lessons from the 'big bang'China's plans this time around are small change compared with the "big bang" stimulus it launched in response to the global financial crisis. In 2008 and 2009, Beijing injected nearly $600 billion into its economy to fight off the effects of the global slowdown. "China still has a lot of ammunition" in terms of the moves it can make, said Jeff Ng, chief Asia economist at research firm Continuum Economics. But he warned that "there are side effects."One concern is the huge amount of debt in the country's financial system. The Chinese economy expanded rapidly in the years after the global financial crisis thanks to repeated debt binges. But that left it nursing a hangover.President Xi and other top officials have in recent years pressed China's financial system to cut down on riskier lending, a campaign often referred to as "deleveraging". But as the economy has weakened, the priority has shifted."In view of the extraordinary difficulty that China is facing amid trade tensions, China is willing to halt its deleveraging efforts in order to defend growth," said Janet Mui, an economist at investment firm Cazenove Capital in London. Losses in the stock market have increased the pressure on authorities to keep adding stimulus, she said.The risks of 'runaway stimulus'But too much stimulus runs the risk of adding to China's already worrisome debt levels.It could also pile pressure on the country's currency, which despite a recent rally is still down significantly against the dollar over the past year. That could lead to renewed fears of investors moving huge sums of money out of China and increase trade tensions with the Trump administration, which has repeatedly accused Beijing of weakening its currency to boost Chinese exporters. "Chinese policymakers are wary of broad-based stimulus in high dosages," said Darren Tay, a country risk analyst at research firm Fitch Solutions. "Loosening monetary policy too quickly could indeed cause the yuan to weaken quickly."Repeated injections of cash into the economy may also add fuel to China's red-hot property market and damagingly distort its industrial sector.In December, prices of Chinese industrial and manufactured goods rose at a much slower pace than expected. Some analysts suggest this may mean China is again starting to suffer from overcapacity --- production that exceeds demand and lowers global prices. "We believe Beijing is painfully aware of these risks, which is why we do not expect runaway stimulus this time around," said Tay.Nanlin Fang contributed to this report. TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Economic worries hang over U.S.-China talksPolitico.comJanuary 6, 2019 Sunday 3:45 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1053 wordsByline: DPalmer@politico.com,  (Doug Palmer)Highlight: Officials and business leaders are hoping that meetings in Beijing spur a continued thaw in relations between the economic superpowers.BodyPresident Donald Trump took a big gamble in 2018 that the U.S. economy could withstand a trade war with China. Talks this week in Beijing could determine if that bet will pay off.A U.S. team led by Deputy Trade Representative Jeffrey Gerrish will hold two days of discussions with Chinese officials to try to resolve concerns that prompted Trump to slap duties on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods."We'll see what happens," Trump told reporters on Friday when asked about the negotiations. "But I can tell you, China is not doing well now and it puts us in a very strong position. We are doing well."No agreement is expected this week, but the meeting is likely to set the stage for higher level talks next week between delegations led by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He.Officials from both nations expressed cautious optimism going into the discussions. Larry Kudlow, Trump's top economic adviser, told Bloomberg TV on Friday that the scheduled talks were a good sign that some kind of deal could be reached.A Chinese government trade policy adviser told the South China Morning Post that both nations were expected "to take the chance to check their respective demands and offers and to check any chance to reach a trade deal.""Both sides are close to finding a solution to address the trade imbalance, and China is open to adjusting some of its structural problems in the economy. It will also take steps toward market-oriented competition," said the adviser, who spoke on condition that he not be identified because of the sensitive nature of the discussions. However, the person cautioned that there were limits on how fast China can move.U.S. officials view this week's meetings as an opportunity to feel out how far China is willing to go to address U.S. concerns on a number of issues like barriers that keep out foreign companies and intellectual property theft through forced technology transfers and cyberattacks. Trump blames such unfair trade practices for the huge U.S. trade deficit with China, which is expected to have set a record in 2018 at more than $400 billion.Last week, Apple blamed the escalating trade friction for reduced sales in China. The tech giant also lowered its revenue forecast for the first quarter.If the U.S. and China cannot come to some détente by March 1, Trump plans to raise duties on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent, up from 10 percent currently. That would match the 25 percent duty he has already imposed on another $50 billion worth of Chinese goods. (Beijing too has retaliated over the last year on most of the U.S.' exports to the country.)This week's discussions are the first face-to-face talks since Trump's Dec. 1 dinner meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Buenos Aires, where both were attending the annual G-20 leaders summit. Since then, there has been a thaw in the escalating tensions and war of words.China has since resumed purchases of American soybeans and temporarily removed its 25 percent retaliatory duty on auto imports from the U.S. That reduced the auto tariff to 15 percent - the same faced by Japan and European and other nations.China has also announced some changes in the recent weeks including a new draft of its foreign investment law that promises additional liberalization and regulatory changes that appear to provide stronger enforcement for patents, said Erin Ennis, senior vice president at the U.S.-China Business Council. In another area, a new e-commerce law went into force on Jan. 1 which increases the amount that Chinese consumers can buy from overseas websites, she said.Depending on how they are implemented, such measures could address some of the issues the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative raised as part of the investigation that led to Trump imposing tariffs, she said.The business community is hoping the talks result in both countries removing the duties they imposed last year. That could involve gradually reversing the tit-for-tat duties and other retaliatory actions."If there's not a clear path for lifting those duties, they will continue to weigh on the economy and companies just like they did in 2018," Ennis said.New U.S. jobs figures released Friday seemed to validate Trump's wager that the U.S. economy is strong enough to withstand higher tariffs. Employers hired the most new workers in 10 months in December, boosting jobs created last year to 2.6 million, compared to 2.2 million in 2017.That helped lift stocks on Friday, taking some of the sting out of the news that markets ended 2018 with their worst performance in 10 years. Last year's selloff was partly fueled by worries that the trade war could hurt growth in world's two largest economies.But one economist expressed doubt the United States was in a stronger position than China to weather the trade war. "I think the White House wants a deal desperately because they see the damage that's being done to the U.S. corporate sector," said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, a consulting firm.The best that may come from the next couple of months of negotiations is another decision by Trump to delay tariff increases until the middle of the year, Brusuelas said. At that point though, Trump's patience may wear out and he could decide to impose duties on imports of all Chinese goods, even if his advisers are urging him not to take that step, he said.U.S. officials are expected to listen closely to whether China carries through on what it promised. In late 2018, Chinese officials gave the United States proposals to address its government subsidies, market access barriers and intellectual property theft. Those documents, and a more recent U.S. response, are expected to be the focus of this week's talks."If Gerrish hears that the Chinese are really serious about doing some hard things, putting meat on the bones of vague commitments and willing to work with the U.S. on verification and enforcement mechanisms, then I think you'll see negotiations move forward at an accelerated clip," a U.S. industry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of trade discussions.If not, "it's going to be more difficult," the person said. Ben White contributed to this article.Article originally published on POLITICO MagazineLoad-Date: January 7, 2019End of Document

Views on the News: China's social credit systemThe Justice: Brandeis UniversityFebruary 5, 2019 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: FORUM; Pg. 1Length: 740 wordsBodyNelson SaBig data and artificial intelligence: a perfect mix to elicit age-old Orwellian fears.Broadly speaking, reputational mechanisms are pervasive in our lives, and credit scoresare heavily used in countries like the United States. Debtor-targeted policies like the onesmaking the rounds in the latest news require, however, excellent governance. Expedited andtransparent mechanisms need to be in place for individuals to dispute and correct errors.Sharing large databases across multiple platforms adds new risks for hacking and identitytheft. In a political system prone to complex bureaucracy, individuals may easily getentangled in petty review processes and become subject to abusive rent-seekingbehaviors. In the meantime, anyone marked as a debtor under such public conditions may be precluded from a large range of economic opportunities, facing layers of punishment that go beyond those legally prescribed. By the end of the day, when technological development outpaces the ability of institutions to handle new challenges in a fair and prompt way, distortions arise, and incentives may fail to accomplish their intended goals. Policies cannot be evaluated in isolation. Different areas of institutional development need to be addressed (in particular in the workings of the financial, legal and political systems in China) before initiatives of this kind can inspire broader trust.Nelson Sa is a Lecturer in the Economics Department Specializing in Macroeconomics and Industrial Organization.Alexander Holtmann '21The Chinese Social Credit System is in fact nothing outrageously new. In Nudge Theory, political agendas and behavioral economics are used by governments to change the environment so that a desired outcome - the citizens' behavior - is achieved. What is new about the Chinese system, however, is how severely it paralyzes citizens' access to important resources. The problem with this is that it sets personal debt equal to harming the public. One could only imagine this system on a college campus or at a Federal Reserve; we would be drowning in shame. In light of the Chinese government's agenda to mass surveil its citizens, this is yet another tool that will further foster insecurities and public tensions. Looking forward, no changes are planned to make platforms less revealing, as the goal of them is to feed into a finger-pointing culture that abides the rule of the governing party's ideology.Alexander Holtmann '21 is an Economics and Philosophy double major and an undergraduate Researcher at the Center for German and European Studies.Alden Good '21I feel that while this system may accomplish a practical goal for the Chinese government of eliminating a good deal of debt that might be present. It seems as though this system is another form of the Chinese Communist Party re-engaging in an invasion of privacy that was once quite normal and is, unfortunately, becoming normal once more. This is to say nothing of the millions of marginalized elements that have emerged in recent years. Exposing and exploiting the debt of these persons, who have often times gone unpaid by their government, would be an immense hypocrisy on their part. While the ultimate outcome of this program is unknown, it will no doubt serve to create an immense resentment in the already displeased Chinese people while perhaps having little to no effect on the actual debt that people may hold.Alden Good '21 is a Politics and Economics double major.This approach to China's debt system is reminiscent of an episode of Black Mirror and has nothing but negative implications. While China generally has lower household debt than most Western nations, there has been a rise in debt within the past 15 years. This means of trying to shame people into paying their debts does not seem effective; this is under the assumption that everyone is motivated by public shame to improve their social standing and that people are simply not paying their debts due to laziness. The software is supposed to target those that have withstanding debt, despite their ability to do so but not everyone has the same social circumstances. Money that the government assumes can be used to pay debt might be used to pay medical bills or other familial expenses. A better way to address the issue might be to create more debt-forgiveness programs that allow people to work off their debts, in a sense.Nia Lyn '19 is an Associate Editor for the JusticeLoad-Date: February 5, 2019End of Document

Canada's relations with China were already bad.

The US government alleges that Meng helped Huawei dodge US sanctions on Iran and has indicated it will file a formal extradition request by the January 30 deadline.Speaking to Chinese-language reporters in Beijing last week, McCallum said that Meng stood a good chance of avoiding extradition to the United States, suggesting that remarks made by US President Donald Trump had potentially strengthened her case.His comments sparked outrage in Canada, with opposition party members demanding his immediate resignation. McCallum backtracked and offered an apology Thursday.However, speaking to a reporter from the Vancouver Star about the case again on Friday, McCallum further embarrassed Trudeau's Liberal party government, saying that a decision by Washington to drop the extradition request would be "great for Canada."Originally Trudeau stood by his ambassador, but on Saturday the Prime Minister announced he had asked for McCallum's resignation, without providing an explicit reason."Last night I asked for and accepted John McCallum's resignation as Canada's ambassador to China," Trudeau said in a statement.Speaking at a regular press briefing Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang declined to comment on McCallum's dismissal, calling it "an internal matter for Canada."But Geng reiterated Beijing's view that Meng's arrest was no simple legal issue, but a case with "strong political intentions and manipulation."

Poland: Huawei exec, Polish security expert spied for ChinaAssociated Press Financial WireJanuary 12, 2019 Saturday 1:38 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 1150 wordsByline: By VANESSA GERA and KELVIN CHAN, Associated PressDateline: WARSAW, Poland BodyWARSAW, Poland (AP) - Poland has arrested a director at the Chinese tech giant Huawei and one of its own former cybersecurity experts and charged them with spying for China, authorities said Friday.The development comes as the U.S. is exerting pressure on its allies not to use Huawei, the world's biggest maker of telecommunications network equipment, over data security concerns.The two men - one a Chinese citizen who was a former envoy in Poland before moving over to a senior position at Huawei and the other a Pole who held several top government cybersecurity positions - were arrested Tuesday, according to Poland's Internal Security Agency.Polish security agents searched the Warsaw offices of Huawei and Orange, Poland's leading communications provider, where the former Polish security expert recently worked, seizing documents and electronic data. The homes of both men, also in Warsaw, were also searched, according to agency spokesman Stanislaw Zaryn.It's the latest setback for Huawei in Europe, where the company has ambitious plans to roll out next-generation "5G" mobile networks, which it is a leader in developing. The arrest is a fresh sign that a U.S. dispute with China over its ban on the company is spilling over to Europe, Huawei's biggest foreign market.Some European governments and telecom companies are following the U.S. lead in questioning whether using Huawei for vital infrastructure for mobile networks could leave them exposed to snooping by the Chinese government.Maciej Wasik, deputy head of Poland's Special Services agency, said the operation that resulted in the arrests of the two suspects had been underway for a long time. He said "both carried out espionage activities against Poland."Zaryn told The Associated Press that prosecutors have charged the two men with espionage, but agents are continuing to collect evidence and interview witnesses. Further indictments are expected, he said.He said no further details would be released about the case because it is classified and the investigation is ongoing.Polish state television TVP reported that the men have proclaimed their innocence, but Zaryn said he could not confirm that. If convicted, they could face up to 10 years in prison each.TVP identified the arrested Chinese man as Weijing W., saying he was a director in Poland at Huawei. It said he also went by the Polish first name of Stanislaw and had previously worked at the Chinese consulate in Gdansk.A LinkedIn profile for a man named Stanislaw Wang appears to match details of the man described by Polish television.Wang's resume said he worked at China's General Consulate in Gdansk from 2006-2011 and at Huawei Enterprise Poland since 2011, where he was first director of public affairs and since 2017 the "sales director of public sector." The resume said he received a bachelor's degree in 2004 from the Beijing University of Foreign Studies.State TV identified the Polish man as Piotr D., and said he was a high-ranking employee at the Internal Security Agency, where he served as deputy director in the department of information security, until 2011.The Polish state news agency, PAP, said the man had also held top cybersecurity positions at the Interior Ministry and the Office of Electronic Communications, a regulatory body that oversees cyber and other telecommunications issues.It said, while at the Internal Security Agency, he was involved in building a mobile communications system for top Polish officials, and he was fired in 2011 amid a major corruption scandal.Geopolitical tensions over Huawei have intensified since Canada arrested a top executive last month at the request of U.S. authorities. The company has been blocked in the U.S. since 2012 over fears that its equipment is a security risk, and last year Australia, New Zealand and Japan instituted their own bans against using Huawei.U.S. officials have reportedly fanned out across Europe recently to make their case with governments and Huawei suppliers for blocking the company.The company and analysts have long maintained that it has never been found guilty of a cybersecurity breach but the latest accusation, if confirmed, will deal a blow to that defense."One thing is clear: this is another nail in the coffin of Huawei's European ambitions," said Thorsten Benner, director of the Global Public Policy Institute, a think tank.The arrest might not have a big impact on broader trade tensions between China and the U.S., but it shows that "there will always be competition and acrimony related to Chinese tech companies," Benner said.Huawei, which also makes smartphones and other consumer devices, issued a statement from its Chinese headquarters saying it was aware of the situation in Poland and was looking into it."We have no comment for the time being. Huawei complies with all applicable laws and regulations in the countries where it operates, and we require every employee to abide by the laws and regulations in the countries where they are based," the statement said.Poland is Huawei's headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe and the Nordic region.An official at the Chinese Embassy in Warsaw said China attaches "great importance to the detention" of the Chinese citizen in Poland and that Chinese envoys had met with Polish Foreign Ministry officials to urge them to arrange a consular visit "as soon as possible."The Chinese Foreign Ministry said late Friday it is "closely following the detention of Huawei employee Wang Weijing" and has asked Poland to "handle the case lawfully, fairly, properly and to effectively guarantee the legitimate rights of the person, his safety and his humanitarian treatment," according to state broadcaster CCTV.Orange Poland told the AP on Friday it was cooperating with Polish security services in the case and had "handed over belongings of one of our employees" in Tuesday's search of its offices. Orange told the AP it did not know if the suspicions against its employee were related to his work at Orange or elsewhere.Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested Dec. 1 in Canada in connection with U.S. accusations that the company violated restrictions on sales of American technology to Iran.The United States wants Meng extradited to face charges that she misled banks about the company's business dealings in Iran. She is out on bail in Canada awaiting extradition proceedings.On Dec. 10, China detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor on vague national security allegations in apparent retaliation for Meng's arrest.China's ambassador to Canada accused the country this week of "white supremacy" in calling for the release of the two Canadians, while describing the detentions as an "act of self-defense."___Chan reported from London.

DEPARTMENT PRESS BRIEFING - MARCH 26, 2019States News ServiceMarch 26, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 7196 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Department of State:TRANSCRIPT:2:49 p.m. EDTMR PALLADINO: A couple things from the top. Next week, we welcome the Democratic Republic of Congos president, Felix Tshisekedi, on his first official visit to the United States. Thatll be April 3rd through 5th. We share President Tshisekedis interest in developing a strong partnership between the United States and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and were committed to working with him to advance his agenda to combat corruption, strengthen the rule of law, enhance security, protect human rights, and promote economic growth through increased foreign investment and trade, particularly with the United States.During his visit, President Tshisekedi will meet with Secretary Pompeo as well as other United States Cabinet-level and high-level officials to discuss United States-Democratic Republic of the Congo cooperation on a range of issues, including efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak in Eastern Congo. We support President Tshisekedis commitment to delivering change that the Congolese people desire and deserve, and we share a common interest in realizing Congos potential and in creating a better and more prosperous future.Secondly, while staying on Africa, yesterday the United States announced nearly 3.4 million in emergency humanitarian food assistance in response to Cyclone Idai and related flooding in Mozambique. This is the worst natural disaster in Southern Africa in nearly two decades.QUESTION: Im sorry, you said 3.4 million what? Dollars, pounds, tons?MR PALLADINO: 3.4 million dollars --QUESTION: Okay.MR PALLADINO: -- in emergency humanitarian food assistance. This is the worst natural disaster in Southern Africa in nearly two decades. The United States Agency for International Development is already on the ground. They have a 13-person Disaster Assistance Response Team that is delivering relief supplies to inaccessible areas. The Department of Defense is also supporting the response by providing airlift and logistics support.The United States Government continues to assess humanitarian needs and coordinate response efforts with the Government of Mozambique and humanitarian organizations. More than 440 people have died as a result of the storm, and more than 600,000 people are in need of assistance. Our thoughts are with the people of Mozambique.And finally, team on the field: Today Secretary Pompeo sent a note to all staff announcing that Stuart McGuigan has joined us yesterday as both our new chief information officer and head of the Bureau of Information Resource Management. The Secretary said that, quote, Every aspect of the departments information technology capabilities and operations now falls under Stuarts oversight, including architecture, infrastructure, cyber security, data management, software, and application development and acquisition, end quote. Mr. McGuigan joins us after nearly seven years as CIO of Johnson and Johnson, where he was responsible for information technology strategy there and operations for the companys 130,000 employees around the world.At the same time, the Secretary we also want to express our thanks to Karen Mummaw for her service these past 15 months as the departments acting CIO. Karen is a career senior Foreign Service officer with a distinguished record of service both at home and abroad. And after 31 years of public service, Karen has elected to move forward on retirement plans that were put on hold, actually, when she assumed the acting role of CIO back in December 2017. So her service exemplifies what our team is all about, and we thank her for her service.And finally, I would just note that our back row is filled with interns from our Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Welcome. Youre not allowed to ask questions, but youre (laughter.) Okay.QUESTION: Im sure theyd have some good ones.MR PALLADINO: They might have some good ones, though.QUESTION: Can I ask you a logistical question on the Congolese president? Since the White unless I missed it while weve been here, I havent seen any kind of an announcement from the White House, which usually announces heads of state visits. Since youre doing it, does that mean that he wont have any meetings at the White House or --MR PALLADINO: Nothing to announce at this time. The Secretary of State looks forward to hosting him, and he will have a series of high-level agencies throughout the interagency.QUESTION: Right. But I mean, he is the president of the country that is in --MR PALLADINO: Nothing to announce at this time, Matt, no.QUESTION: Yeah, okay. I wonder. Now, kind of a bizarre question. Youre familiar with this incident that happened at the North Korean embassy in Madrid not so long ago?MR PALLADINO: Ive seen press reports.QUESTION: Okay. First of all, do you know anything about what happened there? Youve presumably then seen the Spanish judges report or on it. So anything you have on that Id be interested in. And secondly, this was an attack or an invasion of a diplomatic compound. Do you have anything to say about that, considering that you have come out strongly against such incidents in the past, no matter what country the compound has belonged to?MR PALLADINO: Of course. We the United States would always call for the protection of embassies belonging to any diplomatic mission throughout the world. Thats something that we are obligated by, both by international treaty and by standard practice throughout the world. So that goes without saying.Regarding the specifics of whats going on, Spanish authorities are investigating. The investigation is still underway. For any details on their investigation, I would have to refer you to Spanish authorities.QUESTION: Can you say that the United States Government at least had nothing to do with this?MR PALLADINO: The United States Government had nothing to do with this.QUESTION: Thank you.MR PALLADINO: All right. Sure.QUESTION: North Korea?MR PALLADINO: Go ahead, Lesley.QUESTION: I do you want to go to North Korea?QUESTION: Is that okay?QUESTION: Thats if you want to continue the conversation.QUESTION: Okay. What was President Trump talking about when he tweeted about revoking sanctions that have been imposed? There seems to be much lingering confusion about that.MR PALLADINO: This is the United States State Department, and for secretaries we speak on behalf of the State Department from this building, of course.QUESTION: Well I thought you might know something about this.MR PALLADINO: Of course we do.QUESTION: Well, you also speak on behalf of the administration, the entire administration.MR PALLADINO: Of course. And the point here is that our position hasnt changed in the least, and that the international community will continue to implement United Nations Security Council resolutions to underscore to North Korea that the only way to achieve the security and development that it seeks is to forsake its weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. That remains our policy and that remains what were pursuing.QUESTION: Well are there sanctions that are being withdrawn or not?MR PALLADINO: For sanctions I would refer you to the Department of Treasury. Thats not something that we address from the State Department.Please.QUESTION: Just thought Id ask.QUESTION: Wait a second.QUESTION: Yeah.QUESTION: Thats not true. You guys address sanctions all the time.MR PALLADINO: Well, the status I would refer you for details on --QUESTION: You cant you know what, look, you got to be consistent.MR PALLADINO: -- department of sanctions I would refer you to the Department of Treasury.QUESTION: You cant pick and choose when the President lets loose with a tweet about sanctions, which you talk about all the time, on Venezuela, on Iran, on North Korea, in fact. So whats going on here? Are they --MR PALLADINO: For the details of the Department of Treasury sanctions that were announced last week, I would refer you to the Department of Treasury. But --QUESTION: As far as you understand, as far as this building understands, those sanctions are still in place?MR PALLADINO: Absolutely.QUESTION: Thank you.MR PALLADINO: Please.QUESTION: One more (inaudible) Steve Biegun.MR PALLADINO: Please, go ahead.QUESTION: Yes. Special Representative Biegun said that he ask the China to cooperate with sanctions against North Korea, but why President there has been lift new sanctions I mean additional sanctions? Its kind of a little confused, one or the other is they say we going to cooperate with the UN sanctions, but he say (inaudible) sanctions no longer no.MR PALLADINO: We consult regularly with China and other partners on these matters, and our goal remains the same. Thats the final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea. That hasnt changed, and thats something that we are continue to pursue with China and other partners as well as our allies.Please.QUESTION: (Off-mike.)MR PALLADINO: Is there more North Korea?QUESTION: Yes, sir.MR PALLADINO: All right. Lets go one more North Korea.QUESTION: So President Trump tweeted that he said he ordered withdrawals new, large-scale sanctions. And you just mentioned that all sanctions are still in place.MR PALLADINO: Our policy, yeah, has not changed, and that is, the international community is going to continue to implement the United Nations Security Council resolutions to underscore to North Korea that thats the only way to achieve the security that they seek. The pressure campaign is what has been instrumental in creating a diplomatic opening, and the President has made clear throughout the process that that will continue until denuclearization is complete.Lets move on, moving on.QUESTION: (Off-mike.)QUESTION: North Korea?MR PALLADINO: Go ahead. Laurie, go ahead.QUESTION: Yeah. Could you clarify a point from yesterdays briefing about the forces that are to maintain the safe zone in Syria? Ive got three questions. That will the forces in the safe zone in Syria include U.S. and other coalition forces like Britain and France, even if their main mission, as Ambassador Jeffrey said, is to defeat ISIS? Theyre going to be in the safe zone? Will the Syrian Democratic Forces be involved in protecting the safe zone? Will Turkish or Turkish allied forces be involved?MR PALLADINO: Okay, thanks. Yeah, Ambassador Jeffrey spoke about this yesterday at length. What I would say is that the ISIS, while the territorys - been defeated we said this often now it remains and that is a big accomplishment. Its a big deal, to use Ambassador Jeffreys words. They remain a threat throughout northeast Syria, and as long as theyre a threat, this is what were focused on. We are going to as Ambassador Jeffrey said, were going to have a small residual force of the United States military. Theyre going to remain in northeast Syria, and that will be as part of a multinational force. And they will be there to prevent an ISIS resurgence, and, related to that, to provide support, to provide stability in northeast Syria so that our partners can do everything to maintain pressure on ISIS and those networks that exist.Now, regarding composition and the more detailed things, we were consulting. We are planning proactively with other members of the global coalition who have identified their intent to support this transition phase of operations in Syria. That continues. As far as were going to continue to work, as Ambassador Jeffrey said, on the details of this matter, and were optimistic. Were confident that we can achieve a good outcome on that front.QUESTION: Would that include forces from the Syrian Democratic Forces?MR PALLADINO: I dont have anything further to provide beyond that with to what Ambassador Jeffrey alluded to yesterday at this point. Were talking about it. Were looking at it, and I dont have anything further beyond that at this point.QUESTION: Robert?QUESTION: On Syria still?MR PALLADINO: Yes. Ill take the water, thank you very much. All right.QUESTION: On Syria still, Robert? On Syria?MR PALLADINO: Syria.QUESTION: Very quick.MR PALLADINO: Okay. Go ahead.QUESTION: Today the Secretary of State issued a statement on the 40th anniversary of the Egypt-Israel Camp David Accord, the peace treaty, which was premised on Resolution 242 and the principle of land for peace. So I guess now there is no land to sort of trade between Syria and Israel. Is that the case? Do you consider 242 to have been fulfilled, null and void? What is your take on that?MR PALLADINO: Yeah. Well, the decision that the President announced was a critical strategic and of security importance to the state of Israel and to stability of the Middle East. So to allow the Golan Heights to be controlled by the likes of Syrian and Iranian regimes would be to turn a blind eye to threats emanating from a Syrian regime that engages in atrocities, and from Iran and terrorist actors, including Hizballah, that would seek to use the Golan Heights as a launching ground for attacks against Israel.QUESTION: I understand all that, but the principle of land for peace --QUESTION: Well, hold on just sorry, Said. You might understand it. I dont understand it at all. Was there some threat that Iran and Syria were actually going to control the Golan Heights?MR PALLADINO: Without --QUESTION: If there was, I missed it.MR PALLADINO: There have been --QUESTION: Maybe Im --MR PALLADINO: There have been many efforts threatening --QUESTION: Yeah, not to control it, though.MR PALLADINO: But a lack of Israels ability to defend that area would be to undermine Israeli security, and enhancing the Golan Heights is to enhance Israels security and which strengthens, frankly, our ability to partner with Israel to fight the common threats that we face.QUESTION: I dont understand what is different three days ago about Israels ability to defend the Golan that what is different today than it was three days ago? And you talk about the regional stability, but every single country in the region except for Israel, every single one of them, all of Syria and Israels neighbors, have come out against this and say its bad for stability. So this is a case where you and Israel are right and everyone else, including the neighbors, are wrong?MR PALLADINO: Not a popularity contest.QUESTION: Well, thats good because if it was --MR PALLADINO: Standing up for what is right oftentimes is not. This is something that the President has been considering for some time. As he made clear, the statement on the Golan Heights fully reflects our understanding of the unique circumstances that makes it appropriate to recognize Israeli sovereignty at this time.QUESTION: I get that. But is it your position that Israels control of the Golan without this announcement by the President would have been somehow threatened or that it was in jeopardy that --MR PALLADINO: It was a recognition of reality that the President moved forward on this position.QUESTION: And do you think that it will change Irans efforts or Syrias efforts to infiltrate terrorists or fighters into the Golan simply because theres a U.S. the U.S. President has signed a proclamation saying that its that it recognizing Israels sovereignty over it?MR PALLADINO: It certainly makes things clearer, and Israels security is something that, of course, theyre going to continue to defend --QUESTION: Oh, I know.MR PALLADINO: -- and something that were going to continue to support.QUESTION: And this administration has made it clear, as have previous administrations, but this one has made it clear say, with Gaza, with the border with Lebanon, and that the land that Israel has there is Israeli sovereign territory, and that hasnt stopped Hamas or Hizballah from trying to from either launching attacks or so Im just curious as to why you think that the proclamation actually changes conditions on the ground to the point where that some kind of threat to Israels control over it is now done.MR PALLADINO: Were not saying the threat is over in any way. The threat, of course, continues, and Israels need and our need to help support continues, of course. That affects all the stabilization.Yeah.QUESTION: Yeah, I just want to finish my question, if I may. So to be clear, so do you consider 242 to be null and void, completely fulfilled? There is no land to trade since the whole premise of that is land for peace. So that land is no longer, as far as youre concerned, is no longer Syrian, correct? So 242, is it null and void? Is it and 338 as a matter of fact, the other UN resolution, is it considered fulfilled, null and void? What is your designation to the resolutions 242 and 338?MR PALLADINO: The administration has made clear that it supports negotiation towards a comprehensive peace between Israel and its neighbors.QUESTION: Including Syria?MR PALLADINO: This administration, unlike previous administrations, is willing to acknowledge the reality that there can be no comprehensive peace agreement that does not satisfactorily address Israels security needs in the Golan Heights. This is an area that is vital to Israels national security.QUESTION: Gaza. Real quick on Gaza. I just want things are heating up again, and the Israelis now are saying that a ceasefire can only be implemented if its somehow conditioned on ending the demonstrations, the demonstrations that take place every Friday in Gaza. Do you agree with that premise or agree with that principle that they ought to be tied the ceasefire and ending the demonstrations?MR PALLADINO: We condemn the rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel.QUESTION: Im not talking about the rockets. Im talking about --MR PALLADINO: Its important to say this. We condemn the rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel, and we strongly support Israels right to defend itself. The attacks are outrageous and unacceptable.QUESTION: So you --MR PALLADINO: Our position is there must be a complete and permanent halt. We welcome efforts by regional allies that are seeking to restore calm and prevent further attacks. And I have nothing further on that.QUESTION: Thats all excellent, but is it should it be tied to the demonstrations and ending the demonstrations?MR PALLADINO: We welcome efforts by regional allies that are seeking to restore calm and prevent attacks.Go, please. Rich, Fox.QUESTION: Robert, very briefly on Mexico City, the Secretary mentioned this morning that perhaps you would have some more specifics, maybe even a ballpark, on how much the U.S. is withholding from the OAS. And this is the second expansion of the policy that the administration has announced while its in office. Do you see that perhaps there is more room to tighten this policy going forward?MR PALLADINO: Give me a second here. Right. So regarding your first question on the specific numbers, this has to do with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which is part of the Organization of American States, and in light of concerns regarding certain of their activities related to abortion. The Secretary of State directed the withholding of part of the Fiscal Year 2019 U.S.-assessed contribution to the Organization of American States. Specifically to your question, that withholding is $210,000 and that is the equivalent to the United States proportional share of possible OAS costs in question.QUESTION: Robert, India?QUESTION: Is that money directly supposed to go to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, or was it just to the OAS more broadly? In other words, is the entire OAS being hit with this because of something that the Inter the Commission did?MR PALLADINO: My understanding is its specific to the let me get the acronym right IACHR. Correct.QUESTION: Perhaps youre familiar with what country actually led the charge to create this commission. In fact, former Secretary Powell was in South America on 9/11 pushing for the charter to be adopted that that charter created this. So are you saying now that because this commission that you, in fact, created you meaning the United States has taken a position against the criminalization of abortion, which is what I understand they did, that youre now going to withhold money from it? Is that right? You dont see any kind of irony there?MR PALLADINO: We work tirelessly to ensure --QUESTION: You created this thing.MR PALLADINO: -- United States support for the Organization of American States to make sure that its used for purposes that align with United States foreign policy objectives and national interests. We continue to support --QUESTION: So its gone rogue? Is that right?MR PALLADINO: We continue to support the Organization of American States as well as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. That supports a number of important United States and shared regional foreign policy objectives in the hemisphere, including those in Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua. We also take our obligation very seriously to ensure that activities implemented with U.S. funds are consistent with what the Secretary discussed this morning, this Siljander Amendment. And so we see no inconsistencies.QUESTION: What was the total 210,000 of how much?MR PALLADINO: Two hundred and ten thousand, correct.QUESTION: Of how much?MR PALLADINO: I dont have the full budget, but this is the proportional part directly related to those activities in question.QUESTION: And then on just room going forward to tighten, is the administration looking at other ways?MR PALLADINO: Dont have any information in that regard. Nothing to announce at this time.QUESTION: I have a follow-up on that.MR PALLADINO: Go ahead, Shaun. Go ahead.QUESTION: Different part of the world, on Thailand. If you have a follow-up, then --QUESTION: I have a follow-up on Mexico City. Is that okay?MR PALLADINO: All right, lets okay, one more, sure.QUESTION: Great. So speaking to what Rich was asking, are there other multilateral institutions that you believe the U.S. would be in violation of the Siljander Amendment if they continued giving them funds? Are there other multilateral institutions that you think are lobbying for or against abortion?And also, do you have any estimate of the amount of programs that you think will be affected by the expansion announced today of the Mexico City Policy, and are there specific groups that the U.S. is looking at who they believe are funding or financially supporting other groups who are promoting abortion?MR PALLADINO: Yeah. I dont have anything on specific groups that to announce at the podium, and as far as future actions that we may be considering or take, nothing to preview at this time.QUESTION: Should other multilateral institutions be on the lookout, be warned? Are you issuing --MR PALLADINO: I think the United States I think Secretary Pompeo made pretty clear this morning that this administration is a pro-life administration and that were going to continue to seek to advocate our values strongly and globally.Now, Shaun, Im going to go back to you, because you --QUESTION: Thailand. Thailand had elections over the weekend, first since the military coup. Do you believe that these were free and fair elections? Do you believe that this represents a restoration of democracy? Theres been concern, notably from former Prime Minister Thaksin, who alleges widespread irregularities.MR PALLADINO: Right. We congratulate the tens of millions of Thai citizens who participated in the long-awaited March 24th election for demonstrating their strong support for return to elected government. The voting, along with, we note, robust media coverage of the process and open debate of its merits those are positive signs for a return to a democratic government that reflects the will of the people. We stand with the Thai people in calling for the expeditious announcement of voting results and a fair and transparent investigation of any reported irregularities. The United States looks forward to working with Thailands newly elected government to advance values that bring our countries closer together, including democracy, security, and prosperity for all citizens.QUESTION: Just following up briefly on that, the are you are there any concerns about representation of parties? One of the major parties was disbanded legally ahead of the election. Do you think that there is a broad enough spectrum represented in the political process?MR PALLADINO: We are interested in a result that reflects the will of the Thai people. The United States does not support any candidate or political party. We support the democratic process.QUESTION: What about Algeria? Do you have any comment on the military calling for the presidency to be vacated now?MR PALLADINO: I dont have I havent seen that and I dont have anything for you on that.Please.QUESTION: Robert, Robert.QUESTION: On Bangladesh.QUESTION: India.MR PALLADINO: Lets go to Nike, please.QUESTION: Okay. Thank you very much. If I may, I would like to stay in Asia. On Tibet, yesterday, the State Department release its report to Congress on Section 4 of the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2018. Could you please elaborate some of the details? What is the U.S. asking from China? And you may speak Mandarin if you want.MR PALLADINO: (In Mandarin.) Okay?QUESTION: Fair enough.MR PALLADINO: (In Mandarin.)QUESTION: Very good. (Laughter.) Very good, very nice. (Applause.) How about in English?MR PALLADINO: All right, all right. Well do it in English, exactly. All right.QUESTION: Wonderful.MR PALLADINO: So pursuant to the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2018, as you allude, yesterday, the State Department submitted its first annual report to the Congress regarding United States access to Tibet. The report concludes that the Chinese Government, quote, systematically impedes travel to the Tibetan Autonomous Region and Tibetan areas outside of the Tibetan Autonomous Region for U.S. officials, journalists, and tourists.What we seek here is reciprocity reciprocity from China regarding open access that China enjoys in the United States. Were going to continue to work closely with the Congress in pursuit of that shared goal and make sure that Americans have access to the autonomous region and other areas as well.QUESTION: (Off-mike.)QUESTION: The Chinese Government has pushed back. How do you respond to the Chinese Governments assertion that this report is quote, disregards the facts, is full of prejudice, and the Chinese side will never accept it? How do you respond? Thank you.MR PALLADINO: We this is a well-documented report, statistics were kept, and we would note that when the Chinese Government did allow access, the access was infrequent and highly restricted and scripted. Were asking for reciprocity. Thats not something that the Chinese Government would be subjected to in the United States. Its not something that we think Americans ought to be subjected to in China. Well continue to advocate for shared reciprocity. And you know what? It reminds me of the recent decision by the European Union to decline a visit to Xinjiang Province (inaudible). We were their rationale was that they wanted to see they wanted more time to plan a trip and to ensure that in fact, that they were allowed to have access and they would be allowed to for unscripted view of what was taking place in Xinjiang Province, and we support their decision.QUESTION: A follow-up, China?QUESTION: Robert, on Asia, the Secretary will meet the Egyptian foreign minister this afternoon. Whats on the agenda?MR PALLADINO: Well be sure to put a readout out after that. I dont have anything to preview on the meeting of --QUESTION: And whats your view regarding the constitution amendments in Egypt? Do you have anything on this?MR PALLADINO: Nothing. Nothing today for you, Michel. Please?QUESTION: A follow-up, China?QUESTION: Robert?MR PALLADINO: More on China?QUESTION: Yes, sir.MR PALLADINO: Okay. Lets go lets try, please.QUESTION: Robert, thank you very much. Chinese president said that Dalai Lama is a terrorist and Masood Azhar is a spiritual leader. And where do we go after China voted against the UN resolution and supported this Masood Azhar, most wanted terrorist by the U.S., India and Israel and other countries? And hes the mastermind of or what you call Pakistan is supporting him and he was kept by the Pakistani military in a hospital. But after the Chinese vote in favor of him, he said why they kept me in hospital, Im fine, nothing is wrong with me.So where do we go after this most wanted terrorist was protected by China, and they continue to protect him?MR PALLADINO: Well, our policy on Tibet respects Chinas territorial integrity, and we consider Tibet to be a part of China, but at the same time, we have been clear were deeply concerned by the lack of meaningful autonomy for the Tibetan people, the deteriorating human rights situation in Tibetan areas, and severe restrictions on religious freedom and cultural rights there. So we will continue to urge China to cease restrictions on the human rights of Tibetans as well as their religious, cultural, and linguistic identity.QUESTION: Can we go to India?QUESTION: And as far as this --QUESTION: India?QUESTION: -- protecting the Masood Azhar and the UN vote by China?MR PALLADINO: I dont have anything further on that today.India? Sure, Tejinder. Go ahead, please.QUESTION: Is there a shift in U.S.-India defense relationship? There has been denial of visas to Indian defense officials and that also after extending an invite to them. I have two examples from last three weeks. One is the secretary DRDO, Dr. Satheesh, and he was here even in December with the Indian defense minister. And the second one is Dr. Guruprasad, DG production, and out of a team of five he was only one who was denied visa. So these both were not coming first time or any clearance issues. So is there a shift in the policy? Because I know that you dont talk about visas from the podium, but please, is there a policy why these people are getting denied the visas after then invite?MR PALLADINO: The United States no, okay. The United States-India defense and security cooperation is rapidly expanding as part of our deepening strategic partnership, and India is one of the premier security partners in the Indo-Pacific region. So as part of that effort, exchanges, reciprocal visits between American and Indian defense officials theyre increasing at an unprecedented pace. We the United States, we seek to expand our defense and security cooperation with India, and that includes defense and security officials. And Ill stop there.QUESTION: Pakistan. Can you take one question on Pakistan too, please?MR PALLADINO: A question on Pakistan. Sure.QUESTION: Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Sir, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said that there are five big issues that threaten the American security and one of them is Pakistans nuclear program. So can you a little bit elaborate that how Pakistans nuclear program is a threat to America?MR PALLADINO: Nuclear proliferation is a one of the very first national security concerns articulated in our National Security Strategy. Its at the very top of the list. So that absolutely remains something that this administration thinks about often, because the level of the level, the impact, of what could happen is simply so great. So that remains at the very top of our national security considerations.As far as Pakistan itself, the Secretary has also emphasized that the need to deliver outcomes and to build confidence and trust between our two nations, and we do want to see a prosperous Pakistan that contributes positively towards regional stability and security. And Ill stop there.QUESTION: Anything on Pakistans role during the on the peace process in Afghanistan?MR PALLADINO: Pakistan could play an important role in bringing about a negotiated settlement in Afghanistan, and something that were thankful for.QUESTION: Sir, I have a follow-up.MR PALLADINO: Lets go to Tejinder, sure.QUESTION: China?QUESTION: Sir, I have a follow-up.MR PALLADINO: I dont mean Tejinder. I did not mean to say Tejinder, all right? (Laughter.) Please, go ahead.QUESTION: Thank you very much.MR PALLADINO: Lets go ahead.QUESTION: Thank you very much, mister.MR PALLADINO: All right. Were going to stay in South Asia? Is that what were going to do?QUESTION: Yes, on Bangladesh. In two days, our national independence day.MR PALLADINO: Is it? Happy independence day.QUESTION: Thank you.MR PALLADINO: Very good.QUESTION: The recently released Human Rights Report stated that Bangladesh election was not considered free and fair. And obviously, the opposition party rejected this election result. So I am wondering what steps are is the U.S. going to take to restore democracy in Bangladesh and voting rights, as U.S. position is that election was not considered free and fair and credible?MR PALLADINO: Well, Mushfiqul, I would just point out that, as you correctly note, we recently released our Human Rights Report and we noted that the December 2018 election was not free and it was not fair given widespread reports of irregularities, including ballot box stuffing and intimidation of opposition polling agents and voters.That said, we have a the United States and Bangladesh have a long history of cooperation and a vision for a tolerant, democratic Bangladesh that strengthens its democratic institutions, respects human rights, and seeks to improve its governing structures and institutions. Bangladesh has an impressive economic development impressive record of economic development and respect for democracy, freedom of expression, human rights. These are not competing objectives and these would in fact reinforce economic growth. So United States looks forward to continuing to work with the ruling government as well as the opposition to continue to advance these interrelated goals. Ill leave it at that.QUESTION: Robert, can I ask you that trial in Turkey. One of the consulate employees --MR PALLADINO: This is the last one. Lets go to Turkey. Last one, sure.QUESTION: Do you have any concerns about this is one of your consular employees has been charged with terrorism-related I believe the trial opened today. Do you have any concerns about the process?MR PALLADINO: What I would say is we are following this very closely. Our the trial, as you point out, has opened. Itll go on this week, several days, and I can confirm that our charge, Hovenier, attended the hearing. Beyond that, at this point, nothing to add to that. But were watching this very closely.QUESTION: Okay, and presumably, a guilty verdict or something that you think is not fair would be met with a response, correct?MR PALLADINO: At this point were going to continue to watch this trial closely.QUESTION: And then just lastly, theres a story that just came out on Politico and about its a profile of the Secretary. Youre quoted as saying this is in response to criticism about the Secretarys trips, recent trips, domestic recent trips youre quoted as saying, Every recent secretary of state has taken trips inside the United States Secretary Pompeo simply visited Iowa, Kansas, and Texas, places often flown over by his predecessors, instead of Marthas Vineyard, Boston, and the Hamptons. Is that an accurate quote? Did you say that?MR PALLADINO: I said that.QUESTION: And youre a career Foreign Service officer. Secretary Pompeos immediate predecessor, Secretary Tillerson, actually lived in Texas, and spent probably every couple weeks spent a good deal of time there and in Colorado. So exactly which predecessors are you referring to in this statement?MR PALLADINO: I think this kind of information is publicly available. Youre able to put those to --QUESTION: So youre referring to James Baker and George Shultz and Condi Rice and Colin Powell.MR PALLADINO: Okay. So the point remains theres been an awful lot of questions that have come our way about this Secretary of States ability to communicate to the American people in his role as the nations top diplomat, to actually explain to American citizens what it what the State Department what State Department employees are doing and staff are doing to advance their interests.QUESTION: Right.MR PALLADINO: This is a challenge for the State Department. Everybody understands what the Department of Defense does.QUESTION: Yep.MR PALLADINO: Explaining to the American people how this building is advocating its interests this is something that needs to be done.QUESTION: Yeah.MR PALLADINO: This is something that we are proud that the Secretary is doing, and its about time.QUESTION: Its nice that youre youre absolutely right, 100 percent, but thats not really the point of my question. When these predecessors you refer to went to Marthas Vineyard, Boston, and the Hamptons, were they going there to talk about what the State Department does, or were they going there on private trips?MR PALLADINO: There has not been any scrutiny of those kinds of trips. And this is the point that were trying to make here. Would anybody be why is it that when the Secretary wants to speak to the people of Kansas --QUESTION: No one is --MR PALLADINO: -- that it becomes of such great interest? Thats the point were trying to make here.QUESTION: Have you gotten any questions about the Secretarys personal travel?MR PALLADINO: This is a secretary of state --QUESTION: Youre turning this into something thatMR PALLADINO: Okay.QUESTION: -- that I have never once asked you about these domestic trips, okay, and the suggestion that its improper for other reporters to ask about them is wrong. And yes, there is a role for the Secretary of State to try and get out, to create a base of support for the State Department, which is something that most Americans a large percentage of Americans dont have enough about. But I kind of wonder if youre how comfortable are you when youre talking about clearly Secretary Tillersons immediate predecessors in this, given the destinations that you list, which were all not for public diplomacy events or to educate, but private trips. Those secretaries under in the Obama administration also traveled domestically and did these kind of outreach things that the Secretary is doing now and should be doing now without criticism. Im just curious how comfortable you are saying I mean, is this intended to be humorous? Is it snark or are you going to claim that its just a statement of fact? Well, they went to the Hamptons or they went to Marthas Vineyard, and therefore its appropriate for me, a career Foreign Service officer who has worked under administrations of both parties, to say this.MR PALLADINO: Of course, and I will work under both administrations. The point remains this Secretary of State has made a concerted effort to reach a portion of the United States that --QUESTION: And no one is saying --MR PALLADINO: -- traditionally has been neglected.QUESTION: No one is saying he hasnt.MR PALLADINO: Something beyond the west coast and the east coast. We are trying to communicate to more Americans. This is a good thing. This is something --QUESTION: Im not saying its not a good --MR PALLADINO: -- that needs to be done.QUESTION: No one is saying its not a good thing.QUESTION: No ones saying that.QUESTION: Im just wondering why youre comparing his trips, which are business trips to the Midwest, which are good and fine and theres nothing wrong with them, to former secretaries of state who went on vacation over the summer. Look at officials in this administration, starting at the top, who spend time at golf courses and country clubs. I no ones begrudging that, right? He goes there for private visits, which is what these are. So I just think how is this not apples and oranges, you comparing Iowa, Texas, and Kansas to a vacation in Marthas Vineyard or Boston and the Hamptons?MR PALLADINO: The level --QUESTION: And I would also point out that one, Secretary Kerry, actually had meetings with Chinese officials and others in Boston, so how is it how is it not apples and oranges?MR PALLADINO: Certainly, certainly, certainly possible to have meetings in the good town of Boston. The point remains, this Secretary is making a concerted effort to expand what the State Department has traditionally done beyond the coasts and to reach out to the American people and explain what it is that this United this U.S. State Department is doing to advance their interest, to talk about how we are expanding economic opportunities; we are opening places to increasing trade for them, to advance American values. Its been neglected. Were glad that the Secretary is taking that to the people.QUESTION: I and I agree with you. It has been neglected, and Im glad that hes doing it. My question is not to question the motives of his travel. Its to question your quote in this and wonder and to question whether you think its actually appropriate to compare private trips to work trips. Thats my question. It doesnt have to do anything at all with this Secretary and his travel habits. It has to do with you as a Foreign --QUESTION: May I then may I --MR PALLADINO: Secretarys travel --QUESTION: Let me ask another question on that, because isnt it valid, dont you think, that to ask a question about the Secretary going to Kansas, when there is a lot of speculation out there that the Secretary could be campaigning to actually even though he denies it, although in some interviews that he did in Kansas, he didnt completely deny it. So isnt it valid that the press ask about that, that whether hes going back to Kansas, like some secretaries of state would go back to Boston, or whether to whether hes campaigning. I mean that is a very valid question, so I dont sort of see why you need to criticize the press for asking just that very valid question, given that the Senate seat is coming open.MR PALLADINO: Of course.QUESTION: So is he go did he go there to campaign as well?MR PALLADINO: No. He was there to explain to the American people what it is the United States Department of State is doing for the American people, and he did that in different ways. Texas, Kansas, Iowa. Frankly, its something that well be looking for more opportunities to do in the coming future. Its not something were going to shy away from. Its important that Americans understand what role the State Department is playing in national security and in the economic lives of average people. Its important for average citizens to understand what their government is doing to advance their interests.This is something that the Secretary feels strongly about. And if you talk to Foreign Service and Civil Service and the State Department, you go around the country, you meet your aunt in Iowa, and you say the State Department, quite frequently theres confusion. Is that the Forest Service in Iowa or its important for us to explain what we are doing globally on any given day to promote their interests, and thats something thats going to continue. Im going to stop there.Thank you very much, guys.QUESTION: Thank you.QUESTION: Sir, I sir, I have come all the way from Dallas. Can I get one question in?MR PALLADINO: Come back.QUESTION: All right.(The briefing was concluded at 3:41 p.m.)Load-Date: March 27, 2019End of Document

State Department Conducts Daily Press Briefing, March 26Targeted News ServiceMarch 26, 2019 Tuesday 8:34 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 7285 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Department of State issued the following transcript of the daily press briefing by deputy spokesperson Robert Palladino:MR PALLADINO: A couple things from the top. Next week, we welcome the Democratic Republic of Congo's president, Felix Tshisekedi, on his first official visit to the United States. That'll be April 3rd through 5th. We share President Tshisekedi's interest in developing a strong partnership between the United States and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and we're committed to working with him to advance his agenda to combat corruption, strengthen the rule of law, enhance security, protect human rights, and promote economic growth through increased foreign investment and trade, particularly with the United States.During his visit, President Tshisekedi will meet with Secretary Pompeo as well as other United States Cabinet-level and high-level officials to discuss United States-Democratic Republic of the Congo cooperation on a range of issues, including efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak in Eastern Congo. We support President Tshisekedi's commitment to delivering change that the Congolese people desire and deserve, and we share a common interest in realizing Congo's potential and in creating a better and more prosperous future.Secondly, while staying on Africa, yesterday the United States announced nearly 3.4 million in emergency humanitarian food assistance in response to Cyclone Idai and related flooding in Mozambique. This is the worst natural disaster in Southern Africa in nearly two decades.QUESTION: I'm sorry, you said 3.4 million what? Dollars, pounds, tons?MR PALLADINO: 3.4 million dollars --QUESTION: Okay.MR PALLADINO: -- in emergency humanitarian food assistance. This is the worst natural disaster in Southern Africa in nearly two decades. The United States Agency for International Development is already on the ground. They have a 13-person Disaster Assistance Response Team that is delivering relief supplies to inaccessible areas. The Department of Defense is also supporting the response by providing airlift and logistics support.The United States Government continues to assess humanitarian needs and coordinate response efforts with the Government of Mozambique and humanitarian organizations. More than 440 people have died as a result of the storm, and more than 600,000 people are in need of assistance. Our thoughts are with the people of Mozambique.And finally, team on the field: Today Secretary Pompeo sent a note to all staff announcing that Stuart McGuigan has joined us yesterday as both our new chief information officer and head of the Bureau of Information Resource Management. The Secretary said that, quote, "Every aspect of the department's information technology capabilities and operations now falls under Stuart's oversight, including architecture, infrastructure, cyber security, data management, software, and application development and acquisition," end quote. Mr. McGuigan joins us after nearly seven years as CIO of Johnson &#38; Johnson, where he was responsible for information technology strategy there and operations for the company's 130,000 employees around the world.At the same time, the Secretary - we also want to express our thanks to Karen Mummaw for her service these past 15 months as the department's acting CIO. Karen is a career senior Foreign Service officer with a distinguished record of service both at home and abroad. And after 31 years of public service, Karen has elected to move forward on retirement plans that were put on hold, actually, when she assumed the acting role of CIO back in December 2017. So her service exemplifies what our team is all about, and we thank her for her service.And finally, I would just note that our back row is filled with interns from our Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Welcome. You're not allowed to ask questions, but you're - (laughter.) Okay.QUESTION: I'm sure they'd have some good ones.MR PALLADINO: They might have some good ones, though.QUESTION: Can I ask you a logistical question on the Congolese president? Since the White - unless I missed it while we've been here, I haven't seen any kind of an announcement from the White House, which usually announces heads of state visits. Since you're doing it, does that mean that he won't have any meetings at the White House or --MR PALLADINO: Nothing to announce at this time. The Secretary of State looks forward to hosting him, and he will have a series of high-level agencies throughout the interagency.QUESTION: Right. But I mean, he is the president of the country that is in --MR PALLADINO: Nothing to announce at this time, Matt, no.QUESTION: Yeah, okay. I wonder. Now, kind of a bizarre question. You're familiar with this incident that happened at the North Korean embassy in Madrid not so long ago?MR PALLADINO: I've seen press reports.QUESTION: Okay. First of all, do you know anything about what happened there? You've presumably then seen the Spanish judge's report or - on it. So anything you have on that I'd be interested in. And secondly, this was an attack or an invasion of a diplomatic compound. Do you have anything to say about that, considering that you have come out strongly against such incidents in the past, no matter what country the compound has belonged to?MR PALLADINO: Of course. We - the United States would always call for the protection of embassies belonging to any diplomatic mission throughout the world. That's something that we are obligated by, both by international treaty and by standard practice throughout the world. So that goes without saying.Regarding the specifics of what's going on, Spanish authorities are investigating. The investigation is still underway. For any details on their investigation, I would have to refer you to Spanish authorities.QUESTION: Can you say that the United States Government at least had nothing to do with this?MR PALLADINO: The United States Government had nothing to do with this.QUESTION: Thank you.MR PALLADINO: All right. Sure.QUESTION: North Korea?MR PALLADINO: Go ahead, Lesley.QUESTION: I - do you want to go to North Korea?QUESTION: Is that okay?QUESTION: That's - if you want to continue the conversation.QUESTION: Okay. What was President Trump talking about when he tweeted about revoking sanctions that have been imposed? There seems to be much lingering confusion about that.MR PALLADINO: This is the United States State Department, and for secretaries - we speak on behalf of the State Department from this building, of course.QUESTION: Well I thought you might know something about this.MR PALLADINO: Of course we do.QUESTION: Well, you also speak on behalf of the administration, the entire administration.MR PALLADINO: Of course. And the point here is that our position hasn't changed in the least, and that the international community will continue to implement United Nations Security Council resolutions to underscore to North Korea that the only way to achieve the security and development that it seeks is to forsake its weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. That remains our policy and that remains what we're pursuing.QUESTION: Well are there sanctions that are being withdrawn or not?MR PALLADINO: For sanctions I would refer you to the Department of Treasury. That's not something that we address from the State Department.Please.QUESTION: Just thought I'd ask.QUESTION: Wait a second.QUESTION: Yeah.QUESTION: That's not true. You guys address sanctions all the time.MR PALLADINO: Well, the status - I would refer you for details on --QUESTION: You can't - you know what, look, you got to be consistent.MR PALLADINO: -- department of - sanctions - I would refer you to the Department of Treasury.QUESTION: You can't pick and choose when the President lets loose with a tweet about sanctions, which you talk about all the time, on Venezuela, on Iran, on North Korea, in fact. So what's going on here? Are they --MR PALLADINO: For the details of the Department of Treasury sanctions that were announced last week, I would refer you to the Department of Treasury. But --QUESTION: As far as you understand, as far as this building understands, those sanctions are still in place?MR PALLADINO: Absolutely.QUESTION: Thank you.MR PALLADINO: Please.QUESTION: One more (inaudible) Steve Biegun.MR PALLADINO: Please, go ahead.QUESTION: Yes. Special Representative Biegun said that he ask the China to cooperate with sanctions against North Korea, but why President - there has been lift new sanctions - I mean additional sanctions? It's kind of a little confused, one or the other is - they say we going to cooperate with the UN sanctions, but he say (inaudible) sanctions no longer - no.MR PALLADINO: We consult regularly with China and other partners on these matters, and our goal remains the same. That's the final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea. That hasn't changed, and that's something that we are - continue to pursue with China and other partners as well as our allies.Please.QUESTION: (Off-mike.)MR PALLADINO: Is there more North Korea?QUESTION: Yes, sir.MR PALLADINO: All right. Let's go one more North Korea.QUESTION: So President Trump tweeted that he said he ordered withdrawals new, large-scale sanctions. And you just mentioned that all sanctions are still in place.MR PALLADINO: Our policy, yeah, has not changed, and that is, the international community is going to continue to implement the United Nations Security Council resolutions to underscore to North Korea that that's the only way to achieve the security that they seek. The pressure campaign is what has been instrumental in creating a diplomatic opening, and the President has made clear throughout the process that that will continue until denuclearization is complete.Let's move on, moving on.QUESTION: (Off-mike.)QUESTION: North Korea?MR PALLADINO: Go ahead. Laurie, go ahead.QUESTION: Yeah. Could you clarify a point from yesterday's briefing about the forces that are to maintain the safe zone in Syria? I've got three questions. That - will the forces in the safe zone in Syria include U.S. and other coalition forces like Britain and France, even if their main mission, as Ambassador Jeffrey said, is to defeat ISIS? They're going to be in the safe zone? Will the Syrian Democratic Forces be involved in protecting the safe zone? Will Turkish or Turkish allied forces be involved?MR PALLADINO: Okay, thanks. Yeah, Ambassador Jeffrey spoke about this yesterday at length. What I would say is that the - ISIS, while the territory's - been defeated - we said this often now - it remains - and that is a big accomplishment. It's a big deal, to use Ambassador Jeffrey's words. They remain a threat throughout northeast Syria, and as long as they're a threat, this is what we're focused on. We are going to - as Ambassador Jeffrey said, we're going to have a small residual force of the United States military. They're going to remain in northeast Syria, and that will be as part of a multinational force. And they will be there to prevent an ISIS resurgence, and, related to that, to provide support, to provide stability in northeast Syria so that our partners can do everything to maintain pressure on ISIS and those networks that exist.Now, regarding composition and the more detailed things, we - we're consulting. We are planning proactively with other members of the global coalition who have identified their intent to support this transition phase of operations in Syria. That continues. As far as - we're going to continue to work, as Ambassador Jeffrey said, on the details of this matter, and we're optimistic. We're confident that we can achieve a good outcome on that front.QUESTION: Would that include forces from the Syrian Democratic Forces?MR PALLADINO: I don't have anything further to provide beyond that with - to what Ambassador Jeffrey alluded to yesterday at this point. We're talking about it. We're looking at it, and I don't have anything further beyond that at this point.QUESTION: Robert?QUESTION: On Syria still?MR PALLADINO: Yes. I'll take the water, thank you very much. All right.QUESTION: On Syria still, Robert? On Syria?MR PALLADINO: Syria.QUESTION: Very quick.MR PALLADINO: Okay. Go ahead.QUESTION: Today the Secretary of State issued a statement on the 40th anniversary of the Egypt-Israel Camp David Accord, the peace treaty, which was premised on Resolution 242 and the principle of land for peace. So I guess now there is no land to sort of trade between Syria and Israel. Is that the case? Do you consider 242 to have been fulfilled, null and void? What is your take on that?MR PALLADINO: Yeah. Well, the decision that the President announced was a critical strategic and of security importance to the state of Israel and to stability of the Middle East. So to allow the Golan Heights to be controlled by the likes of Syrian and Iranian regimes would be to turn a blind eye to threats emanating from a Syrian regime that engages in atrocities, and from Iran and terrorist actors, including Hizballah, that would seek to use the Golan Heights as a launching ground for attacks against Israel.QUESTION: I understand all that, but the principle of land for peace --QUESTION: Well, hold on just - sorry, Said. You might understand it. I don't understand it at all. Was there some threat that Iran and Syria were actually going to control the Golan Heights?MR PALLADINO: Without --QUESTION: If there was, I missed it.MR PALLADINO: There have been --QUESTION: Maybe I'm --MR PALLADINO: There have been many efforts threatening --QUESTION: Yeah, not to control it, though.MR PALLADINO: But a lack of Israel's ability to defend that area would be to undermine Israeli security, and enhancing the Golan Heights is to enhance Israel's security and which strengthens, frankly, our ability to partner with Israel to fight the common threats that we face.QUESTION: I don't understand what is different three days ago about Israel's ability to defend the Golan that - what is different today than it was three days ago? And you talk about the regional stability, but every single country in the region except for Israel, every single one of them, all of Syria and Israel's neighbors, have come out against this and say it's bad for stability. So this is a case where you and Israel are right and everyone else, including the neighbors, are wrong?MR PALLADINO: Not a popularity contest.QUESTION: Well, that's good because if it was --MR PALLADINO: Standing up for what is right oftentimes is not. This is something that the President has been considering for some time. As he made clear, the statement on the Golan Heights fully reflects our understanding of the unique circumstances that makes it appropriate to recognize Israeli sovereignty at this time.QUESTION: I get that. But is it your position that Israel's control of the Golan without this announcement by the President would have been somehow threatened or that it was in jeopardy that --MR PALLADINO: It was a recognition of reality that the President moved forward on this position.QUESTION: And do you think that it will change Iran's efforts or Syria's efforts to infiltrate terrorists or fighters into the Golan simply because there's a U.S. - the U.S. President has signed a proclamation saying that it's - that it - recognizing Israel's sovereignty over it?MR PALLADINO: It certainly makes things clearer, and Israel's security is something that, of course, they're going to continue to defend --QUESTION: Oh, I know.MR PALLADINO: -- and something that we're going to continue to support.QUESTION: And this administration has made it clear, as have previous administrations, but this one has made it clear - say, with Gaza, with the border with Lebanon, and that the land that Israel has there is Israeli sovereign territory, and that hasn't stopped Hamas or Hizballah from trying to - from either launching attacks or - so I'm just curious as to why you think that the proclamation actually changes conditions on the ground to the point where - that some kind of threat to Israel's control over it is now done.MR PALLADINO: We're not saying the threat is over in any way. The threat, of course, continues, and Israel's need and our need to help support continues, of course. That affects all the stabilization.Yeah.QUESTION: Yeah, I just want to finish my question, if I may. So to be clear, so do you consider 242 to be null and void, completely fulfilled? There is no land to trade since the whole premise of that is land for peace. So that land is no longer, as far as you're concerned, is no longer Syrian, correct? So 242, is it null and void? Is it - and 338 as a matter of fact, the other UN resolution, is it considered fulfilled, null and void? What is your designation to the resolutions 242 and 338?MR PALLADINO: The administration has made clear that it supports negotiation towards a comprehensive peace between Israel and its neighbors.QUESTION: Including Syria?MR PALLADINO: This administration, unlike previous administrations, is willing to acknowledge the reality that there can be no comprehensive peace agreement that does not satisfactorily address Israel's security needs in the Golan Heights. This is an area that is vital to Israel's national security.QUESTION: Gaza. Real quick on Gaza. I just want - things are heating up again, and the Israelis now are saying that a ceasefire can only be implemented if it's somehow conditioned on ending the demonstrations, the demonstrations that take place every Friday in Gaza. Do you agree with that premise or agree with that principle that they ought to be tied - the ceasefire and ending the demonstrations?MR PALLADINO: We condemn the rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel.QUESTION: I'm not talking about the rockets. I'm talking about --MR PALLADINO: It's important to say this. We condemn the rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel, and we strongly support Israel's right to defend itself. The attacks are outrageous and unacceptable.QUESTION: So you --MR PALLADINO: Our position is there must be a complete and permanent halt. We welcome efforts by regional allies that are seeking to restore calm and prevent further attacks. And I have nothing further on that.QUESTION: That's all excellent, but is it - should it be tied to the demonstrations and ending the demonstrations?MR PALLADINO: We welcome efforts by regional allies that are seeking to restore calm and prevent attacks.Go, please. Rich, Fox.QUESTION: Robert, very briefly on Mexico City, the Secretary mentioned this morning that perhaps you would have some more specifics, maybe even a ballpark, on how much the U.S. is withholding from the OAS. And this is the second expansion of the policy that the administration has announced while it's in office. Do you see that perhaps there is more room to tighten this policy going forward?MR PALLADINO: Give me a second here. Right. So regarding your first question on the specific numbers, this has to do with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which is part of the Organization of American States, and in light of concerns regarding certain of their activities related to abortion. The Secretary of State directed the withholding of part of the Fiscal Year 2019 U.S.-assessed contribution to the Organization of American States. Specifically to your question, that withholding is $210,000 and that is the equivalent to the United States proportional share of possible OAS costs in question.QUESTION: Robert, India?QUESTION: Is that money directly supposed to go to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, or was it just to the OAS more broadly? In other words, is the entire OAS being hit with this because of something that the Inter - the Commission did?MR PALLADINO: My understanding is it's specific to the - let me get the acronym right - IACHR. Correct.QUESTION: Perhaps you're familiar with what country actually led the charge to create this commission. In fact, former Secretary Powell was in South America on 9/11 pushing for the charter to be adopted that that charter created this. So are you saying now that because this commission that you, in fact, created - you meaning the United States - has taken a position against the criminalization of abortion, which is what I understand they did, that you're now going to withhold money from it? Is that right? You don't see any kind of irony there?MR PALLADINO: We work tirelessly to ensure --QUESTION: You created this thing.MR PALLADINO: -- United States support for the Organization of American States to make sure that it's used for purposes that align with United States foreign policy objectives and national interests. We continue to support --QUESTION: So it's gone rogue? Is that right?MR PALLADINO: We continue to support the Organization of American States as well as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. That supports a number of important United States and shared regional foreign policy objectives in the hemisphere, including those in Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua. We also take our obligation very seriously to ensure that activities implemented with U.S. funds are consistent with what the Secretary discussed this morning, this Siljander Amendment. And so we see no inconsistencies.QUESTION: What was the total - 210,000 of how much?MR PALLADINO: Two hundred and ten thousand, correct.QUESTION: Of how much?MR PALLADINO: I don't have the full budget, but this is the proportional part directly related to those activities in question.QUESTION: And then on just room going forward to tighten, is the administration looking at other ways?MR PALLADINO: Don't have any information in that regard. Nothing to announce at this time.QUESTION: I have a follow-up on that.MR PALLADINO: Go ahead, Shaun. Go ahead.QUESTION: Different part of the world, on Thailand. If you have a follow-up, then --QUESTION: I have a follow-up on Mexico City. Is that okay?MR PALLADINO: All right, let's - okay, one more, sure.QUESTION: Great. So speaking to what Rich was asking, are there other multilateral institutions that you believe the U.S. would be in violation of the Siljander Amendment if they continued giving them funds? Are there other multilateral institutions that you think are lobbying for or against abortion?And also, do you have any estimate of the amount of programs that you think will be affected by the expansion announced today of the Mexico City Policy, and are there specific groups that the U.S. is looking at who they believe are funding or financially supporting other groups who are promoting abortion?MR PALLADINO: Yeah. I don't have anything on specific groups that - to announce at the podium, and as far as future actions that we may be considering or take, nothing to preview at this time.QUESTION: Should other multilateral institutions be on the lookout, be warned? Are you issuing --MR PALLADINO: I think the United States - I think Secretary Pompeo made pretty clear this morning that this administration is a pro-life administration and that we're going to continue to seek to advocate our values strongly and globally.Now, Shaun, I'm going to go back to you, because you --QUESTION: Thailand. Thailand had elections over the weekend, first since the military coup. Do you believe that these were free and fair elections? Do you believe that this represents a restoration of democracy? There's been concern, notably from former Prime Minister Thaksin, who alleges widespread irregularities.MR PALLADINO: Right. We congratulate the tens of millions of Thai citizens who participated in the long-awaited March 24th election for demonstrating their strong support for return to elected government. The voting, along with, we note, robust media coverage of the process and open debate of its merits - those are positive signs for a return to a democratic government that reflects the will of the people. We stand with the Thai people in calling for the expeditious announcement of voting results and a fair and transparent investigation of any reported irregularities. The United States looks forward to working with Thailand's newly elected government to advance values that bring our countries closer together, including democracy, security, and prosperity for all citizens.QUESTION: Just following up briefly on that, the - are you - are there any concerns about representation of parties? One of the major parties was disbanded legally ahead of the election. Do you think that there is a broad enough spectrum represented in the political process?MR PALLADINO: We are interested in a result that reflects the will of the Thai people. The United States does not support any candidate or political party. We support the democratic process.QUESTION: What about Algeria? Do you have any comment on the military calling for the presidency to be vacated now?MR PALLADINO: I don't have - I haven't seen that and I don't have anything for you on that.Please.QUESTION: Robert, Robert.QUESTION: On Bangladesh.QUESTION: India.MR PALLADINO: Let's go to Nike, please.QUESTION: Okay. Thank you very much. If I may, I would like to stay in Asia. On Tibet, yesterday, the State Department release its report to Congress on Section 4 of the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2018. Could you please elaborate some of the details? What is the U.S. asking from China? And you may speak Mandarin if you want.MR PALLADINO: (In Mandarin.) Okay?QUESTION: Fair enough.MR PALLADINO: (In Mandarin.)QUESTION: Very good. (Laughter.) Very good, very nice. (Applause.) How about in English?MR PALLADINO: All right, all right. We'll do it in English, exactly. All right.QUESTION: Wonderful.MR PALLADINO: So pursuant to the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2018, as you allude, yesterday, the State Department submitted its first annual report to the Congress regarding United States access to Tibet. The report concludes that the Chinese Government, quote, "systematically impedes travel to the Tibetan Autonomous Region and Tibetan areas outside of the Tibetan Autonomous Region for U.S. officials, journalists, and tourists."What we seek here is reciprocity - reciprocity from China regarding open access that China enjoys in the United States. We're going to continue to work closely with the Congress in pursuit of that shared goal and make sure that Americans have access to the autonomous region and other areas as well.QUESTION: (Off-mike.)QUESTION: The Chinese Government has pushed back. How do you respond to the Chinese Government's assertion that this report is - quote, "disregards the facts, is full of prejudice, and the Chinese side will never accept it"? How do you respond? Thank you.MR PALLADINO: We - this is a well-documented report, statistics were kept, and we would note that when the Chinese Government did allow access, the access was infrequent and highly restricted and scripted. We're asking for reciprocity. That's not something that the Chinese Government would be subjected to in the United States. It's not something that we think Americans ought to be subjected to in China. We'll continue to advocate for shared reciprocity. And you know what? It reminds me of the recent decision by the European Union to decline a visit to Xinjiang Province (inaudible). We were - their rationale was that they wanted to see - they wanted more time to plan a trip and to ensure that - in fact, that they were allowed to have access and they would be allowed to - for unscripted view of what was taking place in Xinjiang Province, and we support their decision.QUESTION: A follow-up, China?QUESTION: Robert, on Asia, the Secretary will meet the Egyptian foreign minister this afternoon. What's on the agenda?MR PALLADINO: We'll be sure to put a readout out after that. I don't have anything to preview on the meeting of --QUESTION: And what's your view regarding the constitution amendments in Egypt? Do you have anything on this?MR PALLADINO: Nothing. Nothing today for you, Michel. Please?QUESTION: A follow-up, China?QUESTION: Robert?MR PALLADINO: More on China?QUESTION: Yes, sir.MR PALLADINO: Okay. Let's go - let's try, please.QUESTION: Robert, thank you very much. Chinese president said that Dalai Lama is a terrorist and Masood Azhar is a spiritual leader. And where do we go after China voted against the UN resolution and supported this Masood Azhar, most wanted terrorist by the U.S., India and Israel and other countries? And he's the mastermind of - or what you call - Pakistan is supporting him and he was kept by the Pakistani military in a hospital. But after the Chinese vote in favor of him, he said why they kept me in hospital, I'm fine, nothing is wrong with me.So where do we go after this most wanted terrorist was protected by China, and they continue to protect him?MR PALLADINO: Well, our policy on Tibet respects China's territorial integrity, and we consider Tibet to be a part of China, but at the same time, we have been clear we're deeply concerned by the lack of meaningful autonomy for the Tibetan people, the deteriorating human rights situation in Tibetan areas, and severe restrictions on religious freedom and cultural rights there. So we will continue to urge China to cease restrictions on the human rights of Tibetans as well as their religious, cultural, and linguistic identity.QUESTION: Can we go to India?QUESTION: And as far as this --QUESTION: India?QUESTION: -- protecting the Masood Azhar and the UN vote by China?MR PALLADINO: I don't have anything further on that today.India? Sure, Tejinder. Go ahead, please.QUESTION: Is there a shift in U.S.-India defense relationship? There has been denial of visas to Indian defense officials and that also after extending an invite to them. I have two examples from last three weeks. One is the secretary DRDO, Dr. Satheesh, and he was here even in December with the Indian defense minister. And the second one is Dr. Guruprasad, DG production, and out of a team of five he was only one who was denied visa. So these both were not coming first time or any clearance issues. So is there a shift in the policy? Because I know that you don't talk about visas from the podium, but please, is there a policy why these people are getting denied the visas after then invite?MR PALLADINO: The United States - no, okay. The United States-India defense and security cooperation is rapidly expanding as part of our deepening strategic partnership, and India is one of the premier security partners in the Indo-Pacific region. So as part of that effort, exchanges, reciprocal visits between American and Indian defense officials - they're increasing at an unprecedented pace. We - the United States, we seek to expand our defense and security cooperation with India, and that includes defense and security officials. And I'll stop there.QUESTION: Pakistan. Can you take one question on Pakistan too, please?MR PALLADINO: A question on Pakistan. Sure.QUESTION: Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Sir, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said that there are five big issues that threaten the American security and one of them is Pakistan's nuclear program. So can you a little bit elaborate that how Pakistan's nuclear program is a threat to America?MR PALLADINO: Nuclear proliferation is a - one of the very first national security concerns articulated in our National Security Strategy. It's at the very top of the list. So that absolutely remains something that this administration thinks about often, because the level of - the level, the impact, of what could happen is simply so great. So that remains at the very top of our national security considerations.As far as Pakistan itself, the Secretary has also emphasized that - the need to deliver outcomes and to build confidence and trust between our two nations, and we do want to see a prosperous Pakistan that contributes positively towards regional stability and security. And I'll stop there.QUESTION: Anything on Pakistan's role during the - on the peace process in Afghanistan?MR PALLADINO: Pakistan could play an important role in bringing about a negotiated settlement in Afghanistan, and something that we're thankful for.QUESTION: Sir, I have a follow-up.MR PALLADINO: Let's go to Tejinder, sure.QUESTION: China?QUESTION: Sir, I have a follow-up.MR PALLADINO: I don't mean Tejinder. I did not mean to say Tejinder, all right? (Laughter.) Please, go ahead.QUESTION: Thank you very much.MR PALLADINO: Let's go ahead.QUESTION: Thank you very much, mister.MR PALLADINO: All right. We're going to stay in South Asia? Is that what we're going to do?QUESTION: Yes, on Bangladesh. In two days, our national independence day.MR PALLADINO: Is it? Happy independence day.QUESTION: Thank you.MR PALLADINO: Very good.QUESTION: The recently released Human Rights Report stated that Bangladesh election was not considered free and fair. And obviously, the opposition party rejected this election result. So I am wondering what steps are - is the U.S. going to take to restore democracy in Bangladesh and voting rights, as U.S. position is that election was not considered free and fair and credible?MR PALLADINO: Well, Mushfiqul, I would just point out that, as you correctly note, we recently released our Human Rights Report and we noted that the December 2018 election was not free and it was not fair given widespread reports of irregularities, including ballot box stuffing and intimidation of opposition polling agents and voters.That said, we have a - the United States and Bangladesh have a long history of cooperation and a vision for a tolerant, democratic Bangladesh that strengthens its democratic institutions, respects human rights, and seeks to improve its governing structures and institutions. Bangladesh has an impressive economic development - impressive record of economic development - and respect for democracy, freedom of expression, human rights. These are not competing objectives and these would in fact reinforce economic growth. So United States looks forward to continuing to work with the ruling government as well as the opposition to continue to advance these interrelated goals. I'll leave it at that.QUESTION: Robert, can I ask you - that trial in Turkey. One of the consulate employees --MR PALLADINO: This is the last one. Let's go to Turkey. Last one, sure.QUESTION: Do you have any concerns about - this is one of your consular employees has been charged with terrorism-related - I believe the trial opened today. Do you have any concerns about the process?MR PALLADINO: What I would say is we are following this very closely. Our - the trial, as you point out, has opened. It'll go on this week, several days, and I can confirm that our charge, Hovenier, attended the hearing. Beyond that, at this point, nothing to add to that. But we're watching this very closely.QUESTION: Okay, and presumably, a guilty verdict or something that you think is not fair would be met with a response, correct?MR PALLADINO: At this point we're going to continue to watch this trial closely.QUESTION: And then just lastly, there's a story that just came out on Politico and - about - it's a profile of the Secretary. You're quoted as saying - this is in response to criticism about the Secretary's trips, recent trips, domestic recent trips - you're quoted as saying, "Every recent secretary of state has taken trips inside the United States - Secretary Pompeo simply visited Iowa, Kansas, and Texas, places often flown over by his predecessors, instead of Martha's Vineyard, Boston, and the Hamptons." Is that an accurate quote? Did you say that?MR PALLADINO: I said that.QUESTION: And you're a career Foreign Service officer. Secretary Pompeo's immediate predecessor, Secretary Tillerson, actually lived in Texas, and spent probably - every couple weeks spent a good deal of time there and in Colorado. So exactly which predecessors are you referring to in this statement?MR PALLADINO: I think - this kind of information is publicly available. You're able to put those to --QUESTION: So you're referring to James Baker and George Shultz and Condi Rice and Colin Powell.MR PALLADINO: Okay. So the point remains there's been an awful lot of questions that have come our way about this Secretary of State's ability to communicate to the American people in his role as the nation's top diplomat, to actually explain to American citizens what it - what the State Department - what State Department employees are doing and staff are doing to advance their interests.QUESTION: Right.MR PALLADINO: This is a challenge for the State Department. Everybody understands what the Department of Defense does.QUESTION: Yep.MR PALLADINO: Explaining to the American people how this building is advocating its interests - this is something that needs to be done.QUESTION: Yeah.MR PALLADINO: This is something that we are proud that the Secretary is doing, and it's about time.QUESTION: It's nice that you're - you're absolutely right, 100 percent, but that's not really the point of my question. When these predecessors you refer to went to Martha's Vineyard, Boston, and the Hamptons, were they going there to talk about what the State Department does, or were they going there on private trips?MR PALLADINO: There has not been any scrutiny of those kinds of trips. And this is the point that we're trying to make here. Would anybody be - why is it that when the Secretary wants to speak to the people of Kansas --QUESTION: No one is --MR PALLADINO: -- that it becomes of such great interest? That's the point we're trying to make here.QUESTION: Have you gotten any questions about the Secretary's personal travel?MR PALLADINO: This is a secretary of state --QUESTION: You're turning this into something that -MR PALLADINO: Okay.QUESTION: -- that I have never once asked you about these domestic trips, okay, and the suggestion that it's improper for other reporters to ask about them is wrong. And yes, there is a role for the Secretary of State to try and get out, to create a base of support for the State Department, which is something that most Americans - a large percentage of Americans - don't have enough about. But I kind of wonder if you're - how comfortable are you when you're talking about clearly Secretary Tillerson's immediate predecessors in this, given the destinations that you list, which were all not for public diplomacy events or to educate, but private trips. Those secretaries under - in the Obama administration also traveled domestically and did these kind of outreach things that the Secretary is doing now and should be doing now without criticism. I'm just curious how comfortable you are saying - I mean, is this intended to be humorous? Is it snark or are you going to claim that it's just a statement of fact? Well, they went to the Hamptons or they went to Martha's Vineyard, and therefore it's appropriate for me, a career Foreign Service officer who has worked under administrations of both parties, to say this.MR PALLADINO: Of course, and I will work under both administrations. The point remains this Secretary of State has made a concerted effort to reach a portion of the United States that --QUESTION: And no one is saying --MR PALLADINO: -- traditionally has been neglected.QUESTION: No one is saying he hasn't.MR PALLADINO: Something beyond the west coast and the east coast. We are trying to communicate to more Americans. This is a good thing. This is something --QUESTION: I'm not saying it's not a good --MR PALLADINO: -- that needs to be done.QUESTION: No one is saying it's not a good thing.QUESTION: No one's saying that.QUESTION: I'm just wondering why you're comparing his trips, which are business trips to the Midwest, which are good and fine and there's nothing wrong with them, to former secretaries of state who went on vacation over the summer. Look at officials in this administration, starting at the top, who spend time at golf courses and country clubs. I - no one's begrudging that, right? He goes there for private visits, which is what these are. So I just think - how is this not apples and oranges, you comparing Iowa, Texas, and Kansas to a vacation in Martha's Vineyard or Boston and the Hamptons?MR PALLADINO: The level --QUESTION: And I would also point out that one, Secretary Kerry, actually had meetings with Chinese officials and others in Boston, so how is it - how is it not apples and oranges?MR PALLADINO: Certainly, certainly, certainly possible to have meetings in the good town of Boston. The point remains, this Secretary is making a concerted effort to expand what the State Department has traditionally done beyond the coasts and to reach out to the American people and explain what it is that this United - this U.S. State Department is doing to advance their interest, to talk about how we are expanding economic opportunities; we are opening places to increasing trade for them, to advance American values. It's been neglected. We're glad that the Secretary is taking that to the people.QUESTION: I - and I agree with you. It has been neglected, and I'm glad that he's doing it. My question is not to question the motives of his travel. It's to question your quote in this and wonder - and to question whether you think it's actually appropriate to compare private trips to work trips. That's my question. It doesn't have to do anything at all with this Secretary and his travel habits. It has to do with you as a Foreign --QUESTION: May I - then may I --MR PALLADINO: Secretary's travel --QUESTION: Let me ask another question on that, because isn't it valid, don't you think, that to ask a question about the Secretary going to Kansas, when there is a lot of speculation out there that the Secretary could be campaigning to actually - even though he denies it, although in some interviews that he did in Kansas, he didn't completely deny it. So isn't it valid that the press ask about that, that whether he's going back to Kansas, like some secretaries of state would go back to Boston, or whether to - whether he's campaigning. I mean that is a very valid question, so I don't sort of see why you need to criticize the press for asking just that very valid question, given that the Senate seat is coming open.MR PALLADINO: Of course.QUESTION: So is he go - did he go there to campaign as well?MR PALLADINO: No. He was there to explain to the American people what it is the United States Department of State is doing for the American people, and he did that in different ways. Texas, Kansas, Iowa. Frankly, it's something that we'll be looking for more opportunities to do in the coming future. It's not something we're going to shy away from. It's important that Americans understand what role the State Department is playing in national security and in the economic lives of average people. It's important for average citizens to understand what their government is doing to advance their interests.This is something that the Secretary feels strongly about. And if you talk to Foreign Service and Civil Service and the State Department, you go around the country, you meet your aunt in Iowa, and you say the State Department, quite frequently there's confusion. Is that the Forest Service in Iowa or - it's important for us to explain what we are doing globally on any given day to promote their interests, and that's something that's going to continue. I'm going to stop there.Thank you very much, guys.QUESTION: Thank you.QUESTION: Sir, I - sir, I have come all the way from Dallas. Can I get one question in?MR PALLADINO: Come back.QUESTION: All right.(The briefing was concluded at 3:41 p.m.).Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6674186 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 30, 2019End of Document

China upbeat ahead of US trade talks, but differences largeAssociated Press InternationalJanuary 7, 2019 Monday 3:52 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 855 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - China sounded a positive note ahead of talks with Washington this week on a sprawling trade dispute that threatens to chill global economic growth, but the two sides face lengthy wrangling over technology and their future relationship.Talks were due to start Monday but there was no word from the American Embassy or China's Ministry of Commerce on whether they were under way or details of their agenda.Both sides have expressed an interest in settling their tariff fight over Beijing's technology ambitions. Yet neither has indicated its stance has changed since a Dec. 1 agreement by Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping to postpone further increases.Envoys will have "positive and constructive discussions," a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang, said on Friday.The American side is led by a deputy U.S. trade representative, Jeffrey D. Gerrish, according to the U.S. government. The delegation includes agriculture, energy, commerce, treasury and State Department officials.The Chinese government gave no details of who would represent Beijing.The talks are going ahead despite tensions over the arrest of a Chinese tech executive in Canada on U.S. charges related to possible violations of trade sanctions against Iran.Trump imposed tariff increases of up to 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese imports over complaints Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology. Beijing responded by imposing penalties on $110 billion of American goods, slowing customs clearance for U.S. companies and suspending issuing licenses in finance and other businesses.Washington, Europe and other trading partners complain Beijing's tactics violate its market-opening obligations.The clash reflects American anxiety about China's rise as a potential competitor in telecommunications and other technology. Trump wants Beijing to roll back initiatives like "Made in China 2025," which calls for the state-led creation of global competitors in such fields as robotics and artificial intelligence. American officials worry those might erode U.S. industrial leadership.The ruling Communist Party is reluctant to give up initiatives it sees as a path to prosperity and global influence.China's leaders have tried to defuse complaints by emphasizing its potential as an export market. Over the past year, they've promised to increase foreign access to their auto, finance and other industries.Some Chinese officials suggest the technology initiatives might be opened to foreign companies. But they have given no details, leaving it unclear whether that will satisfy Washington.Trump and Xi agreed to a 90-day postponement of additional tariff increases to take effect Jan. 1. But economists say that is too little time to settle all the disputes that bedevil U.S.-Chinese relations. They say Beijing's goal probably is to show enough progress to persuade Trump to extend his deadline.During that 90-day period, agreements "may not be reached until the last day," said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for World Trade Organization Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.This week's talks will focus on technical details before higher-level leaders "make hard political decisions," Tu said.In the longer term, the final tariffs might "remain for several years," Tu said. "I don't think it will proceed that fast. It must take time."Cooling economic growth in both countries is turning up the pressure to reach a settlement.Chinese growth fell to a post-global crisis low of 6.5 percent in the quarter ending in September. Auto sales tumbled 16 percent in November over a year earlier. Weak real estate sales are forcing developers to cut prices.The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in the third quarter, and unemployment is at a five-decade low. But surveys show consumer confidence is weakening because of concern that growth will slow this year.Beijing has tried in vain to recruit France, Germany, South Korea and other governments as allies against Trump. They criticize his tactics but echo U.S. complaints about Chinese industrial policy and market barriers.The European Union filed its own challenge in the World Trade Organization in June against Chinese rules that the 28-nation trade bloc said hamper the ability of foreign companies to protect and profit from their own technology.For their part, Chinese officials are unhappy with U.S. curbs on exports of "dual use" technology with possible military applications. They complain China's companies are treated unfairly in national security reviews of proposed corporate acquisitions, though almost all deals are approved unchanged.Some manufacturers that serve the United States have shifted production to other countries to avoid Trump's tariffs.UBS said Friday that 37 percent of 200 manufacturers surveyed by the bank have shifted out of China over the past 12 months. The threat of U.S. tariff hikes was the "dominating factor" for nearly half, while others moved because of higher costs or tighter environmental regulation."Most firms expect trade war to escalate," the bank said.Load-Date: January 7, 2019End of Document

TOP NEWS: China's Li Pledges To Open Up Market As Talks With US ResumeLive Briefs PRO Global MarketsMarch 28, 2019 Thursday 8:06 AM ESTCopyright 2019 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 258 wordsBody Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Thursday promised to further open the Chinese market to foreign firms, just as US and Chinese teams are about to resume negotiations in a protracted trade war."We treat domestic and foreign-funded enterprises equally and protect the rights and interests of all types of businesses," Li said at the opening of the Boao Forum for Asia, an economic conference held on the southern Chinese island of Hainan. Li promised that a "negative list" of sectors in which foreign investment is being restricted will be revised by the end of June. Industries that will further open up include telecommunications, education, transportation and energy, he said.Li said it was "the consistent stance of the Chinese government" to strengthen the protection of intellectual property rights - one of several sore points at the centre of a trade war between China and the US.A US trade delegation led by US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin arrived in Beijing Thursday afternoon for two days of negotiations aimed at resolving the trade tensions between the two countries.The US has so far imposed tariffs on USD250 billion worth of Chinese imports, to which China has retaliated with duties on USD110 billion worth of US goods. The US accuses China of unfair trade practices including intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers. Washington also criticizes the Chinese government's support of state-owned enterprises and tech firms, and would like China to import more US goods.Load-Date: March 29, 2019End of Document

Huawei is crushing Apple in China, and the US is partly to blameCNN WireFebruary 14, 2019 Thursday 12:00 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 672 wordsByline: Analysis by Sherisse Pham, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Huawei smartphones are killing the iPhone in China. Demand for the Chinese tech company's devices is red hot even though the country's overall market for smartphones is shrinking. Huawei's China sales rocketed more than 20% in the final quarter of 2018, and experts say that's partly thanks to the US government's global campaign against the company."The latest tension between the US and China raised the patriotism in Chinese consumers," said Jusy Hong, an analyst at research firm IHS Markit. He pointed out that some Chinese companies encouraged employees to buy Huawei phones late last year. The moves were a gesture of support after the firm's chief financial officer was arrested in Canada in early December at the request of the United States.Huawei's booming sales show how major parts of its business continue to thrive even as the United States tries to persuade other countries to shut Huawei products out of 5G wireless networks and pursues criminal charges against it. The company expects to overtake Samsung as the world's biggest smartphone maker by next year. Huawei sold 30 million phones in China in the last three months of 2018, nearly three times as many as Apple, according to data published this week by research firms Canalys and IDC. Apple's sales plunged almost 20%. 'Cult status'Huawei's success in China, the world's largest smartphone market, is about more than geopolitics. Chinese consumers love its flagship, high-end phones because they have great cameras, cutting edge technology and cost less than the latest iPhones, according to analysts. And by offering a selection of cheaper phones, Huawei is able to target a bigger market. It also benefited from the troubles this year at ZTE, a rival Chinese smartphone and telecommunications equipment maker. ZTE was banned by the US government from buying crucial American parts for months last year as punishment for failing to honor a deal that settled US claims that the company violated sanctions on Iran. ZTE's smartphone sales fell by nearly half last year, and "this volume mostly went to Huawei," Hong said. Two other Chinese rivals, Oppo and Vivo, are nipping at Huawei's heels, but their sales grew by less than 10% in the fourth quarter of last year. Xiaomi, another top Chinese brand that has expanded aggressively in India and Europe, had a disastrous quarter, suffering a 28% plunge in sales, according to Canalys. Huawei and its founder, Ren Zhengfei, enjoy cult status in China, according to Canalys analyst Nicole Peng. Most Chinese see Ren, who started his company with a few thousand dollars and built it into a $100 billion behemoth, "as a highly respectable person," Peng said. That reverence extends to the Huawei brand. Under fire from the USHuawei's international reputation, on the other hand, is taking a beating. A US-led campaign against Huawei has resulted in a growing number of countries considering potential restrictions on the use of Huawei's telecommunications equipment in the construction of 5G networks, which are set to provide superfast wireless internet in the coming years. Washington says the Chinese government could use Huawei equipment to spy on other nations, although it hasn't publicly provided any evidence. Huawei denies that any of its products pose national security risks and says it would refuse any request by Beijing to use them for espionage.Australia and New Zealand both blocked the company last year from providing equipment for 5G networks.Huawei has pushed back against what it calls "irresponsible decisions" by some countries that it says were based on "ideological and geopolitical considerations" rather than legitimate concerns about technology.The US Department of Justice has also charged Huawei with violating sanctions on Iran and stealing technology from T-Mobile. Officials are seeking the extradition of CFO Meng Wanzhou from Canada. Huawei and Meng deny any wrongdoing.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Trump says China tariffs may stay for 'a substantial period of time'CNN.comMarch 20, 2019 Wednesday 9:24 AM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 603 wordsByline: By Jethro Mullen, CNNDateline: Hong Kong BodyPresident Donald Trump has warned that US tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese exports are unlikely to go away anytime soon ? even if the two countries reach a deal to end their trade war."We're not talking about removing them, we're talking about leaving them for a substantial period of time," Trump said Wednesday. "Because we have to make sure that if we do the deal with China that China lives by the deal because they've had a lot of problems living by certain deals."The United States and China, the world's two biggest economies, are trying to negotiate a resolution to their trade dispute that escalated dramatically last year with both sides imposing new tariffs on huge portions of each other's exports.The clash has shaken financial markets, fueled political tensions and caused problems for companies around the world. Businesses have already begun shifting their supply chains out of China to other countries in Asia to avoid the trade-war tariffs.Trade talks between the two governments will resume next week after a pause in negotiations.US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will travel to Beijing for discussions meant to finalize an agreement between the two countries. It's expected that a Chinese delegation, led by Vice Premier Liu He, would then go to Washington for further talks.China's Ministry of Commerce announced during a press conference Thursday that a US trade delegation will be in Beijing for talks March 28 and March 29. It also announced a Chinese delegation will be in Washington D.C. in early April.Negotiations had been on hold as the two sides tried to figure out how to overcome disagreements about how the United States would ensure China is abiding by any deal. US concerns about how China goes about getting hold of American technology and trade secrets have also been a sticking point.Aiming for summit in late AprilThe Trump administration, citing longstanding complaints from US companies, accuses China of stealing valuable commercial information though cyberattacks and forcing American businesses to hand over proprietary technology in exchange for access to Chinese markets.Beijing rejects the accusations. But at the same time, it has recently introduced measures that attempt to address the US concerns, such as a new foreign investment law that was rushed through this month.For its part, the US government last month indefinitely postponed a major increase in the tariffs on Chinese goods as the negotiations continued to progress.Trump is eager for a deal that could boost the stock market and improve his re-election chances in 2020. At the same time, the Chinese government is trying to counter an economic slowdown that has dragged the country's annual growth to its lowest level in three decades, weighing on businesses and consumers.The Trump administration official told CNN this week that the two sides hope to reach an agreement to be signed at a summit in late April at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where he previously hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2017.Trump's rhetoric on the trade negotiations has veered between hawkish and highly optimistic. He said nearly a month ago that the two governments were "getting very, very close" to a deal for which he would participate in a "signing summit" with Xi. Reports suggested the summit could take place in late March.But that bout of optimism was soon followed by the pause in negotiations.On Wednesday, Trump said that the agreement "is coming along nicely," adding that "we have our top representatives going there this weekend to further the deal."Load-Date: March 22, 2019End of Document

China Pledges To Treat Foreign And Domestic Companies "As Equals"Live Briefs PRO Global MarketsMarch 15, 2019 Friday 2:40 AM ESTCopyright 2019 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 484 wordsBody China promises to improve conditions for foreign firms and pass "heavyweight" reforms to shore up its economy, Premier Li Keqiang said Friday at the end of the annual parliamentary session.China will treat foreign and domestic firms "as equals", Li said hours after the parliament voted to approve a foreign investment law intended to appease international criticism of China's trade practices and market barriers.   The law states the Chinese government will protect the intellectual property rights of foreign investors and ensure foreign and domestic companies can compete on equal terms.But it also maintains a "blacklist" of sectors where foreign investment is banned or restricted, ranging from oil and gas exploration to news media.Li promised China would gradually shorten that list."China will further open up, and China's opening up will not come all at once, but quarter after quarter and year after year," he said.The largely rubber-stamp parliament passed the foreign investment law with 2,929 votes for, eight votes against and eight abstentions.The delegates, gathered at Beijing's Great Hall of the People, also approved a government work report setting a 6.0% to 6.5% economic growth target for 2019 - China's lowest in almost three decades - and a measure raising defence spending by 7.5%.Li promised China will not resort to lending and deficit spending to shore up its slowing economy. Instead, it wants to "energize" the market to generate growth."We certainly need to take strong measures to cope with the rising uncertainties we face this year," Li said.The premier said tax cuts including reducing value-added tax in manufacturing by three percentage points to 13% are among "heavyweight" measures meant to drive growth this year.Li also promised to cut red tape and make it easier for private and small businesses to access funding and operate.On the China-US relationship, Li said it will continue to "forge ahead" despite the "twists and turns" brought by a months-long trade war.The US accuses China of unfair practices including forced technology transfers and preferential subsidies to state-owned firms. Washington's tariffs on 250 billion dollars' worth of Chinese imports have bogged down the Chinese economy, which grew 6.6% last year.Li said he hopes for "good outcomes" from consultations between Chinese and US trade teams to solve the trade conflict."It is neither realistic nor possible to decouple these two economies," Li said, adding that he hopes US and Chinese people will work to solve their differences.Referring to accusations that Chinese tech giant Huawei could be spying on the US and its allies if it builds 5G network infrastructure, Li said the government does not ask Chinese companies to spy on other countries. "This is not consistent with Chinese law, this is not how China behaves, we did not do that and will not do that in the future," Li said.Load-Date: March 16, 2019End of Document

CHINESE WOMEN WHO FIGHT FOR RIGHTS REMAIN AT RISK: GROUPStates News ServiceMarch 8, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1100 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Women who campaign for human rights in China face reprisals from the ruling Chinese Communist Party, including enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention, sexual abuse and torture, an overseas rights group has said.Since the death of rights activist Cao Shunli in a police detention center five years ago, women who challenge official abuse of power are still in a vulnerable situation, the overseas based Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) network said, in a report released ahead of International Women's Day on Friday ."The Chinese government has intensified suppression of women's rights advocates, including NGOs advocating for women's rights, in recent years," the report said.It said activist Jin Shunnu died in October 2018 in detention on charges related to "national security," but when her family filed a complaint in January calling on Fushan city authorities to investigate, officials refused to give the family any explanation.When the killers of women in custody are brought to justice, their sentences can be relatively light, the report said, citing the prison terms handed down to seven officials convicted over Li Shulian's 2009 death by torture in an extralegal "black jail" in Longkou, Shandong.Cao died aged 52 on March 14 , 2014 after she was denied medical treatment for months while in detention, according to her brother and fellow activists who blasted the government for using medical care as leverage to silence critics.Her lawyers had made repeated requests for her release to allow her to receive medical treatment, but no action was taken until she was seriously ill. She suffered from tuberculosis in both her lungs, cirrhosis of the liver, and uterine fibroids.Cao was detained as she set out for Switzerland to take part in a U.N. Human Rights Council review in September 2013 .Since then, the ruling Chinese Communist Party has targeted civil organizations including the Beijing Yirenping Center, a public health and anti-discrimination NGO, the Weizhiming Women's Center in Hangzhou, which had run campaigns against gender discrimination, violence against women and sexual harassment, and the Beijing Zhongze Women's Legal Counseling Service Center, which provided legal assistance to women, CHRD said."While the #MeToo movement sparked a conversation in 2018, mainly online, about sexual harassment in China, it also led to some backlash and widespread censorship," the group said."Authorities also shut down Sina Weibo and Tencent WeChat accounts of the group Feminist Voices in March," it said.Far fewer feminist voices in 2019Wang Xiaoli, a women's rights activist from the eastern province of Jiangsu, said she had noticed far fewer feminist voices on China's tightly controlled internet on this year's International Women's Day than in previous years.She said a petition calling for better rights for women had appeared on social media, but had garnered scant support."A few dozen people signed, but then after that, nobody signed at all, that I could see," Wang said. "There are so few people signing petitions these days; a lot of feminists are afraid to express their views.""It's not like it was a few years ago; the suppression by the Chinese Communist Party is very harsh," she said. "Nobody's going to stand there holding placards ... because that would get you detained for 'picking quarrels and stirring up trouble'."Wang said that government crackdowns appeared to be working, as very few people are now willing to express support for women's rights in China now.Rights lawyer Wang Shengsheng said the administration of President Xi Jinping, who is currently serving an indefinite term in office, regards anyone who campaigns for anyone's rights as a threat."It doesn't matter what rights you are fighting for; they will regard your actions as illegal," Wang Shengsheng said. "There are now very tight controls on freedom of thought and expression, whether it is to do with feminism or something else.""[They are] preventing [civil rights] from developing, to the extent of sending them into reverse."According to CHRD, an estimated 976 activists and dissidents are currently under enforced disappearance, pretrial detention, or in prison in China.Many women who have tried to defend human rights in China have faced persecution, including arbitrary detention, torture and inhumane punishment by medical deprivation, the group said, citing the cases of lawyer Li Yuhan, activists Liu Ping, Li Xiaoling and Su Changlan and citizen journalists Ding Lingjie and Wang Jing, among many others."Persecuted women [rights activists] often face sexual harassment," it said. "Several women ... spoke out in 2018, accusing policemen of subjecting them to degrading treatment by forcing them to undergo strip searches,and sexual harassment to intimidate them."House arrest for lawyer's wifeCHRD said Xu Yan, wife of detained human rights lawyer Yu Wensheng, lawyer Sun Shihua and activist Zhang Lifang were among them.Unidentified people wearing the red armbands of citizen security details in Beijing placed Xu under house arrest on Friday , she told RFA.Xu, who is now under the guard of around a dozen police officers and neighborhood officials at her Beijing apartment, said her surveillance had been ordered by the Shijingshan district state security police."I just went out to the corridor and found several people sitting in the corridor," she said. "They wouldn't let me go out.""There were about 12 of them blocking the corridor ... so I didn't go out today ," Xu said. "These people are on duty are on duty 24 hours a day, all through the night."The move comes after Xu wrote last month to Li Zhanshu, chairman of the National People's Congress of China, and several vice-chairmen and secretary-generals, urging them to strengthen supervision of the judiciary.Other wives, sisters and mothers of detained prisoners of conscience have also faced harsh retaliation from authorities, CHRD said, citing the beating and detention last December of Huang Qi's mother Pu Wenqing, 86."To silence her, police detained Pu in a secret location for more than one month and only released her into house arrest as her health seriously deteriorated," CHRD said.Authorities have also hit back at campaigning women and their children with detention, abduction, housing eviction, restricted movement, banned travel abroad, and constant surveillance and monitoring, it said.Reported by Wong Lok-to for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Gao Feng for the Mandarin Service.

RIGHTS GROUPS DEMAND RELEASE OF UYGHUR PROFESSOR ILHAM TOHTI ON FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF ARRESTStates News ServiceJanuary 15, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1114 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Rights activists and Uyghur advocacy groups on Tuesday demanded the release from prison of Uyghur academic and blogger Ilham Tohti in statements marking the fifth anniversary of his arrest on charges of promoting separatism and subsequent sentencing to a life term behind bars.An outspoken economics professor who regularly highlighted the religious and cultural persecution of the mostly Muslim Uyghur ethnic minority in northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), Tohti was sentenced on Sept. 23, 2014 following a two-day show trial.The court decision cited Tohti's criticism of Beijing's ethnic policies, his interviews with overseas media outlets, and his work founding and running the Chinese-language website Uighurbiz.net, which was shut down by Chinese authorities in 2014.On Tuesday, the Germany-based Ilham Tohti Initiative urged Beijing to immediately and unconditionally free the jailed writer and professor, calling the conditions of his imprisonment a "calculated and cruel deprivation" of his rights to family visits and outside communication."All this is carefully engineered to punish the Uyghur scholar with degrading treatment and psychological torture, while at the same time keeping the attention on his plight from the outside world to a minimum," the group's president Enver Can said in a statement.Can said that Tohti's family has not been able to visit him at the XUAR capital Urumqi's No. 1 Prison for the past two years, and cited a report by rights group ChinaChange that claimed he had been held in solitary confinement and denied the right to communicate with friends and loved ones.The Ilham Tohti Initiative urged China's government to "unconditionally free Ilham Tohti, [as well as] his students and all innocent Uyghur intellectuals and writers" in prison or "political re-education camps," where authorities have detained Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities accused of harboring "strong religious views" and "politically incorrect" ideas throughout the XUAR since April 2017.Beijing-based rights activist Hu Jia told RFA's Uyghur Service Tuesday that Tohti's situationimprisoned and prevented from seeing his friends and family"reflects the actual situation of the Uyghur people living as second class citizens under Communist Party rule in China."Hu said that in the time since Tohti's family was last allowed to visit him, the health of the professor is unknown, and expressed concern that authorities "will allow him to die slowly, like they did to Liu Xiaobo," the late Nobel peace laureate and political prisoner who succumbed to liver cancer in July 2017.Advice rejectedIn 2011, high-ranking Chinese officials had sought out Tohti's advice on Beijing's policies in the XUAR, but rejected a paper he wrote detailing the difficulties faced by Uyghurs in the region and how they could be addressed.In 2013, fearing he would be detained and accused of various charges without the right to reply, Tohti gave a lengthy statement by phone to RFA's Uyghur Service and requested it be published if he were taken into custody.Authorities in the XUAR went on to institute a crackdown on intellectuals and others voices of dissent in 2013, following the appointment of Chinese President Xi Jinping,Repressive tactics in the XUAR grew to include detentions in the region's vast network of re-education camps, which Beijing initially denied the existence of, but which XUAR chairman Shohrat Zakir told China's official Xinhua news agency in October last year were an effective tool to protect the country from terrorism and provide vocational training for Uyghurs.Reporting by RFA's Uyghur Service and other media organizations, however, has shown that those in the camps are detained against their will and subjected to political indoctrination, routinely face rough treatment at the hands of their overseers, and endure poor diets and unhygienic conditions in the often overcrowded facilities.Adrian Zenz, a lecturer in social research methods at the Germany-based European School of Culture and Theology, has said that some 1.1 million people are or have been detained in the campsequating to 10 to 11 percent of the adult Muslim population of the XUAR.In November 2018, Scott Busby, the deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor at the U.S. Department of State, said there are "at least 800,000 and possibly up to a couple of million" Uyghurs and others detained at re-education camps in the XUAR without charges, citing U.S. intelligence assessments.Citing credible reports, U.S. lawmakers Marco Rubio and Chris Smith, who head the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China, recently called the situation in the XUAR "the largest mass incarceration of a minority population in the world today."Silenced scholarIn an open letter on Tuesday, 132 scholars and 18 civil society groups called on China's government to immediately release Tohti and other notable academics held in re-education camps, saying his case represents "a warning shot directed at Uyghur intellectuals and activists in China more broadly.""The Chinese government has evidently failed to yield to his advice and now operates one of the most obtrusive surveillance states in the world while arbitrarily locking up Uyghurs, Kazakhs and Kyrgyz in political indoctrination facilities," the letter said.In an opinion piece published in the Hong Kong Free Press on Tuesday, Peter Irwin, program manager of the Munich-based World Uyghur Congress exile group, also called on China to free Tohti and other intellectuals, but stressed that doing so will not be enough to reverse the effects of Beijing's repressive policies in the region."It will take time and tremendous effort from a coalition of like-minded governments to bring about real change on the ground for those affected by what some have already likened to crimes against humanity," Irwin wrote."Five years into this experiment leaves us with dwindling hope, but it is today that Professor Tohti's words resonate. If Xi truly wants harmony and stability as is often claimed, they would do well to heed the advice of the scholar they chose to silence, when his voice was most necessary."Ilham Tohti was awarded Liberal International's Prize for Freedom in a ceremony held in absentia in The Hague in November 2017. He was also the recipient of the Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders in 2016 and the Barbara Goldsmith Freedom to Write Award from the PEN America Center in 2014.Reported by Mihray Abdilim for RFA's Uyghur Service.

AMBASSADOR ZHANG MING:DIGITAL IRON CURTAIN MAKES NO SENSE IN 5G ERAStates News ServiceFebruary 26, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 655 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:On 26 February 2019, The Euractive and some other EU watching media published an article by H.E. Ambassador Zhang Ming, Head of the Chinese Mission to the EU, entitled Digital Iron Curtain Makes No Sense in 5G Era, the full text is following:Recently, 5G technology and its security have been on everyone's lips in Europe. Quite often, a Chinese company was mentioned. As Chinese Ambassador to the EU, I do not intend to speak for a company. I prefer to share my views from a broader perspective.5G technology is a product of global innovation and cooperation. Its industrial, supply and value chains are so widely spread and interlinked that almost everyone has a stake in it. Drawing an iron curtain would therefore have an impact on all, Chinese, Europeans, Americans, and others alike. Such an attempt would upset global economic and scientific cooperation, undermine the principles of free trade and fair competition, disrupt market order, and eventually, hurt the interests of every consumer.It is perfectly understandable to see unease about the potential vulnerability of 5G, as it is indeed opening a brand new horizon in our daily life. No country can afford to be na¯ve on this. For each and every 5G company, meeting high security standards holds the key to customer trust and sustainable development. I could not think of any company which would like to ruin itself by being slack on security issues. Whether there are security risks or not requires a well-informed and facts-based technical judgment, not politically motivated bashing or fear-mongering, still less pressuring and coercion.It is a sad truth that our world is imbued with security challenges. Cyber insecurity is one of them and has been with us ever since the invention of the Internet. To keep our cyberspace safe and secure, more action is needed from both public and private sectors, and global cooperation and coordination is the only right way to go. It is even more so in a 5G era. Discrediting, pressurizing or putting restrictions on a selective few would simply not work. Such discriminatory moves serve no one's good.China and the EU have a wide range of shared interests in defending cyber security. The EU has over the years taken substantial steps to protect cyber security and data privacy, while China has always been committed to fighting all forms of cyber crimes. To enhance communication on cyber security, we need to put into good use the existing dialogue mechanisms, be it multilateral ones within the United Nations or bilateral ones between China and the EU.Some European friends have a misperception of China's National Intelligence Law. Like any other legislation, the National Intelligence Law should be viewed as an indivisible whole. It provides that China's intelligence work must be law-based, give full respect to human rights and uphold the legitimate rights and interests of individuals and organizations, while it stipulates that individuals and organizations shall support and assist with national intelligence work. Therefore, it is advisable to look at the law in a holistic way rather than in a one-sided and out-of-context way. The Chinese government calls on Chinese companies operating overseas to strictly observe laws and regulations of the host country, has and will never ask Chinese companies to engage in illegal activities.In the past 40 years and more, China-EU cooperation has come a long way. Chinese companies value the EU market, because of its openness and huge opportunities, and more importantly, because of the EU's firm commitment to multilateralism and the rules-based global order. It is our hope and belief that the EU will continue to act in the spirit of fairness and non-discrimination. China stands ready to work together with the EU toward a 5G era for the prosperity of all.Load-Date: February 28, 2019End of Document

China-US row over tech giant Huawei overshadows trade talksAssociated Press Financial WireJanuary 29, 2019 Tuesday 10:19 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 1082 wordsByline: By KELVIN CHAN and JOE McDONALD, AP Business WritersDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - U.S. criminal charges against Chinese electronics giant Huawei have sparked a fresh round of trans-Pacific recriminations, with Beijing demanding Tuesday that Washington back off what it called an "unreasonable crackdown" on the maker of smartphones and telecom gear.China's foreign ministry said it would defend the "lawful rights and interests of Chinese companies" but gave no details. Huawei is the No. 2 smartphone maker and an essential player in global communications networks.A day earlier, U.S. prosecutors criminally charged Huawei and several of its officials for allegedly stealing technology secrets and violating Iran sanctions. That followed the detention in Canada of the Huawei founder's daughter - a top company official who was named in one of the U.S. indictments, and who is now awaiting possible extradition to the U.S. Huawei has denied wrongdoing.All that has further complicated U.S.-China relations amid attempts to defuse a trade war instigated by President Donald Trump and clashes over alleged Chinese theft of trade secrets and other intellectual property from U.S. firms. A new round of trade talks are planned for Wednesday in Washington.The nearly two dozen charges unsealed Monday by the Justice Department accuse Huawei of trying to spirit a robot arm and other technology out of a T-Mobile smartphone testing lab. They also allege that Huawei, two subsidiaries and a top executive misled banks about the company's business and violating U.S. sanctions.The allegations mark a new phase in the dispute between the two countries over global technological dominance. The U.S. has reportedly waged a campaign to discourage other nations from using Huawei telecommunications equipment for next-generation "5G" wireless networks, based on concerns that the Huawei gear might compromise national security.U.S. intelligence chiefs who briefed Congress on worldwide threats Tuesday sounded the alarm about China's efforts to gain an edge over the United States."China's pursuit of intellectual property, sensitive research and development plans ... remain a significant threat to the United States government and the private sector," Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats told the Senate Intelligence Committee."While we were sleeping in the last decade and a half, China had a remarkable rise in capabilities that are stunning," Coats said. "A lot of that was achieved - a significant amount was achieved by stealing information from our companies."On Tuesday, Australia's TPG Telecom said it abandoned plans to build what would have been the country's fourth mobile network because of a government ban on Huawei over security concerns. Last week Vodafone, one of the world's biggest mobile phone companies, said it would stop using Huawei gear in its core networks.U.S. officials have long harbored suspicions that Huawei could be used by Beijing to eavesdrop on sensitive communications and questioned whether the privately-owned company has ties to China's ruling communist party because its founder is a former military engineer.Monday's U.S. charges did not allege that Huawei worked at the Chinese government's direction.A 10-count indictment in Seattle centers on a T-Mobile phone-testing robot dubbed "Tappy." The robot, developed in 2006, helped spot problems in phones before they hit the market by mimicking how people actually use them.Prosecutors say Huawei began a scheme to steal Tappy technology for its own phone-testing robot after T-Mobile rejected its request to license the machine for broader use.The indictment detailed efforts by Huawei engineers to sneak into the highly-restricted Tappy lab. One engineer succeeded in taking unauthorized photos of the robot. Another managed to sneak it out of the lab to take measurements and photos to send back to China. He returned it after being questioned by T-Mobile, prosecutors said.Huawei allegedly offered bonuses in 2013 to employees who stole information from other companies around the world, according to the Seattle indictment, citing emails obtained by the FBI. The bonuses were based on the value of information, which was sent to Huawei using an encrypted email address.In the second indictment, Brooklyn prosecutors charge Huawei with using a Hong Kong front company, Skycom, to trade with Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions. They allege Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, lied to banks about those dealings.Meng, the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested Dec. 1 in Vancouver, a development that set off a political firestorm between China and Canada.China detained two Canadians shortly after Meng's arrest in an apparent attempt to pressure Canada to free her. A Chinese court also sentenced a third Canadian to death in a sudden retrial of a drug case, overturning an earlier 15-year prison term.Huawei overtook Sweden's LM Ericsson in 2017 to become the No. 1 global seller of network gear. The company says it supplies 45 of the top 50 global phone companies and has signed contracts with 30 carriers to test its next-generation technology. Its smartphone brand, launched in 2010, surpassed Apple Inc. in two quarters of 2018 to become the world's No. 2 seller behind Samsung Electronics Ltd.White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders denied that the criminal charges were part of a carrot-and-stick approach to the trade talks. "Those two things are not linked," she said.

China-US row over tech giant Huawei overshadows trade talksAssociated Press InternationalJanuary 29, 2019 Tuesday 10:19 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 1082 wordsByline: By KELVIN CHAN and JOE McDONALD, AP Business WritersDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - U.S. criminal charges against Chinese electronics giant Huawei have sparked a fresh round of trans-Pacific recriminations, with Beijing demanding Tuesday that Washington back off what it called an "unreasonable crackdown" on the maker of smartphones and telecom gear.China's foreign ministry said it would defend the "lawful rights and interests of Chinese companies" but gave no details. Huawei is the No. 2 smartphone maker and an essential player in global communications networks.A day earlier, U.S. prosecutors criminally charged Huawei and several of its officials for allegedly stealing technology secrets and violating Iran sanctions. That followed the detention in Canada of the Huawei founder's daughter - a top company official who was named in one of the U.S. indictments, and who is now awaiting possible extradition to the U.S. Huawei has denied wrongdoing.All that has further complicated U.S.-China relations amid attempts to defuse a trade war instigated by President Donald Trump and clashes over alleged Chinese theft of trade secrets and other intellectual property from U.S. firms. A new round of trade talks are planned for Wednesday in Washington.The nearly two dozen charges unsealed Monday by the Justice Department accuse Huawei of trying to spirit a robot arm and other technology out of a T-Mobile smartphone testing lab. They also allege that Huawei, two subsidiaries and a top executive misled banks about the company's business and violating U.S. sanctions.The allegations mark a new phase in the dispute between the two countries over global technological dominance. The U.S. has reportedly waged a campaign to discourage other nations from using Huawei telecommunications equipment for next-generation "5G" wireless networks, based on concerns that the Huawei gear might compromise national security.U.S. intelligence chiefs who briefed Congress on worldwide threats Tuesday sounded the alarm about China's efforts to gain an edge over the United States."China's pursuit of intellectual property, sensitive research and development plans ... remain a significant threat to the United States government and the private sector," Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats told the Senate Intelligence Committee."While we were sleeping in the last decade and a half, China had a remarkable rise in capabilities that are stunning," Coats said. "A lot of that was achieved - a significant amount was achieved by stealing information from our companies."On Tuesday, Australia's TPG Telecom said it abandoned plans to build what would have been the country's fourth mobile network because of a government ban on Huawei over security concerns. Last week Vodafone, one of the world's biggest mobile phone companies, said it would stop using Huawei gear in its core networks.U.S. officials have long harbored suspicions that Huawei could be used by Beijing to eavesdrop on sensitive communications and questioned whether the privately-owned company has ties to China's ruling communist party because its founder is a former military engineer.Monday's U.S. charges did not allege that Huawei worked at the Chinese government's direction.A 10-count indictment in Seattle centers on a T-Mobile phone-testing robot dubbed "Tappy." The robot, developed in 2006, helped spot problems in phones before they hit the market by mimicking how people actually use them.Prosecutors say Huawei began a scheme to steal Tappy technology for its own phone-testing robot after T-Mobile rejected its request to license the machine for broader use.The indictment detailed efforts by Huawei engineers to sneak into the highly-restricted Tappy lab. One engineer succeeded in taking unauthorized photos of the robot. Another managed to sneak it out of the lab to take measurements and photos to send back to China. He returned it after being questioned by T-Mobile, prosecutors said.Huawei allegedly offered bonuses in 2013 to employees who stole information from other companies around the world, according to the Seattle indictment, citing emails obtained by the FBI. The bonuses were based on the value of information, which was sent to Huawei using an encrypted email address.In the second indictment, Brooklyn prosecutors charge Huawei with using a Hong Kong front company, Skycom, to trade with Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions. They allege Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, lied to banks about those dealings.Meng, the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested Dec. 1 in Vancouver, a development that set off a political firestorm between China and Canada.China detained two Canadians shortly after Meng's arrest in an apparent attempt to pressure Canada to free her. A Chinese court also sentenced a third Canadian to death in a sudden retrial of a drug case, overturning an earlier 15-year prison term.Huawei overtook Sweden's LM Ericsson in 2017 to become the No. 1 global seller of network gear. The company says it supplies 45 of the top 50 global phone companies and has signed contracts with 30 carriers to test its next-generation technology. Its smartphone brand, launched in 2010, surpassed Apple Inc. in two quarters of 2018 to become the world's No. 2 seller behind Samsung Electronics Ltd.White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders denied that the criminal charges were part of a carrot-and-stick approach to the trade talks. "Those two things are not linked," she said. "They are a totally separate process."Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, agreed Dec. 1 to put off further sanctions against each other's exports while they negotiated a new trade pact. If they don't reach an agreement by March 1, U.S. tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese products are set to rise from 10 percent to 25 percent. That prospect has rattled financial markets for months.The Trump administration has accused Beijing of deploying predatory trade tactics, ranging from requiring U.S. and other foreign companies to hand over technology in return for access to the vast Chinese market to outright cyber-theft.The number of economic espionage investigations the FBI is handling has doubled over the last three to four years, "and almost all of them lead back to China," said FBI Director Christopher Wray.___Chan reported from London.

Huawei crushes Apple in China, and the US has some faultCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 14, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 697 wordsBody HONG KONG (CNN) - Huawei smartphones are leaving behind the iPhone in China.  The demand for the devices of the Chinese technology company is high despite the fact that the general market of smartphones in the country is in decline. Huawei's sales in China increased more than 20% in the last quarter of 2018, and experts say that this is due, in part, to the US government's global campaign against the company.  "The recent tension between the United States and China has increased patriotism among Chinese consumers," said Jusy Hong, an analyst with research firm IHS Markit.  He pointed out that some of the Chinese companies encouraged their employees to purchase Huawei phones at the end of last year. Those decisions represent a gesture of support after the company's chief financial officer was arrested in Canada in early December, at the request of the United States.  The boost in Huawei's sales demonstrates how large parts of its business continue to be profitable even though the United States is trying to persuade other nations to ban Huawei's products from 5G wireless networks and intends to file criminal charges against them. The company expects to overtake Samsung as the world's leading smartphone maker next year.  Huawei sold 30 million phones in China in the last three months of 2018, this is almost three times Apple's sales, according to information published this week by research firms Canalys and IDC. Apple's sales fell almost 20%.  Cult status  Huawei's success in China, the world's largest smartphone market, goes beyond geopolitics.  Chinese consumers love their high-end flagship phones because they have incredible cameras, advanced technology and cost less than the newer iPhones, according to analysts. Also, by offering a selection of lower-cost phones, Huawei has the ability to impact a larger market.  It also benefits from the problems that its rival ZTE, manufacturer of smartphones and telecommunications equipment, has had this year. ZTE was barred for months from acquiring key parts for its products by the US government as punishment for failing to comply with an agreement that ended US claims that the company had violated the sanctions imposed by the country on Iran.  Sales of ZTE smartphones almost halved last year, and "this volume mainly moved to Huawei," Hong said.  Two other Chinese rivals, Oppo and Vivo, are hot on the heels of Huawei, but their sales grew less than 10% in the fourth quarter of last year. Xiaomi, another major Chinese brand that has been aggressively expanded by India and Europe, has had a disastrous quarter with a 28% drop in sales, according to Canalys.  Huawei and its founder Ren Zhengfei enjoy cult status in China, according to Canalys analyst Nicole Peng.  Most Chinese consider Ren, who started his business with a few thousand dollars and turned it into a $ 100 billion giant as "a very respectable person," Peng said. That respect extends to the Huawei brand.  Under US attack  Huawei's international reputation, on the other hand, is being hit.  A campaign against Huawei led by the United States has resulted in a growing number of countries considering potential restrictions on the use of Huawei's telecommunications equipment in the construction of 5G wireless networks, which aim to provide access to wireless internetof high speed in the coming years.  Washington says the Chinese government could use Huawei's equipment to spy on other nations, although it has not provided any evidence to support it. Huawei denies that any of its products pose a danger to national security and says it would reject any Beijing request to use them for espionage.  Australia and New Zealand banned the company from providing equipment for 5G networks last year.  Huawei has pressed against what he calls "irresponsible decisions" of some countries that he says were taken based on "ideological and geopolitical considerations" instead of legitimate concerns about technology.  The US Department of Justice has also accused Huawei of violating sanctions on Iran and stealing T-Mobile's technology. Officials seek the extradition of his CFO Meng Wanzhou of Canada.  Huawei and Meng deny all charges. Load-Date: February 14, 2019End of Document

China gives its slowing economy a new shot in the armCNN WireJanuary 4, 2019 Friday 1:53 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 428 wordsByline: By Charles Riley, CNN BusinessDateline: LONDON (CNN Business) BodyLONDON (CNN Business) --  China is taking new steps to encourage bank lending and stimulate the country's flagging economy.The People's Bank of China is slashing the amount of money that banks are required to hold in reserve, the latest in a series of policy changes the government has taken to support growth.The central bank said Friday it would cut its reserve requirement ratio by 1 percentage point over the next month. The reductions will be made in two stages on January 15 and January 25.Together, the new measures should inject about 800 billion yuan ($116 billion) into the world's second largest economy as growth slows and a trade war with the United States takes its toll.Economists said the move was partly about managing the amount of money in circulation ahead of Chinese New Year, when cash is often exchanged as gifts. But Capital Economics said the policy change is "also intended to provide support to the economy and will be reinforced with further easing soon."Stimulus efforts move up a gearAnalysts at Macquarie Capital said that the rate cut shows government efforts to support the economy have now moved to the "second level" and should signal to investors that more stimulus is in the pipeline.After decades of sharp expansion, the Chinese economy is cooling. Growth in 2018 is set to be the weakest since 1990, and 2019 looks even worse.China is feeling the effects of a darkening trade outlook and government attempts to rein in risky lending after a rapid rise in debt levels."Given the pressures the economy is facing though, it could still be months before growth stabilizes," noted the analysts at Capital Economics.Fears about China's economic health have already rattled financial markets. The issue became a major focus for investors this week when Apple (AAPL) warned that it would sell fewer iPhones because of the slowdown.What remains uncertain is the severity of the slowdown and how far the Chinese government will go in trying to soften its impact. One big wild card is how the trade war between the United States and China will play out in 2019. Beijing said Friday that talks aimed at ending the dispute would resume next week.Analysts at JPMorgan Chase said that the central bank's action suggests that "the Chinese government is tilting toward a growth-oriented stance." The analysts said the central bank may cut the reserve requirement ratio further, and pump more money into the economy in the form of infrastructure investment and tax cuts.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Continue reading US firm stops selling DNA collection equipment to ChinaMassachusetts-based biotech firm Thermo Fisher says it will stop selling equipment to Xinjiang, the province where Chinese authorities have launched a statewide campaign to monitor and track Uighurs. It told The New York Times the new decision was  consistent with Thermo Fisher s values, ethics code, and policies. From 2016 to 2017, China ordered almost 36 million people to get medical checkups, according to numbers reported by state-run Xinhua News. Blood samples, fingerprints, photos of irises, and other identifying data were collected, as Human Rights Watch reported in 2017. Thermo Fisher supplied some of the lab equipment used to collect DNA, patent filings obtained by the NYT revealed. The company s 2017 annual report stated that China brought in about 10 percent of the company s $20.9 billion revenue, describing the country as  our greatest success story in emerging markets. Building a comprehensive database of DNABy collecting Uighurs  DNA, authorities in China were building a comprehensive database to better identify any individual who defied the system. They also benefitted from shared data from a visiting Yale professor, whose research was cited in Chinese state patents. Xinjiang s local government denied to the NYT that it collected DNA samples.Uighurs in Xinjiang have reportedly been imprisoned in camps, according to multiple accounts from human rights groups and media reports. Most predominantly practice Islam and are often discriminated against for being a minority population amid China s majority Han Chinese. The Chinese government has held Uighurs responsible for terrorist attacks within the past ten years.US tech companies sometimes become complicit in helping China build its surveillance system. Just take Cisco s role in selling routers to China while the country was building up its internet censorship system in the early 2000s, or Microsoft censoring search results on its Bing search engine within China so it can continue its operations. Necessary, but insufficient Some tech companies have pulled out of China, like Google did in 2010, citing human rights concerns. But often enough, they continue to be indirectly involved and complicit, drawn by the lure of expanding to a large internet user base that may increase profitability. Facebook has repeatedly tried to enter China againafter being banned in 2009 when Xinjiang activists reportedly used the platform to organize protests, and Google s censored search engine that the company considered last year was the source of much controversy.It s an ethical dilemma for many companies and some choose to compromise as a result. In a blog post, Human Rights Watch called Thermo Fisher s decision to stop selling to Xinjiang a  necessary, but insufficient  move.  Thermo Fisher s decision leaves many key questions unanswered: What about sales of that technology to Chinese police in other parts of the country? The police s abusive collection of DNA materials from people unconnected to crimes is not confined to Xinjiang,  Sophie Richardson, HRW s China director wrote today.Collecting personally identifying data is already somewhat commonplace outside of Xinjiang, although mandatory checkups have not been reported. China already requires all foreigners landing in airports to submit their fingerprints and has also installed over 20 million cameras across the country to spot jaywalkers and other petty crimes on the streets. We ve reached out to Thermo Fisher to ask whether the company plans to end sales to other parts of China as well.Tags: See Website:https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18236615/us-biotech-firm-dna-collection-equipment-china-sales-stopped-uighursContact Information:Shannon LiaoTags:           Wire,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: February 27, 2019End of Document

WHY CHINA IS WINNING THE 5G WARStates News ServiceFebruary 5, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 851 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for the National Interest (former the Nixon Center):If America wants to lead in 5G, then it must clear the path for strong competition among leading American technology companies.by Charles DuanThere is little doubt today that American superiority in the next generation of mobile communications, commonly called 5G, is a matter of extraordinary national concern. There is also little doubt that China is a strong competitor, already having outspent the United States by $24 billion and planning $411 billion in 5G investment over the next decade. The Chinese government has also laid out multiple national plans for establishing the country as a leader in mobile technology, and the Chinese firm Huawei is poised to be the top smartphone manufacturer by 2020.And what are United States companies doing about this? Bickering over patents.For years, the leading American supplier of advanced mobile communications chips has been the San Diego-based Qualcomm. The company has been an innovator of mobile technology, but it has also been a remarkable innovator of convoluted legal strategies. As an ongoing Federal Trade Commission lawsuit alleges , Qualcomm has used its dominant position as a chip supplier and its extensive patent holdings to weave an intricate web of patent licensing across the mobile industry. The effect of that complex licensing scheme, the FTC claims, has been to force competitor chipmakers out of the market and to extract concessions and high patent royalties from smartphone and mobile-device makers.Qualcomm today faces only one major U.S. competitorIntel, whose chips Apple recently started using instead of Qualcomm's. Not surprisingly, Qualcomm has leveraged its patents to force a retaliatory investigation against Apple, the effect of which could be, as an administrative judge recently determined , to boot Intel out of the mobile-chip market and leave Qualcomm as a monopoly.It is hard to imagine that this infighting among Apple, Intel and Qualcomm is getting the United States very far in 5G, and it is harder to imagine that Qualcomm's desired outcome would do so, either. The best path, instead, is the obvious one: allowing competition and expanding the number of firms working on 5G.Competition encourages companies to out-innovate each other in order to grab market share. Of particular importance to 5G, competition leads to better cybersecurity in products, making them less vulnerable to hacking or misuse.Competition is especially crucial when it comes to the technical standards that define how 5G works. These standards are the work of 3GPP, an international consortium of technology companies in the field. Chinese players such as Huawei and ZTE are major participants in 3GPP. Ensuring that 3GPP's standards reflect American values requires having as many American companies at the negotiating table as possiblewhich is harder to achieve when those companies are trying to sue each other out of business.Certainly patents themselves, as rewards for new inventions, are a driver of innovation in areas such as 5G. The problem, though, is not the existence of a patent system but the ever-expanding power of the patent laws, which encourage companies to pour dollars into complex patent licensing and assertion schemesas companies like Qualcomm have donerather than to perform the hard work of building new technologies. When innovation in patent strategy is more profitable than actual innovation, we lose the race to 5G and other technologies.But don't take my word for it. Multiple members of Congress , from both sides of the aisle, have denounced the use of patents to kick companies like Intel out of 5G development, predicting that such actions would "dampen the quality, innovation, competitive pricing, and in this case the preservation of a strong U.S. presence in the development of 5G and thus the national security of the United States."Or look to what China itself is doing. The Chinese government is handing out rewards left and right to encourage technology research and development. Indeed, it grants subsidies and financial benefits (ranging from the ordinary to the imperfect to the bizarre) to encourage its citizens to file for patents. But while China specifically encourages filing for patents, it does little to encourage using them: Patent infringement awards in court are peanutsoften only five figures and most Chinese patent owners drop their patents within five years of getting them. The message in China is clear: You will be rewarded for innovating, but not for quibbling over patents.The United States should take the same tack if it wants to match China in 5G. Ever-stronger patent rights encourage counterproductive disputes that are a drag on industry, a drag on research and development, and ultimately a drag on domestic competitiveness on the global stage. If America wants to lead in 5G, then it must clear the path for strong competition among leading American technology companies.Charles Duan is the Director of Technology and Innovation at the R Street Institute.Load-Date: February 6, 2019End of Document

Redouble China digital surveillanceCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 18, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 486 wordsBody       BEIJING.- China has become the country with the largest and most complex surveillance and artificial intelligence system in the world. In the Asian giant there are currently around 170 million video surveillance cameras throughout the country and it is estimated that by 2021 the number will increase to 400 million with the slogan of protecting its citizens. In recent years, the Chinese government, with the help of Chinese hi-tech companies such as SenseNets, Dahua, Cloudwalk and Hikvision, has developed and implemented facial recognition technology in order to create a database to identify and Track individuals regardless of their location in a matter of minutes. This method has allowed Beijing to stop and interrogate not only suspects or criminals, but also dissidents, activists and people related to them. "Since President Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, China has significantly increased controls," said Berkeley University researcher Xiao Qiang in his report "The Road to Digital Unfreedom: President Xi's Surveillance State." "The new state surveillance arsenal includes massive video surveillance projects that incorporate facial recognition technology, voice recognition software that can be identified in phone calls, and a comprehensive and intrusive DNA collection program," he added. In some cities, the authorities placed cameras to identify and project the image on public screens of all those pedestrians who cross the street when they are stopped; This has become an efficient way to prevent accidents but also in a humiliating practice. In addition, the use of cameras was standardized in places such as public toilets, vending machines, train stations, banks, schools and public transport. The most well-known and criticized case is that of the Sinkiang region, located in northwestern China and inhabited by ethnic Uyghurs, who were detained by Chinese forces and interned in camps to be "re-educated." Millions of uiguires were subjected to a permanent surveillance system, where individuals are constantly monitored with GPS and QR codes to know their exact location 24 hours a day. In addition, social networks available in China, such as WeChat or Weibo, have also become a weapon to control and censor user information. However, many people do not know the technology used. "People in China hardly understand the government's massive surveillance systems, in some cases they even support them because they believe in the propaganda of the authorities that these systems are beneficial for maintaining public order," he warned. Attentive look The Chinese Government installed a network of cameras with facial recognition throughout the country. 170 million cameras were installed. 400 million will be available by 2021.

It looks like Facebook is giving up on its years-long effort to bring its social network to China (FB)Business Insider USMarch 6, 2019 Wednesday 05:55 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 839 wordsByline: rmchan@businessinsider.com,  (Rosalie Chan)Highlight: Facebook has been working to expand business in China, but Mark Zuckerberg's new note on privacy suggests that Facebook won't build data centers thereBodyFacebook• Facebook CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg wrote in a public note Wednesday that Facebook has decided not to build data centers in countries that have been violating human rights, including privacy and freedom of expression.• Zuckerberg seems to be referring to China, where the social media site is banned and where Facebook has long been working to expand business.• China has strict regulations in storing data in the country, and Apple has already built a data center that complies with these regulations.• Facebook has previously built its first data center in Asia in Singapore, where the government restricts freedom of press and speech.Mark Zuckerberg's vow to overhaul Facebook with new privacy rules is likely to spell the end of its years-long campaign to enter China. Facebook's CEO said in a blog post on Wednesday that the social network will not build data centers in countries that have a record of violating privacy and freedom of expression. That moral stance would likely make it impossible for Facebook to offer its service in China, where recent data localization laws require that internet service providers keep all personal data produced by its citizens - from emails to selfies -  on computers within the country's borders. "As we build our infrastructure around the world, we've chosen not to build data centers in countries that have a track record of violating human rights like privacy or freedom of expression,"            Zuckerberg wrote. Facebook decided not to build            data centers in those countries because it can make it easier for governments to access people's sensitive data, he said. To many observers, the implication was obvious. "In other news, Zuck has clearly given up on entering China, as these changes makes that impossible. Good," Alex Stamos, adjunct professor at Stanford and Facebook's former chief security officer, tweeted after Zuckerberg published his comments.A senior source inside Facebook told Buzzfeed News on Wednesday that the company "does not see a path forward in China" and has given up efforts to enter the world's largest internet market by users. Read more: China has withdrawn approval for Facebook's new venture in the country, where it remains bannedFacebook's service is currently blocked in China, but the company has long said that entering the market is crucial to its mission of connecting the world. As Facebook's growth slows, China's 800 million internet users represent an attractive untapped market for Facebook, which generates almost all of its revenue by showing ads to users.Facebook is not following in Apple's footstepsFacebook had previously confirmed that it had at least four data sharing partnerships with            Chinese companies, including smartphone company Huawei, which is under scrutiny from the U.S. government. Facebook had said it would            end those partnerships.Facebook would almost certainly have run into compliance issues if it built a data center in China. Ted S. Warren-Pool/Getty ImagesFor example, data that's collected in China must be stored in that country, and companies must comply with strict rules like undergoing a security assessment if they want to send or move the data outside of China. China also requires companies to assist authorities when they conduct security investigations.Apple already has a data center in China to host the local version of its iCloud online services. It complies with Chinese regulations and is operated by a Chinese company, raising concerns among privacy advocates that the Chinese government will be able to more easily            access this data.Facebook may see its stance on China as an opportunity to claim a moral high ground in an escalating war of words with tech rival Apple over consumer privacy. "People want to know their data is stored securely in places they trust," Zuckerberg wrote. "Looking at the future of the internet and privacy, I believe one of the most important decisions we'll make is where we'll build data centers and store people's sensitive data."That said, Facebook has already built a data center in Singapore - the company's first in Asia. Compared to China, Singapore has a more relaxed stance on data storage, but Singapore's government has also put restrictions on freedom of speech and press. How Facebook justifies its presence in some countries versus others, already a thorny issue freighted with politics, is likely to become even more controversial under the company's new policy.Facebook declined to comment beyond the blog post. NOW WATCH: The wives of high-level cocaine traffickers reveal how their husbands took down 'El Chapo'See Also:• What the British royal family looked like the year you were born• Costco workers reveal 31 things they'd love to tell shoppers, but can't• An Alphabet spinout announced its first new cybersecurity product, and competitor Splunk's stock fell 5%SEE ALSO: Facebook says it will move to encrypted, auto-deleting messages - and warns that some countries might decide to ban itLoad-Date: March 6, 2019End of Document

From president to dictatorThe Oracle: Oral Roberts UniversityJanuary 1, 2019 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 391 wordsBodyOn Sunday, Feb. 25, the Chinese Communist Party announced that it was proposing the removal or term limits inside of a clause in their constitution made in 1982, which limits presidential terms to two five-year periods.There are two main authoritative states inside of the Chinese government: The People's Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party . The PRC is a state that lies inside of the CCP, which itself is the main authoritative rule in China. The values of both parties appeal to nationalism, patriotism and social stability. The total members of the CCP amount to 6.45 percent of China's population by the most recent 2016 statistic, which in total is around 82 million people.President Xi Jinping was elected Chair of the Military Commission, General Secretary of the Communist Party and President of the People's Republic of China in 2013. He continues to hold office in all these positions today. Both the positions of General Secretary and Chair of the Military do not include term limits, and this most recent proposal will permit full, lifelong rule over all three of these positions after the end of his second term in 2023.Among recent events in China involving Jinping, one of the most impactful is the "Belt and Road Initiative", which is a one-trillion-dollar plan to help globalize China's trade by a massive infrastructure train line spanning more than 60 countries. Additional events include Jinping raising the military budget by eight percent and a heavier focus on domestic security due to greater than expected economic growth.Along with these new events and proposals, the CCP also instituted an internet-wide censorship on key-words and phrases on China's Twitter-like website, "Sina Weibo." The list of these words and phrases includes: "I don't agree," "migration," "emigration," "re-election," "election term," "constitutional amendment," "constitution rules," and "proclaiming oneself an emperor." The name "Winnie the Pooh" is also censored as it's a nickname Chinese social media users give Jinping.Many media outlets perceive China's advancements as a two-in-one globalization movement and internal power-grab. Later reports call for an economic downfall, others an increase and greater connection with world powers such as Russia. Though, one can only guess what honey President Pooh can lunge after next.Load-Date: January 1, 2019End of Document

"People think it's much like a deadly virus - if we don't do anything, we could die."Breaches have been "numerous," according to the review. While China is identified as the primary threat, hackers from Russia and Iran have also been causing their share of trouble.Mass Communication Specialist Samuel Souvannason/US Navy PhotoSecretary of the Navy Richard Spencer launched the recently concluded review in October, warning that "attacks on our networks are not new, but attempts to steal critical information are increasing in both severity and sophistication.""We must act decisively to fully understand both the nature of these attacks and how to prevent further loss of vital military information," he added.In one high-profile incident last year, Chinese government hackers stole important data on US Navy undersea-warfare programs from an unidentified contractor. Among the stolen information were plans for a new supersonic anti-ship missile, The Washington Post reported in June, citing US officials.That and a second breach led Navy leadership to order the review.Read More: Chinese hackers are reportedly stealing loads of US Navy secrets, and the Navy is scrambling to stop itThe Journal described the findings of the internal Navy cybersecurity review as "dire," adding that the report "depicts a branch of the armed forces under relentless cyberattack by foreign adversaries and struggling in its response to the scale and sophistication of the problem."The Navy and the Pentagon reportedly "have only a limited understanding of the actual totality of losses that are occurring," meaning the situation could be even worse than the Navy fears.Last week, The Journal reported that Chinese hackers have targeted more than two dozen universities in the US and elsewhere in an attempt to steal military secrets, particularly those related to maritime technology.US Navy PhotoThe Navy is not the only US military service branch in China's crosshairs.Adm. Philip Davidson, head of US Indo-Pacific Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee in April 2018 that Beijing is snatching anything not nailed down - "stealing technology in just about every domain and trying to use it to their advantage," Stars and Stripes reported.A US defense official previously told The Journal that China was targeting America's "weak underbelly," saying that cybersecurity breaches are "an asymmetric way to engage the United States without ever having to fire a round."China has repeatedly denied engaging in cyberattacks against the US or other countries.NOW WATCH: How US Navy carrier strike groups turn the world's oceans into a buffer between the US and warSee Also:• US Navy wants to get rid of an aircraft carrier to buy new weapons needed for a next-level fight with China• The US has been getting 'its ass handed to it' in war games simulating fights against Russia and China• Russia is installing toilets in the wildly expensive NATO killer T-14 supertanks it can't affordSEE ALSO: US Navy wants to get rid of an aircraft carrier to buy new weapons needed for a next-level fight with ChinaLoad-Date: March 12, 2019End of Document

"After gagging journalists, bloggers and Internet uses, the regime is now targeting academic journals whose findings contradict its simplistic rhetoric."The German publishing house Springer Nature, which owns the science magazines Nature and Scientific American, as well as the Journal of Chinese Political Science and the publishing house Palgrave Macmillan, confirmed in November 2017 that the Chinese authorities had forced it to block online access to around 1% of its articles within China.Three months before that, the Cambridge University Press, another respected academic publishing house, reported that, at the Chinese authorities' request, it was blocking access within China to 300 articles in the online archives of its China Quarterly journal.

ELECTRIC VEHICLES: China scales back subsidies to spur innovationClimateWireMarch 27, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLCSection: INTERNATIONAL; Vol. 10; No. 9Length: 461 wordsBodyChina will scale back subsidies on electric vehicles as the industry develops and costs go down, trying to encourage local manufacturers to rely on innovation rather than government assistance to spur sales. The subsidy for pure battery electric cars with a driving range of 400 kilometers (250 miles) and above will be cut by half, to 25,000 yuan ($3,700) per vehicle from 50,000 yuan, the Ministry of Finance said in a statement on its website yesterday. To qualify for any subsidy, electric cars need to have a range of at least 250 kilometers, compared with 150 kilometers previously, the ministry said. The government had warned of its plans to scale back subsidies and phase them out completely after 2020, though it hadn't given details. While financial support for purchases has fueled the rapid growth of China's electric-car industry, there are also concerns that automakers have become overly reliant on them at the expense of developing new technologies and better vehicles. The move aims to support "high-quality development of a new-energy automobile industry," the ministry said. U.S.-listed advance depository receipts for NIO Inc., the maker of ES8 electric sport utility vehicles, plunged as much 5.4 percent to $5.06, the lowest intraday price since the Shanghai-based company's initial public offering in September. "While the incumbent OEMs will see some earnings damage, we consider NIO the most vulnerable of all," Robin Zhu, a Sanford C. Bernstein analyst, wrote in a report yesterday. "Despite struggling for demand, the company recently indicated it won't reduce prices to offset lower EV subsidies. Today's subsidy cuts mean NIO's cars just got meaningfully more expensive for consumers." Worse than expected The finance ministry also urged local governments in China to remove subsidies on purchases of electric vehicles, including buses and trucks, after a three-month grace period starting yesterday. When combining the halving of subsidies for EVs with at least 400 kilometers of range with the complete removal of direct incentives from local governments, the total reduction is 67 percent, a more drastic cut than the 40 percent or 50 percent that the market was expecting, according to Patrick Yuan, a Jefferies analyst. Subsidies have been key to making plug-in hybrids and EVs of companies such as BYD Co., which is backed by Warren Buffett, more affordable to Chinese consumers and helping the country surpass the U.S. as the world's biggest market for such vehicles in 2015. On top of what the central government spends, Chinese cities and provinces separately offer incentives to make electric cars more appealing in a country where automakers from Volkswagen AG to Ford Motor Co. are planning to increase EV offerings. -- BloombergLoad-Date: April 24, 2019End of Document

China lost more than 150 billionaires as its stock markets tumbledCNN WireFebruary 27, 2019 Wednesday 7:57 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 509 wordsByline: By Daniel Shane, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  China's recent stock market turmoil has dealt a heavy blow to the ranks of its super-rich.The number of billionaires in Greater China, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, plunged by 161 in the past year, according to wealth research firm Hurun Report.Chinese fortunes were squeezed last year by a plunge of more than 25% in the country's stock markets and a slump in the country's currency, Hurun said Tuesday as it published its Global Rich List.Chinese financial markets were rocked in 2018 by fears over the country's slowing economy and its damaging trade war with the United States. Analysts expect economic growth to bottom out later this year.The number of Chinese billionaires fell from 819 to 658 in the year ended January 31, according to Hurun. Despite the big drop, the country is still home to more billionaires than the United States, which has 584, an increase of 13, according to Hurun.Among the biggest losers in China were Ma Huateng, the CEO of internet giant Tencent, whose fortune slumped 19% to $38 billion. Shares in Tencent were hit hard by a freeze in Chinese approvals for many of its money-making games. Dalian Wanda Group's Wang Jianlin, once China's richest man, suffered a 37% plunge in net worth to $17 billion. Wang, who once boasted about his sprawling global business empire, has been more focused in recent years on selling off assets from his real estate and entertainment conglomerate.Jack Ma and others get richerSome Chinese billionaires thrived amid the turmoil, though. Jack Ma, founder of e-commerce company Alibaba, enjoyed a rise of more than 20% in his wealth to $39 billion, making him China's richest man. Ma's fortune rose last year thanks to a sharp increase in the value of Alibaba's online payments affiliate, Ant Financial. He is still a long way behind the world's richest man, Jeff Bezos. Hurun pegs the Amazon chief's net worth at $147 billion. A series of big Chinese IPOs also catapulted new names into the ranks of the super-rich. Zhang Yong is now the richest restaurant owner in the world after his Chinese hot pot chain, Haidilao, went public in Hong Kong last year. Zhang is worth an estimated $8.8 billion. Another new entrant is Zhang Yiming, the founder of internet startup ByteDance. The company, which is behind a bunch of popular social media apps like TikTok, is now reportedly valued at about $75 billion."Despite the slowdown in the Chinese economy, there is significant innovation going on, shown by China having more new faces than any other country in the world," said Rupert Hoogewerf, Hurun Report's chairman. The Hurun index measures individual wealth as of January 31. That leaves out that the impact of February's rebound in Chinese stocks, which has been driven by hopes of more stimulus measures from the Chinese government and optimism about a potential deal to end the trade war.The benchmark Shanghai Composite index is up nearly 14% since the start of February.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Stanford overseas travel consultant intensifies warnings for China-related travelThe Stanford Daily: Stanford UniversityJanuary 18, 2019 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 549 wordsBodyStanford's third-party consultant for overseas travel has issued additional precautionary recommendations on China-related travel after a Chinese court sentenced a Canadian traveler convicted of drug smuggling to death on Monday.The recommended precautions include ensuring appropriate travel documents have been obtained and registering itineraries and plans with respective national government traveller programs. Additionally, travelers are encouraged to refrain from discussing sensitive political topics and to exercise caution before sending documents or information abroad that would fall under the purview of China's state secrets law.The new recommendations issued by International SOS - which provides travel, health and security-related services as a part of Stanford's "International Travel Assistance Program" - were emailed on Tuesday to Stanford Global mailing list subscribers on behalf of the Stanford Office of Risk Management .In the email, the ORM warned that China uses exit bans coercively to "compel U.S. citizens to participate in Chinese government investigations," "lure individuals back to China from abroad" and "aid Chinese authorities in resolving civil disputes in favor of Chinese parties."These recommendations come after the State Department updated its China Travel Advisory in early January to warn that U.S. citizens exercise "increased caution" when traveling in China. It warned of added travel risks due to "arbitrary enforcement of local laws" as well as "special restrictions on dual U.S.-Chinese nationals."Also in early January, a State Department representative advised U.S. academic institutions that no additional travel precautions needed to be taken in light of the Travel Advisory revision, according to the ORM.However, in the wake of the death sentence imposed on Canadian traveler Robert Lloyd Schellenberg - who was convicted by a Chinese court of drug smuggling - International SOS decided to issue additional precautionary recommendations on China-related travel.Stanford Office of International Affairs director Brendan Walsh told The Daily that it is "more important than ever for travelers to inform themselves about technology and privacy while they are traveling.""We exist in an international climate where it is important for everyone who travels internationally to exercise sound judgment and be diligent about traveling with the right documents," Walsh wrote.Walsh also noted that the Office of International Affairs has received inquiries about digital security and proper visas for China-related travel in light of the new recommendations, though the Office has not yet heard of any programs or students changing their travel plans.Vinita Bali, who sent Tuesday's email on behalf of the Office of Risk Management, did not respond to a request for comment.Contact Berber Jin at fjin16 'at' stanford.edu.While you're here...We're a student-run organization committed to providing hands-on experience in journalism, digital media and business for the next generation of reporters.

CHINESE EMBASSY OFFICIAL: NO MONEY OFFERED TO ROHINGYA IN BANGLADESHStates News ServiceMarch 7, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 514 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:China has not offered Rohingya refugees money to repatriate to Myanmar, a Chinese Embassy attache in Dhaka told BenarNews, after the news outlet reported that a delegation of officials from Beijing had promised refugee families up to U.S. $6,000 each if they returned to Rakhinestate.The embassy official was asked to comment on a video posted online by a Rohingya NGO that showed Chinese delegates meeting with refugees in southeastern Bangladesh, and offering families money to return to their homeland. Bangladeshi officials and Rohingya leaders confirmed the meeting and the offer to BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service, on Tuesday."I didn't see the video so I cannot say whether there's Chinese official[s]," political attache Vera Hu said in an email response to BenarNews.However, she clarified, "China never offers money to Rohingya people for them to go back.""It is Myanmar government that would offer the money to Rohingya families who don't want to accept the houses built by Myanmar in Rakhine, as a fund to rebuild their homes by themselves," she said.On Thursday, BenarNews could not confirm Hu's statement. Win Myat Aye, chief of Myanmar's Union Enterprise for Humanitarian Assistance, Resettlement and Development in Rakhine, Aung Tun Thet, a member of Myanmar's Rakhine inquiry commission, and a foreign ministry spokesman did not immediately return calls from the Yangon office of RFA.The video of the Chinese delegation was taken when Sun Gouxiang, China's special envoy for Asian Affairs, arrived at the Kutupalong refugee camp in Cox's Bazar on March 3. During his visit, the diplomat met with 29 refugees, including 14 women.A Bangladeshi official and Rohingya leaders who attended the meeting confirmed to BenarNews that the delegation had offered each family up to U.S. $6,000 to help the refugees rebuild their homes in Rakhine state."They asked us whether we would go back if they gave us five thousand to six thousand dollars," Syed Ullah, secretary-general of the Arakan Rohingya Society for Peace and Human Rights (ARSPH), an NGO, told BenarNews.At least 200,000 homes would be constructed in Myanmar to accommodate the returning refugees, the Bangladesh official, who requested anonymity, told BenarNews."The Chinese government offered them the money, so that each Rohingya family can build their own houses when they go back," he said.About 730,000 Rohingya fled their homes in Rakhine and crossed into Bangladesh at the height of a brutal crackdown launched by the Myanmar military in response to attacks by Rohingya insurgents on security posts in August 2017. The United Nations and the United States described the killings that took place during the military counter-offensive as "ethnic cleansing."Last week, Bangladesh's Foreign Secretary Shahidul Haque told a U.N. Security Council meeting that the refugee crisis had gone from "bad to worse" and said Dhaka would no longer be able to take in refugees from Myanmar.Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Load-Date: March 8, 2019End of Document

The United States and China together account for three out of every four unicorns globally, with 156 and 93 respectively. China's main hurdle is its relative lack of research investments."China's scientific research, especially basic research, is still in a catch-up phase," said Vincent Chan, Credit Suisse's head of China equity strategy. According to the report, Chinese spending on research and development from 2000 to 2009 only made up 1.2% of the country's GDP, far lower than the 2.2% average expenditure of OECD countries during the same period.Though China is now working to close the gap, that early investment "provides the foundation for the emergence of unicorns," the Credit Suisse researchers added.Artificial intelligence and robotics are widely seen as gateways to the future of technology --- and a central part of the ongoing tussle between Washington and Beijing for global dominance. Last week, the Trump administration underscored their importance, nominating former venture capitalist Michael Kratsios to the role of US chief technology officer. Kratsios, who focuses on areas like 5G, AI, quantum computing and autonomous vehicles, told the Washington Examiner that his team would continue pushing those initiatives."Our primary goal is to ensure American leadership," he said.But China has made rapid strides in some areas, and is already leading in the development of 5G technology.Chinese tech giant Huawei is one of biggest holders of patents for the next-generation wireless networks, which will help power other emerging technologies like self-driving cars and smart city services. Huawei has rapidly emerged as a global 5G leader, despite a US-led campaign to ban its equipment in countries around the world. The Chinese government has also outlined plans to become a dominant force in artificial intelligence by 2030, targeting an investment of nearly $150 billion in the industry. TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

New carmaker on the block: Byton's CEO on China's car of the futureMcKinsey & CompanyMarch 14, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 McKinsey & Company, Inc All Rights ReservedLength: 2198 wordsByline: McKinsey QuarterlyHighlight: Carsten Breitfeld, an industry veteran turned disruptor, explains how his Chinese-conceived, globally oriented start-up is tuned for the emerging mobility transformation. Body Link to Image Byton aims to transform the way consumers experience mobility-while simultaneously upending the way car companies do business. The Nanjing-headquartered automaker, cofounded in 2016 by Carsten Breitfeld and Daniel Kirchert (industry veterans of BMW and Infiniti, respectively), recently announced plans to introduce an SUV launched with "level 3" autonomy (meaning conditional automation based on specific operating conditions), followed swiftly by a sedan and a seven-passenger vehicle that will be launched with level-4 autonomy (meaning it can drive safely without human intervention). The SUV will debut in China toward the end of 2019, with US and European launches to follow in mid-2020. SidebarCarsten Breitfeld biographyDr. Carsten Breitfeld is the chairman of the board, cofounder, and CEO of Byton. He holds a PhD in mechanical engineering and, prior to launching Byton, spent two decades at BMW, most recently as vice president of engineering and head of the company's Vehicle Program i8, a luxury plug-in hybrid model. He is married and has two children. Cofounder and CEO Carsten Breitfeld recently sat down with McKinsey's Allen Webb to explain Byton's vision, the advantages of operating in China, and the characteristics of the new mobility ecosystem that will emerge worldwide.The Quarterly: Byton is sometimes seen as a lot like Tesla-a company seeking to enter the market from scratch with a luxury electric vehicle. What do you think of the comparison?Carsten Breitfeld: It's not precise at all. Byton was created to be a provider of mobility. Earnings will come from selling mobility, not just selling cars. Byton is about electric cars that are smart, connected, and autonomous. The car will become a platform-a smart device on wheels. This platform can be used to sell digital content generated from data, and those products will be designed for shared mobility.  Link to Image Byton's SUV is set to debut in China by the end of the year, with US and European launches to follow in mid-2020.The Quarterly: You spent two decades at BMW before leaving to found Byton in 2016. Where have industry developments brought us since you started?Carsten Breitfeld: We are coming to a tipping point. It's not only the products that will change but also the business models. The traditional car companies will build electric cars, and great electric cars, without any doubt. But when it comes to rethinking the user experience for smart cars, they have it much harder. The culture and mind-set you need is more about consumer electronics and software and the internet and less about the car industry. And the biggest hurdle is to implement new business models. It will be difficult, if not impossible, to change the business model completely in an organization of 100,000 or 300,000 people who are trained to develop a car, build it, and sell it. This is the reason I eventually decided to take the chance to build something new. Leaving a great company like BMW was not an easy decision. The Quarterly: How does being a Chinese company affect your business model?The culture and mind-set you need is more about consumer electronics and software and the internet and less about the car industry.Carsten Breitfeld: China is the place where the future of mobility will be shaped, developed, and designed, for four reasons. One, it's the biggest market in the world, with about 30 million yearly car sales right now. Two, everything in China is developing at high speed, in every sense. Three, there's a lot of money, and its investors are prepared to invest not just in early-stage companies but also in teams and ideas. We raised $240 million in A-round funding from Chinese investors, based just on a design we had as a team and on a business plan. This would never happen in Europe, and rarely in the United States. The fourth factor is the strong political will to make this happen. The Chinese government wants future transportation to be electric and smart. And when it comes to smart transportation, you need a strong 5G network and infrastructure. The Quarterly: You cofounded the company only three years ago and are slated to launch your first vehicle, an SUV, next year in China. By car-development standards, that seems pretty fast.Carsten Breitfeld: It is fast. But to give you an example, my last job at BMW was to be responsible for the BMW i8 program. BMWi was really a start-up within the company, and we went from idea to market launch in 38 months. That's the time it takes to develop a car. The rest of the time in big companies is lost, spent in long discussions and in very long decision processes where you have to talk to hundreds of people and go to committees, committees, and committees. Not so at Byton.The Quarterly: Why start with an SUV?Carsten Breitfeld: That was an easy decision. The SUV is the fastest-growing and most profitable vehicle segment in essentially every market. The technical platform for this one will be the platform for our sedan, which will come second, and our seven-seater. We will launch the same cars in the United States and Europe starting around the middle of 2020.The Quarterly: Those are crowded markets. How will Byton stand out? Carsten Breitfeld: We want to create enjoyable time on the move. In big cities, from Beijing to Los Angeles, most people are sitting behind the steering wheel, stuck in a traffic jam, nervous, angry, playing with their smartphones. They are not happy. What if we could change this? What if the car drives autonomously, and we create a space of well-being where you can be connected, work, be entertained, shop, whatever. Using a tablet in the middle of the steering wheel, you can do a PowerPoint presentation, browse the internet, make video calls-whatever you like. The interior is like being in your living room.The Quarterly: So the model starts with . . .? Carsten Breitfeld: It starts with a concept. In a pure electric car with pure electric architecture, you can shorten the front overhang, because you don't need it for the combustion engine. And then there's the HVAC [heating, ventilation, and air conditioning] system, which is the reason all those cars have a center console. We moved the HVAC system in front of the firewall, where that bulky engine used to be. This completely frees up space under the dashboard. We've created a much bigger interior space.Moreover, our front seats can be rotated. This makes for a more comfortable seating position and opens the view for rear-seat passengers to see the big screen we use in front. Using a tablet in the middle of the steering wheel, you can do a PowerPoint presentation, browse the internet, make video calls-whatever you like. The interior is like being in your living room. Link to Image Next up for the company following the launch of its SUV: a Byton sedan.The Quarterly: What if the user doesn't own the car? That could well be the case, couldn't it, if we share autonomous electric cars?Carsten Breitfeld: Yes. We believe there's a place for individual mobility, but more as a premium approach. Shared mobility will be so cheap and so easy that for most people it won't make sense to own. So we've made breakthroughs to make the shared experience feel individualized as well.Byton will have a facial-recognition camera. When you enter a Byton, the camera will recognize you and will download your complete profile from the Byton cloud. Your phone will be connected, your music will be there, your videos will be there, your menu structure, everything will be yours. If you leave a Byton in Toronto tonight and fly to San Francisco or Beijing, where another Byton picks you up in the morning, that one will download your last configuration in Toronto and the car will feel like yours. The device itself is like an empty smartphone. It can do everything, but only if you put content in. Byton will be the orchestrator, the manager, of an ecosystem of content.The Quarterly: Let's shift gears and talk about infrastructure. What advances are needed for this emerging mobility ecosystem? And which markets are furthest along?Carsten Breitfeld: We need two types of infrastructure. One is a charging infrastructure for electric cars. A lot is being done in China in this area; many Chinese cities decide to build charging stations and just do it. The speed from decision to execution on public charging stations is quite fast. Home charging in China is a challenge, but any new construction now has an obligation to connect every parking space to the electric grid. Existing homes will take more time to retrofit. This is difficult in China, with its density of population, but it's going to happen. If you talk charging infrastructure in the United States, it's mainly California. And it's not so great right now in Europe. Once the products are out in the market, however, there will be a pull effect, and the infrastructure will fall into place.The second type of infrastructure is about being connected, which is a bit more difficult. You need the car to have high-speed connectivity. And you need a communication network around autonomy. That means the coverage and reliability of a 5G network. Here, too, I think China is leading in terms of implementing 5G technology. As for Europe, we'll see how it develops. People there are starting to think about it.  Link to Image Electric vehicles allow for dramatic redesigns to a vehicle's interior, including more space, more comfortable seating positions, and a larger screen displayed across the dashboard.The Quarterly: How about the differences between cities and other areas. Is the mobility revolution first and foremost an urban revolution?Carsten Breitfeld: Definitely. Densely populated areas will be key. Los Angeles, Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, and such cities is where it will happen.The Quarterly: Major cities typically have mass transit. Is that a competing solution, or does it complement what you are doing?Carsten Breitfeld: They go hand in hand. For the last 130 years, cars have been beneficial for people who want to have individual mobility. But they have been a burden for society. They polluted, they took away space, they created congestion, and they produced accidents that have killed millions of people. The new technology coming up will add value to society. It will be clean. It will reduce the number of traffic accidents. It will reduce the number of cars and therefore reduce the space we need for parking. The new technology coming up will add value to society. It will be clean. It will reduce the number of traffic accidents. It will reduce the number of cars and therefore reduce the space we need for parking.The Quarterly: When will we see these developments become mainstream? Carsten Breitfeld: That's hard to say, because there are three components to the answer. First, technically, we are not so far away. A level-4 car, approaching full autonomy, can be ready in 2020 or 2021. Second, demand-wise, people need to accept the shared approach. Since people share rides on Uber and Lyft now, that may be coming, too. Third is the leading role of governments and politics. There are so many stakeholders. There's the company like ours providing product. There's the high-speed communication company. There are legal frameworks. And then there's setting up smart cities, or at least parts of cities that are considered smart.The third component will be the biggest challenge. You know, if you spent a lot of money and perhaps used Google's components, you could build a car today that came very close to level-4 autonomy. But imagine if you put this car into the middle of Beijing. It would never move! Everyone will be driving like crazy around it. But if 10 percent of the cars around it are autonomous, connected, and communicating with each other, you'd have a good start. Twenty-five percent would be better; 50 percent would be great. The best approach, I think, is to say, "OK, let's start from scratch. Let's build complete cities," or, "Let's define some areas for shared mobility." And then we can define the clear preconditions for companies to participate. That is what is going on in China to drive this technology and its infrastructure.The Quarterly: What opportunities will the future hold for automotive natives, as well as those not traditionally associated with the automotive industry? Carsten Breitfeld: The value chain of supplying mechanical parts, power trains, and so on will still have a place in the future, although those things will become more and more of a commodity. But when it comes to the smart part of the car, that's a very interesting area. We're developing big screens, high-speed connectivity, antenna modules. There will be a need for suppliers and partners to step in. Good businesses will be created by the establishment of the ecosystem around this smart device on wheels.About the authorsCarsten Breitfeld is the CEO and a cofounder of Byton.

China revokes Canadian canola permit as dispute escalatesAssociated Press Financial WireMarch 6, 2019 Wednesday 3:00 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 577 wordsDateline: WINNIPEG, Manitoba BodyWINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) - One of Canada's largest grain processors said Tuesday that China has revoked its permit to export canola there, a move that some saw as retaliation for the Canadian government's arrest of a top executive for the Chinese tech giant Huawei.China's action against Richardson International Ltd. following non-compliance notices alleging that some imports from Canada were contaminated with pests or bacteria. Canada disputes that claim."I am very concerned by what we've heard has happened to Richardson. We do not believe there's any scientific basis for this," Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said in Montreal. "We are working very, very hard with the Chinese government on this issue."The loss of the shipping permit comes as Canada is proceeding with an extradition hearing for Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, who is the daughter of Huawei's founder. She was arrested by Canada at the request of the U.S., where she is wanted on fraud charges.It wouldn't be the first time Beijing has retaliated against nations that offend it. China suspended its bilateral trade deal with Norway and restricted imports of Norwegian salmon after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Chinese political prisoner Liu Xiaobo in 2010.Britain and other countries were retaliated against over meetings with the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, considered a dangerous separatist by Beijing.Canadian Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau said in a statement that the government was closely monitoring the situation and any potential impact on Canada's agricultural trading relationship with China.She said the Canadian Food Inspection Agency conducted further investigations after China issued the notices of non-compliance on canola seed imports, including nine since January, and said the agency had not identified any pests or bacteria of concern.China is the destination for about 40 percent of Canada's canola exports, and the revocation of Richardson's permit hurts the entire value chain of industries involved in the market, the Canola Council of Canada said."We are aware of challenges our exporters have faced shipping to China - these are concerning as they create instability and add costs," council spokeswoman Heidi Dancho said by email.Dancho said that while the diplomatic frictions between China and Canada are concerning, there is no clear evidence they are related to the canola dispute.Neil Townsend, senior market analyst at FarmLink, however, said he thinks there is a definite link to the Huawei case. "There's no doubt China's mad at us," he said.Beijing has warned of serious consequences if Meng is not released. China arrested two Canadians on Dec. 10 in what was widely seen as an attempt to pressure Canada to release Meng.After Meng's arrest, a Chinese court also sentenced a Canadian to death in a sudden retrial, overturning a 15-year prison term handed down earlier.China's move hits a vital crop for western Canada, and comes after canola prices have already been hit by China's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural exports. The industry should be concerned because if China cuts back on buying it would hit prices further, Townsend said."With China kind of saying - because they're mad about the Huawei thing - they're basically saying like, "Oh, we're not going to buy any more,'" Townsend said.He said he suspects Richardson was targeted since it is the largest exporter that is fully Canadian-owned.Load-Date: March 6, 2019End of Document

From corn to Apple: What's behind the US-China standoffAssociated Press InternationalFebruary 21, 2019 Thursday 6:12 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 1343 wordsByline: By PAUL WISEMAN and MICHAEL LIEDTKE, AP Business WritersDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - To hear the Americans tell it, the Chinese have gone on a commercial crime spree, pilfering trade secrets from seed corn to electronic brains behind wind turbines. China has stripped the arm off a T-Mobile robot, the U.S. says, and looted trade secrets about robotic cars from Apple.The alleged victims of that crime spree are individual American companies, whose cases lie behind the Trump administration's core complaint in the high-level U.S.-China trade talks going on in Washington: That Beijing systematically steals American and other foreign intellectual property in a bid to become the world's technology superstar. Yet the odds of a resolution to the trade dispute this week - or anytime soon - appear dim, in part because China's drive for technology supremacy is increasingly part of its self-identity.The seven-month standoff has upset financial markets and likely weakened the global economy. The United States has imposed taxes on $250 billion in Chinese imports; Beijing has lashed back by taxing $110 billion in American products.Determined to attain dominance in cutting-edge fields from robotics to electric cars, U.S. officials charge, Beijing is not only stealing trade secrets but also pressuring American companies to hand over technology to gain access to the vast Chinese market.U.S. intelligence officials told Congress last month that China poses the biggest commercial and military threat to the United States. A separate report said Beijing will steal or copy technologies it can't make itself.Geng Shuang, a spokesman for the China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, retorted that it's "totally unreasonable to make random accusations."Beijing counters that the United States is just trying to suppress a rising competitor.U.S. business groups broadly support the Trump administration's decision to confront China over its strong-arm tech policies. But they mostly object to the administration's weapon of choice: Steep tariffs, which are taxes on importers and are usually passed on to consumers to pay.Rooting out theft could prove impossible. Beijing typically doesn't dispatch spies on missions of commercial espionage. Rather, it encourages Chinese who study and work abroad to copy or steal technology and rewards them when they do. So U.S. companies might have no reason to suspect anything - until a Chinese employee leaves and the employer discovers that trade secrets have been compromised.Most U.S. companies are reluctant to voice specific complaints about their encounters in China. Rather, most choose to speak through trade groups to avoid retribution from Chinese regulators. Last year, for example, the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China found that one in five foreign companies says it feels compelled to transfer technology to the Chinese as the price of market access.Individual examples tend to surface only when the complaints wind up in court - often in cases brought by U.S. prosecutors. Consider:- Federal prosecutors charged in an indictment unsealed last month that the Chinese tech giant Huawei stole trade secrets from U.S. cellphone company T-Mobile and offered bonuses to employees who managed to swipe technology from other companies.U.S. authorities said Huawei was obsessed with a T-Mobile robot nicknamed Tappy that could detect problems in cellphones by mimicking how people use them. T-Mobile was letting Huawei engineers into the Tappy lab to test their phones. In 2013, according to the indictment, a Huawei engineer spirited a Tappy robot arm out of the lab in a laptop bag. Questioned by T-Mobile, he returned it the next day. Prosecutors allege that the Chinese company hungered for T-Mobile technology to use on its own phone-testing robot.- Apple would collect less revenue without China, the country where its iPhone is assembled and the market that accounts for the most sales of that device outside the U.S. But a secretive project that could become a future gold mine has been infiltrated by thieves trying to steal driverless car technology for a Chinese company, according to criminal charges filed in Silicon Valley. The FBI seized the latest suspect, Apple engineer Jizhong Chen, this month after he bought a plane ticket to China.Chen and the other suspect charged in July, Xiaolang Zhang, were part of an Apple project focused on self-driving cars, according to the sworn affidavits from FBI agents. The two are accused of using their access to labs where only 1,200 of Apple's 140,000 employees were allowed to enter to steal trade secrets.Chen took dozens of photos of confidential work on an iPhone 6 Plus, according to court records. One photo was taken last June just a week after Chen attended Apple's secrecy training seminar for employees, the court records show.Zhang stored Apple's trade secrets on various devices before being caught by the company's security team last spring, the FBI alleged.The alleged theft occurred while Zhang was preparing to defect to Xiopeng Motors, or XMotors, a Chinese startup specializing in electric cars and self-driving technology. XMotors' backers include Alibaba Group, China's largest e-commerce company, and Foxconn, one of Apple's major contractors in China. Zhang was arrested last year as he prepared to board a flight to China in San Jose, California, the FBI said.The FBI also alleged that Chen was stealing Apple's trade secrets while interviewing for a job at a Chinese company that wasn't named in the court documents.Daniel Olmos, an attorney for both Chen and Zhang, has declined to comment on the allegations. Apple has said it's working with U.S. authorities on the cases.- In November, the Justice Department charged a government-owned Chinese company, Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., and co-conspirators with stealing trade secrets from the U.S. semiconductor company Micron Technology. According to the indictment, the Chinese hoped to break into the market for a technology called dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, that's used in computer electronics."China, like any advanced nation, must decide whether it wants to be a trusted partner on the world stage or whether it wants to be known around the world as a dishonest regime running a corrupt economy founded on fraud, theft and strong-arm tactics," then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions said at the time.The U.S. has barred Fujian Junhua from importing U.S. components, an action that threatens to put the Chinese company out of business.- A year ago, a Chinese company, Sinovel Wind Group, was convicted in a federal court in Wisconsin of stealing technology -the electronic brains that run wind turbines - from its American partner, AMSC, formerly known at American Superconductor Inc."We believe that over 8,000 wind turbines - an estimated 20 percent of China's fleet - are now running on AMSC's stolen software," CEO Daniel McGahn told U.S. government investigators. "AMSC has not been compensated for its losses."The damage from that betrayal was severe: American Superconductor stock lost $1 billion in value, and the company slashed 700 jobs, more than half its global workforce. It was, McGahn said, a case of "attempted corporate homicide."- A Chinese businessman, Mo Hailong, who had been caught rummaging through an Iowa cornfield was sentenced to three years in prison in 2016 for pilfering trade secrets from U.S. seed corn companies. Five years earlier, DuPont Pioneer security guards had caught Mo and other Chinese men digging in a cornfield that contained test plots of new seed corn varieties. The other suspects fled the United States before they could be arrested.Prosecutors said Mo had traveled to the Midwest while working for Kings Nower Seed, a subsidiary of the Chinese conglomerate Beijing Dabeinong Technology Group Co., to acquire corn seed and ship it to China so scientists could try to reproduce its genetic traits.___Liedtke reported from San Francisco.

Why are the US and other powers closing the doors to China's Huawei?CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 27, 2019 SundayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 886 wordsBody The possible extradition to the US of the Huawei Technologies financial director, Meng Wanzhou, has the markets on alert. His arrest in Canada in December is about the biggest skirmish between the world's second largest telephone manufacturer and Washington, which is especially concerned about the other and most important business of the firm: the technological equipment for operators in the telecommunications industry .  The problem lies in the suspicions that Huawei puts national security at risk, a threat that the House of Representatives made in 2012 for the first time.  In a report he accused her - together with her compatriot ZTE - of supporting the "espionage" efforts of the Chinese government. Since then, congressmen tried to stop the progress of the companies, which could be finalized last year. Then in February of 2018 intelligence agencies, such as the CIA, the FBI and the NSA, reignited the alarms, in August Donald Trump signed the law that banned the use of Huawei and ZTE in the government.  Following the USA  But Washington went further. According to The Wall Street Journal, the government began an international campaign to encourage its allies to stop using equipment from the Chinese manufacturer. Considering even financial incentives, sources close to the matter indicated that contacts had already been made with some countries, including Italy, Japan and Germany.  Only the first of these has not spoken about it. Meanwhile, in December it was reported that Tokyo was evaluating to follow the path of the US and ban Huawei, while in the fortnight of this month it transpired that Germany is considering blocking access to its next-generation mobile networks.  Always appealing to national security, the possibility of restricting Huawei is also being evaluated in Canada, the United Kingdom and Belgium. But Australia and New Zealand were the most severe, forbidding the company to provide 5G technology for the wireless networks of both countries.  Suspicion and defense  Precisely, the deployment of the new network, which promises to revolutionize the sector, is the backdrop to the conflict. Huawei aspires to be the leading provider in the process, compared to its biggest competitors in the field of technological equipment: Cisco and Alcatel Lucent, which worries much of the developed world.  There is a "rational fear that equipment made by Huawei can be designed with backdoors in them, to allow unauthorized access by the Chinese Communist government for the collection of intelligence and other purposes," the report explains. American Thinker's geopolitical expert, Peter Skurkiss.  Faced with growing pressure, on January 15, the firm's founder, Ren Zhengfei, broke the silence. "Huawei is an independent business organization. When it comes to cybersecurity and privacy protection, we are committed to supporting our customers. We will never harm any nation or any individual, "he told a press conference.  However, his words were not convincing enough. The nightmare for the firm continued, after Friday the European Vodafone, following the steps taken last year by the US AT & T and Verizon, decided to stop selling Huawei devices.  Countries on alert U.S After the denunciations of the congress and of intelligence agencies, in 2018 a law was signed that prohibits the use of Huawei and ZTE equipment in the government. Canada Already involved in the dispute over her arrest of the Huawei CFO, Canada said it was studying a ban on Huawei to participate in the 5G network. Australia After the United States,it was the second to impose limitations on Huawei, specifically by blocking its participation as a supplier of equipment for the 5G network. New Zealand It took the same determination from Australia, also appealing to matters of national security. UK The government has expressed "concern" about Huawei's participation in the 5G network. They would be close to vetoing their participation, since they will soon tender it.  Germany  Although the German Industry Association says there is no evidence against Huawei, the government will debate if it blocks it as a provider for the installation of the 5G network. Belgium Both the use of equipment in the government and the limitation to the 5G network, would be studied by Brussels. Japan As in the United States, there would be a ban on the use of Huawei equipment in the government.  The presence of the firm in the Chilean market  The influence of Huawei in the telecommunications industry in Chile has grown strongly in the last decade. At the network level, VTR, WOM, Movistar, Entel and Claro work with the Chinese company and have contracts. Of course, Claro and VTR point out that this occurs in photonic networks or fixed internet services. In the mobile world, companies have Huawei as a major supplier.  In addition, associated with the local firm CTR, the government tender was awarded, which subsidizes the construction of the austral fiber optic with US $ 100 million. But his most ambitious project would be to connect Chile and China through a fiber optic marine cable, for which they already had a meeting with the interior minister, Andrés Chadwick, in search of support.  The entry Why the US and other powers are closing the doors to China Huawei? it was first published in La Tercera. Load-Date: January 28, 2019End of Document

China promises greater opening of financial markets after arrival of US negotiatorsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 28, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 385 wordsBody China will drastically expand access to its markets for banks and foreign asset companies, especially in its financial services sector, Premier Li Keqiang said on Thursday, as US officials are in Beijing for trade talks.  The Chinese government has promised greater opening of its giant financial markets to foreign investors, in the midst of the trade war with the United States. The multinationals have complained for a long time that Chinese liberalization has been too restricted and that its implementation only covered certain segments of the markets.  "We are accelerating the full opening of market access for foreign investors in the banking, securities and insurance sectors," Li said in a speech at the annual Boao forum held on the Chinese island of Hainan.  The government will also work on more favorable policies for foreign investors that operate Chinese bonds, the prime minister said. Li's remarks increased speculation that China could soon announce new rules to allow foreign banks and insurers to increase their presence in the Asian nation.  The broader access to China's financial services markets is part of the US demands for Beijing's trade policies. The US president, Donald Trump, set tariffs worth billions of dollars on Chinese imports last year to force a change in Beijing's policies, which responded with more tariffs on goods from the US country.  China also offered foreign technology companies better access to the nation's cloud computing market, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. US negotiators have pressed for a relaxation of Chinese restrictions to help cloud computing services in the US, in a consensus that would help end the trade dispute.  Sources told Reuters on Wednesday that the two countries have made progress in all areas under discussion, including the sensitive issue of forced technology transfers, although differences persist over intellectual property rules and how to implement a final agreement.  White House adviser Larry Kudlow said the United States could remove some tariffs if a trade agreement was approved, while other tariffs would continue to be applied to ensure that Beijing embraces the pacts.  The entry China promises greater opening of financial markets after the arrival of US negotiators was first published in La Tercera. Load-Date: March 29, 2019End of Document

China: No evidence Huawei a national security threatAssociated Press InternationalFebruary 13, 2019 Wednesday 11:06 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 517 wordsByline: By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - U.S. and other countries have not presented any conclusive evidence that Chinese telecoms gear maker Huawei Technologies threatens their national security and are merely stirring fears out of self-interest, a Chinese government spokeswoman said Wednesday.Huawei's critics are conjuring up threats and misusing state power to "suppress the legitimate development rights and interests of Chinese enterprises" and are "using political means to intervene in the economy," said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying."All countries should deal with relevant matters in an objective, comprehensive, rational, and correct manner, rather than fabricating excuses of all kinds for one's own pursuit of interest at the cost of others, which is quite hypocritical, immoral, and unfair," Hua said.Hua's comments at a daily briefing were some of the sharpest yet in a growing feud over Washington's drive to convince other nations to shut Huawei out of their markets due to national security concerns.Huawei is the world's biggest supplier of network gear used by phone and internet companies. It insists that it is independent and poses no threat to the security of others, but has long been seen by some as a front for spying by the Chinese military or security services.On that basis, the United States, Australia, Japan and some other governments have imposed curbs on use of Huawei technology, including smart phones.On Tuesday in Poland, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo renewed a warning that the United States may be forced to scale back certain operations in Europe and elsewhere if countries continue to do business with Huawei.Pompeo said the U.S. had strong concerns about Huawei's motives in Europe, especially in NATO and European Union member states, as well as its business practices."We've made known the risks that are associated with that, risks to private information of citizens of the country, risks that comes from having that technology installed in network systems," he said.The U.S. warnings about the risks of Chinese telecom technology come as governments are choosing providers for the rollout of 5G wireless internet, which will enable faster download speeds along with greater connectivity among devices.U.S. officials argue that under Chinese security laws companies such as Huawei or ZTE could be compelled to hand over data or access to Chinese intelligence.Hua said such concerns were based on provisions of China's national intelligence law that differ little from similar legislation in other countries."It is an international practice to maintain national security with legislation and to require organizations and individuals to cooperate with national intelligence work," Hua said.Lacking solid evidence, the U.S. "keeps making up crimes and churning out various threat theories," Hua said."We believe that this is very hypocritical, unfair and immoral," she said. All nations, Hua said, have an obligation to "abide by the market principle of free and fair competition and truly safeguard the market environment of fairness, justice and non-discrimination."Load-Date: February 14, 2019End of Document

China posts slowest economic growth since 1990CNN WireJanuary 21, 2019 Monday 4:40 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 497 wordsByline: By Daniel Shane, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  China's economy grew at its slowest pace in almost three decades last year.The world's second biggest economy expanded 6.6% in 2018, according to official data published Monday. That's the weakest annual performance since 1990.Chinese growth has lost momentum following government efforts to try to rein in high levels of debt. It has also started feeling the effects of the trade war with the United States, which has resulted in new tariffs on more than $250 billion of Chinese exports.The deteriorating situation in a market that businesses around the world rely upon for growth is having a widespread impact. It has spooked investors and prompted warnings from top companies like Apple (AAPL).Economic growth in China slowed to 6.4% in the fourth quarter of last year, according to Monday's data, in line with economist's predictions. Stocks listed in Shanghai and Hong Kong rose modestly after the figures were published. Ken Cheung, a strategist at investment bank Mizuho, said investors were relieved that nothing in the data suggested China's slowdown was worse than previously thought.Economic growth is expected to drop closer to 6% this year. But many analysts are skeptical about the accuracy of the government figures and say growth may be significantly lower in reality.How much can Beijing do?Plenty of other indicators have been flashing red. In December, Chinese exports suffered a surprise decline, while annual car sales fell in 2018 for the first time in around 20 years.Beijing announced 1.3 trillion yuan ($193 billion) worth of new measures this month that are designed to stimulate the economy, including tax cuts for small businesses and reduced tariffs. It's the latest in a flurry of government efforts to prop up growth, such as boosting infrastructure spending and loosening monetary policy.But experts question whether Beijing's measures will be enough to return the economy to strong growth anytime soon. And there are risks things could get worse in the meantime.Beijing and Washington are trying to negotiate an end to their trade dispute, but it remains unclear if they'll reach a deal. If they don't, more punishing tariffs loom. There's also a danger the Chinese government's stimulus measures will fail to have the desired effect, according to Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at research firm Oxford Economics. "We think growth will remain under pressure in the coming months," he said in a note to clients Monday.Chinese officials are emphasizing that the economy remains broadly stable.Ning Jizhe, head of China's statistics bureau, said at a news conference Monday that the trade war had weighed on the economy but that "the impact is still under our control."Global conditions this year will "be more complicated and severe," he added, but China's economy "will move forward with stability."Nanlin Fang contributed to this report. TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

From corn to Apple: The cases behind the US-China standoffAssociated Press Financial WireJanuary 31, 2019 Thursday 7:27 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 1348 wordsByline: By PAUL WISEMAN and MICHAEL LIEDTKE, AP Business WritersDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - To hear the Americans tell it, the Chinese have gone on a commercial crime spree, pilfering trade secrets from seed corn to electronic brains behind wind turbines. China has stripped the arm off a T-Mobile robot, the U.S. says, and looted trade secrets about robotic cars from Apple.The alleged victims of that crime spree are individual American companies, whose cases lie behind the Trump administration's core complaint in the high-level U.S.-China trade talks going on in Washington: That Beijing systematically steals American and other foreign intellectual property in a bid to become the world's technology superstar. Yet the odds of a resolution to the trade dispute this week - or anytime soon - appear dim, in part because China's drive for technology supremacy is increasingly part of its self-identity.The six-month standoff has shaken financial markets and likely weakened the global economy. The United States has imposed taxes on $250 billion in Chinese imports; Beijing has lashed back by taxing $110 billion in American products.Determined to attain dominance in cutting-edge fields from robotics to electric cars, U.S. officials charge, Beijing is not only stealing trade secrets but also pressuring American companies to hand over technology to gain access to the vast Chinese market.U.S. intelligence officials told Congress this week that China poses the biggest commercial and military threat to the United States. A separate report this week said Beijing will steal or copy technologies it can't make itself.Geng Shuang, a spokesman for the China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, retorted that it's "totally unreasonable to make random accusations."Beijing counters that the United States is just trying to suppress a rising competitor.U.S. business groups broadly support the Trump administration's decision to confront China over its strong-arm tech policies. But they mostly object to the administration's weapon of choice: Steep tariffs, which are taxes on importers and are usually passed on to consumers to pay.Rooting out theft could prove impossible. Beijing typically doesn't dispatch spies on missions of commercial espionage. Rather, it encourages Chinese who study and work abroad to copy or steal technology and rewards them when they do. So U.S. companies might have no reason to suspect anything - until a Chinese employee leaves and the employer discovers that trade secrets have been compromised.Most U.S. companies are reluctant to voice specific complaints about their encounters in China. Rather, most choose to speak through trade groups to avoid retribution from Chinese regulators. Last year, for example, the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China found that one in five foreign companies says it feels compelled to transfer technology to the Chinese as the price of market access.Individual examples tend to surface only when the complaints wind up in court - often in cases brought by U.S. prosecutors. Consider:- Federal prosecutors charged in an indictment unsealed this week that the Chinese tech giant Huawei stole trade secrets from U.S. cellphone company T-Mobile and offered bonuses to employees who managed to swipe technology from other companies.U.S. authorities said Huawei was obsessed with a T-Mobile robot nicknamed Tappy that could detect problems in cellphones by mimicking how people use them. T-Mobile was letting Huawei engineers into the Tappy lab to test their phones. In 2013, according to the indictment, a Huawei engineer spirited a Tappy robot arm out of the lab in a laptop bag. Questioned by T-Mobile, he returned it the next day. Prosecutors allege that the Chinese company hungered for T-Mobile technology to use on its own phone-testing robot.- Apple would collect less revenue without China, the country where its iPhone is assembled and the market that accounts for the most sales of that device outside the U.S. But a secretive project that could become a future gold mine has been infiltrated by thieves trying to steal driverless car technology for a Chinese company, according to criminal charges filed in Silicon Valley. The FBI seized the latest suspect, Apple engineer Jizhong Chen, this month after he bought a plane ticket to China.Chen and the other suspect charged in July, Xiaolang Zhang, were part of an Apple project focused on self-driving cars, according to the sworn affidavits from FBI agents. The two are accused of using their access to labs where only 1,200 of Apple's 140,000 employees were allowed to enter to steal trade secrets.Chen took dozens of photos of confidential work on an iPhone 6 Plus, according to court records. One photo was taken last June just a week after Chen attended Apple's secrecy training seminar for employees, the court records show.Zhang stored Apple's trade secrets on various devices before being caught by the company's security team last spring, the FBI alleged.The alleged theft occurred while Zhang was preparing to defect to Xiopeng Motors, or XMotors, a Chinese startup specializing in electric cars and self-driving technology. XMotors' backers include Alibaba Group, China's largest e-commerce company, and Foxconn, one of Apple's major contractors in China. Zhang was arrested last year as he prepared to board a flight to China in San Jose, California, the FBI said.The FBI also alleged that Chen was stealing Apple's trade secrets while interviewing for a job at a Chinese company that wasn't named in the court documents.Daniel Olmos, an attorney for both Chen and Zhang, declined to comment on the allegations. Apple said it's working with U.S. authorities on the cases, both of which remain open.- In November, the Justice Department charged a government-owned Chinese company, Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., and co-conspirators with stealing trade secrets from the U.S. semiconductor company Micron Technology. According to the indictment, the Chinese hoped to break into the market for a technology called dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, that's used in computer electronics."China, like any advanced nation, must decide whether it wants to be a trusted partner on the world stage or whether it wants to be known around the world as a dishonest regime running a corrupt economy founded on fraud, theft and strong-arm tactics," then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions said at the time.The U.S. has barred Fujian Junhua from importing U.S. components, an action that threatens to put the Chinese company out of business.- A year ago, a Chinese company, Sinovel Wind Group, was convicted in a federal court in Wisconsin of stealing technology - the electronic brains that run wind turbines - from its American partner, AMSC, formerly known at American Superconductor Inc."We believe that over 8,000 wind turbines - an estimated 20 percent of China's fleet - are now running on AMSC's stolen software," CEO Daniel McGahn told U.S. government investigators. "AMSC has not been compensated for its losses."The damage from that betrayal was severe: American Superconductor stock lost $1 billion in value, and the company slashed 700 jobs, more than half its global workforce. It was, McGahn said, a case of "attempted corporate homicide."- A Chinese businessman, Mo Hailong, who had been caught rummaging through an Iowa cornfield was sentenced to three years in prison in 2016 for pilfering trade secrets from U.S. seed corn companies.

Rather, most choose to speak through trade groups to avoid retribution from Chinese regulators. Last year, for example, the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China found that one in five foreign companies says it feels compelled to transfer technology to the Chinese as the price of market access.Individual examples tend to surface only when the complaints wind up in court - often in cases brought by U.S. prosecutors. Consider:- Federal prosecutors charged in an indictment unsealed this week that the Chinese tech giant Huawei stole trade secrets from U.S. cellphone company T-Mobile and offered bonuses to employees who managed to swipe technology from other companies.U.S. authorities said Huawei was obsessed with a T-Mobile robot nicknamed Tappy that could detect problems in cellphones by mimicking how people use them. T-Mobile was letting Huawei engineers into the Tappy lab to test their phones. In 2013, according to the indictment, a Huawei engineer spirited a Tappy robot arm out of the lab in a laptop bag. Questioned by T-Mobile, he returned it the next day. Prosecutors allege that the Chinese company hungered for T-Mobile technology to use on its own phone-testing robot.- Apple would collect less revenue without China, the country where its iPhone is assembled and the market that accounts for the most sales of that device outside the U.S. But a secretive project that could become a future gold mine has been infiltrated by thieves trying to steal driverless car technology for a Chinese company, according to criminal charges filed in Silicon Valley. The FBI seized the latest suspect, Apple engineer Jizhong Chen, this month after he bought a plane ticket to China.Chen and the other suspect charged in July, Xiaolang Zhang, were part of an Apple project focused on self-driving cars, according to the sworn affidavits from FBI agents. The two are accused of using their access to labs where only 1,200 of Apple's 140,000 employees were allowed to enter to steal trade secrets.Chen took dozens of photos of confidential work on an iPhone 6 Plus, according to court records. One photo was taken last June just a week after Chen attended Apple's secrecy training seminar for employees, the court records show.Zhang stored Apple's trade secrets on various devices before being caught by the company's security team last spring, the FBI alleged.The alleged theft occurred while Zhang was preparing to defect to Xiopeng Motors, or XMotors, a Chinese startup specializing in electric cars and self-driving technology. XMotors' backers include Alibaba Group, China's largest e-commerce company, and Foxconn, one of Apple's major contractors in China. Zhang was arrested last year as he prepared to board a flight to China in San Jose, California, the FBI said.The FBI also alleged that Chen was stealing Apple's trade secrets while interviewing for a job at a Chinese company that wasn't named in the court documents.Daniel Olmos, an attorney for both Chen and Zhang, declined to comment on the allegations. Apple said it's working with U.S. authorities on the cases, both of which remain open.- In November, the Justice Department charged a government-owned Chinese company, Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., and co-conspirators with stealing trade secrets from the U.S. semiconductor company Micron Technology. According to the indictment, the Chinese hoped to break into the market for a technology called dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, that's used in computer electronics."China, like any advanced nation, must decide whether it wants to be a trusted partner on the world stage or whether it wants to be known around the world as a dishonest regime running a corrupt economy founded on fraud, theft and strong-arm tactics," then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions said at the time.The U.S. has barred Fujian Junhua from importing U.S. components, an action that threatens to put the Chinese company out of business.- A year ago, a Chinese company, Sinovel Wind Group, was convicted in a federal court in Wisconsin of stealing technology - the electronic brains that run wind turbines - from its American partner, AMSC, formerly known at American Superconductor Inc."We believe that over 8,000 wind turbines - an estimated 20 percent of China's fleet - are now running on AMSC's stolen software," CEO Daniel McGahn told U.S. government investigators. "AMSC has not been compensated for its losses."The damage from that betrayal was severe: American Superconductor stock lost $1 billion in value, and the company slashed 700 jobs, more than half its global workforce.

From corn to Apple: The cases behind the US-China standoffAssociated Press InternationalJanuary 31, 2019 Thursday 7:28 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: WASHINGTON DATELINELength: 1348 wordsByline: By PAUL WISEMAN and MICHAEL LIEDTKE, AP Business WritersDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - To hear the Americans tell it, the Chinese have gone on a commercial crime spree, pilfering trade secrets from seed corn to electronic brains behind wind turbines. China has stripped the arm off a T-Mobile robot, the U.S. says, and looted trade secrets about robotic cars from Apple.The alleged victims of that crime spree are individual American companies, whose cases lie behind the Trump administration's core complaint in the high-level U.S.-China trade talks going on in Washington: That Beijing systematically steals American and other foreign intellectual property in a bid to become the world's technology superstar. Yet the odds of a resolution to the trade dispute this week - or anytime soon - appear dim, in part because China's drive for technology supremacy is increasingly part of its self-identity.The six-month standoff has shaken financial markets and likely weakened the global economy. The United States has imposed taxes on $250 billion in Chinese imports; Beijing has lashed back by taxing $110 billion in American products.Determined to attain dominance in cutting-edge fields from robotics to electric cars, U.S. officials charge, Beijing is not only stealing trade secrets but also pressuring American companies to hand over technology to gain access to the vast Chinese market.U.S. intelligence officials told Congress this week that China poses the biggest commercial and military threat to the United States. A separate report this week said Beijing will steal or copy technologies it can't make itself.Geng Shuang, a spokesman for the China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, retorted that it's "totally unreasonable to make random accusations."Beijing counters that the United States is just trying to suppress a rising competitor.U.S. business groups broadly support the Trump administration's decision to confront China over its strong-arm tech policies. But they mostly object to the administration's weapon of choice: Steep tariffs, which are taxes on importers and are usually passed on to consumers to pay.Rooting out theft could prove impossible. Beijing typically doesn't dispatch spies on missions of commercial espionage. Rather, it encourages Chinese who study and work abroad to copy or steal technology and rewards them when they do. So U.S. companies might have no reason to suspect anything - until a Chinese employee leaves and the employer discovers that trade secrets have been compromised.Most U.S. companies are reluctant to voice specific complaints about their encounters in China.

No word on progress after 2nd day of China-US trade talksAssociated Press InternationalJanuary 8, 2019 Tuesday 11:07 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 740 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Talks between the U.S. and China on ending their tariff war were ending their second day Tuesday without word on whether they've made any progress, as an official newspaper warned not to push Beijing too hard.China is strong and has its own needs, said the Global Times, published by the ruling Communist Party. Washington "cannot push China too far" and must avoid a situation that "spins out of control."Negotiators began the talks Monday on the trade war launched by President Donald Trump in July with tariff hikes on Chinese goods in response to complaints that Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology.Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed on Dec. 1 to postpone more tariff hikes on each other's goods for 90 days while they negotiate. But neither side appears to have budged, and economists say three months is too little time to resolve issues that have disrupted U.S.-Chinese relations for years.Washington is pressing Beijing for changes including rolling back plans for government-led creation of Chinese global champions in robotics and other fields. Europe, Japan and other trading partners echo Washington's complaints that those violate Beijing's market-opening obligations.Chinese officials have suggested Beijing might alter its industrial plans but they have rejected pressure to abandon their blueprint for greater prosperity and global influence. They have tried to defuse pressure for more sweeping change by offering concessions including purchasing more American soybeans, natural gas and other exports."China would need to significantly recalibrate its industrial policies to fully meet the U.S. trade team's demands," Nick Marro of the Economist Intelligence Unit said in a report. "The limited policy movement that we've seen so far suggests that a game-changing deal remains unlikely."Also Tuesday, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un arrived in Beijing in a possible effort to coordinate with the North's only major ally ahead of a possible meeting with Trump. U.S. and North Korean officials are believed to have met in Vietnam to discuss a location.A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman rejected suggestions that Kim's visit was intended as a bargaining chip during the trade talks.China's position on trade is "transparent and the U.S. side is well aware of it," said Lu Kang. "China does not need to use any other tactics."As the talks began Monday at the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, Beijing complained about a U.S. warship in what it said were Chinese waters, but it was unclear whether that would disrupt the proceedings. Both sides have provided scant information about their discussions.The talks went ahead despite tensions over the arrest of a Chinese tech executive in Canada on U.S. charges related to possible violations of trade sanctions against Iran.The American delegation is led by a deputy U.S. trade representative, Jeffrey D. Gerrish, and includes agriculture, energy, commerce, treasury and State Department officials.Trump imposed tariff increases of up to 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese imports. China responded by imposing penalties on $110 billion of American goods, slowing customs clearance for U.S. companies and suspending issuing licenses in finance and other businesses.The Global Times commentary said China's growing economy means it can "carry out a more intense boycott" of trade with the United States if needed.Beijing's growing commercial and political ties with its neighbors will make it harder for Washington to find Asian countries willing to help it try to "contain China," the newspaper said.Still, cooling economic growth in both countries is increasing pressure to reach a settlement.Chinese growth fell to a post-global crisis low of 6.5 percent in the quarter ending in September. Auto sales tumbled 16 percent in November over a year earlier. Weak real estate sales are forcing developers to cut prices.The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in the third quarter and unemployment is at a five-decade low. But surveys show consumer confidence is weakening because of concern growth will slow this year.For their part, Chinese officials are unhappy with U.S. curbs on exports of "dual use" technology with possible military applications. They complain China's companies are treated unfairly in national security reviews of proposed corporate acquisitions, though almost all deals are approved unchanged.Load-Date: January 9, 2019End of Document

Canadian Government allows Huawei CFO's extradition process to go forwardCNN WireMarch 1, 2019 Friday 8:04 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 406 wordsByline: By Jill Disis, CNN BusinessDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  Canadian authorities have cleared the way for a hearing to extradite Huawei's chief financial officer to the United States. Justice officials in Canada on Friday issued an authority for the case involving Meng Wanzhou to proceed, setting the stage for another court appearance Wednesday. The announcement had been expected.Meng was arrested last December in Canada at the request of the United States, which claimed she helped the Chinese telecom company circumvent US sanctions in Iran. She was released in Canada on bail of 10 million Canadian dollars ($7.5 million US). She will appear in court again Wednesday in Vancouver, at which time an extradition hearing will be scheduled. That eventual hearing could result in her extradition to New York.Canadian justice officials said the department's decision Friday followed a "thorough and diligent review" of the evidence in the case. The department said it was "satisfied" that there was "sufficient evidence" for the case to be put before a judge.Meng will not be found guilty or innocent during her extradition hearing. If the judge decides she should be extradited, then the country's minister of justice --- its highest-ranking judicial official --- will have the final decision.If Meng is extradited to the United States, she will face trial there. The Huawei executive's arrest has led to a diplomatic standoff between the Chinese and Canadian governments. China has furiously called for Canada to return Meng, and multiple Canadians in China were subsequently detained. Canada has said it's just following the letter of its extradition agreement with the United States.The case is one of several ways the United States is trying to put pressure on Huawei. The US government claims Huawei's technology poses a national security threat.For example, Friday's announcement came a day after Huawei pleaded not guilty in Seattle to federal charges that it tried to steal trade secrets from T-Mobile. A judge set a trial in that case for March 2, 2020. How the cases figure into ongoing trade negotiations between the United States and China remains an open question.President Donald Trump has suggested that he could consider the cases against Huawei as part of ongoing trade talks with China.-- CNN's Paula Newton and CNN Business' Julia Horowitz contributed to this story.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

China's premier denies Beijing tells companies to spyAssociated Press InternationalMarch 15, 2019 Friday 12:36 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 901 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - China's No. 2 leader denied that Beijing tells its tech companies to spy abroad and promised Friday to treat foreign and domestic competitors equally in an effort to defuse tensions with Washington and Europe.Premier Li Keqiang's rejection of spying accusations at a news conference was the Communist government's highest-level effort yet to put Western security concerns to rest. They threaten Chinese access to lucrative markets for telecom and other technology."This is not how China behaves. We did not do that and will not do that in the future," the premier said when asked whether Beijing told Chinese companies to spy on foreign countries.The United States, Australia and some other governments have imposed curbs on use of technology from Chinese vendors including Huawei Technologies Ltd. on security grounds. Washington is lobbying European and other allies to shun Huawei as their phone carriers prepare to invest billions of dollars in next-generation technology.Huawei, the biggest global maker of network gear, has denied it facilitates Chinese spying. Its founder has told reporters he would reject official requests to disclose customer secrets.President Xi Jinping's government faces mounting pressure to repair trade relations with the United States, Europe and other major markets after last year's economic growth fell to a three-decade low of 6.6 percent. Activity has weakened further on multiple fronts including cooling export growth and a contraction in auto sales.Li promised to create a "level playing field" for all competitors in China's state-dominated economy. He pledged to open more industries to foreign investment but gave no details."We will adhere to the principle of neutrality and treat domestic and foreign companies as equals," he said.Also Friday, the country's ceremonial legislature endorsed a law aimed at defusing a tariff war with Washington by discouraging Chinese officials from pressuring companies to hand over technology.The measure is part of an investment law that aims to address complaints that China's system is rigged against foreign companies."This is designed to protect the rights and interests of foreign investors and attract more foreign investment," Li said.It was unclear whether the measure would mollify President Donald Trump, who raised U.S. duties on Chinese imports in response to complaints Beijing steals or pressures companies to give up technology.Washington also wants China to roll back plans for government-led creation of global competitors in robotics and other technologies.The new law is "vague enough that it allows for state-led industrial policy to continue behind the scenes," Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report.Both governments say negotiations are making progress but they have yet to announce formal agreements on ending the dispute that has disrupted trade in soybeans, medical equipment and billions of dollars' worth of other goods.The official Xinhua News Agency said China's economy czar, Vice Premier Liu He, talked by phone with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The one-sentence report said they made "further substantial progress" but gave no details.Forecasters expect Chinese economic activity to pick up in the quarter that starts in April as government stimulus efforts through higher spending on public works construction gain traction.That spending "will be enough to put a floor beneath economic growth by the second half of this year, but not enough to drive a strong rebound," Evans-Pritchard said.Government plans also call for higher spending on development of technologies including artificial intelligence, electric cars, biotechnology and new materials that China's leaders see as a path to prosperity and global influence.China's emergence as a competitor in smartphones, solar power and other technologies has increased consumer choice and helped to drive down prices. But it rattles Washington and other governments that worry Chinese competition threatens their industries and employment.The government says the investment law will prohibit Chinese officials from using "administrative methods to force technology transfers."Foreign business groups welcomed that but said they need to see how the law is enforced to know whether it improves conditions.The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China expressed concern Friday the law would permit regulators to retaliate against companies from a country they believe discriminates against a Chinese enterprise.That "allows for political issues to influence" regulatory decisions, a chamber statement said. It said the law's "vague wording" adds to "legal uncertainty" for companies.The American Chamber of Commerce in China expressed concern in a statement Wednesday about the broad scope of "national security reviews" allowed by the law that might block business activity.The European chamber also expressed concern the focus on "administrative methods" might leave officials free to use other pressure tactics.Chinese officials deny companies are required to hand over technology. But the companies face pressure including requirements in auto manufacturing, pharmaceuticals and other industries to work through state-owned partners. That requires them to share technology with companies the ruling Communist Party hopes will become their competitors.Load-Date: March 16, 2019End of Document

Cambodia, China to Kick Off Annual Joint Military Exercise Amid Waning Western InfluenceASEAN TribuneFebruary 27, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 ASEAN Tribune All Rights ReservedLength: 857 wordsBody 27 February 2019 (Washington DC 20036) Cambodia and China will kick off preparations for their third annual joint 'Golden Dragon' military exercise on Feb. 28, Cambodia's National Defense Ministry announced Wednesday, highlighting improved ties between the two countries as Western influence in the Southeast Asian nation wanes.In a post to his Facebook account, Ministry of National Defense spokesman Chhum Socheat said that more than 250 Chinese and 2,500 Cambodian military personnel will attend the drill, held at the Chum Kiri Military Shooting Range Training Field in Kampot province's Chum Kiri district.After two weeks of rehearsals, the 15-day exercise will begin with a March 13 opening ceremony attended by Royal Cambodian Armed (RCAF) Commander-in-chief General Vong Pisen and end with a March 27 closing ceremony overseen by Defense Minister General Tea Banh, the post said.'This military exercise reflects the government's stance that the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces implement the national defense policy between Cambodia and China and for cooperation in all sectors,' Chhum Socheat said.'This drill will also focus on exchanging experience in humanitarian and natural disaster rescue operations, as well as combatting terrorism and peacekeeping.'According to Chhum Socheat, the exercise will involve 'important military equipment' including armored trucks, tanks, and helicopters, as well as artillery and mortars.This year's Golden Dragon exercise is the third and largest joint Cambodia-China military drills to be held on Cambodian soil since Cambodia's Defense Ministry abruptly suspended annual 'Angkor Sentinel' joint exercises with the U.S. military and abandoned counter-terrorism training exercises with the Australian military in 2017.The government had claimed it was too busy preparing security for commune elections in June last year to take part in the exercises, but they have yet to be reestablished.Observers said at the time that the moves indicated Cambodia was pivoting away from Western influence in favor of better relations with other countries on the rise in Asia, such as China.Chhum Socheat's Facebook post on Wednesday gave no indication of what portion of Cambodia's budget had been allocated to holding the Golden Dragon exercise, or whether China was footing the bill.Calls to Chhum Socheat went unanswered on Wednesday, while Tea Banh refused to comment on the exercise when contacted by RFA's Khmer Service, saying he was busy in a meeting.The Defense Ministry spokesman's announcement came as Prime Minister Hun Sen's son, RCAF army commander Lieutenant General Hun Manet, visits Beijing to promote cooperation between the militaries of Cambodia and China.Hun Manet has met with several military officials during the five-day trip, which began on Monday and came at the invitation of the Chinese government.In addition to bolstering ties between the two militaries, the Lieutenant General also discussed the Golden Dragon exercise with Chinese officials, a reports said, without providing details.Speaking with RFA on Wednesday, international affairs expert Em Sovannara said Cambodia would do 'better to reauthorize' military exercises with the U.S. and Australia to dispel any suggestion that it is 'tilting towards China.''As far as the need to enhance national defense is concerned, I think it is necessary for Cambodia to conduct joint military exercises with China,' he said.'However, Cambodia should balance its foreign policy to ensure that it does not appear to be leaning too much in favor of China. It would be wise if Cambodia resumes joint military exercises with other countries as well, like Australia and the U.S.'Naval baseThe Golden Dragon exercise comes amid speculation that Beijing is building a 45,000 hectare (111,200-acre) naval base in Cambodia's Koh Kong province, based on a Nov. 15 report by Hong Kong's Asia Times online news portal, which cited unnamed diplomatic sources.Hun Sen later dismissed the report, saying such a move would violate the constitution, while Cambodia's Ministry of National Defense called it 'fake news' and part of a 'foreign campaign to mislead the public and the international community with the intention of destroying the country's independence and neutrality.'If such a naval base were built on the Gulf of Thailand, it would allow China to significantly expand patrols on the South China Sea, which Beijing claims much of, while rival Taiwan and ASEAN countries Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam have their own stakes in the waters.Earlier this month, Chhum Socheat rejected the U.S. intelligence assessment in an interview with RFA's Khmer Service, saying it had no merit.But analysts have said the assessment 'has solid foundation' and that Hun Sen may be willing to amend the constitution to allow a Chinese military presence in Cambodia.Trade volume between Cambodia and China was valued at U.S. $5.8 billion in 2017, up 22 percent from U.S. $4.76 billion dollars a year earlier, while China is currently Cambodia's largest investor, and has poured U.S. $12.6 billion into the Southeast Asian nation from 1994 to 2017.Load-Date: February 28, 2019End of Document

Huawei tries to reverse the US blockadeCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 22, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 826 wordsBody HONG KONG (CNN) - Chinese tech giant Huawei faces a new attack as it tries to persuade the UK government to help build super-fast 5G networks in the country.  Apparently, top UK cybersecurity officials are confident they can handle any risk from Huawei's telecommunications equipment, but a report released on Wednesday by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a major safety studies center, said that would be a mistake.  "Allowing Huawei's participation is, in the best of cases, naive, at worst, irresponsible," the report said, suggesting that such a move could compromise the communications infrastructure of the United Kingdom.  The US government is pressuring its allies around the world to prevent wireless operators from buying Huawei equipment for the 5G networks they are beginning to build. US officials say the company's technology could be used by Chinese intelligence agencies to spy.  Huawei and the Chinese government have repeatedly denied accusations by the United States. Huawei did not respond to requests for comments on Wednesday.  Zeng Rong, spokesman for the Chinese embassy in the United Kingdom, said in a statement that "discrediting a company without concrete evidence is deceptive to the public, violates trade rules and damages commercial confidence."  "The right approach is to be rational with foreign companies and support fair competition," he added.  The launch of the report comes days after the Financial Times reported that the National Cybersecurity Center in the United Kingdom had concluded that the risks of using Huawei equipment in 5G networks could be managed.  The UK government, a key US intelligence and security ally, is expected to decide this spring which providers can provide technology for 5G networks. If you decide to allow the use of Huawei equipment, it could seriously undermine the US campaign against the company and influence other governments that are weighing the way to handle the problem.  The Department of Culture, Media and Sports in the United Kingdom said in a statement earlier this week that it was "analyzing a range of options" and that "no decision has been made".  'A rigorous advance of China's interests'  The RUSI report - drafted by former diplomat Charles Parton, who spent 22 years working in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan - warned that the UK government should remain alert to interference from the Chinese government on several fronts, including political and the investigation.  Britain is a particularly attractive target for interference, being a close ally of the United States with a large ethnic Chinese community and an open and advanced economy, said Parton.  "The interference of Beijing is not aimed at upsetting the West, but represents a rigorous and relentless advance of China's interests and values at the expense of those of the West," he wrote.  Australia and New Zealand have already prevented mobile operators from using equipment from Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer, for security reasons.  The United States has made it clear that any country that uses Huawei will find limited opportunities to work with Washington. In a speech in Munich on Saturday, Vice President Mike Pence described the company as a "threat".  "Chinese law requires them to provide the vast security apparatus of Beijingaccess to any information that touches their networks or equipment, "said Pence.  The RUSI report came to a similar conclusion, saying that, although Huawei is a private company, China's national security laws require cooperation with the authorities when requested.  "The Huawei Chinese staff has no choice but to accede to the requests of the ministries of the Chinese government," says the report.  The Chinese government has denied that it will demand access to Huawei's technology to spy, and the company said it would reject such request.  Intelligence ties at risk  If the UK government approves the use of Huawei technology in 5G networks, nearby allies may be less willing to work with the country in the future, the RUSI report warned.  Britain is part of the intelligence exchange group known as Five Eyes, which also includes the United States, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.  "The maintenance of a 'Five Eyes Standard' of cybersecurity in telecommunications is a vital strategic and security interest, whose loss would go far beyond a reduction in the exchange of intelligence reports, and could lead the United Kingdom to be excluded from work to develop future technologies for the collection of intelligence data, "the report said.  He also advised to devote more resources to the protection of British universities, where technology of interest to Beijing could be developed.  "Ultimately, the objective of the United Kingdom must be a genuine reciprocity and an equitable, mature and comprehensive relationship with China," the report said.  Jethro Mullen contributed to this article. Load-Date: February 22, 2019End of Document

The US wants to halt Huawei's global advance. It may be too lateCNN WireJanuary 30, 2019 Wednesday 1:39 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1566 wordsByline: Analysis by Sherisse Pham, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Huawei's rise as a global tech company is under threat as an increasing number of governments express concern that its technology could be used by Chinese spies. But the US-led campaign against the Chinese company may do little more than act as a brake on growth, given the dominant position Huawei has already built in fifth generation (5G) wireless technology. It has loyal customers in emerging markets and parts of Europe, and expects to become the world's top smartphone seller by next year. "This campaign will only slow Huawei's business growth in some countries in European and Asia Pacific markets," said Charlie Dai, an analyst with research firm Forrester based in Beijing. "But I don't think it's going to retreat from any market at all in the foreseeable future." Huawei's global dominance has raised alarm bells in the United States, which has accused the company of selling products that the Chinese government could use for spying. The latest move against the company came on Monday, when the US Justice Department filed criminal charges that accuse Huawei of stealing trade secrets, obstruction of justice, bank fraud and evading US sanctions on Iran. Huawei denies the charges. "Suspicion of Huawei runs deep and there is a bipartisan, whole of government campaign in Washington to take down this company, not just in the United States, but around the world," said Samm Sacks, a cybersecurity policy and China digital economy fellow at the New America think tank.The assault on Huawei's business reflects the increasingly bitter rivalry between Beijing and Washington over who will control the technologies of the future. There is particular concern about the security of 5G because it will be used to carry vast amounts of data, connecting robots, autonomous vehicles and other sensitive devices. If the US government decides to escalate the fight still further by preventing Huawei buying US-made parts, as it did with another Chinese tech company ZTE last year, it could inflict substantial damage. "Huawei is less dependent on US suppliers than ZTE, but without access to US technologies, even it will not survive long," Dan Wang, an analyst at research firm Gavekal wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.For now, though, the Chinese company remains in a strong position to lead the rollout of 5G networks. Huawei says it has signed 30 contracts for 5G, and is working with more than 50 wireless carriers on commercial tests. It is also one of the top owners of 5G patents. Huawei has spent decades building a strong presence in scores of markets around the world, helped by reliable hardware and competitive pricing. It is the world's No. 1 telecommunications equipment maker, despite being effectively shut out of the US market, and last year overtook Apple (AAPL) as the second biggest supplier of smartphones. It expects to overtake Samsung by 2020. The company denies that its products are a risk to national security. It also maintains that it is a privately owned company with no ties to the Chinese government. Its international reputation, however, is taking a beating.Huawei prepares for tougher timesPolish authorities detained a Huawei executive this month on allegations of spying for the Chinese government. The company fired the employee shortly after the arrest, saying his actions had brought Huawei into "disrepute." In December, Canada arrested Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou at the request of US prosecutors. The United States is seeking her extradition on allegations she helped the company dodge US sanctions on Iran. Meng, the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, denies any wrongdoing. In recent months, Australia and New Zealand have restricted Huawei from providing equipment for 5G networks. Germany and Canada are considering similar measures. Top global mobile carrier Vodafone is pausing the deployment of Huawei equipment in core networks in Europe while it speaks with authorities and the company. In the United Kingdom, Huawei is already monitored by a government oversight panel that warned last summer of new risks. The company says it's working to address them. But the pressure has gone beyond the telecoms industry, with organizations such as Oxford University saying they will stop accepting money from Huawei. Prominent American universities are also distancing themselves from the company's funding and equipment. Huawei's leaders accept that the environment is becoming more hostile. "In the next few years, the overall situation will not be as optimistic as we imagined. We must prepare for hardships," Ren said in November. His comments were posted on a company website this month. Huawei is unlikely to repeat the breakneck growth it experienced over the last 30 years, and will have to "give up some mediocre employees and lower labor costs," Ren added.Following the wave of negative headlines, the company is stepping up its PR campaign. Ren, who rarely speaks to the media, gave interviews to two separate groups of reporters in recent weeks. He said he expects Huawei to bring in $125 billion in revenue this year, an increase of roughly 15% from 2018. "If we are not allowed to sell our products in certain markets, we would rather scale down a bit," Ren said. "As long as we can feed our employees, I believe there will always be a future for Huawei."Emerging markets and loyal customers Huawei reported revenue growth of 16% for 2017. Its major western rivals, Finland's Nokia (NOK) and Sweden's Ericsson (ERIC), both suffered declines in revenue for the same year.The Chinese company still does brisk business in many emerging markets, which are unlikely to abandon its equipment.Revenue from Europe, the Middle East and Africa grew by about 5% in 2017 to 164 billion yuan ($25 billion). Growth in the Asia-Pacific region was stronger, with revenue up more than 10%. Analysts predict customers in those regions will stick with Huawei because of its highly competitive prices and out of a sense of loyalty. The rollout of 5G wireless networks will be expensive because they require far more base stations than previous generations, according to Kenny Liew, a telecommunications analyst at research firm Fitch Solutions. Mobile operators "will be keen to slash costs wherever possible, and one way to do so is to opt for cheaper but proven Chinese equipment," he said. Wireless carriers in India, which have fought a brutal price war in recent years, are likely to favor Huawei as a cheaper option in light of the financial pressures in the industry, Liew added. And Huawei's early commitment to countries such as Nigeria and South Africa has earned it loyalty. "There are countries in sub-Saharan Africa where Huawei ... took a risk to invest when other vendors were wary," Liew said. Huawei could also benefit from the opening of China's market to foreign players such as British carrier BT, which last week became the first foreign telecoms group to obtain a license to sell directly to customers nationwide."This move is definitely helpful for Huawei," said Dai, the Forrester analyst. BT may need Huawei's help to better serve the local market, and a closer business relationship could help Huawei outside China. The decision from Beijing came just weeks after BT said it would not buy Huawei equipment for the core of its 5G network and was stripping Huawei equipment from the heart of its 4G network. BT said it would continue to buy the Chinese company's products for other parts of its networks. Beyond telecoms equipment, Huawei's smartphone business is thriving. The company sold more than 200 million devices in 2018, up about 30% from the previous year. The spike in sales helped revenue from Huawei's consumer business rise to $52 billion --- an increase of more than 40%. Geopolitical tightropePolitical considerations could help Huawei, too.Nations that have benefited from Chinese investment will be reluctant to impose bans on Huawei equipment because of potential geopolitical repercussions, according to Liew.Poland and the Czech Republic are already trying to walk a diplomatic tightrope, balancing security ties with the United States with their need for Chinese investment. Poland is reportedly trying to smooth over tensions with Beiing after arresting the Huawei executive. Poland is China's biggest trading partner in the region, according to the World Bank. Late last year, the Czech Republic's intelligence agencies issued a public warning about using products from Huawei and its smaller rival ZTE. The Czech prime minister later had to deny a report that he had told Chinese diplomats the warning didn't represent the Czech government's position. Like Huawei, ZTE denies that its products pose any national security risks. Chinese officials are also lashing out over the increasing pressure Huawei is facing in Western Europe. After Vodafone's announcement Friday, Chinese Ambassador to the European Union Zhang Ming blasted the "slander" and "discrimination" that he said Huawei and other Chinese companies are facing in Europe.Zhang warned that any attempts to restrict the use of Chinese technology in European 5G projects would risk "serious consequences" for global economic and scientific cooperation, according to an interview published Sunday by the Financial Times.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

CONCERNS GROW FOR TAIWAN ACTIVIST SERVING JAIL TERM IN CHINAStates News ServiceMarch 21, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 674 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Two years after his initial 'disappearance' on March 19 , 2017, Taiwan rights activist Lee Ming-cheh has endured ill-treatment and is suffering declining health in prison, a rights group says."Since then, Lee has endured ill-treatment and deteriorating health; according to his wife ... he has lost 30 kilograms," the New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported."Authorities froze his commissary account, necessary to buy better food, after two unnotified and unexplained prison transfers, and does not allow his wife to send items, including clothing," it said.It said Lee is also prohibited from sending letters or receiving a phone card or books, even those that meet government approval.Lee Ming-cheh, a lifelong activist with Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), was sentenced by Hunan's Yueyang Intermediate People's Court to five years in jail for "attempting to subvert state power" in November 2017 .He was accused of setting up social media chat groups to "vilify China."Under China's Prison Law, prisoners are entitled to family visits at least once a month, but Lee Ching-yu has only been allowed to visit her husband six times since his sentence began, and has been turned back at the Chinese border four times, HRW said.Authorities banned Lee Ching-yu from visiting her husband in January after she spoke out about his treatment in Chishan Prison in the central Chinese province of Hunan, following her most recent visit last December."[They claimed] public statements she made following her last visit in December had 'disrupted the prison's standard operations for upholding the law and impeded [Li's] reformation'," HRW said.U.S. ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom Sam Brownback called for Lee's release during a visit to Taipei on March 12."Since 2016, the Chinese government has forcibly disappeared and prosecuted citizens of other countries for helping Chinese activists or speaking critically of the government, including Swedish activist Peter Dahlin, British bookseller Lee Bo, and Swedish bookseller Gui Minhai, whose whereabouts remain unknown," HRW said.'A very strange experience in Stockholm'Media reports emerged this week that Sweden's former ambassador to China has been appointed a criminal lawyer in an ongoing investigation of her 'secret' meeting with the daughter of imprisoned bookseller Gui Minhai, the details of which were reported on Angela Gui's blog.Anna Lindstedt was recalled from her post after Angela Gui accused the diplomat of having invited her to a "very strange" meeting with Chinese businessmen who claimed they could assist Gui's father. Sweden's foreign ministry said it had not been informed of the meeting in advance.She is now under investigation for "crimes against the security of the realm," Swedish media reported, cited court documents.Lindstedt's lawyer was quoted as saying that Lindstedt denies the allegations and welcomes the investigation.In her article, Angela Gui recounted "a very strange experience in Stockholm" after she was contacted by Lindstedt, who set up a meeting with two unnamed businessmen to discuss her father's case."What I thought was going to be a meeting about the Swedish government's latest efforts to win my father's release turned out to something quite different," she wrote, detailing a meeting in which her movements were restricted to a hotel VIP lounge.During the meeting she was also quizzed about her personal life, and then asked not to speak out about her father's case if she wanted it to be resolved at an unspecified point in the future.Sweden's foreign ministry said at the time that the meeting was unofficial, and that it knew nothing about it.More than three years after he was taken to mainland China from his holiday home in Thailand under murky circumstances, Gui Minhaia Hong Kong-based publisher with Swedish nationalityis believed to be detained in the eastern port city of Ningbo on suspicion of "leaking state secrets overseas."Load-Date: March 21, 2019End of Document

REPS. RUPPERSBERGER, HIMES, CONAWAY, HURD INTRODUCE BIPARTISAN BILL TO FIGHT DIGITAL THREATS FROM CHINA, OTHERSUS Fed NewsJanuary 16, 2019 Wednesday 5:09 PM  ESTCopyright 2019 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 699 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, Jan. 16 -- Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger issued the following press release:Congressmen C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-MD), Jim Himes (D-CT), Mike Conaway (R-TX) and Will Hurd (R-TX) today introduced bipartisan legislation that will toughen the United States' position against national security threats posed by technology competitors like China.The bill will create a new office within the White House that will serve as a central coordinator to combat the assault on American innovation which threatens our national security. The executive-level Office of Critical Technologies &#38; Security will be tasked with interagency coordination and creating a long-term strategic plan to combat state-sponsored technology theft and supply chain vulnerabilities.China's state-directed and state-supported efforts to achieve economic dominance by stealing intellectual property from American businesses are well-documented. Meanwhile, the over-reliance of Americans on foreign products that have been identified as national secure risks - such as cell phones made by Chinese telecom giants Huawei and ZTE - creates major supply chain risks."We can't be too tough when it comes to our national security," Congressman Ruppersberger said. "We have long suspected Beijing uses its telecom companies to spy on Americans and we know China is responsible for up to $600 billion in theft of U.S. trade secrets. It's time to get our ducks in a row: we need a coordinated, dedicated team armed with a long-term plan to ensure America maintains superiority.""Passivity in the face of increased global threats would be a grave mistake," said Congressman Himes. "Through the establishment of this office, we will not only increase our capacity to respond to Chinese aggression, but also signal to geopolitical rivals around the world that we will fiercely defend our national security, technology and intellectual property. This step is long overdue and will hopefully move us further toward a comprehensive cyber strategy.""Chinese telecommunications giants, such as Huawei and ZTE, have well established ties to the Chinese Communist Party and a long history of providing a vehicle for the Chinese government to spy on American citizens and our federal government," said Congressman Conaway. "It's critical that we respond to these rising national security threats aggressively, and utilize whatever tools we have available to prevent foreign entities from harming our country.""China's coordinated assault on American companies, the U.S. government and American intellectual property is part of a broader strategy aimed at attaining leadership in advanced technology and 21st century great power politics. We must continue to hold bad actors accountable," said Congressman Will Hurd, who spent nearly a decade fighting to secure our homeland as an undercover officer in the CIA. "I am proud to join my colleagues today to introduce this bipartisan bill that ensures that our nation uses every tool in our arsenal to combat this continued national security threat and keep Americans safe."The Office of Critical Technologies &#38; Security will consult with federal regulators, the private sector, academics and experts to make sure every available tool is being used to protect the supply chain and emerging technologies.Ruppersberger, a former Ranking Member of the House Intelligence Committee, has been warning American companies against doing business with companies like Huawei and ZTE for years. With access to telecommunications equipment-including the cellphones and tablets that are indispensable to modern life-China can spy on all Americans. If the U.S. were ever to go to war with China, Beijing could theoretically disable American cellphones, or take control of American computer networks.The legislation is the House companion to a bipartisan bill in the U.S. Senate sponsored by Sens. Mark Warner (D-VA) and Marco Rubio (R-FL).(For a copy of the bill text, click here) at https://ruppersberger.house.gov/sites/ruppersberger.house.gov/files/RUPPER_003_xml.pdf For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at contentservices@htlive.comLoad-Date: January 17, 2019End of Document

With access to telecommunications equipment--including the cellphones and tablets that are indispensable to modern life--China can spy on all Americans. If the U.S. were ever to go to war with China, Beijing could theoretically disable American cellphones, or take control of American computer networks.The legislation is the House companion to a bipartisan bill in the U.S. Senate sponsored by Sens. Mark Warner (D-VA) and Marco Rubio (R-FL).For a copy of the bill text, click here (https://ruppersberger.house.gov/sites/ruppersberger.house.gov/files/RUPPER_003_xml.pdf).Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6578215 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: January 17, 2019End of Document

Hong Kong-Based Grassroots News Website Blocked in ChinaTargeted News ServiceMarch 6, 2019 Wednesday 8:21 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 458 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: BRUSSELS, Belgium BodyThe International Federation of Journalists issued the following news release:The website of a Hong Kong grassroots news organisation, reporting labour issues around the globe, has been blocked in mainland. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) would call for the Chinese government to ensure freedom of expression in their country, ending their internet censorship policy.The grassroots news organisation based in Hong Kong, Worker News, issued a post on the 28 February 2019, saying that mainland readers recently found its site to be inaccessible, and the Chinese internet censorship analyser GreatFire.org also showed the site to be blocked as of 1 March, HKFP reported."We can't tell if this is a censorship official targeting us, or the algorithm blocked us because we hit too many keywords. But looking back at the sensitive incidents we reported over the past year we can say this is an expected result," the post reads. Last year, Worker News reported extensively on the plight of Shenzhen Jasic Technology workers, as well as other crackdowns on strikers and student activists.IFJ noted that internet censorship is not new in China. According to a report of Radio Free Asia on 11 February 2019, Zhao Weidong, a Twitter user from the northern province of Shaanxi, was called in for questioning by police in the provincial capital Xi'an and fined after he forwarded a post to social media critical of the country's beleaguered authoritarian government. He was then issued with an administrative fine of 500 yuan on 29 January for retweeting "false information".IFJ is concerned that internet censorship damages freedom of expression in China. Country authorities have the obligation to protect the Freedom of Expression, according to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which China has signed in 1998. While according to Principle 6 of Johannesburg Principles: National Security, Freedom of Expression and Access to Information, restriction on expression is prohibited unless (a) the expression is intended to incite imminent violence; (b) it is likely to incite such violence; or (c) there is a direct and immediate connection between the expression and the likelihood or occurrence of such violence.IFJ urges the Chinese government to comply international human rights standards on freedom of expression when they are trying to play a more important role on the global platform; "Access to information is an important part of freedom of expression and the people in China should have the right to access any information they want. The judgement of whether the information is true or false should be done by the people, not by the authorities".Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6636720 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 7, 2019End of Document

Jeff Van Drew (D), New Jersey is Interviewed About the Robocall BillMORNINGS WITH MARIA MORNINGS WITH MARIA 7:00 AM ESTMarch 15, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; FinancialLength: 7722 wordsByline: Maria Bartiromo, Dagen McDowell, Cheryl CasoneGuests: Scott Brown, Jeff Van Drew, Griffin Spikoski, Kevin Kelly, Jon Steinberg, Roger McNamee, Katie Nixon, Jon HilsenrathBodyMARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: European markets this morning higher across the board. The FT 100 is up 50 points, that's two- thirds of 1 percent. The CAC in Paris is up better than 1 percent. And the DAX index in Germany up 110 points. It's almost 1 percent right there.In Asia overnight, markets finished higher across the board with the best performer in China. Shanghai composite up better than 1 percent.And as we told you earlier, at least 49 people are dead this morning, dozens others injured after shootings at two mosques in New Zealand.Cheryl Casone with the details now -- Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes -- Maria.Officials in Christchurch, New Zealand say that a gunman allegedly live- streamed himself on Facebook as he fired multiple shots at worshipers inside the mosque during Friday prayers. This happened about 1:30 p.m. Local time.Australia's prime minister says the alleged gunman is an Australian citizen. Police have charged him with murder.Police say that there were defused improvised explosive devices attached to the attacker's car. And all four people are in custody but none of those arrested were on any terror watch list.New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says that this is one of the darkest days the country has ever seen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JACINDA ARDERN, NEW ZEALAND PRIME MINISTER: It is clear that this can now only be described as a terrorist attack. There are currently four individuals who have been apprehended but three connected to this attack who are currently in custody.These are people who I would describe as having extremist views that have absolutely no place in New Zealand and in fact have no place in the world.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Facebook reportedly confirming the shooter did live stream the attack and it says it has deleted that video and that Facebook account and the Instagram account that were also attached to it -- Maria.So those are the developments we have as of now.BARTIROMO: Yes. Let's talk more about that Facebook element of this.Cheryl -- thank you.Joining me right now is the co-founder and managing director of Elevation Partners. He's a former mentor to the CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg. And he's also the author of "Zucked: Waking up to the Facebook Catastrophe", author Roger McNamee and investor. Roger -- good to see you.ROGER MCNAMEE, MANAGING DIRECTOR, ELEVATION PARTNERS: Great to be here.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us.But first, let's talk about what went on in New Zealand and the fact that it was live streamed on Facebook.MCNAMEE: Yes.BARTIROMO: Now, they took it down, Roger -- quickly and they also deleted the account that the video was posted on.MCNAMEE: I mean Maria -- this is a tragedy and in my mind the Facebook angle of it is -- pales by comparison to the fact of the thing.BARTIROMO: Of course.MCNAMEE: To my mind, the culture that we've created, getting attention at any cost is obviously a factor here, right? And you see this -- I mean, the same thing was true with at least one of the kids in the college scandal, the college admissions scandal, right --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCNAMEE: -- that this is all about getting attention. It's all about, you know, projecting yourself into the world, you know, creating a false persona or in this particular case, a true persona that is just truly horrific.And in my mind, you know, Facebook didn't create that culture, but it has promoted extraordinarily effectively, you know, to create this whole community of influencers -- this whole world of influencers and, you know, obviously that can apply for ill as well as good.BARTIROMO: Yes.But let's talk about Facebook in general. I mean the company now more news, losing two of its top executives yesterday --MCNAMEE: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- the chief product officer Chris Cox; the head of WhatsApp messaging service Chris Daniels -- both leaving the company. These exits are coming after CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that the future of Facebook is private messaging.This is what I want to get your take on because we've talked about the business model of Facebook. And the fact is, they have really let down a lot of people, you included. You've been very vocal about this, in terms of what they do with all of our data.MCNAMEE: So Maria -- Mark's announcement was nonsense. I mean there was a piece of it that was great. His commitment to stop hosting operations and having data in countries with bad records on human rights, bad records on privacy means he's not going to go into China. That's a really big deal.It means he would have to exit countries like Vietnam and Philippines and Cambodia. If he follows through, that's a really big deal and very positive. I will support it hugely.The whole thing about private messaging is just a dodge to get them out from under the responsibility for all the hate speech and the conspiracy theories and disinformation that have become such a huge problem on the platform.I don't actually know if this is why Chris Cox is leaving. Chris has been there from the beginning and he's an immensely important person there. And his departure means something really significant.And I wish I knew exactly why he's going.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCNAMEE: I don't want to pretend that I do. I just know that Facebook brought this on itself. The company's had more than two years to recognize that it is responsible for the consequences of its actions ==BARTIROMO: Yes.MCNAMEE: -- and to embrace the mission of protecting shareholders and sacrificing the business model to do that. The failure there in my mind is it's just a tragedy because this is a great company and a wonderful product and one that I was really proud of for a long time.And when I reached out to Mark and Cheryl Sandberg in 2016, it was as a friend to say guys, you're in a business based on trust. And you've got to do what Johnson & Johnson did after the Tylenol poisoning scandal.BARTIROMO: Have a mea culpa.MCNAMEE: Well no -- what Boeing should have done with the 737 Max which is first thing you do is you protect the people that use your product.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCNAMEE: And their failure to do that in my mind is -- you know, it's really sad because there are all these other people who should have been giving them good advice who didn't do it.BARTIROMO: But isn't this the business model?MCNAMEE: Yes.BARTIROMO: I mean they have people's data. Advertisers want that data. Advertisers are going to pay for that data.MCNAMEE: Yes.BARTIROMO: That's the business model. So what --MCNAMEE: It's really scary -- Maria because what they've created -- and it's not just them. I mean Google really invented this model. And so Google's the best at it. Facebook's the second best at it. And Amazon, Microsoft, Verizon and others are trying to get a piece of it.But the notion was that they would gather data everywhere which means they're buying our credit card transaction records. They're buying health information from health apps.BARTIROMO: This is incredible.MCNAMEE: They're buying our location from cellular carriers. They're buying our web -- you know, everything we do on the web. You look at all those things. They're putting that together with what they have on their own sites and they basically act as a portal.So if you're a marketer and you want to reach people, you have to pay them. But if you do pay them, you get perfect information. We, as the customer, we're at a total disadvantage because we're also limited by the data that they let us have.So it's like we have no information. The people selling to us have perfect information. That is not capitalism. That's really unfair.BARTIROMO: All of this so that you could get an e-mail from whatever's Joe Schmoe's Pizza Place, to say "Hey Roger, you're on Sixth Avenue in New York City and there's a pizza place around the block similar to what you ate last week. Go there now." That location data -- I'm just trying to understand what advertisers are doing with the data.MCNAMEE: To me, it's this whole notion that we are merely a source of data. We're no longer customers. We're no longer human beings. I want to ask the question, why is it legal for a company that offers you e-mail to scan the content in order to gather data on what you're doing? Why is it legal for the credit card processors to sell our transaction history? Why is it legal for cellular carriers to sell our location? Why is it legal for an Internet company to sell any of the data about what you do on there?BARTIROMO: And how come we didn't know about this beforehand? Now, all of a sudden your customers --(CROSSTALKING)BARTIROMO: -- fooled.MCNAMEE: They worked really hard to cover their tracks. I look at this and I go, look, now we know. We've been through this before. What these guys are doing is no different than what the robber barons did, you know, at the turn of the 20th century. We need Teddy Roosevelt to come in here and, you know, put some balance back in the economy.Right now -- I mean you've got this problem. Like artificial intelligence should be the penicillin of the 21st century. But nobody can do a startup because Google, Facebook and everybody else have hired every artificial intelligence person in the country.They go to every university and hire whole departments. So there's nobody available to do startups. They basically block competitors from coming along.And we see this with Google in China now, right where, you know, you've got this situation where Google says to the Defense Department, you can't regulate us because you need our A.I. right. And then they go to China and go hey, would you like our search engine, based on the same A.I. right.BARTIROMO: Well, you're hitting on a lot of really important things.Yesterday General Joe Dunford -- he's the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- he tells a Senate panel that Google is helping the Chinese military indirectly through its work with the Chinese government and leading state-owned companies inside the communist nation.Google says we're not going to do evil, U.S. government. We're not working with you. We don't want to be anywhere near your immigration policy. We're going to walk away from a deal with the Pentagon. And yet they're willing to help China, the communist country.MCNAMEE: Ok. And this is precisely the thing that makes me sad because after 9/11, when everybody was terrified, right. It was very convenient for our security services to have Google doing surveillance on everybody, right. But they didn't think through what's the downside which is they're a corporation, they're going to sell to anybody.BARTIROMO: Yes. That's incredible.I mean you would think that America could rely on its leading technology companies in this race with China. China is about to overtake America in A.I.I want to talk to you about this.MCNAMEE: I'm not --BARTIROMO: This is according to a new study by the Allen Institute. Researchers finding that China will publish more of the most cited 50 percent of papers than America for the first time this year. And that America's share of the most cited 10 percent of papers declined form a high of 57 percent in '82 to a low of 29 percent in 2018.MCNAMEE: Let me tell you why this doesn't worry me quite as much as the issue in China. And that is because what China's doing with A.I. is behavioral modification. They're a communist country, they have centralized control and they're trying to modify the behavior of their people to get them to do the right --BARTIROMO: They've got data on everybody.MCNAMEE: Well, my point is what Facebook and Google do is also behavior modification. And my point is that's not what we should be great at. We should be using A.I. to empower our citizens. We should have literally thousands of different A.I. companies out doing different things with it, not trying to do behavioral modification.So what I really I want to do is to make sure that Facebook and Google and the others can't gather all the A.I. resources and focus all our energy on the one place where China's not only going to win but where we shouldn't want to win.We shouldn't want to win in behavioral modification. We shouldn't want to win in, you know, -- instead of using -- here's one of the things that really scares me.These guys track your mouse movement. And the first day when I get older and my hand slows down and gets a little wobbly and maybe I've got a neurologic condition. Maybe I've got Parkinson's, they're going to know. They'll be the first people on earth to know.BARTIROMO: Wow. Wow -- that's a big --MCNAMEE: They're under no obligation to tell me. Not only that, they're not even under an obligation to keep it secret. They can sell it to the highest bidder which will be my insurance company --BARTIROMO: That's incredible.MCNAMEE: who will either raise my rates or drop my coverage. And I'm sitting there and going hang on, what they could do instead is have an insurance product that says he6y look, we're tracking your mouse coverage, you know, you need to go to the doctor right. That would be the right thing to do. That's my point here.If all we can do is get these tech companies to look at us as human beings, as customers, instead of always looking at us as a source of data, all of this would be fine.There's a good version of every one of these technologies, it's just you have to treat the people as the customer instead of as like an oil well of data.BARTIROMO: How do they get away with this?MCNAMEE: Well, they got away with it because there are no rules right now in the business world, right. I mean right now you can do whatever you want.BARTIROMO: So Roger -- where is this going? You've got Elizabeth Warren out saying, you know, maybe we need to be thinking about breaking these companies up.You've got last year at the end of last year Kevin McCarthy calling all these guys down to testify. Where is this going in terms of legislation?MCNAMEE: Let me tell you what I'm doing, ok. So I spent part of the day Tuesday with the anti-trust division of the Justice Department. Next week I have conversation with the Federal Trade Commission that have been going.I'm working with the administration because they know there's a problem here, right. So they want to get on top of this. And I don't know where they're going to come down. But my point is we're working together because I have a perspective and a look at this.Warren is absolutely correct that the notion of people who make a market shouldn't allow it to also -- shouldn't be allowed to participate in it. Because that's unfair to everybody who is in it.And also you shouldn't be able to use your monopoly power to hire all the A.I. guys or to prevent start-ups from happening. So what Warren's doing is classic Teddy Roosevelt, ok.I mean you can say -- I mean people put labels on all that kind of stuff. But in an economic sense, it's so obviously the right thing to do.I don't think this is about right versus left, I think it's about right versus wrong. And I think you're see people across the whole spectrum, once they understand the issues, once they get the chance to talk to everybody, I think you're going to see that everybody -- -- I mean this was, again, Teddy Roosevelt was a Republican. I mean, anti-trust is an American concept because we always used to believe that monopoly was part of monarchy, right.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCNAMEE: And we're in favor of entrepreneurship and letting a thousand flowers bloom -- that's where I'm coming from.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCNAMEE: And it happens that Warren's right on this issue.BARTIROMO: Google has 90 percent market share in search.MCNAMEE: Yes.BARTIROMO: 90 percent. I mean if we were to see competitors come in, that would be good but there haven't been any that actually stick. They're not sticking.MCNAMEE: They don't have the economic value.BARTIROMO: They don't have the market share.MCNAMEE: No, that's true. But there are alternatives. I use a thing called Duck, Duck, Go.BARTIROMO: You do use Duck, Duck -- ok.MCNAMEE: Because they do not -- they do not track me. Right.BARTIROMO: You've talked about Duck, Duck.MCNAMEE: Well, I talk about all these guys. I mean I use Apple products because they protect me from Google. I use Duck, Duck, Go. I use Ghostery which makes sure that nobody can track me. And you know, I try to avoid Google all the time. And I've got a podcast later today and the guy requires you to use Chrome. And so it's I had to use -- anyway, I treat it like a video game.BARTIROMO: But apple really has tried to let customers believe that it is really protecting their privacy, that it's a priority. The company's debuting a new commercial yesterday with the tag line, "Privacy, that's iPhone".Here's a piece of it. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let me see that.GRAPHICS: If privacy matters in your life, it should matter to the phone your life is on. Privacy. That's iPhone.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: and of course, it comes following Apple's Facetime privacy bug. Do you buy this?MCNAMEE: Oh, definitely. I mean Apple's not perfect. Their manufacturing strategy in China is flawed. There're all kinds of issues.But on this issue, they're not just sincere about it, they've been walking this walk for a long time. And if you're on an android phone you're giving away everything.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.North Korea is considering suspending nuclear talks with the United States.Cheryl Casone with this news now -- Cheryl.CASONE: Yes, Maria.North Korea may resume its missile and nuclear testing. The country's vice foreign minister says that Kim Jong-un will soon decide whether to continue negotiations with Washington. She says that Kim was deeply disappointed by the failed summit in Hanoi last month. She blames Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Advisor John Bolton for hardening the U.S. position.Following the news, defense related stocks in South Korea and Japan surged by more than 20 percent.Well, the Securities and Exchange Commission is suing Volkswagen, accusing it of defrauding U.S. investors during the diesel emissions scandal. The SEC says the company issued more than $13 billion in bonds and asset backed securities in the U.S. markets at a time when senior executives knew that its diesel vehicles exceeded legal emissions limits. The SEC claims Volkswagen reaped hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits by issuing those securities. Now Volkswagen says the SEC complaint is quote, "legally and factually flawed" and will contest it vigorously.There is Volkswagen year to date average on your screen.Welk, the burger chain Shake Shack is testing a new incentive to attract workers in a pretty tight labor market. The company is trying out a four- day workweek at a restaurant out in Las Vegas. With unemployment at record lows restaurants have had to boost wages as a recruitment tool. Average hourly earnings at limited service restaurants rose 4.5 percent in the year through January. And that outpaces the national average.A four-day workweek and you get to eat Shake Shack burgers, sounds like a great gig.BARTIROMO: Thank you -- Cheryl.Coming up, trade talks in focus President Trump sounding optimistic on a deal with China. What that means for markets and where are we truly with this deal.Then a major recall, Butterball recalls 80,000 pounds of ground turkey over salmonella concerns after several people got sick.. We've got all the details right after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Markets this morning are higher. We're at the highs of the morning right here with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 120 points, 122 points, one half of 1 percent. The S&P 500 is up 12.5 and the Nasdaq up 43 points, that's two-thirds of 1 percent.We are watching ongoing trade negotiations between the U.S. and China. That's certainly a factor for the U.S. plus uncertainty over Britain's exit from the European Union.Let's talk markets and investing with Northern Trust Wealth chief investment officer Katie Nixon. Katie -- good to see you. Thanks so much for being here.KATIE NIXON, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, NORTHERN TRUST WEALTH: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: So you still want to put money to work into equities?NIXON: We're still risk-on Maria -- with our tactical model. And certainly if you're a long-term investor, now is a very good time to be in equities.BARTIROMO: What about these uncertainties like China, like the slowdown that we're seeing across the world? I mean look at earnings, where they were a year ago and what we're expecting this year -- big decline.NIXON: so two things. First of all, on sort of the risk cases around some of the geopolitical issues, you mentioned Brexit, clearly the China-U.S. trade talks, those are risk cases. We do believe that, you know, the next recession will very much be a man made issue and if these things don't get resolved it will turn the economy south and probably earnings south.On the earnings front though Maria -- we're actually pretty optimistic about earnings this year. We see around a 5 to 6 percent earnings growth without making any sort of herculean assumptions about margin.And that's good enough to keep the market moving ahead.KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK: And Katie -- isn't one of the main reasons why you want to be long and strong into this market is one we have an accommodative fed, right. They actually did a complete about face from December.And then the next thing that happened is that we're going to see buybacks come in. I know Maria and I have talked about this before that actually buybacks are going to overtake capital expenditure spending. So you're going to see an underlying bid for earnings because the companies are going out there and making sure they're going to meet their marks.BARTIROMO: The buyout blackout window begins at the end of the month.NIXON: Right.BARTIROMO: The 25th.NIXON: And so on the central bank front, it's not just the fed. I mean global central banks have pivoted very, very dovish. We have the ECB very dovish. We have the Bank of Japan very dovish. And now we have Powell coming out dovish. So those things are very positive for financial conditions and for risk assets globally.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Why isn't it scaring the you know what out of investors though. The central banks around the globe, even the Fed here is saying whoa, we got it wrong four months ago.BARTIROMO: Right. And now they're talking about a rate cut.KELLY: Well, it seems to me Katie -- if China, China, China -- any investor I talk to at a hedge fund or a mutual fund that would have you, they all agree with everything you said. The economy is fundamentally strong.It seems like if a deal of any kind is reached, if he gets Xi down to Mar- A-Lago, they play golf, the sun shines and they agree to something, it's clear skies ahead, right?BARTIROMO: But before you go there, I think what Dagen was bringing up is really important. And that is are people nervous that we could see this enormous change that the Fed is now maybe cutting rates. Do you think the fed is going to cut rates this year?NIXON: It's possible. I think it's possible.BARTIROMO: Wouldn't that be a scary thing -- I mean doesn't that scare somebody who thought we're seeing higher rates and now the economy is slowing so much, to such an extent that we have to change entirely and lower rates.NIXON: That's the risk, Maria, that the Fed has really painted into a bit of a corner here because even if they want to lower rates -- and lowering rates right now would be an acknowledgement that they went one too far in 2018.KELLY: Or that it's so bad out there that they have to stimulate the economy. Like cutting rates to me would scare me to death because the macroeconomic conditions aren't supportive of where rates are right now.NIXON: And that's the risk is that they said -- instead of taking a walk- back and saying wait a minute, do over, they scare the market into thinking that conditions are worse than they are.And Dagen -- to your point I think as long as they are neutral or cutting rates for the right reason -- and the right reason is that inflation isn't an issue. We don't have a growth problem. Growth is chugging along just fine. We're going to get about 2 percent, maybe even slightly higher if we get a resolution to some of the issues, whether it's China or even Brexit - - growth is going to be ok.The issue is that we have very, very low inflation, so to the extent that the Fed isn't fighting inflation, there's nothing to fight.BARTIROMO: So the issue that Jon brought up, the China deal, do you think there will be a deal?NIXON: I do, Maria. And the bar is set pretty low, actually. Just get something done.JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, "WALL STREET JOURNAL": I so agree with you. And I think the President will get something done. And I think that to your point, I mean you and Kevin are very bullish in saying now is the time to kind of leg into the market. I agree. Something is going to happen and the market's going to react (ph).NIXON: Right. I agree.BARTIROMO: If they have the important issues covered like the transfer of technology, IP theft.KELLY: State-owned enterprises.BARTIROMO: Structural issues that I don't know that China is going to agree to.KELLY: They won't.BARTIROMO: This is a cultural thing.NIXON: But for the market, they just want a deal on the tariffs.HILSENRATH: The bar is so low.BARTIROMO: They just want a deal on China buying more soybeans from the U.S.?NIXON: That's the low-hanging -- really the low-hanging fruitBARTIROMO: I don't think the markets are going to be happy with that. I mean I understand what you're saying. But I don't think the markets are going to like a deal that's not an actual deal that includes some of these important things.NIXON: It will be a deal to make a deal. So we'll have a resolution on some of that low-hanging fruit. And then I think you'll have a clear path forward on how to make a deal but it will be short on details-- Maria.BARTIROMO: Yes.NIXON: That's our base case. It would be great if we get these things done. But as you I both know they're so complicated.BARTIROMO: Right.NIXON: They're not going to get done in the next six weeks.HILSENRATH: And any time the meeting is scheduled, the market goes up. I mean to Katie's point Maria -- you're right. This stuff needs to get resolved but the threshold is so low. People just want them to get together.BARTIROMO: Yes. All right. We'll be watching.Katie -- thank you.NIXON: Thanks.BARTIROMO: Great insights from you. Katie Nixon there.Coming up, fighting back, one lawmaker is introducing a bill targeting illegal robo calls. His plan coming up.And then the business of video games. An elite gamer turning his skills into big bucks. Wait until you meet him. We've got the story coming up.Stay with us.MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back. Breaking news, terrorism in New Zealand, at least 49 people have been killed, dozens other injured in two mass shootings in mosques. The attack reportedly streamed live on Facebook. Four people have now been taken into police custody.Joining me right now on the telephone is U.S. Ambassador to New Zealand, Scott Brown. Ambassador, thanks very much for calling in this morning. Incredible that I'm talking to you today after this horrific event. What can you tell us, sir?SCOTT BROWN, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO NEW ZEALAND AND ZAMOA (via telephone): Well, Maria, certainly it's surreal, came out of left field. You know, you don't expect this type of thing in New Zealand. And you saw and you've been following 49 dead, others injured, and probably the death toll will rise. And the fact that this coward could walk through a mosque and stroll through Christchurch and drive through Christchurch assassinating people is unconscionable. And you know, it's a -- it's a sad time here in New Zealand. In fact, people are really upset as we are as well.BARTIROMO: The national security threat level was raised to the second highest level. Can you tell us anything about the sentiment about the feelings going into this before there? Were there -- was terrorism high on the alert for most people?BROWN: Well, certainly, Maria, they're always vigilant and diligent, and anticipating trends, especially what's happening in Australia and other parts of the world. So I know for a fact obviously that they pay great attention, but it's difficult to determine what's coming and who's next, especially when apparently -- allegedly this person or persons were not on any type of watch list. So there'll be a lot of certainly deep-diving into -- you know, the who, what, when, where, but right now they're trying to anticipate if there's more to follow. Doing a deep dive into this -- the person who's being arraigned tomorrow, accomplices and trying to find out how to prepare better.BARTIROMO: So, what are they looking at, Scott? I mean, the police say that they're investigating whether there was more than one attacker. You've got four people in custody so far. What are the kinds of things that the police are looking at to indicate whether or not there was another shooter? Or another attacker?BROWN: Obviously, Maria, you of all people know it's an ongoing investigation and it's just everybody, all hands on deck. I mean, you know, everybody's offering help and assistance. The police have been doing a good job. The prime minister and her team have been -- you know, working diligently to find out. So they're going to look everything, social media, you know, go to his place of residence, you know, look at his phone records, the stuff that -- you know, we and anyone else would do to see, OK, who is this person associated with if anybody. He could have been a lone wolf or not.The bottom line is, you know, they're working hard to figure out that and obviously focus on the victims and the families right now.BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, the White House just released a statement, ambassador, he said -- the White House releases this, the United States strongly condemns the attack in Christchurch, our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families. We stand in solidarity with the people of New Zealand and their government against this vicious act of hate. What do you want to see from the white House, that statement from Sarah Sanders, what would you like to see at this point, Scott?BROWN: Well, listen, I've been in communication with D.C. you know, since it happened, obviously. We have a free flow of information as a Five Eyes partner and as a -- as a -- as a friend of the Kiwis, we do a lot together and we'll continue to do that.So we're very comfortable as to what we're doing and what we will continue to do. But right now we're focusing on gathering information and making sure that -- you know, the victims and the -- you know, the families are accounted for. Our teams and all our citizens in the United States are accounted for our inducted program, and make sure they're all accounted for and -- you know, it's an ongoing, free-flowing situation. I understand that maybe one of those four that were arrested were released.So, you know, I don't want anyone to jump to conclusions, but listen, Maria, you know me. You know, this is a great place, it's one of the most amazing countries aside from our country and to have this happen in a -- in a beautiful Friday is a little -- a little shake -- you know, we're shaken. You know, Gail and I are shaken. We're like, OK, you know, we're looking over our shoulders and you know, wondering what's next. But we also know that we're not going to change our routine and we're going to just look at it in the face and drive on like we do back home.BARTIROMO: All right ambassador, great to had talk with you this morning. Our support for you, be safe, ambassador Scott Brown. Thanks so much for joining us this morning.BROWN: I know that, Maria. Miss you, OK. Say hi to everybody.BARTIROMO: All right, will do. U.S. Ambassador to New Zealand, Scott Brown, obviously a friend of this program for years during the election. Scott joined us many times, obviously you just heard him now, living in New Zealand, dealing with this tragedy.Turning now to taking on robocalls, my next guest recently introduced legislation in congress to crackdown on those calls.Joining me right now is New Jersey congressman, House Agriculture Committee member and author of the Robocall Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2019, Jeff Van Drew. And congressman, it's good to see you again. Thanks so much for joining me this morning. REP. JEFF VAN DREW (D-NJ), HOUSE AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE MEMBER: It's great to be here with you again, thank you.BARTIROMO: First, you just heard Ambassador Scott Brown. Your reaction, what do you see in terms of necessary moves at this point from the U.S. in light of what we know took place in New Zealand overnight?VAN DREW: Well, obviously as we find out more, it's going to be important that we help in any way and I know that we will for intelligence gathering to make sure that any assistance they need in any way, technical and otherwise is there.You know, I would also say, I think that I -- all of us have the same reaction. There's just too much hate in the world, too much hurt. You know, it starts with social media. We feel that we can speak to each other a certain way. It starts with politics and the way that we behave and people deal with each other and it's just extended into these horrible hateful acts that happen.Someday, I hope that we really truly realize we all have the same blood flowing in our veins, that we are all human beings, and that we should love each other a little bit more. This is a bad day.BARTIROMO: I'm so glad you said that, congressman. You've been among those who are very much wanting to work with the other side, willing to work with the other side on policy and you don't see that enough in the congress.I mean, you're from New Jersey. I want to get to the Robocall Bill in a minute. But you're from New Jersey, a high taxes, the SALT deductions all top of the agenda issues. Numbers are from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration estimate that over 10 million people will lose out on deductions for state and local taxes due to the 2017 tax overhaul. It's being felt the most in high tax states like New York, California and your state of New Jersey.What do you want to see here and how hard will the bite be come April 15th in your view?VAN DREW: Well, the bite's going to be hard for some folks. And you're right, for some folks it won't be as much. But unfortunately, New Jersey is a high tax state as well as the other ones that you mentioned and you know, I would just like to see taxes cut. I hate when you know, we say OK, we have a tax cut, I support tax cuts, and I'm not faulting anybody for this but the reality is, when we -- you know, we cap that deduction it hurts a lot of folks and they really don't get the tax cuts.So, I think we need legislation and there are various pieces out there and nothing is -- you know, moved forward yet but I hope at some point it does because if we want to cut taxes, we should for everybody, particularly the middle class and --BARTIROMO: So, what do you -- so what do you want to say to some of your colleagues in the Democrat Party, like an Elizabeth Warren, who is calling for a tax on wealth? Right? I mean, you've got -- you know, ideas from AOC of 70 percent tax rates. You're talking about cutting taxes because you see that people are hurting from the high taxes in New Jersey, state taxes and local taxes, New York the same thing. How are you dealing with all these -- you know, proposals from some of your colleagues on the sharp left?VAN DREW: Well, I respectfully disagree. I mean, the answer is not always more taxes. That certainly is not where we need to go. And when you get to rates of 70 percent and higher, then you are no longer a capitalist country. You are then becoming a socialist country and as I've said to you before and I say very often, I am not a socialist. I am a capitalist. I am a compassionate capitalist. Which means that at times and I think you would agree, we absolutely need a safety net. There is a place for government. But we just can't run everything and tax everything then we lose initiative in the country. So, I don't agree with them.BARTIROMO: I'm very impressed with you, congressman. You've got the right ideas because you understand the economy clearly, Kevin Kelly.KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK: Yes, congressman, it's Kevin Kelly here. I think we're tip-toeing around the main point when it comes to taxes and it's too convoluted and complicated. And we, our tax code is 75,000 pages, right? And so the SALT deduction is hurting people because the wealthy can find loopholes and they can get out of it. And then we've seen what's happened here in New York where Amazon's not coming here, why, because people viewed it as corporatism, right? People saw it as giving basically subsidies to a company that actually didn't need them, right. That's crony capitalism at its finest.So, how do we actually pinpoint and address this? Can we -- can we simplify the tax code? And is there anything being done?VAN DREW: We can do anything we want to. And if we work hard enough, of course we can and if you get both sides to agree that we should, we can. That's the question. And we -- you know, this has been spoken about and you know, debated for a long period of time.I agree with you. I'd like a simpler tax code. I'd like to make sure that middle class folks, working people, small business people are really getting the break that they need and the opportunities that they need. That's what this country has been about. It's always been about hard working people in the middle. That's what drives the United States of America.And also when it comes to -- you know, Amazon, certainly I said before, you know, I don't love that you have to incentivize companies that are doing well to come to your state but it's the way that it is now.So until we change it, you know, they're not going to be where they originally thought, obviously, in New York. They are welcome to come down to Atlanta county or down to South Jersey where I am because I have different countys in my district that would help them and incentivize them and I know that there are other areas that would as well. The name of the game is jobs, business, and good healthy competition.BARTIROMO: What about the robocalls, congressman? You're introducing this legislation aimed at combating this annoying robocalls. Tell us about your proposal.VAN DREW: So, you know, we're speaking about huge issues that are just over-arching. But you know, it also comes down to -- you know, smaller issues that affect our everyday lives. And I don't know about you, but I think most people are really tired of this and we did a no call list. In fact, I was the author in New Jersey of the no call list. And we thought that was going to be the end of it. But the problem is, the enforcement. We don't have the proper enforcement against these robocalls and telemarketing and spoofing for those that don't know what spoofing is. It is simply when a number comes up and you believe that it's a certain number but when you pick it up it's not. It's a robocaller again.BARTIROMO: These calls -- these calls have picked up. I'm getting them too.VAN DREW: A lot.BARTIROMO: It's so annoying, you're right, congressman.VAN DREW: They've picked up a lot. And they interrupt people's lives. We are bothered enough. People are quite frankly tense enough and just have this on top of it.BARTIROMO: Good for you.VAN DREW: So, this just, you know, increases the statute of limitations, increases the fines and I'd love to see that we could actually increase the enforcement to finally stop this. Because it's getting worse, not better.BARTIROMO: Then that's the key -- then that's the key, it's the enforcement. Congressman, it's good to see you this morning, thank you so much.VAN DREW: Great to be with you.BARTIROMO: And to you, Congressman Jeff Van Drew.President Trump just tweeted about the terrorist attacks, he writes this, my warmest sympathy and best wishes goes out to the people of New Zealand after the horrible massacre in the mosques. 49 innocent people have so senselessly died with so many seriously injured, the U.S. stands by New Zealand for anything we can do. God bless all. And we'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A massive power outage in Venezuela causing a major water crisis now. Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Maria, clean water is running low there and some desperate Venezuelans are swarming sewage drains. You can see a long line of people including children that are searching for clean water. The Trump administration is now considering imposing new sanctions that could prohibit Visa and MasterCard from processing any transactions in Venezuela.Well, check your freezer. Butterball recalling nearly 80,000 pounds of ground turkey, the move comes after five people became sick from salmonella in Wisconsin and Minnesota. The ground turkey has a use or sell by date July 26th, 2018. Consumers are advised to either toss it out or return it to the store for a refund.Well, Budweiser meats hitting grocery stores this summer. Budweiser teaming up with Coleman Meats to create Budweiser infused bratwurst pulled pork and spare ribs. The Jalapeno Cheddar Brats and the regular brats are actually made with Budweiser barbecue sauce for the pulled pork and ribs is also made with the beer. Beer and brats, Maria, there you go.BARTIROMO: There you go. All right, thanks, Cheryl. Coming up, a $200,000 at 14 years old, a teenage gamer turning his skills into a mega salary. We've got the story right after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The big business of video games, 14 year old Griffin Spikoski, known by his gaming moniker Sceptic earned $200,000 playing the video game Fortnite. Griffin is with us right now to tell us how he did it. And Griffin, congratulations to you.GRIFFIN SPIKOSKI, GAMER: Thank you.BARTIROMO: This is incredible. How did you do it?SPIKOSKI: It is. So, I started off on YouTube around eight months ago. And I killed a big streamer. I put it on YouTube and it got nine million views.BARTIROMO: And then what?SPIKOSKI: It just took off and I just kind of kept the hype up.KELLY: So, in order to be the best, you beat the best and that's how you got --SPIKOSKI: Yes, kind of.JON STEINBERG, CEO, CHEDDAR: The bulk of your money now is coming from twitch, right? You get 50 percent of your subscriber fees on Twitch, right?SPIKOSKI: And YouTube.STEINBERG: And YouTube, and which is -- which is bigger for you?SPIKOSKI: Usually YouTube.STEINBERG: YouTube, you're earning more revenue from YouTube than Twitch because I think most of the audience would think that everybody watches gamers on Twitch but -- and be surprised that YouTube is doing that well for you. Is that something across the industry or?SPIKOSKI: Yes, it usually across the industry YouTube is superior.BARTIROMO: Take us through your strategies that you use to make money.SPIKOSKI: So, I take videos, I record them on my own and I upload it to YouTube. I like to upload around two videos a week. I'm going to switch that to daily upload soon. And people like to watch those a bunch of times. And I do daily streams on Twitch and Caffeine as well, and I just stream through there.STEINBERG: And I notice on shirt, so Misfits is a professional gaming team. So you must be the youngest professional on a formal team of almost anybody now, right?SPIKOSKI: Probably yes.STEINBERG: And what games do you professionally play?SPIKOSKI: Just Fortnite, that's it.KELLY: Are there other games you're looking to expand to? Because I know there's other games from other providers coming out that everyone's looking at moving to.SPIKOSKI: Yes. So, I do play a couple other games but I mainly play Fortnite. That's what I practice the most.KELLY: Yes, you've got to master that one game.SPIKOSKI: Definitely.STEINBERG: But what other games are you playing? Because the two big public companies that investors trade now are E.A., makes Apex Legends. OK, so I'm going to give you all the context, right. And Activision makes Overwatch. Are either of those games doing anything good these days? And are they just crushed by Fortnite? Or do you see them as being a big deal?SPIKOSKI: So, Apex Legends sponsored a bunch of big streamers and it's huger now. And I did play it for a while. But I think Fortnite is still the thing.BARTIROMO: And you still like Fortnite better?SPIKOSKI: Yes, definitely.BARTIROMO: Why?SPIKOSKI: So, in upcoming weeks is going to be a $40 million tournament that 13 years older can compete in.BARTIROMO: Wow.STEINBERG: And what about Call of Duty? Because Activision on that one used to call the duty league. Is that -- is that --SPIKOSKI: Well, Fortnite crushed it.BARTIROMO: Are you playing to win that $40 million, is that where you're going for?SPIKOSKI: I hope.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Can I ask you a question, are you going to end up going to college?SPIKOSKI: Depends where I am in a few years.MCDOWELL: That's a good answer.SPIKOSKI: I guess we'll see.BARTIROMO: Do you want to turn this talent into something in college that you'll be doing as well?SPIKOSKI: It depends if I'm still at this position in like four years' time, then probably not.STEINBERG: Who makes the best keyboards and who makes the best headphones?SPIKOSKI: So, I'm not sure, this isn't too known of a company, it's called an Anne Pro 2. But it's like a more of a slimmer kind of keyboard. It tucks like all the --STEINBERG: Who makes this?SPIKOSKI: It's called type wreck.STEINBERG: So these are your two favorite brands?SPIKOSKI: Yes, sort of.STEINBERG: Are either of them sponsors?SPIKOSKI: No.BARTIROMO: And how did you dye your hair that color? What is that?SPIKOSKI: So, I got it because I said if once I had 100,000 followers, you guys choose the color that I dye my hair. And those they chose blue and my mom did it.BARTIROMO: Griffin, that's great.STEINBERG: Good mom did it.BARTIROMO: Griffin Spikoski.STEINBERG: Good mom.BARTIROMO: Congratulations, Griffin. We'll be right back.Load-Date: March 15, 2019End of Document

It's still not clear exactly why it was banned, what/if Microsoft changed anything.Microsoft Corp's Bing search engine is seen on a computer in this illustration picture taken January 24, 2019. The search engine's home page too remains inaccessible from within mainland China.Access to Microsoft's Bing search engine has since been restored in China, a Microsoft spokesperson confirmed to ZDNet.State-owned telecom company China Unicom confirmed that the government had ordered the block, the Financial Times reported, citing a source.Microsoft-run search engine Bing was unavailable in mainland China attempting to open cn.bing.com results in an error message, though users can still access Bing's global site using a virtual private network , which allows people to circumvent China's "Great Firewall" of censorship.Should Bing be blocked, it would mark Microsoft's second setback in China since November 2017, when its Skype internet phone call and messaging service was pulled from Apple and Android app stores.Sweethearts sweets won't be on shelves this Valentine's DayAccording to candystore.com , the conversation hearts candy took the crown as the most popular candy for the 2018 holiday season. Well, there are plenty of the brand's conversation hearts for sale on Amazon and Ebay, though they won't be fresh.Control of the internet has tightened under President Xi Jinping, an effort that has accelerated since 2016, as the ruling Communist Party seeks to crack down on dissent in the social media landscape.China blocks access to a large number of Western websites, including Facebook and Twitter, to restrict its citizens' access to uncensored information."Over the past couple months, it appears the Chinese government has improved [the] accuracy and frequency of theGreat Firewall blocking", said Sunday Yokubaitis, CEO of internet services company Golden Frog.Notably, this is not the first time that CAC has initiated a cleanup or blocked websites and apps from operating in China.Smith saidMicrosoft has "days when there are either hard negotiations or even disagreements" with Chinese authorities about search results on Bing.Bing's rival Google shut down its search engine in China in 2010, after rows with the authorities over censorship and hacking.U.S. lawmakers introduce bipartisan Bill that, if passed, would ban the export of U.S. chips and other components to the two Chinese tech companies. It had only a 2 percent share of the country's search market, according to StatCounter.Load-Date: January 25, 2019End of Document

DOJ pursuing criminal charges against Huawei for theft of techStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeJanuary 17, 2019 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MARKETS; Pg. 1Length: 415 wordsByline: Jean GarciaBodyIn the wake of a civil lawsuit by T-Mobile and other telecommunications companies against the Chinese networking and telecommunications company Huawei, the US Department of Justice is reportedly conducting a criminal investigation of the company.In the recent civil case, which was originally filed in 2014, a jury in Seattle found that Huawei had stolen robotic technology from a T-Mobile lab. Huawei had used the access it gained by being a handset supplier to obtain copies of the robot's specifications and steal software, parts, and trade secrets from the lab.The legislation is the latest in a long list of actions taken to fight what some in the Trump administration call China's cheating through intellectual property theft, illegal corporate subsidies and rules hampering U.S. corporations that want to sell their goods in China. A source told the WSJ that the federal probe is still in an advanced stage, but it could lead to an indictment soon. Last week, a company employee was arrested in Poland."They noted their continued commitment to Canada's conduct of a fair, unbiased and transparent legal proceeding and USA extradition request with respect to Ms. Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei", a State Department statement said.Both have also been accused of failing to respect USA sanctions on Iran.Knicks' Enes Kanter subject of Turkey worldwide arrest warrant requestBut just because of the one lunatic guy, one maniac, one dictator, I can't even go out there and do my job. The Turkish government requested that the US extradite Kanter to face a four-year prison sentence."Huawei is effectively an intelligence-gathering arm of the Chinese Communist Party whose founder and CEO was an engineer for the People's Liberation Army", said Republican Senator Tom Cotton, one of the bill's sponsors.This definitely puts even more pressure on the company whose high-ranking executives and employees are being arrested for one reason or another, some of them on behalf of the United States government."If Chinese telecom companies like Huawei violate our sanctions or export control laws, they should receive nothing less than the death penalty - which this denial order would provide."The case of Meng, under house arrest awaiting proceedings, has inflamed US-China and Canada-China relations.Huawei's reclusive founder Ren Zhengfei, in a rare media interview Tuesday, forcefully denied accusations that his firm engaged in espionage on behalf of the Chinese government.Load-Date: January 18, 2019End of Document

Continue reading China confirms scientist genetically engineered babies   and more are on the wayGovernment investigators have confirmed a Chinese scientist s claim of creating the world s first genetically engineered babies, as well as the existence of a second pregnancy with a gene-edited embryo.Back in November, scientist He Jiankui captured international attention when he claimed to have used the gene-editing tool CRISPR/Cas-9 to alter two embryos. He maintained that the alterations would protect the embryos from HIV infection later in life, though other experts say that the editing was flawed and could put the babies at risk for future health problems. Though He presented results on the twin girls ( Lulu  and  Nana ) at a genetics conference in Hong Kong, he did not release all of his data, publish his results in an academic journal, or otherwise provide definitive proof that the experiment had taken place. Bioethicists, geneticists, and other Chinese scientistswere horrified by the news, and rumors swirled that He had gone missing or was possibly put under house arrest. The legal responsibility is unclear and the penalties are very light. Now, a preliminary investigation by authorities in the province of Guangdong (where the scientist works) confirms the births and states that He  defied government bans and conducted the research in the pursuit of personal fame and gain,  according toXinhua, a Chinese state-run newspaper. The report paints a picture of a lone scientist who raised funds on his own, faked ethical review documents, and is likely to face serious charges. He s research was halted by the Chinese government last year, and he has since been fired from the Southern University of Science and Technology. Lulu and Nana will be placed under medical observation.It s still unclear what charges He might face, whether the gene editing in the second pregnancy was HIV-related, or what will become of this second pregnancy. Still, the case has sparked a widespread discussion around China s rules for this type of biomedical research. In November, former vice minister of health Huang Jiefu suggested that the country should establish an organization to oversee biomedical experiments. Meanwhile, Wang Yue, a health law research at Peking University, toldThe New York Times that because traditionally,  the legal responsibility is unclear and the penalties are very light,  China needs to enact stricter regulations.Tags: See Campaign:https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/22/18192961/crispr-genetic-engineering-baby-ethics-scientist-china-investigation-he-jiankuiContact Information:Angela ChenTags:,            Wire,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: January 25, 2019End of Document

Chinese hackers have been hammering the US Navy, and admirals are in the crosshairsBusiness Insider USMarch 14, 2019 Thursday 03:33 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 662 wordsByline: rpickrell@businessinsider.com,  (Ryan Pickrell)Highlight: The US Navy is "under cyber siege" from China's spies, and trying to keep admiral promotions secret. But their names and bios are published elsewhere.BodyMass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Katie Lash/US Navy• The US Navy is no longer publicizing promotions of admirals, a policy that promotes reduced transparency in the service.• Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson argued Wednesday that one of the reasons the service is doing this is to protect flag officers from cyberattacks.• The US Navy is "under cyber siege," an internal cybersecurity review recently concluded.• A significant amount of information about top Navy officers can still be found online, undermining Richardson's rationale of the service's new policy.A top US admiral explained Wednesday that the Navy is keeping high-level promotions a secret because hackers from China and other adversarial countries are targeting flag officers.While the Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps all continue to publish lists of newly promoted officers, the Navy abruptly stopped in October, USNI News first reported last month.The policy reportedly began with the promotion of Trump's doctor, Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson, who withdrew from consideration to lead Department of Veterans Affairs amid a scandal.Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson defended the policy decision Wednesday, arguing that publishing this information - which the US Senate continues to publish - leaves high-ranking Navy officers vulnerable to cyberattacks."I don't know if you've been personally attacked in the cyber world, but our flags are," Richardson said at a conference in Washington, DC, Breaking Defense reported. It is "just a vulnerability that we are trying to think about," he added,            according to Military.com."There's always a tension between on the transparency and security," he explained, telling reporters that the Navy intends to do anything it can "to make sure we're keeping their information and stuff secure."An alarming internal Navy cybersecurity review recently concluded that the service, as well as its industry partners, are "under cyber siege," The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday.Read More: The US Navy and its partners are 'under cyber siege' from Chinese hackers and are hemorrhaging national security secrets"We are under siege," a senior US Navy official stressed to The Journal. "People think it's much like a deadly virus - if we don't do anything, we could die."The service has been hit relentlessly by Chinese, Russian, and Iranian hackers, with the threat presented by Chinese cyber criminals among the most severe. China is accused of hacking the US military, large and small defense contractors, and even university partners to steal anything not nailed down.Last year, Chinese government hackers stole important data on several US Navy undersea-warfare programs from an unidentified contractor. Among the stolen information were plans for a new supersonic anti-ship missile, The Washington Post reported in June, citing US officials.Speaking to Congress Wednesday, Army Gen. Paul Nakasone, head of US Cyber Command, said that the US is prepared to aggressively strike back against adversarial powers in cyberspace.Read More: The US is ready to use more aggressive cyber operations to strike back at enemiesWhile Navy leadership argues that the decision to keep flag officer promotions a secret is to eliminate exposure that could put its admirals at risk, the defense appears a bit thin, as their names, ranks and biographies are still publicly available."This may not work out in the end, I don't know, but that's kind of our mindset there," Richardson reportedly said Wednesday.NOW WATCH: The wives of high-level cocaine traffickers reveal how their husbands took down 'El Chapo'See Also:• The US Navy and its partners are 'under cyber siege' from Chinese hackers and are hemorrhaging national security secrets• US Navy wants to get rid of an aircraft carrier to buy new weapons needed for a next-level fight with China• The US has been getting 'its ass handed to it' in war games simulating fights against Russia and ChinaLoad-Date: March 14, 2019End of Document

Industry Voices—Lowenstein: The China situation has 3 possible outcomesFierceWirelessFebruary 26, 2019Copyright 2019 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 970 wordsByline: Mark LowensteinHighlight: The U.S. and China's trade issues—with Huawei currently topping the discussion—are playing out like a Richard North Patterson novel. But this is serious business: A worst-case scenario could have a profound impact on the economy and many companies in the tech-verse. If the current rhetoric devolves into a full-scale trade war, the entire global supply chain would be affected.BodyThe "China Situation"and 5G areplaying out like a fascinating business/political/industrial policy chess match. This would be the stuff of a Richard North Patterson novel or a Ryan Murphy Netflix series. But this is serious business, with far-reaching potential consequences and hundreds of billions of dollars at stake.In thinking about how this might play out, I'm taking a classic B-school business case approach of constructing three possible outcomes: base case, optimistic case, and pessimistic case. The optimisticscenario is what's best for the continued advancement of 5G, and therefore positive for key industry stakeholders and consumers. The pessimistic scenario would mean delays in 5G advancement and innovation, with broader negative implications for the industry's supply chain, from networks to devices.There are three intertwined issues here: overall U.S.-China trade policy; a 21st century "arms race"focused on tech leadership in areas such as AI and 5G; and concerns about privacy and data security, with Huawei as the moment's cause célèbre. We also have to understand that there are many layers and complexities here. This is not the U.S. vs. U.S.S.R. 1970s/80s Cold War, with each superpower in their respective corner. China is a hugely important market for nearly every major U.S. tech supplier. Andit's an important center of manufacturing for all manner of device/network gear and components, and a linchpin of the global supply chain. There are 350,000 Chinese students currently attending U.S. universities. The concerns of the current U.S. administration are very much justified, but the bloviating and posturing ignore many of the nuances and interrelationships.Base Case. My base case scenario is that this is a short-term crisis that gets solved, in some shape or form, during 2019. On trade, that means that the U.S. and China agree to a new framework and that we don't get dragged into a damaging, retaliatory trade war. With regard to Huawei (and related firms/situations), we see a sort of middle ground. The company's overtures in the U.K. recently were less an admission of wrongdoing than an acknowledgement that there is room for improvement, and that measures both actual and symbolic need to be taken to assuage the concerns of the West. Given the allegationsand potential upcoming trials, Huawei's prospects to sell gear in the United States in the foreseeable future are dim. But if Huawei and other Chinese firms are banished from North America and Western Europe markets, with no mechanism to get back in, they (and the Chinese government by proxy) might take down a lot of others with them.So, my base case means finding some form of middle ground: developing a series of steps and safeguards that Chinese (and other firms) need to undertake to make us more comfortable with installing their equipment and selling their devices. And vice-versa, if needed. A road map, of some sort. This might take some time to fully define, and longer still to fully implement. But it would not significantly impact markets or delay the 5G timetable.Worst Case. The negative scenario could have a profound impact on the economy and many companies in the tech-verse. If the current rhetoric and threats devolve into a full-scale trade war, the entire global supply chain would be affected. This would impact everything from the 5G timetable to the evolution, availability, and supply of smartphones and other popular consumer gear. And if Huawei and others are out-and-out banished from a significant swath of the global network equipment market, the short-term market share gains enjoyed by firms such as Ericsson, Samsung andNokia would be countered by: losing at least some of the potential China market; impacting manufacturing and availability of components; and dampening innovation overall.Best Case. The first component of a "best case"scenario is that the U.S. and China reach some sort of a trade agreement in the coming months. Despite all the posturing, there are teams of actual adults working on this, and I'm cautiously optimistic.The second component of a positive outcome would be some framework for addressing issues of data security and privacy that would result in less draconian measures than are currently being contemplated. Clearly, there's a race for supremacy between the U.S. and China in critical areas such as 5G and AI. But it does not necessarily have to be a zero- sum game. This could be an important opportunity to define the proper safeguards that would allow participation in each other's markets, while protecting against untoward actions by firms and governments. Is it Pollyanna-ish to think that we could come up with some sort of "trust but verify"mechanism, which Reagan and Gorbachev accomplished in the previous Cold War?Even with progress here, there will continue to be fundamental differences between our societies and governments. Just as we might not deploy small cells in the same number and time frame as China, zoning and aesthetics be damned, we also (hopefully)won't go there with "Social Credit Score"and other Big Brother schemes that AI could further enable.So perhaps a more positive, bigger-picture outcome would be that this is less of a "nuclear"arms raceand more like Apollo-Soyuz, which accelerated innovation and created many positive, long-term benefits for business and society.Mark Lowenstein, a leading industry analyst, consultant, and commentator, is managing director of           Mobile Ecosystem.

RUPPERSBERGER, HIMES, CONAWAY, HURD INTRODUCE BIPARTISAN BILL TO FIGHT DIGITAL THREATS FROM CHINA, OTHERSStates News ServiceJanuary 16, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 655 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by the office of Maryland Rep. C. A. Dutch Ruppersberger:Congressmen C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-MD), Jim Himes (D-CT), Mike Conaway (R-TX) and Will Hurd (R-TX) today introduced bipartisan legislation that will toughen the United States' position against national security threats posed by technology competitors like China.The bill will create a new office within the White House that will serve as a central coordinator to combat the assault on American innovation which threatens our national security. The executive-level Office of Critical Technologies and Security will be tasked with interagency coordination and creating a long-term strategic plan to combat state-sponsored technology theft and supply chain vulnerabilities.China's state-directed and state-supported efforts to achieve economic dominance by stealing intellectual property from American businesses are well-documented. Meanwhile, the over-reliance of Americans on foreign products that have been identified as national secure risks such as cell phones made by Chinese telecom giants Huawei and ZTE creates major supply chain risks."We can't be too tough when it comes to our national security," Congressman Ruppersberger said. "We have long suspected Beijing uses its telecom companies to spy on Americans and we know China is responsible for up to $600 billion in theft of U.S. trade secrets. It's time to get our ducks in a row: we need a coordinated, dedicated team armed with a long-term plan to ensure America maintains superiority.""Passivity in the face of increased global threats would be a grave mistake," said Congressman Himes. "Through the establishment of this office, we will not only increase our capacity to respond to Chinese aggression, but also signal to geopolitical rivals around the world that we will fiercely defend our national security, technology and intellectual property. This step is long overdue and will hopefully move us further toward a comprehensive cyber strategy.""Chinese telecommunications giants, such as Huawei and ZTE, have well established ties to the Chinese Communist Party and a long history of providing a vehicle for the Chinese government to spy on American citizens and our federal government," said Congressman Conaway. "It's critical that we respond to these rising national security threats aggressively, and utilize whatever tools we have available to prevent foreign entities from harming our country.""China's coordinated assault on American companies, the U.S. government and American intellectual property is part of a broader strategy aimed at attaining leadership in advanced technology and 21st century great power politics. We must continue to hold bad actors accountable," said Congressman Will Hurd, who spent nearly a decade fighting to secure our homeland as an undercover officer in the CIA. "I am proud to join my colleagues today to introduce this bipartisan bill that ensures that our nation uses every tool in our arsenal to combat this continued national security threat and keep Americans safe."The Office of Critical Technologies and Security will consult with federal regulators, the private sector, academics and experts to make sure every available tool is being used to protect the supply chain and emerging technologies.Ruppersberger, a former Ranking Member of the House Intelligence Committee, has been warning American companies against doing business with companies like Huawei and ZTE for years. With access to telecommunications equipmentincluding the cellphones and tablets that are indispensable to modern lifeChina can spy on all Americans. If the U.S. were ever to go to war with China, Beijing could theoretically disable American cellphones, or take control of American computer networks.The legislation is the House companion to a bipartisan bill in the U.S. Senate sponsored by Sens. Mark Warner (D-VA) and Marco Rubio (R-FL).Load-Date: January 17, 2019End of Document

Shareholders Tell Google to Prioritize Human Rights and Rethink China Search ProductGlobeNewswireFebruary 27, 2019 Wednesday 12:09 PM PTCopyright 2019 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: ANNUAL MEETINGS & SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS; COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT; MAJOR SHAREHOLDER ANNOUNCEMENTSLength: 930 wordsBodyFALLS CHURCH, Va., Feb.  27, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A coalition of Google shareholders has filed a resolution asking the company to publish a human rights impact assessment for a controversial censored search product -- called "Dragonfly" -- that Google is reportedly developing for use in China. Led by Azzad Asset Management, the shareholders are concerned that Google's compliance with China's repressive laws would facilitate and legitimize surveillance and censorship, posing serious human rights risks. The shareholders' call to action at Google is timely given recent reports that the company is already censoring its search product in Russia, blacklisting websites according to government instructions. India's government is considering new rules that could again implicate Google in censorship. Open MIC, a non-profit that fosters shareholder engagement at leading tech and media companies, developed the proposal alongside lead filer Azzad, a socially responsible investment firm. The group of filers includes institutional and individual investors representing over $3 billion in assets under management.In submitting the resolution, shareholders are asking Google to demonstrate that the company's stated ethical codes, values, and policies are truly informing all its products in the global market. Advocates are concerned that Dragonfly's reported development may already be sending a dangerous signal to other governments, including authoritarian governments. Last Thursday, 14 members of Congress asked Google and Apple to remove a Saudi government app that both companies offer through their app stores; it includes a disturbing tracking component that allows men to register, track, and control the travel rights of women in their families.The shareholder resolution asks Google to proactively assess all actual and potential risks before launching the Dragonfly product. Human rights experts say that a Google search product in China would serve as an additional surveillance tool for the government to use against all residents in that country, and that Uighurs and religious minorities   who already face state violence, systemic discrimination, and grave human rights abuses   face the greatest danger. Just last week, a New York Times investigation revealed that an American company has been deeply implicated in the surveillance and tracking of Uighur Muslims in China, affirming shareholders' concern that Google must proactively assess its operations in China to avoid supporting the Chinese government's documented human rights abuses.Despite reports in December 2018 that the planning of Dragonfly had stalled, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has refused to say that the company will not proceed with its plans, and the company faces continued backlash. Last month, a coalition of Chinese, Tibetan, Uighur, and human rights groups protested Dragonfly outside of 10 Google offices around the globe. U.S. lawmakers and Google's own engineers have also called on Google to end work on the project.Joshua Brockwell, investment communications director at Azzad Asset Management, said: "As shareholders, we are concerned that Google's powerful technology could produce data on citizens that their governments wouldn't be able to reach on their own. We believe that technology companies have a responsibility to consider the human rights implications of how their products will be used."Jonas Kron of Trillium Asset Management said: "The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights provide a framework for companies, including Alphabet, to -Protect, Respect and Remedy' human rights. Now is the time for Google to demonstrate its commitment to this framework with specific reference to China. All eyes are on Google at this critical juncture." Trillium co-filed the resolution.Michael Connor, Executive Director of Open MIC, said: "Google has long been a leader in global technology. It's high time for Google to take the lead on human rights."In submitting this shareholder resolution, investors are asking Google to demonstrate its previously stated commitment to human rights and free expression for all its users, regardless of where they live   as these open internet values are precisely what fuel the company's business success. The resolution requests that the company publish the human rights impact assessment no later than October 30, 2019, and recommends that the company refer to the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

SCARY PHOTO: DOES THIS PROVE CHINA'S H-20 STEALTH BOMBER IS REAL?States News ServiceMarch 1, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1518 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for the National Interest (former the Nixon Center):We break down the facts.by Sebastien RoblinIf the H-20 is judged to be of credible design, the Pentagon in turn will have to factor the strategic implications of China's stealth capabilities, and will likely seek to field implement counter-stealth technologies which formerly have been mostly vaunted by Russia and China.In October 2018, Chinese media announced that the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) would publicly unveil its new H-20 stealth bomber during a parade celebrating the air arm's seventieth anniversary in 2019.(This first appeared several months ago.)Prior news of the H-20's development had been teased using techniques pioneered by viral marketing campaigns for Hollywood movies. For example, the Xi'an Aviation Industrial Corporation released a promotional video in May 2018 pointedly imitating Northrop Grumman's own Superbowl ad for the B-21 stealth bomber, portraying a shrouded flying wing bomber in its final seconds. Later, the silhouette of a possible new bomber appeared at a PLAAF gala. This comes only two years after PLAAF Gen. Ma Xiaotian formally revealed the Hong-20's existence.If the H-20 does have the range and passable stealth characteristics attributed to it, it could alter the strategic calculus between the United States and China by exposing U.S. bases and fleets across the Pacific to surprise air attacks.Only three countries have both the imperative and the resources to develop huge strategic bombers that can strike targets across the globe: the United States, Russia and China. Strategic bombers make sense for China because Beijing perceives dominance of the western half of the Pacific Ocean as essential for its security due to its history of maritime invasion , and the challenge posed by the United States in particular. The two superpowers are separated by five to six thousand miles of oceanand the United States has spent the last century developing a network of island territories such as Guam, foreign military bases in East Asia and super-carriers with which it can project air and sea power across that span.Xi'an Aviation, the H-20's manufacturer, also builds China's H-6 strategic jet bombers , a knockoff the 1950s-era Soviet Tu-16 Badger which has recently been upgraded with modern avionics, aerial refueling capability and cruise missiles in the later H-6K and H-6J models. Beijing could easily have produced a successor in a similar vein, basically a giant four-engine airliner-sized cargo plane loaded with fuel and long-range missiles that's never intended to get close enough for adversaries to shoot back.Alternately, analyst Andreas Rupprecht reported that China considered developing a late-Cold War style supersonic bomber akin to the U.S. B-1 or Russian Tu-160 called the JH-XX. This would have lugged huge bombloads at high speed and low altitude, while exhibiting partial stealth characteristics for a marginal improvement in survivability. However, such an approach was already considered excessively vulnerable to modern fighters and air defense by the late twentieth century. A Chinese magazine cover sported a concept image of the JH-XX in 2013, but the project appears to have been set aside for now.Instead, in the PLAAF elected to pursue a more ambitious approach: a slower but far stealthier flying wing like the U.S. B-2 and forthcoming B-21 Raider. A particular advantage of large flying wings is they are less susceptible to detection by low-bandwidth radar, such as those on the Navy's E-2 Hawkeye radar planes, which are effective at detecting the approach of smaller stealth fighters.While China's development of stealth aircraft technology in the J-20 and J-31 stealth fighter was an obvious prerequisite for the H-20 project, so apparently was Xi'an's development of the hulking Y-20 'Chubby Girl' cargo plane , which established the company's capability to build large, long-range aircraft using modern computer-aided design and manufacturing techniquesprecision technology essential for mass producing the exterior surfaces of stealth aircraft.According to a study by Rick Joe at The Diplomat, Chinese publications began speculating about the H-20 in the early 2010s. Postulated characteristics include four non-afterburning WS-10A Taihang turbofans sunk into the top of the wing surface with S-shaped saw-toothed inlets for stealth. It's worth noting that the WS-10 has been plagued by major problems, but that hasn't stopped China from manufacturing fighters using WS-10s , with predictably troubled results.The new strategic bomber is expected to have a maximum un-refueled combat radius exceeding 5,000 miles and payload between the H-6's ten tons and the B-2's twenty-three tons. This is because the H-20 is reportedly designed to strike targets beyond the "second island ring" (which includes U.S. bases in Japan, Guam, the Philippines, etc.) from bases on mainland China. The third island chain extends to Hawaii and coastal Australia.In a U.S.-China conflict, the best method for neutralizing U.S. air power would be to destroy it on the ground (or carrier deck), especially in the opening hours of a war. While ballistic missiles and H-6 bombers can already contribute to this with long-range missiles, these are susceptible to detection and interception given adequate forewarning. A stealth bomber could approach much closer to carrier task forces and air bases before releasing its weapons, giving defenses too little time to react. An initial strike might in fact focus on air defense radars, "opening the breach" for a follow up wave of less stealthy attacks.The H-20 will also likely be capable of carrying nuclear weapons, finally giving China a full triad of nuclear-capable submarines, ballistic missiles and bombers. Though the H-6 was China's original nuclear bomber, these are no longer configured for nuclear strike, though that could change if air-launched nuclear-tipped cruise or ballistic missile are devised. Beijing is nervous that the United States' limited ballistic missile defense capabilities might eventually become adequate for countering China's small ICBM and SLBM arsenal. The addition of a stealth bomber would contribute to China's nuclear deterrence by adding a new, difficult-to-stop vector of nuclear attack that the U.S. defenses aren't designed to protect against.Some Chinese publications also argue that the H-20 will do double-duty as a networked reconnaissance and command and control platform similar to U.S. F-35 stealth fighters . This would make sense, as China has developed a diverse arsenal of long-range air-, ground- and sea-launched missiles, but doesn't necessarily have a robust reconnaissance network to form a kill-chain cueing these missiles to distant targets. Theoretically, an H-20 could rove ahead, spying the position of opposing sea-based assets using a low-probability-of-intercept AESA radar, and fuse that information to a firing platform hundreds or even thousands of miles away. The H-20 could also be used for electronic warfare or to deploy specialized directed energy.The crescendo of publicity surrounding the H-20 indicates the PLAAF believes the plane will soon be ready enough to show to the publicand international audiences. Once revealed, analysts will pour over the aircraft's geometry to estimate just how the stealthy it really is, looking for radar-reflective Achilles' heels such as exposed engine inlets and indiscrete tail stabilizers. However, external analysis cannot provide a full assessment, because the quality of the radar-absorbent materials applied to surfaces, and the finesse of the manufacturing (avoiding seams, protruding screws, etc.) has a major impact on radar cross-section.It is worth bearing in mind, however, that an H-20 seeking to slip through the gauntlet of long-range search radars scattered across the Pacific to launch CJ-10K cruise missiles with a range of over nine hundred miles would not require the same degree of stealth as an F-35 intended to penetrate more densely defended airspace and launch small diameter bombs with a range of 70 miles.Analysts forecast the H-20's first flight in the early 2020s, with production possibly beginning around 2025. If the H-20 is judged to be of credible design, the Pentagon in turn will have to factor the strategic implications of China's stealth capabilities, and will likely seek to field implement counter-stealth technologies which formerly have been mostly vaunted by Russia and China. The publicity which the often-secretive Chinese government is according the H-20 also indicates Beijing's hope the bomber will serve as a strategic deterrent to foreign adversarieseven before its first flight.Sebastien Roblin holds a master's degree in Conflict Resolution from Georgetown University and served as a university instructor for the Peace Corps in China.

Good morning, everyone, thanks for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, January 24th. Your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the east coast. Markets are edging higher this morning. Investors watching for the first European Central Bank meeting of the year. We will see more headlines coming out of Europe this morning. Earnings are also driving the action. Among the companies reporting today their fourth quarter, JetBlue, Southwest Airlines, Bristol-Myers.The State of the Union on hold, President Trump is delaying his address until after the government reopens. What that means for the shutdown showdown, now entering day 34. Carlos Ghosn has resigned from Renault. The board of the French automaker meeting today to replace him. We have the very latest there. And moments ago, I sat down with IBM's CEO Ginni Rometty, and first asked her about IBM's growth and earnings last night.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)GINNI ROMETTY, CEO, IBM: After the full year, we returned to growth, improved our operating margins and our EPS positive growth. And so, what you saw was the acceleration of our cloud, data and analytics still very important and growing, and you saw what we call our cognitive, our A.I. businesses as part of that, our solutions all did well in our services business. So really, all the businesses did a really good job.BARTIROMO: What are you seeing from businesses today in terms of executives putting new money to some of these services? How does the pipeline look?ROMETTY: Yes, this is interesting. Because as I sort of step back and look around the world, every so often do you see a change? And you can actually see a change in what people are looking at. There are some things are the same. So, one is everyone is really still investing and believing as I do that data, A.I., are going to allow them to fundamentally compete differently. And so, it's got to do about their decision making, about improving every process, that stays the same.But I flip to the other side, I do see a remix in what people are looking for now. And I think it says something about what's in front of us. I would have seen all of many proposals all around innovation. Now, they're a blend between innovation and cost savings. So, you see this productivity focus coming back in. So, that's usually when people say, look, I'm going to bet on this but I'm also going to -- I want this to return faster. So, you see projects coming in in a shorter period of time. So, I think you see people starting to react to some uncertainty and saying, I'm going to play both sides of this at the same time, productivity as well as my innovation at the same time.BARTIROMO: See, that worries me a little for the broad economy because I know when there's uncertainties and there has been obviously uncertainties with the government shutdown, with the tariffs, people sit on cash.ROMETTY: Yes.BARTIROMO: So, do you think they'll be sitting on cash or are there certain areas like you just mentioned that are must invests?ROMETTY: You know, there are must invests, and I think you also see they're still investing but it's in areas that not only in front side digital, they're looking at their core systems and saying, hey, these could perform better and they'll perform with some productivity and efficiency, so you see both sides.BARTIROMO: What kind of a '19 are you expecting?ROMETTY: Look, I think a '19, as I look around the world, I see all different segments continuing to plan on there being growth. And so, they are continuing to do their investments, but again, I sort of repeat myself, they're saying but I'm going to play both sides and I'm going to also be ready with a productivity play as well.BARTIROMO: Can you compare the U.S. to the rest of the world? Because, of course, we've got some messiness, noise in Europe, whether it'd be London and the U.K. or France or Italy and its budget issues, and then, of course, we saw some slower numbers in China, but 6.4 percent is still pretty good. Emerging markets also. How do you see those areas?ROMETTY: Yes. Look, I see in the U.S. many of the same things that people were focused on, again, enter the productivity play at the same time. And then, in -- obviously, in the U.K., you see folks that are still planning for multiple -- all of us planning for multiple scenarios. But I still see the car companies in Germany, whatever it is, are proceeding down their plans, still of transformation, and again, but with shorter timeframes as they look at projects. So, they put more milestones in. That's, I think, the best way to describe the difference in how you see demand -- people looking at closer in milestones, so they can make go, no-go decisions.BARTIROMO: What a year you've had. You announced your biggest acquisition, ever, Red Hat.ROMETTY: Yes.BARTIROMO: You sold assets to HCL. You did a deal, manufacturing deal with Samsung. First, let's talk Red Hat. What does that do for IBM? Where does that pivot the company?ROMETTY: Well, as you know, we have been reinventing IBM. So, we just had earnings, as you mentioned, 50 percent of the company, pretty steadily now, 50 percent has moved into these new products and services. But you're always redoing the portfolio. And one of the things that with the acquisition I'll get to, then the divestitures, but the acquisition was really about what we see in front of us for what I call Chapter 2 of the cloud.I really believe for most enterprises, Chapter 1 was easy things that they moved, pretty low hanging fruit. And if you size it, 20 percent is what's moved to the cloud. The other 80 now becomes not just more complex, it's got a different complexion. Most companies weren't born yesterday, so they -- it's just like if you have a house already, you've got your house, and they say, OK, these rooms, I'm not going to touch, I'm going to leave them as they are. These are going to get remodeled, move to the public cloud. These, you know what, they're so sensitive, I'm going to keep them right here and put them in a private cloud.BARTIROMO: And that's a great way to put it.ROMETTY: So, that's really what Red Hat and us together says for all you clients out there, this journey now is you're going to have multiple clouds. They have between five and 16. They're difficult to manage, the security, move the data. And don't get locked into anyone. And so, what we now become the greatest proponent of open and open source. And so, part of Red Hat is how you build things, so that they can move from cloud to cloud in private and around. So, this allows clients to move to a multi- cloud era, open so they're not locked in, in a very secure way so they make their cloud journey from where they start. And it really allows us to own the sort of starting point and the ending point of a cloud journey. So, that's part of the portfolio.BARTIROMO: Yes, before we go to the rest, in terms of divestitures and your plans, how do you differentiate yourself in that business? Because you've got all these guys nipping at your kneels -- heels.ROMETTY: Yes.BARTIROMO: You've got Microsoft here and Google there, and then there's Amazon. Amazon wants to take market share from everybody. So, tell us the sales pitch or how you differentiate at IBM.ROMETTY: Yes. Well, first off, when you think of IBM, think of your mission critical work, and then, think of us as the one that -- we believe it will be a multi-cloud world, but we believe we'll have the most secure public cloud for mission-critical work. But we'll also help you manage and integrate all these other clouds together. So, we are the -- I would call the cloud for business is how I differentiate us.BARTIROMO: And big business as well as small and mid-cap?ROMETTY: As well as small. We've got plenty.BARTIROMO: Because that's a big part of the bases, right?ROMETTY: Hundreds of thousands of small clients as well, right?BARTIROMO: Right. Right.ROMETTY: And so, you'll just see a different mix between how -- what percentage runs on a public cloud versus a private cloud. And I mean, you probably don't realize that most clients, they may have their CRM system, their sales -- with Salesforce, they may have an H.R. system with SAP or with Workday, they already have all of these different real estate. But, all of us know the big job is how to manage it, access control, security, know what data is where, and how much data do you want flowing. So, these are all the things that -- actually, this is why I say it's Chapter 2. Now, we get -- and that's a trillion-dollar market, Chapter 2. We will be number one in what the world calls "hybrid cloud," that is Chapter 2, and we'll be number one. That's the differentiation.BARTIROMO: Is there a cultural difference -- I mean, Red Hat and IBM, two very different companies. How do you get that culture right?ROMETTY: Yes, I've always heard this, right? And I've known Jim Whitehurst and we know Red Hat for many, many years. We've partnered with them for -- oh, my goodness gracious -- it goes back to -- our familiarity and our investment in Linux goes back 20 years. Linux is the open- operating system, what people mostly think of when they think of open. And so, we're one of the greatest contributors, one of the top contributors of all the projects out there. So, I think counter to what may be a perception is, IBM is the greatest supporter of open source. So, there are some things we have that are proprietary, but you and I have talked about blockchain, that's all open sourced. We open sourced that on purposed to make it fly. And in fact, Red Hat has got Linux, the operating system. It's the number one operating system in a company on premise as well as now in the cloud. This year, we took over number one over the others.And so, we view this as part of our DNA to be open and one of the -- so I don't see it cultural, but I do see two things: we're going to preserve for them, though. It's really important what they do not just runs on IBM, it's going to run on all of our competitors and you know, friendly competition as well. These are -- our clients use all these. So, it will be on all the other clouds. We want that to -- we want to preserve that and make sure that they have equal opportunity on what they do. And then, what we do is we take the same products from Red Hat, we add to it, and then we'll compete in that world.BARTIROMO: You've called them the strategic imperatives.ROMETTY: Yes. Yes. Around cloud, around analytics, around mobility. And that's the part of the business that's well over -- getting 50 percent now.BARTIROMO: Anything else you want to say about how you're repositioning the portfolio given the other things like the divestitures.ROMETTY: Well, and some of the -- look, we as an investor would always expect, we always go back over this portfolio. And what IBM is a high- value company, which means we are always -- we've been around 108 now, to be another 100, you've always got to keep moving the portfolio and our value proposition to investors is that it's about we always move to higher value. Which means it's not always about growth for us. Because we will remove products that are starting to commoditize so that we can always fuel investment in the next era.And so, what we did there, what you saw was some products that really they were standalone and they weren't growing. And we said look, our value prop to a client is we integrate things for them. If these are standalone, there's a better fit for them. And so, we did a divestiture, it's about $2 billion of divestitures there that really don't line up. They're individual with our integrated value proposition. And so, that's all part -- and we'll continue to keep looking at that.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: Much more of my interview with IBM's CEO Ginni Rometty in just a moment. We will talk about government regulation and privacy. Coming up, shutdown showdown, we are entering day 34, the heated battle over funding the border wall causing President Trump to delay the State of the Union Address. The latest coming up.And then, stepping aside, Carlos Ghosn officially resigning as Chairman of Renault as he sits in a Japanese jail cell for more than a month, details coming up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are coming to you live from Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic Forum this week. Moments ago, I sat down with the CEO of IBM, Ginni Rometty, after a strong quarter this week. Here's what she said about privacy and regulation.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: You've also become a statesman or stateswoman in the industry, in an environment where people are worried about privacy.ROMETTY: Yes.BARTIROMO: You've talked a lot about this. What would you like to see on the regulatory front in terms of privacy?ROMETTY: Yes, I've -- the reason I've talked so much about it is two front. One is, I feel our license to operate is trust. And so, people have got to trust us and what we do with their data. So, on one front on data, we've been very clear, the purpose of our technology is to augment man. The owner of the data, the data belongs to the owner, we do not take it. The insights from that data belong to them. Others have different business models, that's not ours. I will not compete with my clients there.So, first off, be clear on your principles on this. But when you get deregulation, what I do see happening around the world is because there's so much, you know, angst about this topic, governments are anxious to regulate. And so, my recommendation strung has been there needs to be what I call precision regulation, like precision medicine. Right? You don't want the doctor to kill the whole body when he's just treating one piece.And the precision, meaning we do need for consumer privacy consent, opt-in, opt-out, see your data, be able to remove yourself. That's where we need some regulation and liability. You shouldn't as a platform be able to do - - host illegal information, false information, influence an election. Those are illegal things. So, there should be liability. But I call that precision because my big fear is that someone would in exuberance here to regulate this, you go too far, you could end up derailing consequential in -- of the whole digital economy, right? So, an intended consequence of it.BARTIROMO: Sure.ROMETTY: So, that's why I've been so strong about precision regulation. But focus on building the trust.BARTIROMO: What's most important about A.I. that companies need to recognize and how you're delivering it?ROMETTY: The most important thing is it will change 100 percent of jobs but it can make us all do what we do better. And I think the most important thing, A, is to humanize it. B, is to realize to get value from it. You really have to change the way you do work. I say that I've met with so many clients out here, and I say you have random acts of digital everywhere. And I think we're kind of getting through this phase where clients -- millions things, nothing's scaled. And so, what it can really do is change the basis of your decision making in a company, and that can completely reset -- you'll compete on expertise. So, it resets your competitive basis.BARTIROMO: Yes. But I mean, on a practical level, I mean, A.I. being used in companies that are actually, you know, in the cloud, using your services, you know, and that's obviously an important business. What changes will they see?ROMETTY: Oh, look, I'll give you a very simple one. I think everyone can sort of identify with, human resources. Any of us work in a company, there's a human resource. Some group that we interfaced with, we get paid, we train ourselves all sorts. My own -- my own human resources, nine big points where we use artificial intelligence. One, predict attrition, so that you head it off. Second, be sure everyone's paid fairly. Third, help you with what is the optimal career path for someone like you with your skills. You're new to IBM, you go tour Web site, it's all A.I. that interfaces and says, if you'll allow me to look at your resume, allow me maybe to look at your -- you know, one of your external sites, if you give me permission, I'll look at it and I'm going to match you to jobs you haven't thought about.And because of that, we have 3X, the applicants because (AUDIO GAP) so, that to me and (AUDIO GAP) H.R. over the last four years, we've saved maybe $400 million and reduced by 26 percent, some of what the staffing needed to do work. So, that's very practical to me. And in fact, in your net promoter score in the 90s. So now, everyone in the company understands what H.R. -- what A.I. is because they viscerally deal with it every day. So, that's going to be a great example.BARTIROMO: Fantastic. That's a great analogy. Thank you for that. It just makes it -- our audience, it really resonates with them. OK. 2019, we're hearing a lot of gloom and doom here, a lot of people are talking about this global slowdown. I feel like we started the year talking about a synchronized growth story. And now we're talking about synchronized slowdown. How do you see it?ROMETTY: Well, I think I've come here now enough that every year, everyone talks themselves -- you know, last year was exuberance, right?(CROSSTALK)ROMETTY: So, in this year, the other direction. So, we're probably somewhere in the middle of that. It's probably -- my guess of this is every year, you come through this here. So, I think as I listen through here, we're just in a time -- no one likes uncertainty, right? And we have a number of uncertain things around us. So, everyone's anxious to move through a number of these things. And again, as you and I started the conversation, therefore I think you see people planning for contingency, planning on both sides.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: My thanks to IBM's CEO Ginni Rometty. Quick break. A big day of earnings. We will bring you the numbers as soon as they hit the tape. Tell you how it's impacting markets. And the software business taking things to new heights on the cloud, the CEO of SAP, Bill McDermott is here, live for an exclusive interview on big technology and a big acquisition he made this week, that's coming up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The big business of the cloud, SAP announcing yesterday, it closed an $8 billion acquisition of Qualtrics, a survey software company. Joining me right now in a Fox Business exclusive is the CEO of SAP, Bill McDermott. And Bill, it's always a pleasure. Good to see you.BILL MCDERMOTT, CEO, SAP: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Tell us what's so special about Qualtrics and why this acquisition now. Where does it take SAP?MCDERMOTT: There's a huge trust deficit in the economy. So, customers aren't necessarily getting what they paid for, which is why there's a 1.6 trillion deficit in customers that defect from companies that are out there in the marketplace today. So, how do you keep a loyal customer? Today's systems create operating data. You know your customer, you know your people, you know your suppliers. But we need to know what are consumers saying in real-time, in the moment, that sentiment analysis. Qualtrics is the number one experienced management company in the world. So, now, if you're a CEO, your customers will love your products. In fact, they'll be obsessed with them. And your brand will become a religion because every employee is an ambassador, that's connected inextricably to the customer experience. That's Qualtrics.BARTIROMO: So, what does it do? I mean, how will I see the difference as a customer?MCDERMOTT: So, if you're a customer of SAP, now you have all the experience data, I call this X-data, of all the consumers that are experiencing your product and your brand. You combine that with the O- data, which is all the operational data of how you run your company, from your demand all the way through to your supply, you know everything. If you take X plus O, you have the winning formula. So X and O.BARTIROMO: Yes, I love it.MCDERMOTT: SAP and Qualtrics.BARTIROMO: Hugs and kisses.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Congratulations, Bill.MCDERMOTT: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about the environment, the backdrop. I know you're reporting earnings next week, so you're going to be guarded in terms of what you can say. But in terms of the broad environment, we've been hearing a lot about a global slowdown. You're the largest company in Europe, the largest technology company in Europe, and of course, we've got lots of messiness going on in Europe from Brexit to Italy, et cetera. What are you seeing in Europe and across the world?MCDERMOTT: We have very strong business, so there is absolutely no signs in our business that there is this global slowdown. And because we serve the best-run businesses in the world, we're usually an early indicator of what's going on out there. So, we see a very optimistic future and our pipelines and our business model has not changed one iota. So, I think that there is this disjoint between kind of the consumer companies and the consumer world and the enterprise. Because enterprise companies have to keep up with modern technologies and modern platforms to stay competitive. We're in the poll position as the number one business software company in the world, and I think that leadership position is serving us very well.BARTIROMO: You've been repositioning the product line. You've Oracle nipping at your heels, Microsoft over here. How do you change the product line or do the shifting that you've been doing to differentiate, to stay on top like that?MCDERMOTT: 77 percent of the world's transactions run through an SAP system. So, we manage everything from the customer relationship, to how you manage your people, to how you build great products and how you ship on time and deliver. Now, we have experienced management which is the ultimate touch point for customers and we put it all in the cloud. So, you can be nimble, you can be agile, you can upgrade quickly, you don't need a whole lot of resources to maintain these systems, and we're moving faster than anyone in 25 industries and on our 93 countries around the world.So, where do we leave them in the dust? We basically out-innovated everybody in terms of how you run your business better. Now, the idea is how you create an unbelievable human experience, so you inspire your people to take care of your customer and create a loyalty effect that's unlike any other company in the industry. That's what we do. And I think it's really important that you focus on the business of your customer, and stay obsessed with that and not get caught up in a lot of tech jargon. That's why I'm glad we're the business software market leader.BARTIROMO: Yes, I'm glad you said that because there is a lot of tech jargon out there. Explain the upgraded S/4 Hana.MCDERMOTT: S/4 Hana is now the system from the demand signal of your consumer in any channel including e-commerce. We know your consumer. We align the product and the proper configuration at the proper price based on the customer's history and all the loyalty that they should earn from their business with you. We ship, we take care of the whole supply chain so you get what you want at the price you procured for anyplace in real-time in the world. That whole value chain is SAP. S/4 Hana is now in a cloud. So, you can run your entire company from end to end on top of SAPs S/4 Hana platform in the cloud. Game change. But again, I go back to that's all the operational data and all the operational processes.Now, if you can add experiences to this, with Qualtrics you've got an unbeatable competitive advantage. So, I'm signing up customers left and right on this idea in Davos because this has been the number one thing that businesses have forgotten, you have to have the experience under control with your consumers and it has to be real-time sentiment analysis. So, just think, it's five times more expensive to get a new customer than keep the one you have. Don't you want to know how they're doing?BARTIROMO: Some companies want to do their -- you know, some business with SAP, smaller business with somebody else. How do you get the market share where you take all of that business to SAP?MCDERMOTT: The smartest CEOs know the power of integration. When you integrate your business processes on an end-to-end basis and you have full visibility on what's happening, you're running a solid company.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about China because that has been a big topic of discussion here. People are expecting China to slow down, becoming an overhang a bit. How is that impacting your business?MCDERMOTT: Yes, I keep hearing this China slowdown. I guess it's going on like eight or 10 years in a row now.BARTIROMO: Yes, six percent growth.MCDERMOTT: And what people realize is, you know, six percent growth, you're minting new countries every year. So, I have no doubt that the growth rate is probably slowing down, but our China business is the fastest growing in the world. So, we think very strongly that the number one economy in the world, the U.S. economy, and the number two economy in the world, the China economy, coming together in a highly-collaborative way is good for the world, and it's good for the world economy.BARTIROMO: Do you think we're going to see a China deal between the U.S. and China sooner?MCDERMOTT: I'm hopeful. I'm hopeful and actually I'm quite optimistic. I think both sides realize there's a wonderful opportunity to create value and a balanced playing field and serve customers in ways that are highly compelling and also profitable. So, I think there's a deal there because it's good for business.BARTIROMO: How does the news of the day impact things? When you look at the markets, markets are up today. And obviously, January has had a better tone than the end of 2018, but are markets telling us something in terms of this volatility and this downdraft?MCDERMOTT: Well, markets like certainty. You know, stock markets like to know things are solid, and any time there's uncertainty, whether it's Brexit or it's the China situation --BARTIROMO: Or the government shutdown.MCDERMOTT: Or the government shutdown.BARTIROMO: President announced pushing off the State of the Union Address, Nancy Pelosi basically saying don't come to the House chambers.MCDERMOTT: Right. These are all uncertainties. But we live in an uncertain world. And if it's not this set of uncertainties, there'll be others. What we try to do and this is what's special about the SAP software, we configure the software based upon these regulatory and governance changes.That's why, in tough times, we're highly resilient because you're still going to need to modify the way you do your work. In good times, we're even more resilient because now we're going for growth.So, in all cases, the SAP platform is helping companies run better.BARTIROMO: Has the shutdown impacted your business in any way, the government shutdown?MCDERMOTT: It hasn't. It hasn't yet. But, you know, we obviously recognize that, you know, the psychology of optimism can't possibly be overstated in its importance. So, we like to see optimism, we like to he see positivity. So, we're hopeful that it gets back in real action real soon.BARTIROMO: I know you wrote a blog post for the World Economic Forum, saying that it's time to rebuild trust.MCDERMOTT: Yes.BARTIROMO: What are you messaging? What are you trying to say?MCDERMOTT: Well, if you -- we surveyed with Qualtrics and SAP, along with the World Economic Forum here. We surveyed 10,000 individuals on a random sample, in 29 different countries, and we asked them a couple of questions.One question was, what are you really worried about out there? Most humans said we're worried about being replaced by robots, which is really interesting. We said is tech for good or tech for bad? What's happening in your world, in your perception, technology?They said, well, a little bit better than negative, but somewhat ambivalent. That's a concern. And they said that they're basically trusting the people that run their companies even more than the people that run governments, so there's a trust deficit out.BARTIROMO: Right.MCDERMOTT: And --BARTIROMO: And we're going to talk about that, coming up.MCDERMOTT: And it's really important that we close that trust deficit at the leadership level, but also it's important that companies get the human experience going with their own employees and their customers and that's why I think this experience management positioning for SAP is going to fundamentally be a moment in time on show today, Maria, where the enterprise has been redefined by SAP.I give you my word on that. A year from now, let's talk about that.BARTIROMO: We will, Qualtrics, congratulations on the deal.MCDERMOTT: Thank you very much, Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Bill McDermott, joining us. CEO --MCDERMOTT: Great pleasure. Thank you.BARTIROMO: -- at SAP. We'll take a break. When we come back, government shutdown stretches on. Tomorrow marks two weeks since the government workers last saw a paycheck. Now, President Trump's State of the Union Address is being delayed, details, coming up.New privacy concerns over Huawei, meanwhile, the Chinese government dismissing claims of espionage within the company. That's next, back in a moment.ANNOUNCER: Here again is Maria Bartiromo with a special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA, live from Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic Forum.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, live from Switzerland. It is Thursday, January 24th. Thank you so much for joining us this morning, your top stories right now, 6:35 on the East Coast.Markets expecting to open higher this morning, take a look at Futures, we're looking at fractional gains, but nonetheless, higher across the board. Dow Industrials right now up 15 points, S&P 500 up 2 points and the NASDAQ, higher by 28.Solid earnings reports from IBM, United Technologies, Procter & Gamble, helping lift the markets yesterday, certainly, big move at the close. Dow Industrials up 171 points, big move on IBM. We spoke with Ginni Rometty after her earnings.The Dow is up three quarters of one percent, the S&P 500, up six, a quarter of a percent, and the NASDAQ, up a fraction, five points higher right now.In Europe this morning, the major indices looked like this, and there are two, you are seeing some gains, although the FT-100 in London remains lower, down nine points on the Financial Times. The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 36, three quarters of a percent, and the DAX Index up 58 points, that's one-half of one percent.Asian markets, overnight, closed mostly higher. Take a look at the numbers, best performer there, as you can see, was Korea, KOSPI Index up almost one percent. Fractional moves pretty much, though, throughout Asia, overnight.Earnings season in full swing now, Southwest reporting moments ago. It beat on earnings and revenue per share at $5.7 billion in revenue for Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, JetBlue, reporting later this morning. As soon as the numbers hit the tape, we'll have them for you and show you the stocks involved.Then, there is, of course, the shutdown. We are now in this day 34 showdown. President Trump is now delaying his State of the Union Address until the shutdown is over. We will have the very latest.And then, this, Carlos Ghosn resigns, the embattled executive, officially out of Renault, as CEO, even as he maintains his innocence in finance charges -- on finance charges in Japan. He is sitting in a Japanese jail cell, still.This morning, joining the conversation, Microsoft President Brad Smith is with me, talking about the technology sector in an exclusive interview.I'll also be talking in an exclusive with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise President and CEO Antonio Neri, a first on FOX Interview with Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, he'll talk markets in the Trump economy, and another first on FOX Interview with U.N. General Secretary Antonio Guterres, he will talk global issues here in Davos. We got a big 2 hours, coming up, 2-1/2 hours, so don't miss a moment of it.Let's kick it off here with our top story this half hour, Huawei's growing privacy concerns. The chairman of the technology company in China, dismissing claims that the company is engaged in espionage with the Chinese government, we continue to hear stories of spying.This comes after Huawei's CFO was arrested and detained in Canada, on suspicion. She violated U.S. sanctions against Iran, back in December, not to mention the spying. The U.S. government says it's skeptical of Huawei's close relationship with the Chinese government. It is, of course, a Chinese company and it's a communist country.Joining me right now is Edelman CEO Richard Edelman, talking about trust, and Richard, it is good to see you this morning.RICHARD EDELMAN, CEO, EDELMAN: Always good to be here.BARTIROMO: Thank you for joining us. You're here with your global trust study. But, before that, let me get your take on the privacy issues surrounding China.EDELMAN: You know, I think that trust is the essential component for a corporation and Chinese companies really have an issue because they're seen as, you know, non-transparent. They don't really have governance, the same standard as global. And there are issues related to how close they are to government.BARTIROMO: Yes. And we know that China has been stealing I.P. for decades, in terms of American businesses and we're going to get into that in a moment. But you're out with your trust report. This is the global business trust, Edelman does this every year. This is your 2019 barometer. Tell me what it says.EDELMAN: The big story this year is trust moved from being top-down, then to peer to peer, and this year, it has gone local. So my employer is the most trusted institution in the world, 20 points above any other.And what's significant here is also that three quarters of the respondents told us they want CEOs to stand up and speak up and act, and not wait for government, because they see that CEOs can do things on important issues, whether it is trade or innovation. That's what business is supposed to lead on.BARTIROMO: I think it's really important that you bring this up, that people trust their own company. But I thought it was overwhelming. Seventy-five percent of employees say that they trust their own employer more than sectors, like business, government and media.EDELMAN: The reason for this, Maria, is, you know, in a full employment economy, I feel as if I have control. I can move companies if I don't like it. And when, you know, people stand up and walk out at a company and say I don't like your policy about me too or other things, you know, it's a very significant time.And the pyramid which used to be like this, the (INAUDIBLE) has flipped upside down. So, the bottom people really seem like they have a voice now.BARTIROMO: So what do those other areas need to do? Business, the media, tell us.EDELMAN: Well, basically, I think that there's a new contract between the employer and the employee. And the first thing is that a company has to stand for something, have a big mission. The second is, you know, it has to focus on its home market. Third, it's got to talk to its employees and inform them. And lastly, the CEO's got to be out front so that the rest of the people feel as if they can speak.BARTIROMO: In another portion of the survey, you asked about the most trusted business sectors, technology coming in most trusted, financial services, last.EDELMAN: That's been the same for a decade.BARTIROMO: Why do they trust technology so much when we know we just got let down during the election with the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook.EDELMAN: Here's the thing, there's a separation in people's minds between technology and platforms. And what's fascinating to us this year, about media, you'll love this, is a zoom in terms of media engagement. Mainstream media is 65 percent trusted. It is the source of quality information. People are desperate for good information. They don't trust that which they just hear on social. It's not good enough.BARTIROMO: So, social media is --EDELMAN: There's 35-point gap between mainstream and social. It's a fantastic opportunity for you.BARTIROMO: That is incredible. Richard, it's great to have you on the program.EDELMAN: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Thank you for dropping that good news.EDELMAN: Of course. Why not?BARTIROMO: Richard Edelman, joining us from Edelman. Good to see you.EDELMAN: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Coming up, the President versus the Speaker, Nancy Pelosi barring President Trump from the House Chamber, to deliver the State of the Union, details coming up next.And then, earnings in full swing, we just heard from Southwest Airlines, McCormick, Ford, sees a slide after reporting earnings miss. That was yesterday. We're breaking down all the numbers. Take a look at Ford this morning.Stay with us, back in a moment, live from Davos.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Shutdown showdown, now day 34 of the partial government shutdown. President Trump is now delaying his State of the Union address. The president tweeted late last night this: "As the shutdown was going on, Nancy Pelosi asked me to give the State of the Union address, I agreed. She then changed her mind because of the shutdown suggesting a later date. This is her prerogative. I will do the address when the shutdown is over. I'm not looking for an alternative venue for the State of the Union address because there is no venue that can compete with the history, tradition, and importance of the House Chamber. I look forward to giving a great State of the Union address in the near future!" Joining me right now in New York: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, CFRA Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell with us this morning. So happy to finally hear from our panel in New York. Ladies, good morning.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria.LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH: Good morning.MCDOWELL: Terrific interviews, though, so far.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. I'm very surprised that the president is not just taking up Rand Paul, Lindsey Graham's idea to just do it in the Senate. What are your thoughts, Dagen, on this news?MCDOWELL: Well, now, we know that the high road is up ahead and, on the right, and not the left. And this is -- again, shining the spotlight on Nancy Pelosi being dug in and doing absolutely nothing except a tit-for-tat for the cameras to open the government. What would be really interesting today are these two dueling votes that will come up in the Senate. One voting on President Trump's plan, $5.7 billion in barrier and border security funding along with a three-year protection for the DREAMers, along with the Democrats' plan to just reopen the government until February 8th, and then try and come up with a solution then.Hopefully, this will get some movement and force some discussions and the beginning of a compromise between the Democrats and the Republicans. There's growing pressure to do something. Kevin Hassette said yesterday, that the economy might not grow, might have zero percent growth in the first quarter, so they both better get off their, you know what, and get something done to reopen the government.BARTIROMO: You know what I can't believe? Nancy Pelosi continues to call a wall immoral. But Dagen, she has a wall in her own state. She's got a wall in California that separates Tijuana from San Diego.MCDOWELL: On that note, later this week, that Democrats are -- now they're trying to draft a letter to map out how they would support spending about $5 billion on border security measures. Not mentioning a wall but other things because they look weak on the border. They look like that they support, quite frankly, more and more open borders, and they don't support protecting the people who live here in the United States.So, they're trying to, kind of, do a song and dance over in the Senate. I mean, in the house. The Democrats are, to look like that they're doing something. But there's great -- you know, there's greater pressure, there was a town hall that Mitt Romney had, his first as a senator, where somebody stood up in Utah and said, can you all hire a divorce mediator to talk it out with you guys because you're not getting anything done, which I thought was hilarious.BARTIROMO: Well, I don't know, at the end of the day, if voters are going to ultimately blame the Democrats, to say you know what, this resist, resist, resist campaign is getting nothing done. So, there's that, Lindsey.BELL: Yes, I mean, I think the good news is that it seems like we're getting closer to a negotiation between the Democrats and Republicans here, like Dagen said, the Democrats are coming out with their talking points of what they think border security should look like. And there are these votes that are going to happen in the Senate today that should hopefully lead to some discussion between the two parties.BARTIROMO: That's right. Yes, there are two bills there. So, we will take a look at that and also, Lindsey, you've got to give us an update on earnings so far. We'll do that after this short break. Because markets are up right now; we've got some strong earnings on the docket. Crisis, meanwhile, Venezuela; clashes breaking out after President Trump recognizes an opposition leader as the country's true president. Details coming up. And then, Carlos Ghosn officially resigning from Renault. The embattled executive stepping down from Renault, even as he maintains his innocence on finance charges in Japan. What happens next for the French automaker and why is he still sitting in a Japanese jail.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Breaking news this morning, a St. Louis police officer has died after being shot. Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines right now in New York. Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, we're just following this story early this morning, Maria. The off-duty female officer was at another officer's home when she was accidentally shot in the chest. She was rushed to the hospital. She did later die. Two on-duty officers were at the home when the gun went off. It's not clear whose gun this was. So, a lot of questions. The officer, whose name hasn't been released, was just 24-years-old. We're going to bring you more information as we get it this morning. A breaking story we're following.Well, now to the overseas news. Carlos Ghosn has resigned as Chairman and Chief Executive of Renault and the French car maker's board seized on that move. They meet today to replace Ghosn, creating a path to hopefully repairing relations with long-time partner, Nissan. Ghosn arrested back in November in Japan, charged with misstating his salary in Nissan for years. He denies those allegations, but he's likely to remain in jail until at least March.Well, the crisis in socialist Venezuela reaching a breaking point. A group of world powers led by the United States has declared resistance leader, Juan Guaido, as the country's true president. The move comes as pro and anti-government demonstrators clash in the streets. Now, the Trump administration is also refusing to comply with Nicolas Maduro's 72-hour deadline to remove U.S. diplomats from the country. Vice President Mike Pence told FBN's Trish Regan, the U.S. will do what it can to restore democracy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: But the real work lies ahead and the United States is going to continue to bring the full weight of our economic and diplomatic pressure until freedom and democracy and fair elections are restored for the people of Venezuela.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: In Britain today, a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May says the 2018 presidential election in Venezuela, neither free no nor fair, and Britain supports Guaido. Well, in earnings news, Southwest Airlines posting adjusted profit $1.17 a share, they beat revenue, jumping 8-1/2 percent, 5.7 billion; shares of the company down 23 percent from a year ago. Stock to watch: Ford, reported an adjusted profit, 30-cents a share, fell short of expectations; revenue, $41.8 billion, that beat. Shares of Ford down about 30 percent from a year ago. All right, Maria, go a lot of big earnings coming out this morning and later today. Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right. Thank you so much, Cheryl. We will take a short break. When we come back, more live from Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic Forum. We are watching markets this morning and earnings. Then, a billionaire buys the world's most expensive home in America. We'll tell you how much and who, next hour, right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIA.

HRW urges New Zealand's Ardern to discuss Muslims in ChinaAssociated Press InternationalMarch 29, 2019 Friday 11:25 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 517 wordsDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - A rights group has urged New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to raise concerns about reported Chinese government abuses of Muslims during her upcoming visit to Beijing that was shortened after the killing of 50 worshippers at two mosques in New Zealand.Human Rights Watch said Friday that Ardern "spoke forcefully in defense of Muslims' rights" after the Christchurch attacks and should do so again in Beijing.Hundreds of thousands of Chinese Muslims have been detained without charge in internment camps, where relatives and ex-inmates say they have been subjected to physical abuse and forced to renounce Islam.Human Rights Watch said Ardern should publicly call on Chinese leaders to close the camps, end the abuses, and permit independent, international observers' access to the Xinjiang region that is home to China's largest mainly Muslim minority group, the Uighurs. Other members of Muslim groups, including Kazakhs and the Hui, have also faced internment and other forms of repression.China has so far rejected calls for independent observers and after first denying the camps' existence, now says they are voluntary vocational training centers that provide job skills to ward off religious extremism.Ardern is to meet with both President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang on her only day in Beijing on Monday.Relations between China and New Zealand have been strained after New Zealand's spy agency in November stopped mobile phone company Spark from using Huawei equipment in its planned 5G upgrade. The agency said the Chinese tech giant's equipment posed a "significant network security risk."  That brought indications of economic retaliation from China, New Zealand's largest trading partner and a key customer for its dairy and other agricultural products. Ardern said last month that no final decision has been made on whether Huawei equipment can be used in the country's slated 5G network. New Zealand media quoted Ardern as saying that she couldn't justify extending her Chinese trip beyond Beijing because "We are still very much in an operational response to the terrorist attack and we are still making sure that we have the right care in place for those victims."The gunman in the mosque killings cited China in his online manifesto as the country most aligned with his political and social values.Although Muslim countries have remained largely silent over the camps and other abuses against Chinese Muslims, some European nations and the U.S. have become increasingly vocal in their criticism.On Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with former inmates and family members, tweeting that he called on China to "end these counterproductive policies and release all arbitrarily detained.""The world cannot afford China's shameful hypocrisy toward Muslims. On one hand, China abuses more than a million Muslims at home, but on the other it protects violent Islamic terrorist groups from sanctions at the U.N.," Pompeo wrote, in a reference to China's repeated refusal to designate Masood Azhar, the head of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad, as a terrorist.Load-Date: March 30, 2019End of Document

HURD JOINS RUPPERSBERGER, HIMES AND CONAWAY TO INTRODUCE BIPARTISAN BILL TO FIGHT DIGITAL THREATS FROM CHINA, OTHERSStates News ServiceJanuary 18, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 552 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by the office of Texas Rep. Will Hurd:U.S. Representative Will Hurd (TX-23) joined Reps. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger (MD-02), Mike Conaway (TX-11) and Jim Himes (CT-04) to introduce bipartisan legislation that will toughen the United States' position against national security threats posed by technology competitors like China.China's state-directed and state-supported efforts to achieve economic dominance by stealing intellectual property from American businesses are well-documented. Meanwhile, the over-reliance of Americans on foreign products that have been identified as national security risks such as cell phones made by Chinese telecom giants Huawei and ZTE creates major supply chain risks."China's coordinated assault on American companies, the U.S. government and American intellectual property is part of a broader strategy aimed at attaining leadership in advanced technology and 21st century great power politics. We must continue to hold bad actors accountable," said Congressman Will Hurd, who spent nearly a decade fighting to secure our homeland as an undercover officer in the CIA. "I am proud to join my colleagues today to introduce this bipartisan bill that ensures that our nation uses every tool in our arsenal to combat this continued national security threat and keep Americans safe.""We can't be too tough when it comes to our national security," Congressman Ruppersberger said. "We have long suspected Beijing uses its telecom companies to spy on Americans and we know China is responsible for up to $600 billion in theft of U.S. trade secrets. It's time to get our ducks in a row: we need a coordinated, dedicated team armed with a long-term plan to ensure America maintains superiority.""Passivity in the face of increased global threats would be a grave mistake," said Congressman Himes. "Through the establishment of this office, we will not only increase our capacity to respond to Chinese aggression, but also signal to geopolitical rivals around the world that we will fiercely defend our national security, technology and intellectual property. This step is long overdue and will hopefully move us further toward a comprehensive cyber strategy.""Chinese telecommunications giants, such as Huawei and ZTE, have well established ties to the Chinese Communist Party and a long history of providing a vehicle for the Chinese government to spy on American citizens and our federal government," said Congressman Conaway. "It's critical that we respond to these rising national security threats aggressively, and utilize whatever tools we have available to prevent foreign entities from harming our country."The bill will create a new office within the White House that will serve as a central coordinator to combat the assault on American innovation which threatens our national security. The executive-level Office of Critical Technologies and Security will be tasked with interagency coordination and creating a long-term strategic plan to combat state-sponsored technology theft and supply chain vulnerabilities.The Office of Critical Technologies and Security will consult with federal regulators, the private sector, academics and experts to make sure every available tool is being used to protect the supply chain and emerging technologies.Load-Date: January 18, 2019End of Document

China sets robust growth target to shore up cooling economyAssociated Press InternationalMarch 5, 2019 Tuesday 6:06 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 1217 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - China announced a robust annual economic growth target and a 7.5 percent rise in military spending Tuesday as it convened an annual legislative session overshadowed by a tariff war with Washington.Seeking to defuse U.S. and European complaints the Chinese system is rigged against foreign companies, Premier Li Keqiang promised in a speech to the National People's Congress that they will be "treated as equals" with their Chinese competitors.Li, the country's top economic official, set this year's growth target at 6 to 6.5 percent, reflecting determination to shore up a cooling state-dominated economy and prevent politically dangerous job losses. Such a growth rate, if achieved, would be among the world's strongest. Yet it would be slightly below last year's 6.6 percent growth in China and would mark a new three-decade low.The slowdown in China, the world's second-largest economy after the United States, is likely to hold back international growth."China is still a very large locomotive pulling the global economy," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at SS Economics in Los Angeles. "As the Chinese economy slows, this will have an impact around the world. We are already seeing that impact."Still, Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University, suggested that a more manageable pace of growth in China could benefit the global economy in the long run."Slower but more balanced growth in China, especially if it was driven by domestic consumption demand and involved fewer financial system risks, could be a net positive for the world economy," Prasad said.At the legislative session in Beijing, Li promised to "promote China-U.S. trade negotiations," but gave no details of talks aimed at ending the fight with President Donald Trump over Beijing's technology ambitions and complaints it steals or pressures companies to hand over technology.Li, No. 2 in the ruling Communist Party behind President Xi Jinping, pledged higher spending on development of technologies including artificial intelligence, electric cars, biotechnology and new materials that China's leaders see as a path to prosperity and global influence. He also promised more money for education, social programs and public works construction.China's emergence as a competitor in smartphones, telecom equipment, solar power and other technologies has increased the range of products available to consumers and helped to drive down prices. But it rattles Washington and other governments that worry Chinese competition is a threat to their industries and employment.Li warned that the second-largest economy faces a "graver and more complicated environment" and risks that "are greater in number and size."The two-week gathering of the congress's 3,000-plus delegates in the cavernous Great Hall of the People is China's biggest event of the year. It does little lawmaking, but serves as a platform to highlight the government's plans for the year.Xi's government is expected to use this year's session to announce tax cuts and more support for entrepreneurs who generate much of China's new jobs and wealth.Legislators also are due to endorse a law that aims to ease tensions with Washington and Europe by discouraging officials from pressuring foreign companies to hand over technology.Higher government spending will push the budget deficit from 2.6 percent of total economic output to 2.8 percent, Li said.The plans reflect "emphatic pro-growth efforts" to "offset external headwinds," Vishnu Varathan of Mizuho Bank said in a report.Proposed tax cuts of up to 2 trillion yuan ($300 billion) would put "significant spending power" in the hands of consumers and companies, helping to buoy sagging demand for autos, household appliances and other goods, Varathan said.Spending on the Communist Party's military wing, the People's Liberation Army, will rise to 1.2 trillion yuan ($178 billion), according to a separate report issued by the finance ministry. China's total military outlay, the second-largest behind the United States, is estimated by independent experts to exceed $220 billion a year when off-budget expenses are added in.The spending will pay to expand China's navy and acquire advanced aircraft and other weapons to help Beijing enforce its territorial claims in the South China Sea.The slower rise in military spending, down from double digit increases in previous years, reflects changing priorities, said Yue Gang, a military expert and retired Chinese army colonel."It is more urgent for China to prepare for a trade war with the U.S., instead of a physical war," Yue said. Military reforms are nearly complete, and "China needs the money to be used for more urgent matters," he said.The tariff fight with Trump over Beijing's technology ambitions has rattled Chinese consumers and investors, prompting some to put off spending, which could add to downward pressure on economic growth.News reports say Washington and Beijing might be close to an agreement to end the battle. But the chief U.S. envoy, Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, said earlier the two sides still had much work to do.No agreements have been announced on the core of the dispute: U.S. pressure on Beijing to roll back its plans for state-led creation of global competitors in robotics and other technology.Washington, Europe and other trading partners say those violate China's market-opening obligations. Some American officials worry they might erode U.S. industrial leadership.It's unclear if Trump would be mollified by the technology measure, part of a law on foreign investment that state media say the congress is due to endorse.It would bar officials from using "administrative measures" to pressure companies to hand over technology. Foreign business groups welcomed the proposal but said they need to see enforcement rules to know whether it will improve conditions.Li tried to reassure investors by promising foreign companies will be "treated as equals" with Chinese enterprises in a "fair and impartial market environment."Foreign business groups and governments complain Beijing routinely violates its commitments under the World Trade Organization to ensure such equality, or "national treatment." They say rules on investment, technology licensing and other facets of business discriminate against foreign companies or shield Chinese enterprises from competition.Xi and other Chinese leaders have announced changes over the past year including tariff cuts on imported consumer goods and plans to allow full foreign ownership in auto manufacturing. But business groups say those have little impact on operating conditions.Beijing faces a WTO challenge filed in July by the European Union against technology licensing rules the 28-nation trade bloc said improperly hamper the ability of foreign companies to protect and profit from their technology.Li promised "competitive neutrality," or equal treatment of state-owned and private companies by regulators. But he gave no details of how far that might extend for foreign competitors."Enterprises under all forms of ownership will be treated on an equal footing," the premier said.___AP writers Yanan Wang and Christopher Bodeen and researcher Yu Bing in Beijing and AP Economics Writer Martin Crutsinger in Washington contributed to this report.Load-Date: March 6, 2019End of Document

DOES THIS BLURRY PICTURE PROVE CHINA'S H-20 STEALTH BOMBER IS THE REAL DEAL?States News ServiceMarch 25, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1522 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for the National Interest (former the Nixon Center):We have some ideas.by Sebastien RoblinThe crescendo of publicity surrounding the H-20 indicates the PLAAF believes the plane will soon be ready enough to show to the publicand international audiences. Once revealed, analysts will pour over the aircraft's geometry to estimate just how the stealthy it really is, looking for radar-reflective Achilles' heels such as exposed engine inlets and indiscrete tail stabilizers. However, external analysis cannot provide a full assessment, because the quality of the radar-absorbent materials applied to surfaces, and the finesse of the manufacturing (avoiding seams, protruding screws, etc.) has a major impact on radar cross-section.In October 2018, Chinese media announced that the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) would publicly unveil its new H-20 stealth bomber during a parade celebrating the air arm's seventieth anniversary in 2019.(This first appeared several months ago.)Prior news of the H-20's development had been teased using techniques pioneered by viral marketing campaigns for Hollywood movies. For example, the Xi'an Aviation Industrial Corporation released a promotional video in May 2018 pointedly imitating Northrop Grumman's own Superbowl ad for the B-21 stealth bomber, portraying a shrouded flying wing bomber in its final seconds. Later, the silhouette of a possible new bomber appeared at a PLAAF gala. This comes only two years after PLAAF Gen. Ma Xiaotian formally revealed the Hong-20's existence.If the H-20 does have the range and passable stealth characteristics attributed to it, it could alter the strategic calculus between the United States and China by exposing U.S. bases and fleets across the Pacific to surprise air attacks.Only three countries have both the imperative and the resources to develop huge strategic bombers that can strike targets across the globe: the United States, Russia and China. Strategic bombers make sense for China because Beijing perceives dominance of the western half of the Pacific Ocean as essential for its security due to its history of maritime invasion , and the challenge posed by the United States in particular. The two superpowers are separated by five to six thousand miles of oceanand the United States has spent the last century developing a network of island territories such as Guam, foreign military bases in East Asia and super-carriers with which it can project air and sea power across that span.Xi'an Aviation, the H-20's manufacturer, also builds China's H-6 strategic jet bombers , a knockoff the 1950s-era Soviet Tu-16 Badger which has recently been upgraded with modern avionics, aerial refueling capability and cruise missiles in the later H-6K and H-6J models. Beijing could easily have produced a successor in a similar vein, basically a giant four-engine airliner-sized cargo plane loaded with fuel and long-range missiles that's never intended to get close enough for adversaries to shoot back.Alternately, analyst Andreas Rupprecht reported that China considered developing a late-Cold War style supersonic bomber akin to the U.S. B-1 or Russian Tu-160 called the JH-XX. This would have lugged huge bombloads at high speed and low altitude, while exhibiting partial stealth characteristics for a marginal improvement in survivability. However, such an approach was already considered excessively vulnerable to modern fighters and air defense by the late twentieth century. A Chinese magazine cover sported a concept image of the JH-XX in 2013, but the project appears to have been set aside for now.Instead, in the PLAAF elected to pursue a more ambitious approach: a slower but far stealthier flying wing like the U.S. B-2 and forthcoming B-21 Raider. A particular advantage of large flying wings is they are less susceptible to detection by low-bandwidth radar, such as those on the Navy's E-2 Hawkeye radar planes, which are effective at detecting the approach of smaller stealth fighters.While China's development of stealth aircraft technology in the J-20 and J-31 stealth fighter was an obvious prerequisite for the H-20 project, so apparently was Xi'an's development of the hulking Y-20 'Chubby Girl' cargo plane , which established the company's capability to build large, long-range aircraft using modern computer-aided design and manufacturing techniquesprecision technology essential for mass producing the exterior surfaces of stealth aircraft.According to a study by Rick Joe at The Diplomat, Chinese publications began speculating about the H-20 in the early 2010s. Postulated characteristics include four non-afterburning WS-10A Taihang turbofans sunk into the top of the wing surface with S-shaped saw-toothed inlets for stealth. It's worth noting that the WS-10 has been plagued by major problems, but that hasn't stopped China from manufacturing fighters using WS-10s , with predictably troubled results.The new strategic bomber is expected to have a maximum un-refueled combat radius exceeding 5,000 miles and payload between the H-6's ten tons and the B-2's twenty-three tons. This is because the H-20 is reportedly designed to strike targets beyond the "second island ring" (which includes U.S. bases in Japan, Guam, the Philippines, etc.) from bases on mainland China. The third island chain extends to Hawaii and coastal Australia.In a U.S.-China conflict, the best method for neutralizing U.S. air power would be to destroy it on the ground (or carrier deck), especially in the opening hours of a war. While ballistic missiles and H-6 bombers can already contribute to this with long-range missiles, these are susceptible to detection and interception given adequate forewarning. A stealth bomber could approach much closer to carrier task forces and air bases before releasing its weapons, giving defenses too little time to react. An initial strike might in fact focus on air defense radars, "opening the breach" for a follow up wave of less stealthy attacks.The H-20 will also likely be capable of carrying nuclear weapons, finally giving China a full triad of nuclear-capable submarines, ballistic missiles and bombers. Though the H-6 was China's original nuclear bomber, these are no longer configured for nuclear strike, though that could change if air-launched nuclear-tipped cruise or ballistic missile are devised. Beijing is nervous that the United States' limited ballistic missile defense capabilities might eventually become adequate for countering China's small ICBM and SLBM arsenal. The addition of a stealth bomber would contribute to China's nuclear deterrence by adding a new, difficult-to-stop vector of nuclear attack that the U.S. defenses aren't designed to protect against.Some Chinese publications also argue that the H-20 will do double-duty as a networked reconnaissance and command and control platform similar to U.S. F-35 stealth fighters . This would make sense, as China has developed a diverse arsenal of long-range air-, ground- and sea-launched missiles, but doesn't necessarily have a robust reconnaissance network to form a kill-chain cueing these missiles to distant targets. Theoretically, an H-20 could rove ahead, spying the position of opposing sea-based assets using a low-probability-of-intercept AESA radar, and fuse that information to a firing platform hundreds or even thousands of miles away. The H-20 could also be used for electronic warfare or to deploy specialized directed energy.The crescendo of publicity surrounding the H-20 indicates the PLAAF believes the plane will soon be ready enough to show to the publicand international audiences. Once revealed, analysts will pour over the aircraft's geometry to estimate just how the stealthy it really is, looking for radar-reflective Achilles' heels such as exposed engine inlets and indiscrete tail stabilizers. However, external analysis cannot provide a full assessment, because the quality of the radar-absorbent materials applied to surfaces, and the finesse of the manufacturing (avoiding seams, protruding screws, etc.) has a major impact on radar cross-section.It is worth bearing in mind, however, that an H-20 seeking to slip through the gauntlet of long-range search radars scattered across the Pacific to launch CJ-10K cruise missiles with a range of over nine hundred miles would not require the same degree of stealth as an F-35 intended to penetrate more densely defended airspace and launch small diameter bombs with a range of 70 miles.Analysts forecast the H-20's first flight in the early 2020s, with production possibly beginning around 2025. If the H-20 is judged to be of credible design, the Pentagon in turn will have to factor the strategic implications of China's stealth capabilities, and will likely seek to field implement counter-stealth technologies which formerly have been mostly vaunted by Russia and China. The publicity which the often-secretive Chinese government is according the H-20 also indicates Beijing's hope the bomber will serve as a strategic deterrent to foreign adversarieseven before its first flight.Load-Date: March 25, 2019End of Document

Macau syndicate smuggled $4.4 billion out of China, police sayCNN WireJanuary 23, 2019 Wednesday 5:53 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 619 wordsByline: By Joshua Berlinger, CNNDateline: HONG KONG (CNN) BodyHONG KONG (CNN) --  Chinese authorities say they have busted an underground money-smuggling ring used to launder more than $4.4 billion through the Asian gambling hub of Macau.The case is a high-profile example of Beijing's crackdown on attempts to dodge its capital controls, which it has tightened in recent years to prevent money from flooding out of the country and destabilizing the economy.Macau's Judicial Police said the syndicate was formed in 2016 and relied on point-of-sale machines -- the devices used by shops to conduct transactions with credit cards or debit cards -- which were smuggled in from China. These in theory would allow Chinese citizens to make withdrawals from their bank accounts that appeared to be domestic transactions, thereby avoiding China's strict limits on how much money people can move across its borders.Wealthy Chinese nationals living in the mainland have long sought to skirt the country's capital controls by moving money through Hong Kong and Macau. The cities are technically part of the People's Republic of China but governed as special administrative regions, with their own currencies and far fewer restrictions than mainland China on moving money internationally.China's state-run Xinhua News Agency said authorities found evidence that the group, run by a suspect surnamed Xu, was using the point-of-sale machines to allow gamblers to secretly cash out their casino winnings in Hong Kong dollars and Macanese patacas.Thirty-nine people were arrested in a series of coordinated raids across China and Macau earlier this month in connection with the case, Beijing police said on their official Weibo account. Macau police said they seized 32 mainland point-of-sale machines.The case could bring increased scrutiny of Macau. Beijing has vowed to crack down on economic criminals and keep the yuan stable amid the ongoing trade war with the United States. The Chinese government has spent vast sums in recent years to prop up its currency as its economy has slowed down. As a result, some investors have sought to move money into more attractive investments elsewhere.Chinese nationals are not allowed to withdraw more than 100,000 yuan (about $15,000) a year overseas using domestic bank cards.Macau poses a unique risk because it is the only place in China where casinos are allowed to operate legally, and the cash-intensive nature of the industry makes money particularly difficult to track.But in a note to investors, analysts at Sanford Bernstein said the police action does not appear to be "materially different" from similar crackdowns and "this activity is part of an ongoing campaign against underground money transfers and illegal use of UnionPay (a Chinese financial service) which has been in force for several years."Vitaly Umansky, a senior research analyst at Bernstein who covers the global gaming industry, said Macau authorities have increasingly been cracking down on illegal use of point-of-sale machines and have been making arrests every six to nine months.Last summer, Macau's Monetary Authority ordered financial institutions to crack down on the illicit modification of point-of-sale machines, after a similar case was uncovered."What Macau has really gone after is all of these illegal POS (point-of-sale) devices," Umansky said.Umansky said it's unclear how authorities came up with the $4.4 billion figure. That number was only mentioned by police in mainland China; Macau's Judicial Police said it seized $3 million from five accounts. "They never really tell you what it means," Umansky said.CNN's Serenitie Wang and Angie Chan contributed to this reportTM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

China optimistic about dialogue with US despite differencesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 7, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 624 wordsBody       Beijing has given positive signs on the eve of negotiations with Washington aimed at ending a trade war that threatens the world economy, but the bilateral relationship remains overshadowed by a number of uncertainties.  High-level talks were scheduled to start in Beijing today, but neither the US embassy nor the Chinese Ministry of Commerce confirmed whether the details of the agenda are in progress.  The two countries have already increased customs duties on hundreds of millions of dollars worth of products from each. Earlier in December, US and Chinese presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping respectively agreed to a 90-day truce with a view to finding a solution.  On Friday, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said the two sides were prepared for "positive and constructive" discussions.  Deputy Trade Representative Jeffrey Gerrish leads the US delegation, which also includes officials from the energy, agriculture and trade sectors, and the State Department and Treasury. The Chinese government has not informed who is leading the Beijing delegation.  The talks are taking place despite diplomatic tensions over the arrest of a Chinese woman in Canada, accused by the US of fraud and violating sanctions against Iran.  Trump calls on Beijing to end state subsidies for certain strategic industries as the Chinese leadership tries to turn the country's firms into important players in high-value-added activities such as artificial intelligence, renewable energy, robotics and electric cars, threatening to US dominance in those areas.  But the Chinese Communist Party is reluctant to relinquish its plans, which it sees as crucial to raising the country's overall status.  Chinese leaders have emphasized the potential of the country's market and pledged to increase the access of foreign capital to the automotive or financial sectors.  Some Chinese officials suggested that the country could open its technology initiatives to foreign participation, but without further details.  Economists say the truce agreement between Trump and Xi is too short to resolve all disputes that overshadow relations.  During this period, "there should be no agreement until the last day," said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for Studies of the World Trade Organization at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.  This week talks will focus on technical details, before leaders of the two countries "make difficult political decisions," Tu said.  But the economic slowdown on both sides is putting pressure on an agreement.  In the third quarter of the year, the Chinese economy's growth slowed to 6.5%, the lowest level since 2009.  In November, sales in the automotive sector fell by 16% year-on-year, while falling demand forced builders to reduce property prices in major cities.  In the third quarter, the US economy grew by 3.4%, while the unemployment rate has been at the lowest level of the last 50 years. However, forecasts point to a slowdown this year.  Beijing tried unsuccessfully to recruit France, Germany or South Korea as allies against Trump's protectionism, but these countries share the same complaints about industrial policy and the country's market access difficulties.  Some manufacturers exporting to the US market have already begun to shift production out of China to avoidCustoms Clearances.  In a report, financial services company UBS said last Friday that 37% of 200 respondents surveyed have shifted production over the past 12 months.  Rising rates in the US were the "deciding factor" for about half, while others pointed to rising labor costs and tougher environmental regulations.  "Most companies believe that trade conflicts will escalate," USB said. Load-Date: January 8, 2019End of Document

AT&T chief: China isn't beating the United States on 5G - yetCNN WireMarch 20, 2019 Wednesday 10:26 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 464 wordsByline: By Katie Lobosco, CNN BusinessDateline: WASHINGTON (CNN Business) BodyWASHINGTON (CNN Business) --  There's a lot of concern from the Trump administration and policymakers about America's ability to compete with China on building the next generation of wireless networks, but AT&T chief Randall Stephenson said Wednesday that China isn't beating the United States on 5G --- yet. While AT&T, which owns CNN's parent company WarnerMedia, has 5G up and running in a dozen markets, Chinese 5G networks remain in trial stages, Stephenson said at an event hosted by the Economic Club of Washington, D.C.But China is investing heavily in the technology. "China is going to commit to this. They have said that this is a major focus of theirs from an economic development standpoint and a security standpoint," Stephenson said.He lamented that it can take two or three years to get a permit to even start work on a new cell site in the United States, and that the process moves along a lot faster in China. But there's another hurdle for US companies in the 5G race. The Chinese company Huawei is leading the way on producing the necessary network components --- and the US government has banned the company from bidding on US government contracts. Federal employees are also forbidden from using its products. The US government has long been suspicious that Beijing could use Huawei equipment for spying but hasn't provided public evidence to support those concerns. The company strongly denies the accusations. Stephenson said that the government is right to be cautious about where it gets the equipment from, but suggested that officials aren't doing a good job explaining why the security risk exists. "To me, the biggest risk is not that the Chinese government might listen in on our phone conversations or mine our data some how if we use their equipment. That's not the issue," he said. Stephenson is worried, however, about how the 5G equipment could eventually be connected to millions of devices tied to US infrastructure --- including autonomous cars, manufacturing floors, refineries and traffic management in cities. "We have to ask ourselves a question: If that much of our infrastructure will be attached to this kind of technology, do we want to be cautious about who is the underlying company behind that technology? We damn well better be," Stephenson said. The Trump administration has also pressured other nations to stop using Huawei technology, but many foreign countries aren't moving to block the company. Germany announced earlier this month that it would not ban any companies from bidding to build its 5G networks. Stephenson said Europe doesn't have a choice because it used Huawei for its 4G network and the company is not allowing interoperability to 5G. TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Research Report on the Import of Paper & Paperboard in China, 2019 to 2023 - The Lower Average Price of Imports than Domestic Counterparts is a Major Market DriverPR NewswireMarch 14, 2019 Thursday 7:45 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1477 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, March 14, 2019 BodyPR NewswireThe"Research Report on Paper and Paperboard Import in China, 2019-2023"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.According to this analysis, with the development of China's economy and the improvement of living standards, the per capita consumption of paper and paperboard shows an upward trend. Meanwhile, China's net annual population growth is between 8 million and 10 million, which leads to an increasing demand for paper and paperboard in China and promotes the development of China's papermaking industry.However, the papermaking industry is dependent on forest resources which are scarce in China. As China tightens its environmental protection policies and the forest coverage rate decreases, the fiber materials for papermaking are in increasingly short supply. Besides, the labor costs in the Chinese manufacturing sector keeps rising. Therefore, China needs to import a large quantity of paper and paperboard to cover the shortage of domestic capacity.The Chinese government has set no administrative barriers against paper and paperboard import, e.g. making paper and paperboard exclusive to state-owned enterprises, or introducing import quota administration for paper and paperboard. But import tariffs vary greatly among China's paper and paperboard imports. For instance, the MFN rate and general rate on the commodity that has the heaviest tax burden is respectively 35% and 100%. The import tariffs on newsprint, kraft paper, etc. are lower with the lowest MFN rate being 2%.According to this analysis, the import volume of paper and paperboard in China is rising in recent years. It reached 6.27 million tons in 2018, increasing by 122.3% as compared to 2014. And the import value reached USD 5.53 billion, increasing by 54% as compared to 2014.The reasons for the growing paper and paperboard imports mainly include: (1) The price of imported paper and paperboard is lower than that of domestic counterparts; and (2) the quality of imported paper and paperboard is better than that of domestic counterparts. But market trends vary greatly among China's paper and paperboard imports.Overall, product segments that have great price differences with domestic counterpart see faster growth. For example, with the development of Intermedia, the sales volume of newspaper, magazines and other print media is decreasing in China, which brings down the demand for newsprint. However, the import volume of newsprint in China grew by 860% from 2014 to 2018 because the price of imported newsprint was far lower than that of domestic newsprint.In recent years, the demand for liner board keeps rising with the rapid development of the e-commerce and logistics industries. As the import price differed little from the domestic market price, the import volume of liner board in China grew by only 65.10% from 2013 to 2017.Future OutlookBased on this research, the demand for paper and paperboard imports in China will continue to grow from 2019 to 2023. The major driving forces include the lower average price of imports than domestic counterparts and the sluggish growth in domestic production of paper and paperboard resulting from the shortage of raw materials and the upward costs of labor, land, energy resources and other production factors.Key TopicsEconomic and policy environment of paper and paperboard import in China Paper and paperboard

China calls on the world to end "inventions" on HuaweiCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 14, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 305 wordsBody China on Monday urged countries to end their "inventions" on Huawei, after a Polish official said that his country could limit the use of its products by public entities after the arrest of a company employee China for espionage accusations.  Huawei, the world's largest producer of telecommunications equipment, faces intense scrutiny in the West for its relations with the Chinese government and US-led accusations that its devices could be used by Beijing to spy.  So far no public evidence has been presented against Huawei, who has repeatedly rejected the accusations. However, several Western countries have restricted Huawei's access to their markets.  Poland arrested a Chinese Huawei employee and a former Polish security official on Friday on charges of espionage, officials and sources told Reuters.  A Polish government official responsible for cybersecurity, Karol Okonski, told Reuters on Sunday that the company's use of the company's products could be reviewed.  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told media in Beijing that her government expects Poland to work to build mutual trust and maintain relations.  Hua said that "some people" intend to use baseless accusations about security threats to "suppress and restrict the development of Chinese technology companies abroad."  "We urge the relevant parties to put an end to the baseless inventions and the restrictions without reason to Huawei and other Chinese firms, and to create a fair and good environment for mutual investment and the normal cooperation of the companies of both parties" said Hua.  "Using security reasons to exaggerate, obstruct or restrict normal cooperation between companies will only affect their own interests."  The China entry calls the world to end the "inventions" about Huawei was first published in La Tercera. Load-Date: January 14, 2019End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 25 of 312Hoover event examines Chinese development, demographic shiftseval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'stanforddaily_com-box-3','ezslot_1']));  Page 28 of 312Huawei defends security record as annual sales top $100B  Page 31 of 312China won't unleash 'runaway stimulus' to revive the economy  Page 34 of 312Economic worries hang over U.S.-China talks  Page 36 of 312Views on the News: China's social credit system  Page 39 of 312Canada's relations with China were already bad.
