Continue reading T-Mobile s latest merger gambit isn t subtle: John Legere trades a pink t-shirt for a fireman s hatPhoto by Alex Wong/Getty ImagesT-Mobile announced its plans for a 5G rollout yesterday, promising to launch  nationwide  service on December 6th. It's much wider coverage than either AT&T or Verizon has promised, thanks in large part to T-Mobile's use of the 600MHz spectrum it licenses. But even though T-Mobile appears to be doing better with 5G, there are still important caveats. We need to see it actually tested for speed and coverage, for one thing. For another, it's only available on two fairly expensive phones: the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus 5G and the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G.In some ways, however, this announcement and even thisdeploymentis a publicity stunt meant to drum up support for the merger with Sprint. T-Mobile has passed pretty much every regulatory hurdle   two days ago the FCC repeated its blessing. There's essentially only one thing standing in CEO John Legere's way, a lawsuit from 10 state attorneys general to block the merger.The trial begins on December 9th, three days after T-Mobile says it's lighting up its 5G network. What a coincidence!T-Mobile is now engaged in a no-holds-barred campaign to win support for the merger from constituencies that might put pressure on those attorneys general to settle their case. Alongside the 5G rollout, T-Mobile launched an initiative it calls  5G for Good,  laden with programs that you would have to be a heartless jerk to criticize. I'm simply amazed at how brazen it is.It came complete with a press release filled with diction, random capitalization, and exclamation points that are so Trumpian it seems custom-designed to bait our president into quoting it verbatim: We're building a 5G network that will allow us to deliver future New T-Mobile moves that are going to be SO massive we couldn't WAIT to share the first few. [ ] Only the New T-Mobile's transformative 5G network will FINALLY have the capacity and reach to make the BOLD moves we announced today that are squarely aimed at SOLVING inequities that have huge impacts on our society. When it comes to wireless service, many have been taken advantage of, left behind or completely forgotten. It's time for another wave of change and the New T-Mobile will be at the forefront of that!  said John Legere, CEO of T-Mobile.The three programs T-Mobile announced are contingent on the merger. The company willonlyprovide these services if it is able to complete its merger with Sprint. These programs are each cleverly designed to give T-Mobile instant rebuttals to potential criticisms of the merger. They're so well-crafted that I can't help but applaud how genius they are as pieces of propaganda. Even calling them  propaganda  makes me the asshole!Let's go through them each in turn and examine just why they could be effective.T-Mobile promises free 5G to first responders for 10 years after Sprint mergerThis program is called the  Connecting Heroes Initiative  and it will offer a base level of free wireless service to police and firefighters throughout the country   with relatively inexpensive upgrades for data.Recall that last year Verizon throttled data for California firefighters actively engaged in fighting the state's wildfires. This move not only could gather support from local police and firefighters (who could put pressure on those attorneys general), it also is a not-so-subtle way for T-Mobile to position itself as the good guys compared to Verizon. Worried about T-Mobile doing bad things? It's not like they're Verizon!On a larger level, though, the rhetorical kung-fu here is so blatant that I'm almost embarrassed to have to point it out: if you wanted to oppose this merger you will be vulnerable to accusations that you are not supporting our heroic first responders.T-Mobile promises a $15 budget Connect plan with 2GB data if the Sprint merger goes throughThe number one accusation T-Mobile faces is that after the merger it will find ways to increase prices on its customers   customers who will have fewer alternatives because we're moving from four big carriers to three. A $15/month plan is ridiculously inexpensive and so long as it's around, T-Mobile can use it as a response to that accusation.T-Mobile claims it will give free internet to 10 million homes if Sprint merger goes throughThis proposal haslevels. It's designed to offer internet service specifically to children who wouldn't otherwise have it, giving them access and helping them do homework. It's also, I think, an indirect way to gesture towards the concern that big carriers aren't doing enough to provide rural access.It's worth pointing out that all three of these plans are disingenuous as soon as you look at the fine print   which is the way with nearly all US mobile plans. The  heroes  are limited to 1GB a month, and it's $15 to get 20GB. The kids are limited to 100GB/year, which is not very much data at all. And T-Mobile Connect only offers 2GB per month   which you could burn through in less than a day watching YouTube.For a while now, this merger has had an air of inevitability. Sure, the 10 state AGs are going forward with the lawsuit, but it feels like it would take a miracle for it to successfully stop this train. It's one thing for T-Mobile and Sprint to lobby the FTC, DOJ, and FCC   it's quite another for it to challenge the states. An attorney general looks like the champion of the people when they take on a big corporation   will they look that way when firefighters are asking why they can't get free cell phone service in an emergency?Just last month, Colorado stopped opposing the deal because Dish Network (which is hoping to become a fourth network someday) promised to base its headquarters here. These new initiatives are a genuine good for cops, firefighters, and kids   but they're also a perfectly targeted pressure campaign on the attorneys general who are trying to block the merger.It's not subtle. Then again, nobody's ever accused John Legere of subtlety.Microsoft's revisionist history+Microsoft reveals the future of OneNote and it's all about Fluid and desktopI would like to try to pithily capture all the Windows app platform / web stuff / 32-bit / ARM / confounding changes in direction / overall shiftlessness / uncertainty for consumers / fetishization of backwards compatibility / general nuttiness of what's going on with this decision, but yeah, that's a lot to synthesize.

They're not entirely wrong   and after a year of ragging on Intel for failing to adequately innovate, I should eat a little crow. There's something to be said for slow and steady   I think it's too slow and too steady, but at least you know it'll work.+Bill Gates thinks Windows Mobile would have beaten Android without Microsoft's antitrust woesI think Gates is engaging in more than a little revisionist history here. Just because Verizon may have screwed over Microsoft at around the same time it was screwing over webOS doesn't mean that if it had gone another way that Windows Mobile would have succeeded. Verizon had already tried to anoint an iPhone killer before the period Gates is referring to: the absolutely atrocious BlackBerry Storm. If Verizon had picked WinMo instead of Android, it might have also been rejected.In fact, as the founder and former Editor in Chief of a site calledWMExpertsthat was exclusively dedicated to Windows Mobile, I can say with a high degree of confidence that while powerful, it was not ready for mainstream adoption.Gates' implication here is that if he had been paying more attention, Windows Mobile would have been a better product. I just don't know if that is definitively true: Microsoft was producing a lot of stinkers in the late  90s and early 2000s. Regardless, it's quite the condemnation of the rest of the company (Steve Ballmer especially) that Gates is saying the main reason it failed in mobile is because Bill Gates wasn't personally working on it.+Don't all go out and buy one at once:The Microsoft HoloLens 2 ships today for $3,500More from The Verge+The big questions behind TikTok's looming national security investigationExcellent analysis from Zoe Schiffer into an issue that you probably rolled your eyes at at first.

They don't always mobilize them right away to harm freedom of expression, until something threatening happens and then they do.

The companies that have bothered to commend have done so in the most terse, least illuminating way possible. Any time messages can't get through a network, it's a problem. SMS is often the last fallback option for lots of essential communications, not just texting between people. The stories of people receiving texts from deceased friends is heartbreaking, too.The fact that all this happened with Valentine's Day messages is also just bizarre. I don't discount that SMS interchange is more complex than we assume   I still remember the days when an MMS from Sprint wasn't compatible with an MMS from AT&T. But that very complexity means that we have to trust these companies to transparent. And not for nothing: we are still waiting for the next federated messaging model to launch, the RCS joint venture these companies just announced.What happened today doesn't inspire confidence.+Vivo Nex 3 review: chasing waterfallsSam Byford likes the radically curved screen.

Former Google exec, Schwarzenegger aide enters Senate raceAssociated Press State & LocalNovember 7, 2019 Thursday 9:27 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICAL NEWSLength: 298 wordsDateline: PORTLAND, Maine BodyPORTLAND, Maine (AP) - A former Google executive and adviser to former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is joining the race for the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican Susan Collins.Biddeford native Ross LaJeunesse, a Democrat, makes it a four-way primary race with Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon, activist and lobbyist Betsy Sweet, and attorney Bre Kidman.He said that through his work with Google in China and as a Democrat in Republican Schwarzenegger's administration he learned to have conversations with people with whom he didn't agree."You don't change the world by talking to people who agree with you," he said Thursday. "If we are just talking to people who agree with us, then we end up in our bubble. The hard work of making change means standing across from someone who disagrees with you."As director of international relations for Google, LaJeunesse negotiated with the Chinese government and executed Google's decision to stop censoring search results in China. Before that, LaJeunesse served in several posts in California government, capped by a stint as deputy chief of staff to Schwarzenegger.In addition to four Democrats, there are several independents and Green Independents aiming to challenge Collins. Collins, for her part, has yet to formally announce her decision whether to seek reelection. That's expected later this fall.LaJeunesse and his husband moved back to Maine in April.He said he thinks the story of how his parents struggled in Biddeford to make ends meet and how they nearly lost the family home will resonate with voters in a state where economic growth and wages lag behind the rest of the region."We raised animals and had a huge garden. We didn't do that as hobbies," he said. "We did that because it we needed to put food on the table."Load-Date: November 8, 2019End of Document

Apple (AAPL 266.39, -0.69, -0.3%), Netflix (NFLX 302.30, -0.27, -0.1%), Alphabet (GOOG 1318.70, -2.00, -0.1%), and Amazon (AMZN 1754.62, +2.09, +0.1%) trade near their flat lines.Separately, President Trump recently reiterated his stance on raising tariffs on China if a trade deal is not reached. Meaningful trade updates has been lacking today.11:55 ETDow -99.37 at 27936.76, Nasdaq +24.47 at 8574.41, S&P -0.11 at 3121.92[BRIEFING.COM] Stocks received a slight boost earlier after Bloomberg reported that the trade deal that was almost reached in May is now being used as baseline in trade talks. The market has returned to levels prior to the report, leaving the S&P 500 currently unchanged.The knee-jerk, and algorithmic, price action following the stale news is understandable given the market's anxiousness about a trade deal. Stocks are currently well off from session lows, except for those struggling retail stocks, in another buy-the-dip effort.Overseas, the major indices closed mixed. Germany's DAX increased 0.1%, UK's FTSE increased 0.2%, and France's CAC declined 0.4%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 0.2%.11:25 ETDow -110.42 at 27925.71, Nasdaq +5.86 at 8555.8, S&P -3.61 at 3118.42[BRIEFING.COM] True to form, the S&P 500 has cut its losses and is now down 0.1%. The price-weighted Dow (-0.4%) continues to be pressured by Home Depot (HD 227.66, -11.17, -4.7%).The financials sector (unch) has held steady throughout the day, even as the Treasury yield curve undergoes some curve-flattening. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.60%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.79%.Separately, shares of ConocoPhillips (COP 57.26, +0.56, +1.0%) are up 1% after the company highlighted a 10-year plan that included free cash flow of approximately $50 billion.10:55 ETDow -105.56 at 27930.57, Nasdaq -4.52 at 8545.42, S&P -6.64 at 3115.39[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is now down at session lows with a 0.2% decline, which isn't terribly concerning given the benchmark index is still up 2.5% this month, including today's loss.The market has shown a propensity to buy every dip, so it will be interesting to see how the market reacts to the recent slip in stocks. Interestingly, the CBOE Volatility Index is up just 0.5 points, or 4.3%, to 12.95.Separately, shares of Slack (WORK 21.37, -1.74, -7.4%) have dropped another 7% following news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.59, +0.23, +0.2%) competitive product, Teams, has grown daily active users by nearly 50% since July. Slack is down around 45% from its IPO in June.10:25 ETDow -51.66 at 27984.47, Nasdaq +11.78 at 8561.72, S&P -1.53 at 3120.5[BRIEFING.COM] It's been a shaky start for the stock market, with the S&P 500 continuing to waver around its flat line. An absence of new trade updates has the market struggling for direction, as its bullish uptrend has to contend with the weakness in the retail space.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.90, -0.92, -2.0%) has doubled its losses from earlier and now trades lower by 2.0%. Fortunately, the gains in the health care sector (+0.4%) have helped offset some of their losses today.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 38.63, -1.00) are down 2.5% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson with a price target of $30.09:55 ETDow -25.70 at 28010.43, Nasdaq +8.37 at 8558.31, S&P -0.54 at 3121.49[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has slipped below its flat line, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.3%.Following up on the retail space, shares of Macy's (M 15.39, -1.48, -8.8%) have extended losses after the company alerted customers about a potential credit card breach, according to Axios. TJX Companies (TJX 60.81, +1.26, +2.1%) has bucked the trend after it beat top and bottom-line estimates and raised its full-year guidance.Separately, oil prices ($56.02, -1.12, -2.0%) have been pressured by Russia reportedly saying it is unlikely to expand oil output costs. The S&P 500 energy sector is down 0.9%.09:40 ETDow +13.80 at 28049.93, Nasdaq +21.90 at 8571.84, S&P +2.39 at 3124.42[BRIEFING.COM] The major indices open slightly higher at new all-time highs. The S&P 500 is up 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows financials (+0.4%) and information technology (+0.3%) leading the early advance. Conversely, the utilities (-0.6%) and consumer discretionary (-0.4%) sectors underperform, with the latter pressured by Home Depot (HD 228.90, -9.94, -4.2%) following its earnings results and guidance.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.37, -0.45, -1.0%) is being dragged lower by shares of Kohl's (KSS 49.48, -8.86, -15.1%) after the company missed earnings estimates and lowered its FY20 EPS below consensus.U.S. Treasuries are little changed. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.60%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.80%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 97.79. WTI crude is down 1.9% to $56.06/bbl.09:14 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: +7.60. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +35.10.The stock market's bullish bias is set to continue at the open, with the S&P 500 futures trading seven points, or 0.2%, above fair value. Relative weakness in the retail space hasn't been enough to deter the good mood on Wall Street.Home Depot (HD 230.37, -8.48, -3.6%) and Kohl's (KSS 50.70, -7.70, -13.2%) have disappointed investors with their quarterly results and guidance, causing selling pressure in many of the other retail stocks, too. TJX Companies (TJX 60.25, +0.70, +1.2%) has bucked the trend with better than expected results and higher full-year guidance.Separately, housing starts and building permits increased more than expected in October, although the data has had muted impact on the futures trade. The market appears determined to rise on either good or bad news at this point.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: +6.60.

The S&P 500 futures trade eight points, or 0.3%, above fair value.Home Depot missed revenue estimates and lowered its FY20 comparable sales guidance, but it wasn't the only retailer to disappoint. Shares of Kohl's (KSS 52.43, -5.97, -10.2%) have dropped 10% after it missed earnings estimates and lowered its full-year earnings guidance. Other retail stocks are currently trading lower in sympathy.Weakness in the retail space this morning is being offset by the gains in the market's largest technology stocks, namely Apple (AAPL 268.17, +1.07, +0.4%), Alphabet (GOOG 1326.00, +5.30, +0.4%), and Microsoft (MSFT 150.90, +0.56, +0.4%). In addition, the expectation for a Phase One trade deal has been supportive for the market's bullish bias.Today's economic calendar will feature Housing Starts (Briefing.com consensus 1.3 million) and Building Permits (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million) for October at 8:30 a.m. ET.U.S. Treasuries are little changed.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 97.80.Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for November declined to 70 from 71 in October.

Abiomed recoups a portion of yesterday's losses after the company's medical office issued a press release stating that the Amin et al. at the American Heart Association Conference (AHA) observational analysis of Impella was flawed. Advanced Micro found 13-year highs today in reaction to favorable sell side commentary and news that the company's 7nm professional PC workstation graphics card, dubbed the AMD Radeon Pro W5700, had launched. Alexion Pharma finds itself higher today in conjunction with the company's appearance at today's Stifel Global Healthcare Conference.Conversely, TripAdvisor (TRIP 28.34, -3.27, -10.34%) sits near the bottom of the index as the stock goes ex-dividend today ahead of its $3.50 per share special dividend.14:00 ETDow -102.47 at 27933.66, Nasdaq +26.47 at 8576.41, S&P -0.67 at 3121.36[BRIEFING.COM] The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite still holds the best gains on the day, up 0.31% to this point, as the major averages hold split trade into the final two hours of the session.Gold futures recouped afternoon losses, settling $2.40 higher (+0.2%) to $1,474.30/oz.The U.S. Dollar Index holds gains of less than 0.1% to 97.82.13:30 ETDow -93.86 at 27942.27, Nasdaq +24.99 at 8574.93, S&P -0.81 at 3121.22[BRIEFING.COM] After tapping all-time highs earlier in the session the Dow Jones Industrial Average finds itself lower, and its counterparts find themselves mixed.Behind index-leading losses out of Home Depot (HD 226.45, -12.40, -5.19%), Dow Jones Industrial Average constituents Dow (DOW 53.31, -1.01, -1.86%), Chevron (CVX 117.25, -1.30, -1.10%), and Nike (NKE 93.55, -0.63, -0.67%) post the worst declines.Conversely, Visa (V 181.98, +2.32, +1.29%) sits atop the index.Still, inclusive of today's losses the DJIA holds gains of about 3.31% on the month.12:55 ETDow -105.04 at 27931.09, Nasdaq +22.29 at 8572.23, S&P -2.48 at 3119.55[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is currently down 0.1% in midday action, with weakness concentrated in the retail space following disappointing quarterly results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.39, -12.46, -5.2%) and Kohl's (KSS 47.58, -10.82, -18.5%).The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, but the Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%) and Russell 2000 (+0.4%) trade higher.The underperformance of the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.12, -0.71, -1.6%) best displays the negative sentiment that has subsumed the retail industry today. Both the Dow and S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%), meanwhile, can attribute their underperformance to Home Depot.The S&P 500 energy sector (-1.1%) is down even more amid a sharp decline in oil prices ($55.69, -1.45, -2.5%), but the market isn't getting concerned about the U.S. consumer based on a couple of reports. Instead, the market is hanging in there amid gains in the heavily-weighted health care (+0.3%), information technology (+0.1%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors.The consensus among many investors is that the market is due for a pullback, but the absence of one has created a sort of pain trade for investors fearful of missing out on further gains. The S&P 500 was down just 0.3% at its low earlier today before a buy-the-dip effort briefly brought it back above its flat line.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 37.65, -1.99) are down 5.0% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson with a price target of $30. Shares of Slack (WORK 20.88, -2.24, -9.7%) are down 10% on news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.99, +0.65, +0.4%) competitive product, Teams, has increased daily active users by nearly 50% since July.In the Treasury market, demand for longer-dated bonds has caused some minor curve-flattening activity. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.79%. The U.S. Dollar Index is flat at 97.79.Today's economic calendar was limited to Housing Starts and Building Permits for October:Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million).There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1451/1377. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1924/1094.12:25 ETDow -76.37 at 27959.76, Nasdaq +28.13 at 8578.07, S&P -0.71 at 3121.32[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades just below its flat line, while the Nasdaq trades higher by 0.3%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Facebook (FB 198.98, +1.58, +0.8%) benefiting from increased buying interest. Apple (AAPL 266.39, -0.69, -0.3%), Netflix (NFLX 302.30, -0.27, -0.1%), Alphabet (GOOG 1318.70, -2.00, -0.1%), and Amazon (AMZN 1754.62, +2.09, +0.1%) trade near their flat lines.Separately, President Trump recently reiterated his stance on raising tariffs on China if a trade deal is not reached. Meaningful trade updates has been lacking today.11:55 ETDow -99.37 at 27936.76, Nasdaq +24.47 at 8574.41, S&P -0.11 at 3121.92[BRIEFING.COM] Stocks received a slight boost earlier after Bloomberg reported that the trade deal that was almost reached in May is now being used as baseline in trade talks. The market has returned to levels prior to the report, leaving the S&P 500 currently unchanged.The knee-jerk, and algorithmic, price action following the stale news is understandable given the market's anxiousness about a trade deal. Stocks are currently well off from session lows, except for those struggling retail stocks, in another buy-the-dip effort.Overseas, the major indices closed mixed. Germany's DAX increased 0.1%, UK's FTSE increased 0.2%, and France's CAC declined 0.4%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 0.2%.11:25 ETDow -110.42 at 27925.71, Nasdaq +5.86 at 8555.8, S&P -3.61 at 3118.42[BRIEFING.COM] True to form, the S&P 500 has cut its losses and is now down 0.1%. The price-weighted Dow (-0.4%) continues to be pressured by Home Depot (HD 227.66, -11.17, -4.7%).The financials sector (unch) has held steady throughout the day, even as the Treasury yield curve undergoes some curve-flattening. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.60%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.79%.Separately, shares of ConocoPhillips (COP 57.26, +0.56, +1.0%) are up 1% after the company highlighted a 10-year plan that included free cash flow of approximately $50 billion.10:55 ETDow -105.56 at 27930.57, Nasdaq -4.52 at 8545.42, S&P -6.64 at 3115.39[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is now down at session lows with a 0.2% decline, which isn't terribly concerning given the benchmark index is still up 2.5% this month, including today's loss.The market has shown a propensity to buy every dip, so it will be interesting to see how the market reacts to the recent slip in stocks. Interestingly, the CBOE Volatility Index is up just 0.5 points, or 4.3%, to 12.95.Separately, shares of Slack (WORK 21.37, -1.74, -7.4%) have dropped another 7% following news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.59, +0.23, +0.2%) competitive product, Teams, has grown daily active users by nearly 50% since July. Slack is down around 45% from its IPO in June.10:25 ETDow -51.66 at 27984.47, Nasdaq +11.78 at 8561.72, S&P -1.53 at 3120.5[BRIEFING.COM] It's been a shaky start for the stock market, with the S&P 500 continuing to waver around its flat line. An absence of new trade updates has the market struggling for direction, as its bullish uptrend has to contend with the weakness in the retail space.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.90, -0.92, -2.0%) has doubled its losses from earlier and now trades lower by 2.0%. Fortunately, the gains in the health care sector (+0.4%) have helped offset some of their losses today.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 38.63, -1.00) are down 2.5% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson with a price target of $30.09:55 ETDow -25.70 at 28010.43, Nasdaq +8.37 at 8558.31, S&P -0.54 at 3121.49[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has slipped below its flat line, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.3%.Following up on the retail space, shares of Macy's (M 15.39, -1.48, -8.8%) have extended losses after the company alerted customers about a potential credit card breach, according to Axios. TJX Companies (TJX 60.81, +1.26, +2.1%) has bucked the trend after it beat top and bottom-line estimates and raised its full-year guidance.Separately, oil prices ($56.02, -1.12, -2.0%) have been pressured by Russia reportedly saying it is unlikely to expand oil output costs. The S&P 500 energy sector is down 0.9%.09:40 ETDow +13.80 at 28049.93, Nasdaq +21.90 at 8571.84, S&P +2.39 at 3124.42[BRIEFING.COM] The major indices open slightly higher at new all-time highs. The S&P 500 is up 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows financials (+0.4%) and information technology (+0.3%) leading the early advance. Conversely, the utilities (-0.6%) and consumer discretionary (-0.4%) sectors underperform, with the latter pressured by Home Depot (HD 228.90, -9.94, -4.2%) following its earnings results and guidance.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.37, -0.45, -1.0%) is being dragged lower by shares of Kohl's (KSS 49.48, -8.86, -15.1%) after the company missed earnings estimates and lowered its FY20 EPS below consensus.U.S. Treasuries are little changed. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.60%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.80%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 97.79. WTI crude is down 1.9% to $56.06/bbl.09:14 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: +7.60. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +35.10.The stock market's bullish bias is set to continue at the open, with the S&P 500 futures trading seven points, or 0.2%, above fair value. Relative weakness in the retail space hasn't been enough to deter the good mood on Wall Street.Home Depot (HD 230.37, -8.48, -3.6%) and Kohl's (KSS 50.70, -7.70, -13.2%) have disappointed investors with their quarterly results and guidance, causing selling pressure in many of the other retail stocks, too. TJX Companies (TJX 60.25, +0.70, +1.2%) has bucked the trend with better than expected results and higher full-year guidance.Separately, housing starts and building permits increased more than expected in October, although the data has had muted impact on the futures trade. The market appears determined to rise on either good or bad news at this point.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: +6.60.

The S&P 500 futures trade eight points, or 0.3%, above fair value.Home Depot missed revenue estimates and lowered its FY20 comparable sales guidance, but it wasn't the only retailer to disappoint. Shares of Kohl's (KSS 52.43, -5.97, -10.2%) have dropped 10% after it missed earnings estimates and lowered its full-year earnings guidance. Other retail stocks are currently trading lower in sympathy.Weakness in the retail space this morning is being offset by the gains in the market's largest technology stocks, namely Apple (AAPL 268.17, +1.07, +0.4%), Alphabet (GOOG 1326.00, +5.30, +0.4%), and Microsoft (MSFT 150.90, +0.56, +0.4%).

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 97.80.Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for November declined to 70 from 71 in October.

It did guide Q4 EPS below consensus, though.Looking ahead, Target (TGT 110.73, -0.58, -0.5%) and Lowe's (LOW 113.20, -1.82, -1.6%) will report their earnings reports tomorrow morning.14:30 ETDow -75.89 at 27960.24, Nasdaq +38.27 at 8588.21, S&P +2.78 at 3124.81[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 stepped modestly into positive territory in the last half hour, now up 0.09%.

Advanced Micro found 13-year highs today in reaction to favorable sell side commentary and news that the company's 7nm professional PC workstation graphics card, dubbed the AMD Radeon Pro W5700, had launched. Alexion Pharma finds itself higher today in conjunction with the company's appearance at today's Stifel Global Healthcare Conference.Conversely, TripAdvisor (TRIP 28.34, -3.27, -10.34%) sits near the bottom of the index as the stock goes ex-dividend today ahead of its $3.50 per share special dividend.14:00 ETDow -102.47 at 27933.66, Nasdaq +26.47 at 8576.41, S&P -0.67 at 3121.36[BRIEFING.COM] The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite still holds the best gains on the day, up 0.31% to this point, as the major averages hold split trade into the final two hours of the session.Gold futures recouped afternoon losses, settling $2.40 higher (+0.2%) to $1,474.30/oz.The U.S. Dollar Index holds gains of less than 0.1% to 97.82.13:30 ETDow -93.86 at 27942.27, Nasdaq +24.99 at 8574.93, S&P -0.81 at 3121.22[BRIEFING.COM] After tapping all-time highs earlier in the session the Dow Jones Industrial Average finds itself lower, and its counterparts find themselves mixed.Behind index-leading losses out of Home Depot (HD 226.45, -12.40, -5.19%), Dow Jones Industrial Average constituents Dow (DOW 53.31, -1.01, -1.86%), Chevron (CVX 117.25, -1.30, -1.10%), and Nike (NKE 93.55, -0.63, -0.67%) post the worst declines.Conversely, Visa (V 181.98, +2.32, +1.29%) sits atop the index.Still, inclusive of today's losses the DJIA holds gains of about 3.31% on the month.12:55 ETDow -105.04 at 27931.09, Nasdaq +22.29 at 8572.23, S&P -2.48 at 3119.55[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is currently down 0.1% in midday action, with weakness concentrated in the retail space following disappointing quarterly results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.39, -12.46, -5.2%) and Kohl's (KSS 47.58, -10.82, -18.5%).The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, but the Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%) and Russell 2000 (+0.4%) trade higher.The underperformance of the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.12, -0.71, -1.6%) best displays the negative sentiment that has subsumed the retail industry today. Both the Dow and S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%), meanwhile, can attribute their underperformance to Home Depot.The S&P 500 energy sector (-1.1%) is down even more amid a sharp decline in oil prices ($55.69, -1.45, -2.5%), but the market isn't getting concerned about the U.S. consumer based on a couple of reports. Instead, the market is hanging in there amid gains in the heavily-weighted health care (+0.3%), information technology (+0.1%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors.The consensus among many investors is that the market is due for a pullback, but the absence of one has created a sort of pain trade for investors fearful of missing out on further gains. The S&P 500 was down just 0.3% at its low earlier today before a buy-the-dip effort briefly brought it back above its flat line.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 37.65, -1.99) are down 5.0% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson with a price target of $30. Shares of Slack (WORK 20.88, -2.24, -9.7%) are down 10% on news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.99, +0.65, +0.4%) competitive product, Teams, has increased daily active users by nearly 50% since July.In the Treasury market, demand for longer-dated bonds has caused some minor curve-flattening activity. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.79%. The U.S. Dollar Index is flat at 97.79.Today's economic calendar was limited to Housing Starts and Building Permits for October:Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million).There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1451/1377. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1924/1094.12:25 ETDow -76.37 at 27959.76, Nasdaq +28.13 at 8578.07, S&P -0.71 at 3121.32[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades just below its flat line, while the Nasdaq trades higher by 0.3%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Facebook (FB 198.98, +1.58, +0.8%) benefiting from increased buying interest. Apple (AAPL 266.39, -0.69, -0.3%), Netflix (NFLX 302.30, -0.27, -0.1%), Alphabet (GOOG 1318.70, -2.00, -0.1%), and Amazon (AMZN 1754.62, +2.09, +0.1%) trade near their flat lines.Separately, President Trump recently reiterated his stance on raising tariffs on China if a trade deal is not reached. Meaningful trade updates has been lacking today.11:55 ETDow -99.37 at 27936.76, Nasdaq +24.47 at 8574.41, S&P -0.11 at 3121.92[BRIEFING.COM] Stocks received a slight boost earlier after Bloomberg reported that the trade deal that was almost reached in May is now being used as baseline in trade talks. The market has returned to levels prior to the report, leaving the S&P 500 currently unchanged.The knee-jerk, and algorithmic, price action following the stale news is understandable given the market's anxiousness about a trade deal. Stocks are currently well off from session lows, except for those struggling retail stocks, in another buy-the-dip effort.Overseas, the major indices closed mixed. Germany's DAX increased 0.1%, UK's FTSE increased 0.2%, and France's CAC declined 0.4%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 0.2%.11:25 ETDow -110.42 at 27925.71, Nasdaq +5.86 at 8555.8, S&P -3.61 at 3118.42[BRIEFING.COM] True to form, the S&P 500 has cut its losses and is now down 0.1%. The price-weighted Dow (-0.4%) continues to be pressured by Home Depot (HD 227.66, -11.17, -4.7%).The financials sector (unch) has held steady throughout the day, even as the Treasury yield curve undergoes some curve-flattening. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.60%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.79%.Separately, shares of ConocoPhillips (COP 57.26, +0.56, +1.0%) are up 1% after the company highlighted a 10-year plan that included free cash flow of approximately $50 billion.10:55 ETDow -105.56 at 27930.57, Nasdaq -4.52 at 8545.42, S&P -6.64 at 3115.39[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is now down at session lows with a 0.2% decline, which isn't terribly concerning given the benchmark index is still up 2.5% this month, including today's loss.The market has shown a propensity to buy every dip, so it will be interesting to see how the market reacts to the recent slip in stocks. Interestingly, the CBOE Volatility Index is up just 0.5 points, or 4.3%, to 12.95.Separately, shares of Slack (WORK 21.37, -1.74, -7.4%) have dropped another 7% following news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.59, +0.23, +0.2%) competitive product, Teams, has grown daily active users by nearly 50% since July. Slack is down around 45% from its IPO in June.10:25 ETDow -51.66 at 27984.47, Nasdaq +11.78 at 8561.72, S&P -1.53 at 3120.5[BRIEFING.COM] It's been a shaky start for the stock market, with the S&P 500 continuing to waver around its flat line. An absence of new trade updates has the market struggling for direction, as its bullish uptrend has to contend with the weakness in the retail space.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.90, -0.92, -2.0%) has doubled its losses from earlier and now trades lower by 2.0%. Fortunately, the gains in the health care sector (+0.4%) have helped offset some of their losses today.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 38.63, -1.00) are down 2.5% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson with a price target of $30.09:55 ETDow -25.70 at 28010.43, Nasdaq +8.37 at 8558.31, S&P -0.54 at 3121.49[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has slipped below its flat line, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.3%.Following up on the retail space, shares of Macy's (M 15.39, -1.48, -8.8%) have extended losses after the company alerted customers about a potential credit card breach, according to Axios. TJX Companies (TJX 60.81, +1.26, +2.1%) has bucked the trend after it beat top and bottom-line estimates and raised its full-year guidance.Separately, oil prices ($56.02, -1.12, -2.0%) have been pressured by Russia reportedly saying it is unlikely to expand oil output costs. The S&P 500 energy sector is down 0.9%.09:40 ETDow +13.80 at 28049.93, Nasdaq +21.90 at 8571.84, S&P +2.39 at 3124.42[BRIEFING.COM] The major indices open slightly higher at new all-time highs. The S&P 500 is up 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows financials (+0.4%) and information technology (+0.3%) leading the early advance. Conversely, the utilities (-0.6%) and consumer discretionary (-0.4%) sectors underperform, with the latter pressured by Home Depot (HD 228.90, -9.94, -4.2%) following its earnings results and guidance.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.37, -0.45, -1.0%) is being dragged lower by shares of Kohl's (KSS 49.48, -8.86, -15.1%) after the company missed earnings estimates and lowered its FY20 EPS below consensus.U.S. Treasuries are little changed. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.60%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.80%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 97.79. WTI crude is down 1.9% to $56.06/bbl.09:14 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: +7.60.

Relative weakness in the retail space hasn't been enough to deter the good mood on Wall Street.Home Depot (HD 230.37, -8.48, -3.6%) and Kohl's (KSS 50.70, -7.70, -13.2%) have disappointed investors with their quarterly results and guidance, causing selling pressure in many of the other retail stocks, too. TJX Companies (TJX 60.25, +0.70, +1.2%) has bucked the trend with better than expected results and higher full-year guidance.Separately, housing starts and building permits increased more than expected in October, although the data has had muted impact on the futures trade.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%.

It did guide Q4 EPS below consensus, though.Looking ahead, Target (TGT 110.73, -0.58, -0.5%) and Lowe's (LOW 113.20, -1.82, -1.6%) will report their earnings reports tomorrow morning.14:30 ETDow -75.89 at 27960.24, Nasdaq +38.27 at 8588.21, S&P +2.78 at 3124.81[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 stepped modestly into positive territory in the last half hour, now up 0.09%.

Advanced Micro found 13-year highs today in reaction to favorable sell side commentary and news that the company's 7nm professional PC workstation graphics card, dubbed the AMD Radeon Pro W5700, had launched. Alexion Pharma finds itself higher today in conjunction with the company's appearance at today's Stifel Global Healthcare Conference.Conversely, TripAdvisor (TRIP 28.34, -3.27, -10.34%) sits near the bottom of the index as the stock goes ex-dividend today ahead of its $3.50 per share special dividend.14:00 ETDow -102.47 at 27933.66, Nasdaq +26.47 at 8576.41, S&P -0.67 at 3121.36[BRIEFING.COM] The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite still holds the best gains on the day, up 0.31% to this point, as the major averages hold split trade into the final two hours of the session.Gold futures recouped afternoon losses, settling $2.40 higher (+0.2%) to $1,474.30/oz.The U.S. Dollar Index holds gains of less than 0.1% to 97.82.13:30 ETDow -93.86 at 27942.27, Nasdaq +24.99 at 8574.93, S&P -0.81 at 3121.22[BRIEFING.COM] After tapping all-time highs earlier in the session the Dow Jones Industrial Average finds itself lower, and its counterparts find themselves mixed.Behind index-leading losses out of Home Depot (HD 226.45, -12.40, -5.19%), Dow Jones Industrial Average constituents Dow (DOW 53.31, -1.01, -1.86%), Chevron (CVX 117.25, -1.30, -1.10%), and Nike (NKE 93.55, -0.63, -0.67%) post the worst declines.Conversely, Visa (V 181.98, +2.32, +1.29%) sits atop the index.Still, inclusive of today's losses the DJIA holds gains of about 3.31% on the month.12:55 ETDow -105.04 at 27931.09, Nasdaq +22.29 at 8572.23, S&P -2.48 at 3119.55[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is currently down 0.1% in midday action, with weakness concentrated in the retail space following disappointing quarterly results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.39, -12.46, -5.2%) and Kohl's (KSS 47.58, -10.82, -18.5%).The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, but the Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%) and Russell 2000 (+0.4%) trade higher.The underperformance of the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.12, -0.71, -1.6%) best displays the negative sentiment that has subsumed the retail industry today. Both the Dow and S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%), meanwhile, can attribute their underperformance to Home Depot.The S&P 500 energy sector (-1.1%) is down even more amid a sharp decline in oil prices ($55.69, -1.45, -2.5%), but the market isn't getting concerned about the U.S. consumer based on a couple of reports. Instead, the market is hanging in there amid gains in the heavily-weighted health care (+0.3%), information technology (+0.1%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors.The consensus among many investors is that the market is due for a pullback, but the absence of one has created a sort of pain trade for investors fearful of missing out on further gains. The S&P 500 was down just 0.3% at its low earlier today before a buy-the-dip effort briefly brought it back above its flat line.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 37.65, -1.99) are down 5.0% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson with a price target of $30. Shares of Slack (WORK 20.88, -2.24, -9.7%) are down 10% on news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.99, +0.65, +0.4%) competitive product, Teams, has increased daily active users by nearly 50% since July.In the Treasury market, demand for longer-dated bonds has caused some minor curve-flattening activity. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.79%. The U.S. Dollar Index is flat at 97.79.Today's economic calendar was limited to Housing Starts and Building Permits for October:Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million).There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1451/1377. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1924/1094.12:25 ETDow -76.37 at 27959.76, Nasdaq +28.13 at 8578.07, S&P -0.71 at 3121.32[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades just below its flat line, while the Nasdaq trades higher by 0.3%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Facebook (FB 198.98, +1.58, +0.8%) benefiting from increased buying interest.

Meaningful trade updates has been lacking today.11:55 ETDow -99.37 at 27936.76, Nasdaq +24.47 at 8574.41, S&P -0.11 at 3121.92[BRIEFING.COM] Stocks received a slight boost earlier after Bloomberg reported that the trade deal that was almost reached in May is now being used as baseline in trade talks. The market has returned to levels prior to the report, leaving the S&P 500 currently unchanged.The knee-jerk, and algorithmic, price action following the stale news is understandable given the market's anxiousness about a trade deal. Stocks are currently well off from session lows, except for those struggling retail stocks, in another buy-the-dip effort.Overseas, the major indices closed mixed. Germany's DAX increased 0.1%, UK's FTSE increased 0.2%, and France's CAC declined 0.4%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 0.2%.11:25 ETDow -110.42 at 27925.71, Nasdaq +5.86 at 8555.8, S&P -3.61 at 3118.42[BRIEFING.COM] True to form, the S&P 500 has cut its losses and is now down 0.1%.

The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.60%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.79%.Separately, shares of ConocoPhillips (COP 57.26, +0.56, +1.0%) are up 1% after the company highlighted a 10-year plan that included free cash flow of approximately $50 billion.10:55 ETDow -105.56 at 27930.57, Nasdaq -4.52 at 8545.42, S&P -6.64 at 3115.39[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is now down at session lows with a 0.2% decline, which isn't terribly concerning given the benchmark index is still up 2.5% this month, including today's loss.The market has shown a propensity to buy every dip, so it will be interesting to see how the market reacts to the recent slip in stocks. Interestingly, the CBOE Volatility Index is up just 0.5 points, or 4.3%, to 12.95.Separately, shares of Slack (WORK 21.37, -1.74, -7.4%) have dropped another 7% following news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.59, +0.23, +0.2%) competitive product, Teams, has grown daily active users by nearly 50% since July.

An absence of new trade updates has the market struggling for direction, as its bullish uptrend has to contend with the weakness in the retail space.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.90, -0.92, -2.0%) has doubled its losses from earlier and now trades lower by 2.0%. Fortunately, the gains in the health care sector (+0.4%) have helped offset some of their losses today.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 38.63, -1.00) are down 2.5% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson with a price target of $30.09:55 ETDow -25.70 at 28010.43, Nasdaq +8.37 at 8558.31, S&P -0.54 at 3121.49[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has slipped below its flat line, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.3%.Following up on the retail space, shares of Macy's (M 15.39, -1.48, -8.8%) have extended losses after the company alerted customers about a potential credit card breach, according to Axios. TJX Companies (TJX 60.81, +1.26, +2.1%) has bucked the trend after it beat top and bottom-line estimates and raised its full-year guidance.Separately, oil prices ($56.02, -1.12, -2.0%) have been pressured by Russia reportedly saying it is unlikely to expand oil output costs. The S&P 500 energy sector is down 0.9%.09:40 ETDow +13.80 at 28049.93, Nasdaq +21.90 at 8571.84, S&P +2.39 at 3124.42[BRIEFING.COM] The major indices open slightly higher at new all-time highs. The S&P 500 is up 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows financials (+0.4%) and information technology (+0.3%) leading the early advance. Conversely, the utilities (-0.6%) and consumer discretionary (-0.4%) sectors underperform, with the latter pressured by Home Depot (HD 228.90, -9.94, -4.2%) following its earnings results and guidance.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.37, -0.45, -1.0%) is being dragged lower by shares of Kohl's (KSS 49.48, -8.86, -15.1%) after the company missed earnings estimates and lowered its FY20 EPS below consensus.U.S. Treasuries are little changed. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.60%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.80%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 97.79.

TJX Companies (TJX 60.25, +0.70, +1.2%) has bucked the trend with better than expected results and higher full-year guidance.Separately, housing starts and building permits increased more than expected in October, although the data has had muted impact on the futures trade.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc.

The retail industry was under pressure following disappointing quarterly results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 225.86, -12.99, -5.4%) and Kohl's (KSS 47.02, -11.38, -19.5%).The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%) also finished lower, while the Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%) and Russell 2000 (+0.4%) finished higher. The Nasdaq closed at another record high.The session began with each of the large-cap indices setting intraday highs despite the negative sentiment in the retail space. The early advance quickly faltered but overall losses were modest, and transient, as the S&P 500 only dipped 0.3% below its flat line before buyers quickly stepped in to buy the dip.The retail space didn't benefit from an opportunistic mindset, though, as the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.95, -0.87, -1.9%) finished near its lows like the S&P 500 energy (-1.5%) and consumer discretionary (-1.0%) sectors. Home Depot dragged on the consumer discretionary sector while a 3% drop in WTI crude ($55.21, -1.84, -3.2%) weighed on the energy space.Gains were mainly found in the heavily-weighted S&P 500 health care (+0.7%), information technology (+0.2%), and financials (+0.2%) sectors. The real estate sector (+0.2%) also finished in positive territory.TJX Companies (TJX 60.64, +1.09, +1.8%) was a bright spot among the retailers after it beat top and bottom-line estimates and raised its full-year guidance. TJX likely tempered some concerns about U.S. consumer spending for the holiday shopping season that may have been engendered by Home Depot and Kohl's.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 38.00, -1.63, -4.1%) pulled back 4% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson.

Both the Dow and S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%), meanwhile, can attribute their underperformance to Home Depot.The S&P 500 energy sector (-1.1%) is down even more amid a sharp decline in oil prices ($55.69, -1.45, -2.5%), but the market isn't getting concerned about the U.S. consumer based on a couple of reports. Instead, the market is hanging in there amid gains in the heavily-weighted health care (+0.3%), information technology (+0.1%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors.The consensus among many investors is that the market is due for a pullback, but the absence of one has created a sort of pain trade for investors fearful of missing out on further gains.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though.

The early advance quickly faltered but overall losses were modest, and transient, as the S&P 500 only dipped 0.3% below its flat line  before buyers quickly stepped in to buy the dip. The retail space didn't benefit from an opportunistic mindset, though, as the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.95, -0.87, -1.9%) finished near its lows like the S&P 500 energy (-1.5%) and consumer discretionary (-1.0%) sectors. Home Depot dragged on the consumer discretionary sector while a 3% drop in WTI crude ($55.21, -1.84, -3.2%) weighed on the energy space. Gains were mainly found in the heavily-weighted S&P 500 health care (+0.7%), information technology (+0.2%), and financials (+0.2%) sectors. The real estate sector (+0.2%) also finished in positive territory. TJX Companies (TJX 60.64, +1.09, +1.8%) was a bright spot among the retailers after it beat top and bottom-line estimates and raised its full-year guidance. TJX likely tempered some concerns about U.S. consumer spending for the holiday shopping season that may have been engendered by Home Depot and Kohl's. Separately, shares of AT&T (T 38.00, -1.63, -4.1%) pulled back 4% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson. Shares of Slack (WORK 21.18, -1.93, -8.4%) sold off on news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.39, +0.05, unch) competitive product, Teams, increased daily active users by nearly 50% since July. The U.S. Treasury market was relatively quiet, but demand for longer-dated bonds contributed to some curve-flattening activity. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.79%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 97.85. Tuesday's economic calendar was limited to Housing Starts and Building Permits for October:• Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million).There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.Looking ahead, the FOMC Minutes from the October 30-31 meeting and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index will be released on Wednesday.• Nasdaq Composite +29.2% YTD• S&P 500 +24.5% YTD• Dow Jones Industrial Average +19.8% YTD• Russell 2000 +18.5% YTDNASDAQ - 1806 - 1278 - 2.1 blnNYSE - 1351 - 1507 - 842.4 mlnDJ30 - -102.20 - 27933.93NASDAQ - +20.72 - 8570.66SP500 - -1.85 - 3120.18WTI crude falls 3% amid concerns about oversupply - Nov 19 - 15:25 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade unchanged. Any incremental gain would denote another record close for the benchmark index. One last look at the S&P 500 sectors show energy (-1.3%) and consumer discretionary (-0.9%) sectors underperforming the broader market, while the health care sector (+0.7%) remains firmly on top. WTI crude dropped $1.84 (-3.2%) to $55.21/bbl on concerns about oversupply.

Advanced Micro found 13-year highs today in reaction to favorable sell side commentary and news that the company's 7nm professional PC workstation graphics card, dubbed the AMD Radeon Pro W5700, had launched. Alexion Pharma finds itself higher today in conjunction with the company's appearance at today's Stifel Global Healthcare Conference.Conversely, TripAdvisor (TRIP 28.34, -3.27, -10.34%) sits near the bottom of the index as the stock goes ex-dividend today ahead of its $3.50 per share special dividend.NASDAQ - 2014 - 1054 - 1.36 blnNYSE - 1543 - 1312 - 393.0 mlnDJ30 - -75.89 - 27960.24NASDAQ - +38.27 - 8588.21SP500 - +2.78 - 3124.81Gold Makes Back-To-Back Gains - Nov 19 - 14:00 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite still holds the best gains on the day, up 0.31% to this point, as the major averages hold split trade into the final two hours of the session.Gold futures recouped afternoon losses, settling $2.40 higher (+0.2%) to $1,474.30/oz.The U.S. Dollar Index holds gains of less than 0.1% to 97.82.NASDAQ - 1967 - 1074 - 1.25 blnNYSE - 1486 - 1362 - 361.0 mlnDJ30 - -102.47 - 27933.66NASDAQ - +26.47 - 8576.41SP500 - -0.67 - 3121.36Averages Still Mixed - Nov 19 - 13:30 ET[BRIEFING.COM] After tapping all-time highs earlier in the session the Dow Jones Industrial Average finds itself lower, and its counterparts find themselves mixed.Behind index-leading losses out of HomeDepot (HD 226.45, -12.40, -5.19%), Dow Jones Industrial Average constituents Dow (DOW 53.31, -1.01, -1.86%), Chevron (CVX 117.25, -1.30, -1.10%), and Nike (NKE 93.55, -0.63, -0.67%) post the worst declines.Conversely, Visa (V 181.98, +2.32, +1.29%) sits atop the index.Still, inclusive of today's losses the DJIA holds gains of about 3.31% on the month.NASDAQ - 1966 - 1072 - 1.17 blnNYSE - 1506 - 1343 - 337.0 mlnDJ30 - -93.86 - 27942.27NASDAQ - +24.99 - 8574.93SP500 - -0.81 - 3121.22Stock market trades mixed; Home Depot, Kohl's weigh on retail space - Nov 19 - 12:55 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is currently down 0.1% in midday action, with weakness concentrated in the retail space following disappointing quarterly results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.39, -12.46, -5.2%) and Kohl's (KSS 47.58, -10.82, -18.5%). The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, but the Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%) and Russell 2000 (+0.4%) trade higher. The underperformance of the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.12, -0.71, -1.6%)  best displays the negative sentiment that has subsumed the retail industry today. Both the Dow and S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%), meanwhile, can attribute their underperformance to Home Depot. The S&P 500 energy sector (-1.1%) is down even more amid a sharp decline in oil prices ($55.69, -1.45, -2.5%), but the market isn't getting concerned about the U.S. consumer based on a couple of reports. Instead, the market is hanging in there amid gains in the heavily-weighted health care (+0.3%), information technology (+0.1%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors. The consensus among many investors is that the market is due for a pullback, but the absence of one has created a sort of pain trade for investors fearful of missing out on further gains. The S&P 500 was down just 0.3% at its low earlier today before a buy-the-dip effort briefly brought it back above its flat line.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 37.65, -1.99) are down 5.0% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson with a price target of $30. Shares of Slack (WORK 20.88, -2.24, -9.7%) are down 10% on news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.99, +0.65, +0.4%) competitive product, Teams, has increased daily active users by nearly 50% since July.In the Treasury market, demand for longer-dated bonds has caused some minor curve-flattening activity. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.79%.

The market has returned to levels prior to the report, leaving the S&P 500 currently unchanged. The knee-jerk, and algorithmic, price action following the stale news is understandable given the market's anxiousness about a trade deal. Stocks are currently well off from session lows, except for those struggling retail stocks, in another buy-the-dip effort. Overseas, the major indices closed mixed.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory. The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory  thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the  consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest. The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%). Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs. Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%.

Enrique Galván Ochoa: MoneyCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 26, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 721 wordsBody       ? Last Tuesday a mass was held in memory of the former governors of Puebla, Martha Erika Alonso Hidalgo and her husband Rafael Moreno Valle Rosas.Photo taken from Twitter En meaning opposed to bad omens of chayocracy, Mexico's international dollar reserves approach a historic mark this year: $200 billion. In its most recent report, the Bank of Mexico reports that as of the 20th of this month, they had reached 180,512 million. The distance that is still to go to reach 200 thousand is not out of the way possible. A little-known figure is that the central bank has invested a portion of its reserves in U.S. Treasury bonds: $49 billion, as of October this year. It's not the only country that entrusts its savings to gringos. The main investors are China and Japan, with more than a trillion dollars each. (Trump's lawsuit with the Chinese government inexplicable). You will think that the Bank of Mexico wins with its investment in the United States. Yes and no. It charges an interest rate less than 2 percent per annum. Instead, it pays Mexican bond holders a rate of around 7 percent. The gringos take us to the dance. However, it gives international prestige to our country to be on the list of nations that lend money to the United States. This unbalanced relationship is an issue that should be reviewed in the Governing Board of the Bank of Mexico, which today heads the first truly autonomous governor, Alejandro Díaz de León. The previous ones – Mancera, Ortiz, Carstens – were first employees of the presidents of the Republic. Diaz de León did not know López Obrador.Sleepty nightChristmas Eve was a wake-up night for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Tensions at the Mexican embassy in Bolivia go up and down from one hour to the next. They continue to rule on Evo Morales in an intimidating attitude and the risk of them attempting an assault to capture political asyado is growing. Just on the eve of Christmas Eve, Chancellor Marcelo Ebrard's office issued a statement. It thus states, in its main part: The government of Mexico denounces the harassment of both its embassy and its official residence and appreciates the displays of solidarity of different countries and representatives of international organizations in this worrying situation. It also endorses its call on the international community to continue to condemn the intimidation of Mexico's official embassy and residence in Bolivia, which is a flagrant violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. For her side, Bolivian government Chancellor Karen Longaric Rodríguez said on her (@KarenLongaric) account that #Bolivia is a country respectful of diplomatic immunities and denied that the force was going to enter the Mexican embassy. Only it's a troubled country, without a single command center. Sleepless nights will continue at the Mexican chancellery until the asylated ones can be moved to another country.Rising pricesThe UPDATE (l'increase) of the IEPS in Fiscal Miscellaneo 2020 will likely cause cigarette and soft drink prices to rise. For cocacolas and the like, the tax will rise from a peso of 17 cents per litre to a weight of 26 cents. Add the two weights that will increase the transport system of the state of Mexico – one of the most insecure on the planet – and from next Wednesday, the first of January, we will be watching the recent pay rise gradually evaporate.class-"summary">social ombudsmanSubject: card lockedI'm really desperate.

Interestingly, the CBOE Volatility Index is up just 0.5 points, or 4.3%, to 12.95.Separately, shares of Slack (WORK 21.37, -1.74, -7.4%) have dropped another 7% following news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.59, +0.23, +0.2%) competitive product, Teams, has grown daily active users by nearly 50% since July.

An absence of new trade updates has the market struggling for direction, as its bullish uptrend has to contend with the weakness in the retail space.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.90, -0.92, -2.0%) has doubled its losses from earlier and now trades lower by 2.0%. Fortunately, the gains in the health care sector (+0.4%) have helped offset some of their losses today.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 38.63, -1.00) are down 2.5% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson with a price target of $30.09:55 ETDow -25.70 at 28010.43, Nasdaq +8.37 at 8558.31, S&P -0.54 at 3121.49[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has slipped below its flat line, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.3%.Following up on the retail space, shares of Macy's (M 15.39, -1.48, -8.8%) have extended losses after the company alerted customers about a potential credit card breach, according to Axios. TJX Companies (TJX 60.81, +1.26, +2.1%) has bucked the trend after it beat top and bottom-line estimates and raised its full-year guidance.Separately, oil prices ($56.02, -1.12, -2.0%) have been pressured by Russia reportedly saying it is unlikely to expand oil output costs. The S&P 500 energy sector is down 0.9%.09:40 ETDow +13.80 at 28049.93, Nasdaq +21.90 at 8571.84, S&P +2.39 at 3124.42[BRIEFING.COM] The major indices open slightly higher at new all-time highs. The S&P 500 is up 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows financials (+0.4%) and information technology (+0.3%) leading the early advance. Conversely, the utilities (-0.6%) and consumer discretionary (-0.4%) sectors underperform, with the latter pressured by Home Depot (HD 228.90, -9.94, -4.2%) following its earnings results and guidance.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.37, -0.45, -1.0%) is being dragged lower by shares of Kohl's (KSS 49.48, -8.86, -15.1%) after the company missed earnings estimates and lowered its FY20 EPS below consensus.U.S. Treasuries are little changed. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.60%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.80%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 97.79.

Relative weakness in the retail space hasn't been enough to deter the good mood on Wall Street.Home Depot (HD 230.37, -8.48, -3.6%) and Kohl's (KSS 50.70, -7.70, -13.2%) have disappointed investors with their quarterly results and guidance, causing selling pressure in many of the other retail stocks, too. TJX Companies (TJX 60.25, +0.70, +1.2%) has bucked the trend with better than expected results and higher full-year guidance.Separately, housing starts and building permits increased more than expected in October, although the data has had muted impact on the futures trade.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 97.80.Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for November declined to 70 from 71 in October.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though.

Best Stocks of the Year: Apple Is Number 1TheStreet.comDecember 31, 2019 Tuesday 1:22 PM EDTCopyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 702 wordsByline: Annie GausHighlight: The tech giant's shares experienced quite the turnaround in 2019.BodyFor 2019, TheStreet has compiled a list of the top 25 stocks of the year, looking at everything from stock performance and quarterly results versus expectations to execution against strategy and each stock's overall story.After publishing round-ups for the 25th-ranked through the 6th-ranked stocks, we're now running individual articles on our top five picks. Picks         ***In 2019, Apple dodged trade war bullets, grew its services and wearables segments, and made progress in persuading investors that it can prosper in a non-iPhone-centric world. And for all those reasons, it was voted TheStreet's Stock of the Year over many other worthy candidates.The tech giant started the year on shaky footing, given a broader market plunge in December 2018 driven largely by trade uncertainty and other macro issues. And Apple's unusual fourth-quarter revenue warning, which it  , had investors scrambling for answers on what the year had in store. Since then, however, Apple has rewarded those who stayed the course. Apple  shares have steadily gained more than 70% throughout this year, well outpacing the broader S&P's gain of roughly 25%. It's also the top-performing FAANG name this year by a wide margin. According to Tom Forte, analyst at D.A. Davidson, part of what influenced Apple's stock performance this year was simply "low expectations." As trade tensions roiled the markets in late 2018 and throughout this year, Apple's position in China -- both as its manufacturing base and as an important sales market -- placed it in the unenviable position as poster child of the U.S.-China trade war. Many investors worried that Apple could see punishing tariffs applied to iPhone imports, a consumer sales hit in China, or other  But so far, no such fears have materialized on a sustained basis. "Because of its size in the U.S. and in China, it's arguably the only company that can lobby both the U.S. and Chinese governments," Forte said. "They were able to dodge several bullets in calendar 2019 because of their influence."Playing  , Tim Cook forged a productive relationship with the White House and found success in navigating Apple through several instances of tariff threats that would have impacted Apple products. Recently, trade negotiators announced a reprieve from a potential 15% tariff on consumer goods, including electronics, as part of an  Of course, there was a lot more happening with Apple than just trade issues. Product-wise, Apple kicked its services segment into high gear the launch of Apple Arcade, Apple Card, Apple News+ and Apple TV+, These services are only a few weeks or months old as of December 2019, but they round out a growing slice of Apple's services portfolio, which also includes Apple Pay, Apple Care, the App store and others. Apple also delivered strong growth in its wearables segment, anchored by strong Apple Watch sales, and released a  "The maturation of the smartphone market has been the best thing to happen to Apple because it forced them to diversify," Forte added. Although iPhone sales are still the biggest line item in Apple's overall revenue, investors appear confident in the power of Apple's brand and product ecosystem to drive success in newer product endeavors, such as wearables and services. As for what lies ahead in 2020, it's looking like a different ballgame. Expectations are quite a bit higher now. Next year, Apple investors will learn more about how some of its newer products and services are performing, and be able to further parse out what their contributions are to Apple's bottom line. Apple is also due to release several new 5G-enabled iPhones, potentially at a  , that could drive a fresh wave of sales. But with a market cap of $1.24 trillion as of Dec. 16, Apple's stock is a lot more expensive than it used to be. And another gangbusters year of 70% gains in its share price is far from a sure thing, noted Patrick Healey, president of financial planning firm Caliber Financial Partners."We're in an election year [next year] and we're going to see more volatility; I'd be hard pressed to see them replicate that in 2020," Healey said. Apple is a holding in Jim Cramer's.

Censorship in competitive gaming puts Hofstra gamers at riskThe Chronicle: Hofstra UniversityDecember 10, 2019 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 733 wordsByline: Andrew IovinoBodyThe Hofstra Esports club is a place where students are able to join like-minded gamers and participate in online competitions representing the university, but after recent events that occurred last October, the club and its members may be at risk of censorship.Ng Wai Chung, also known as Blitzchung while gaming, was a professional gamer and college student who was suspended and had his prize money revoked after yelling, "Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times!" during an interview.Chung is best known for playing Hearthstone, a popular online competitive card game created by Blizzard Entertainment. Blizzard is a video game developing and publishing company based in Irvine, California that is known for hit games such as World of Warcraft and Overwatch.Chung's ban sparked controversy in the gaming community, with gamers in the U.S. scolding Blizzard for squandering free speech to avoid upsetting the Chinese government."Blitzchung was within his rights. Blizzard banning him to appease China isn't a good look for them," said Sean Cafferty, a junior film major who is the president of Hofstra's Esports club . "While I understand that Blizzard is a business, I think the fact that they were so extreme with their initial punishment was a mistake," Cafferty said.Other colleges and universities have reacted in support of Chung as well. Casey Chambers, Corwin Dark and Torin Wright are all sophomore international studies majors at American University. As members of their school's esports team, they decided that they had to do something in the wake of Chung's ban. Holding up a sign that read, "Free Hong Kong, boycott Blizz" during a live-streamed Hearthstone match, the players expected an immediate ban similar to the one Chung had received.The match was run by Tespa. "[Tespa is] a collegiate gaming organization and a subdivision of Blizzard that supports gaming initiatives," Cafferty said. "They send prizes to clubs, raffle off rewards and otherwise support the clubs."Instead of being suspended, the American University esports team was invited to another match afterward, which they declined, requesting they be punished like Chung was because they committed the same offense."We used our delayed suspension to point out how banning Blitzchung was a PR decision to appease China and not taking action on us was to appease the West. Delaying our ban was a calculated choice," said Chambers, who is the captain of the esports team at American University.The suspension of Blitzchung may have sparked controversy, but the suspension of the American University students has created a tangible fear of punishment for American gamers."There is a looming fear of being careful about what you say. Esports is very new at Hofstra and it's scary to potentially be at odds with Tespa, Blizzard or the university," Cafferty said."The First Amendment only restricts governmental action. No matter how censorial, private action cannot violate the First Amendment," said James Weinstein, an expert on free speech at Arizona State University.Since Blizzard is a private company and both American and Hofstra University are private institutions, Blizzard is legally allowed to suspend players under most circumstances."Players have social power. It should not be held against them to use that position of power," Cafferty said.One month later, J. Allen Brack, president of Blizzard, claimed to take responsibility for the suspensions during a panel at Blizzcon, Blizzard's annual convention in Anaheim, California. This was done in response to protestors outside the convention center holding picket signs and donning Winnie the Pooh outfits, in reference to the president of China, Xi Jinping , who banned the character from the country after being visually compared to him."Brack called for accountability, but that involves a full acceptance of the problem and actively mending the situation, which they haven't done," Chambers said. "It was a PR statement to try to remove criticism."As of now, Blitzchung's suspension from the game has been halved and his prize money was returned, but he and the American University students are still actively being punished for their actions as the suspensions have not been entirely lifted."Blizzard believes China is significantly more likely to harm their profits than the West in response to this incident, which appears to be true," Chambers said.Load-Date: December 10, 2019End of Document

Bitcoin Plummets Below $7,000; What's Behind Its Sudden Tumble This Week?TheStreet.comNovember 22, 2019 Friday 9:23 AM EDTCopyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 372 wordsByline: Annie GausHighlight: The price of a bitcoin fell below $7,000 on Friday, its lowest level since May.BodyThe price of bitcoin took a sudden tumble this week to the lowest level the cryptocurrency has seen in months, falling almost 19% over the last five days.Bitcoin was trading at $6,977 as of Friday morning, marking the first time it has traded below $7,000 since May. Even with the declines, the price of one bitcoin has risen by about 89% so far this year.Compared to more traditional assets, bitcoin's bull and bear cycles can be difficult to forecast and explain. Bitcoin observers have speculated that recent price action has something to do with moves by China to crack down on illegal exchanges and to formalize the Chinese government's backing of blockchain technologies, as well as recent changes in how hard it is to create bitcoin. China plans to issue its own cryptocurrency, which could launch within the next 18 months. Although crypto trading has been restricted in China for years, the country is home to many of the world's biggest bitcoin mining operations. And mining is a good place to look to better understand bitcoin prices, according to Michael Kazley of the asset management firm Crescent Crypto."Bitcoin's 'difficulty' is a measure of how likely a miner is to mine a block for a given amount of hashrate and time," Kazley explained. "It serves to keep the network in balance, and aims to keep bitcoin's block time around 10 minutes, adjusting every two weeks," Kazley noted that difficulty rallied to new heights in 2018, bringing bitcoin prices along with it. But bitcoin saw a "substantial difficulty decline" two weeks ago, according to Kazley. "Today, difficulty adjusted upwards slightly, but market participants are keenly watching to see if a bearish difficulty trends continue," Kazley said. After a slump in the latter part of last year, the price of bitcoin hovered in the $3,000 to $4,000 range throughout the early months of 2019 before skyrocketing again between March and August 2019."Historically, bitcoin difficulty has been more resilient than price and even managed to climb during the bulk of the 2018 bear market," Kazley said. "However, we did see a steep difficulty decline in October 2018, which coincided with a very large selloff from the $6,000s to the $3,000s in about a month's time."Load-Date: November 23, 2019End of Document

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +34.10.U.S. equity-index futures continue to edge higher into record territory, even as shares of Home Depot (HD 227.25, -11.60, -4.9%) slide on disappointing quarterly results and guidance.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 97.80.Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for November declined to 70 from 71 in October.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though.

Great documentaries of 2019 that you can watch in streaming in 2020CE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 29, 2019 SundayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1095 wordsBodySome of the most outstanding documentaries of 2019 have explained to us our past, our present and, therefore, our future. Issues such as war, the charm of the rural world, corruption and family remed in them. In addition, they can already be seen (or are about to) be seen on the many streaming platforms. Here are some recommendations to catch up throughout 2020 of what's going on in the genre.1.Chris the Swiss, by Anja Kofmel (Filmin)This Swiss director (Lugano, 1982) formed in the field of animation combines with great expertise the objective and the subjective, the personal memory and the historical memory in this film that won the critics' award of the Atl'ntida Film Festival. In it, he investigates in the first person the death of his cousin Chris W'tenberg, a war reporter who died in strange circumstances during the Balkan conflict. The real action scenes are shocking; animation, hypnotics.2. For Sama, by Waad Al Kateab (Movistar +)Journalist Waad Al Kateab (Syria, 1991) delves into a perhaps too personal account: the chronicle of the siege of Aleppo in the form of a visual letter dedicated to her daughter Sama. Without disguising reality or sweetening the horror of war, it has shocked much of the viewers who have seen the film where it has been screened so far (South By Southwest and Cannes, among other festivals). Winner of the European Film Awards for Best Documentary, it is one of the favorite titles in the next Oscars. It will arrive at Movistar+ in February 2020.3. Ridge, by John Skoog (MUBI)The imaginative and vivid photograph of this documentary seduces in such a way that, at the end, one feels that an entire summer in Sweden has passed. A combination of mundane stories with more relevant ones in Kvidinge, the director's village, serve as an excuse to create 70 minutes of magical realism in the midst of Scandinavian nature. In March 2019 Ridge won the main award (and was a critic's favorite) at one of the world's leading documentary film festivals, Copenhagen's CPH:DOX. It can be seen on MUBI.4. One Child Nation, by Nanfu Wang and Lynn Zhang (Amazon Prime Video)Director Nanfu Wang (China, 1985), a resident of the United States, returned to her hometown to shoot this documentary. There he collected harsh testimonies recorded behind the Chinese government on the country's brutal birth control measures in a recent past. The result of his research with Lynn Zhang has become another favorite to win the Oscar for Best Documentary in 2020. "In China, our generation is the result of censorship and propaganda, so it was important for us to explain what had happened and to give a context and nuances that this story has not had before. It was a way of unlearning what we learned," Zhang told THE COUNTRY.5. My name is Violeta, by Marc Parramon and David Fernández de Castro (Movistar +)"My name is Violeta", were the first words Ignatius said to his parents, Franceska Jaimes and Nacho Vidal, to explain, at the age of 6, that she was a trans girl. This revealing expression is what gives its name to this documentary, which shows the challenges it will face from adolescence. "It's a bright, colorful story that helps us marvel at the difference," one of its directors, David Fernández de Castro (London, 1969), told THE COUNTRY.6. Torn Apart: Separated at the Border, by Ellen Goosenberg Kent (HBO)The American, winner of an Oscar in 2015 for her work in the documentary genre, personalizes in this medium the account of the almost 3,000segregated families in the United States. It's the consequence of Donald Trump's controversial immigration policy. Maria and if son Alex, from Honduras, and Vilma and his daughter Yeisvi, from Guatemala, put face, name and surname to this humanitarian crisis in the richest country in the world. "It's a matter that needs to be counted on with more than just numbers," the filmmaker once explained.7. Emergency in Mexico DF, by Luke Lorentzen (Movistar +)"Then I decided to spend a short time in Mexico City. One night, I found an ambulance on the corner of my street. I realized that the men who came out of it were more than just co-workers, who were actually family and I asked them to spend a night with them. I kept my mouth open with what I saw. Without looking for it, I came across a film," Luke Lorentzen (United States, 1993) recalled the country in October of the new documentary. In this film he follows in the footsteps of the Ochoa clan, which compensates with his private vehicle for the medical deficiencies of Mexico City. Only a few dozen public ambulances are operational at a location of nearly nine million people. It can be viewed on Movistar+ from January 5.8. The Prosecutor, The President and the Spy, by Justin Webster (Movistar +)The director of Death in Leon premieres new six-chapter series. It is reminiscent of prosecutor Alberto Nisman. Four days after accusing Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner of conspiring with Iran, she was found dead in his bathroom with a shot to the head. His mysterious death in 2015 became a global issue. Arrives at Movistar + on January 12.9. The Pioneer, by Enric Bach (HBO)In 2016, the documentary series Movistar + Muerte en León (2016), about the assassination of the president of the Diputación de León Isabel Carrasco, was a success. HBO joined him, releasing a film in early 2019, as a sequel and conclusion, titled Death in Leon. Case closed. To continue betting on the genre, he launched Soon after The Pioneer. Throughout four chapters that have been the most talked about of the year, Enric Bach makes a profile of another of the most controversial political figures of recent Spain, that of Jesus Gil. Again Justin Webster appears in the credits, this time as a screenwriter.And don't lose track of...Although they do not yet have a release date, keep an eye out for these other titles that are among the highlights of the 2019 documentary production.Honeyland, by Tamara KotevskaNorthern Macedonia released its name in 2019 and did so by placing one of its films in screening rooms around the planet. This documentary by Tamara Kotevska (Northern Macedonia, 1993) about the parallel lives of a colony of bees affected by the chaos of the modern world and her carer Hatidze, who also breaks her peaceful rural life, has fallen in love with critics.Aquarela, by Viktor KossakovskyThe sound of water is the sole narrator of this documentary full of stunning aquatic images. In addition to being a sign of the grandiosity of water, the documentary is also an example of the grandiosity of cinema.Load-Date: January 27, 2020End of Document

All Rights ReservedLength: 534 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Isobel Asher Hamilton)Highlight: Apple and TikTok skipped a Senate hearing on Big Tech and China, and Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri has been targeted by 'swatting.'BodyHandout/ReutersGood morning! This is the tech news you need to know this Wednesday.• Apple and TikTok skipped a Senate hearing on Big Tech and China. Empty chairs were left to draw attention to the missing tech executives, signalling the senators' displeasure.• Researchers discovered that Siri, Google Assistant, and Amazon Alexa can be hijacked with a $14 laser pointer to open garage doors, start cars, and shop online. They found that shining even cheap laser pointers at microphones in smart speakers and some smartphone models could result in the device interpreting the light as sound.• Employees of TikTok in the US were reportedly pressured to censor "culturally problematic" content that might offend the Chinese government. Former employees told the Washington Post they were directed to censor videos that featured vaping, "suggestive" dancing, and social and political issues.• Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri and his family have been targeted by multiple "swatting" calls, drawing armed police to their homes in San Francisco and New York. In both cases responding officers were able to determine that the reports were hoaxes, though the callers reported shootings in progress.• Google is launching an accelerator for climate change startups. The first cohort will be selected from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa for a six-month program beginning in early 2020 and a second cohort will start later in 2020.• A Facebook exec acknowledged that some people won't be "comfortable" using a financial product built by Facebook but said Mark Zuckerberg isn't giving up - even if it takes decades. Kevin Weil, vice president of Facebook's currency venture Calibra, spoke at Web Summit in Lisbon.• Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey trolled Facebook's rebranded all-caps logo. This isn't the first time Dorsey has pushed back on Facebook in recent weeks: he has criticized Mark Zuckerberg's comments on free speech, and after Facebook said it wouldn't fact-check political ads, Twitter said it would ban political ads.• YouTube banned former White House advisor Sebastian Gorka after he refused to stop playing an Imagine Dragons song in his videos. Gorka repeatedly used the Imagine Dragons song "Radioactive" to introduce his radio show "America First," which was streamed on YouTube.• Peloton acquired a company that manufactures its bikes for $47.4 million. This is an important acquisition for Peloton as it had previously said that having limited control over its third-party manufacturing partners is a big risk for the company.• Microsoft researchers used a laser to encode Warner Bros. "Superman" on a piece of glass. The feat was a proof of concept for a years-long effort to store data in glass, and the researchers used a combination of laser optics and artificial intelligence.Have an Amazon Alexa device?

Global Transportation Management System (TMS) Market: Growth, Trends & Forecasts (2019-2024) - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireNovember 13, 2019 Wednesday 4:05 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 1219 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Transportation Management System Market - Growth, Trends, and Forecast (2019 - 2024)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The transportation management system market is expected to register a CAGR of 19.13% over the forecast period of 2019-2024.According to Cerasis, by using a transportation management system (TMS) solution, a shipper can reduce freight invoice payments by 90-95%. TMS plays a crucial role in handling transportation-related activities, such as moving goods from the supplier to the place of production and then to the end-user. There is a high demand for an efficient TMS to reduce the overall delivery time, owing to the increase in global trade activities.Over the last couple of years, an increasing number of ERP vendors have jumped into the transportation and logistics sector. Led by companies like Oracle, this trend opened the doors for more shippers to use TMS as part of their overall enterprise solutions rather than having to purchase separate software applications from different vendors.The need for scalability, visibility, and flexibility across the supply chain is a major driving factor for the TMS market. With the growth in the e-commerce industry across the world, the online retail market is developing rapidly, and customers are looking for highly personalized retail experiences, which helps to drive the market.Moreover, as the logistics and transportation sectors continue to grow, the need for faster, smarter, and more efficient shipping services becomes crucial, which is expected to make a significant contribution to the growth of the market.According to Logistics Management, most users experience about 5 to 10% freight cost reductions after implementing TMS, with the higher end of the scale increasing by at least 2 percentage points.New technologies such as AI and Blockchain are significantly contributing to TMS. Moreover, companies are making huge investments in their technological R&D, to improve payment processing, freight location monitoring, and order fulfillment.However, issues related to low-level of awareness among consumers and high deployment costs are hindering the growth of the market.Key Market TrendsShifting Towards Cloud Technologies in Supply Chain Management to Augment the TMS Market• Vendor innovation along with the proliferation of e-commerce and omnichannel distribution are both pushing more shippers to consider TMS as part of their overall supply chain management strategy.• Growing demand to improve governance and transparency, while expanding business capabilities among transportation industries is likely to drive the demand for cloud-based services in their operation.• Major companies, such as Amazon and Walmart utilize cloud-based services in supply chain management to gain both financial and operational benefits. As cloud-based technologies are universally accessible, cloud-based software in logistics is estimated to increase rapidly, primarily because of its ability to connect teams and monitor the exact whereabouts of a shipment.• A lot of companies are moving from older, on-premise platforms to either multi-tenant (when a single instance of the software runs on a server and serves multiple tenants) or Cloud-based solutions.• Moreover, third party logistic providers offer technology service of TMS 87% over the year 2019. This traction is due to the increasing usage of TMS across the transportation and logistics industries.Asia-Pacific is Expected to Be the Fastest Growing Market• Asia-Pacific is projected to be the fastest-growing region for the transportation management system market, owing to the increase in international trade, especially in developing economies, such as China and India. The growth in international business is an essential element that has supported infrastructural developments and solution deployments for logistics services.• In many Asia-Pacific countries, the transportation infrastructure is inadequate for useful goods and public transportation, thus driving the demand for the transportation management system market.• Moreover, the rate of technological change has been rapid with the Chinese government introducing new policies to create a favorable environment for smart transportation development.• By 2020, over 50% of new vehicles produced in China are expected to have Driver Assistance (DA), Conditional Automation (CA) systems, with over 10% connected to an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). These factors are further expected to drive the demand for TMS solutions to accelerate the deployment of smart transportation.Competitive LandscapeThe transportation management system market is consolidated due to a few players are having a large market.

World Transportation Management System (TMS) Market Outlook, 2024 - Growing Preference for SaaS-based Transportation Solutions Drives the MarketGlobeNewswireNovember 13, 2019 Wednesday 7:14 AM PTCopyright 2019 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: RESEARCH ANALYSIS AND REPORTSLength: 1239 wordsBodyDublin, Nov.  13, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The     "Transportation Management System Market - Growth, Trends, and Forecast (2019 - 2024)"   report has been added to     ResearchAndMarkets.com's  offering.The transportation management system market is expected to register a CAGR of 19.13% over the forecast period of 2019-2024. According to Cerasis, by using a transportation management system (TMS) solution, a shipper can reduce freight invoice payments by 90-95%. TMS plays a crucial role in handling transportation-related activities, such as moving goods from the supplier to the place of production and then to the end-user. There is a high demand for an efficient TMS to reduce the overall delivery time, owing to the increase in global trade activities.Over the last couple of years, an increasing number of ERP vendors have jumped into the transportation and logistics sector. Led by companies like Oracle, this trend opened the doors for more shippers to use TMS as part of their overall enterprise solutions rather than having to purchase separate software applications from different vendors.The need for scalability, visibility, and flexibility across the supply chain is a major driving factor for the TMS market. With the growth in the e-commerce industry across the world, the online retail market is developing rapidly, and customers are looking for highly personalized retail experiences, which helps to drive the market.Moreover, as the logistics and transportation sectors continue to grow, the need for faster, smarter, and more efficient shipping services becomes crucial, which is expected to make a significant contribution to the growth of the market.According to Logistics Management, most users experience about 5 to 10% freight cost reductions after implementing TMS, with the higher end of the scale increasing by at least 2 percentage points.New technologies such as AI and Blockchain are significantly contributing to TMS. Moreover, companies are making huge investments in their technological R&D, to improve payment processing, freight location monitoring, and order fulfillment.However, issues related to low-level of awareness among consumers and high deployment costs are hindering the growth of the market.Key Market TrendsShifting Towards Cloud Technologies in Supply Chain Management to Augment the TMS Market• Vendor innovation along with the proliferation of e-commerce and omnichannel distribution are both pushing more shippers to consider TMS as part of their overall supply chain management strategy.• Growing demand to improve governance and transparency, while expanding business capabilities among transportation industries is likely to drive the demand for cloud-based services in their operation.• Major companies, such as Amazon and Walmart utilize cloud-based services in supply chain management to gain both financial and operational benefits. As cloud-based technologies are universally accessible, cloud-based software in logistics is estimated to increase rapidly, primarily because of its ability to connect teams and monitor the exact whereabouts of a shipment.• A lot of companies are moving from older, on-premise platforms to either multi-tenant (when a single instance of the software runs on a server and serves multiple tenants) or Cloud-based solutions.• Moreover, third party logistic providers offer technology service of TMS 87% over the year 2019. This traction is due to the increasing usage of TMS across the transportation and logistics industries.Asia-Pacific is Expected to Be the Fastest Growing Market• Asia-Pacific is projected to be the fastest-growing region for the transportation management system market, owing to the increase in international trade, especially in developing economies, such as China and India. The growth in international business is an essential element that has supported infrastructural developments and solution deployments for logistics services.• In many Asia-Pacific countries, the transportation infrastructure is inadequate for useful goods and public transportation, thus driving the demand for the transportation management system market.• Moreover, the rate of technological change has been rapid with the Chinese government introducing new policies to create a favorable environment for smart transportation development. • By 2020, over 50% of new vehicles produced in China are expected to have Driver Assistance (DA), Conditional Automation (CA) systems, with over 10% connected to an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). These factors are further expected to drive the demand for TMS solutions to accelerate the deployment of smart transportation.Competitive LandscapeThe transportation management system market is consolidated due to a few players are having a large market. Some of the major players are 3GTMS Inc., CargoSmart Ltd., Manhattan Associates Inc., JDA Software Group, Inc., Oracle Corporation, SAP SE, One Network Enterprises Inc., Precision Software Inc., among others. Industry Developments• September 2019 - Manhattan Associates Inc. has expanded and enhanced its Indian operations with the opening of a new facility in Brigade Tech Gardens. This investment increases Manhattan's footprint in India and reflects the company's strong commitment to the country. • June 2019 - 3Gtms Inc., has partnered with Trimble for commercial routing solutions. Trimble MAPS (Maps and Applications for Professional Solutions) brings together the company's former ALK Technologies and TMW Appian Final Mile businesses, creating an integrated platform that delivers ALK's mileage, mapping, routing, and navigation technology along with Appian's fleet routing, scheduling, and optimization solutions.

THREE DARTMOUTH STUDENTS RECEIVE SCHWARZMAN SCHOLARSHIPSStates News ServiceDecember 6, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1092 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: HANOVER, NH BodyThe following information was released by Dartmouth College:A record three Dartmouth studentstwo alumni and one undergraduatehave been named 2021 Schwarzman Scholars. Delia Friel '20, Danny Li '19, and Colleen O'Connor '19 join 142 other top students from around the world who will receive a fully funded scholarship to study at the new Schwarzman College at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China.The 2021 cohort, the fifth Schwarzman class since the program welcomed its inaugural scholars in 2016, was selected from more than 4,700 applicants and includes students from 41 countries. Schwarzman Scholars pursue a master's degree in global affairs with a core curriculum focused on three pillars: China, global affairs, and leadership."Delia, Danny, and Colleen have demonstrated an outstanding commitment to public service and scholarship that will not only serve them well as Schwarzman Scholars, but will also represent Dartmouth well on the global stage," says Provost Joseph Helble.Friel, Li, and O'Connor join four previous Dartmouth students selected by Schwarzman: Campbell Haynes '14, Halimo Hassen '17, and inaugural scholars Jordyn Turner '16 and Jacob Gaba '16.Founded by Stephen Schwarzman, chairman, CEO, and co-founder of the global investment firm Blackstone, the program seeks to prepare a new generation of international leaders "to respond to the geopolitical landscape of the 21st century," according to the program's website.For information about applying for Schwarzman Scholarships and other programs, and to see a list of past recipients, visit the Office of Fellowship Advising .Delia Friel '20Delia Friel '20 is majoring in biomedical engineering with a minor in Spanish. As a presidential scholar, Friel worked as a research assistant studying the mechanics of morphogenesis in embryonic brain and heart development at Thayer School of Engineering and was a learning fellow for a scientific computing class at Thayer, serving as a teaching assistant. She served as a counselor for the U.S. State Department's Women in Science Program in Kosovo and was an intern for the Ways and Means committee in the U.S. House of Representatives. She was also a player on Dartmouth's national championship women's rugby team in 2018."I am absolutely overjoyed and honored to be a Schwarzman Scholar," Friel says. "I want to thank Dartmouth and my professors for their support and preparation over these past four years. This is an absolute dream come true, and I am excited to continue learning about the intersection of global affairs and science."Friel says she looks forward to learning more about China and thinking about how the global community can work to pursue innovation and improve healthcare delivery.Danny Li '19At Dartmouth, Danny Li '19 served as class president for four years, founded two student organizations focused on international diplomacy and foreign policy, and served at the helm of six other student organizations including the Dartmouth Law Journal, graduating as a class marshal. As a Rockefeller Leadership Fellow at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Center for Public Policy, He was involved in a range of public policy programs, including as an intern at the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training and writing memoranda on the 2018 National Defense Strategy.Li currently serves as an analyst at The Asia Group, leading the firm's portfolio in identifying and assessing geo-economics and trade trends in Asia, and conducting research for the firm's China practice, assessing political and market developments taking place in mainland China in order to provide insights for U.S. companies."I am excited for Schwarzman because I see it as an opportunity to engage in a deep yearlong discussion about the economic, political, and technological trends and developments that are taking place in China as well as Asia more broadly, and to think deeply about how the United States and China fit into that changing global landscape," Li says.At Tsinghua, Li plans to explore the economics, business, and international studies curriculum and take advantage of the Schwarzman Deep Dive and Practical Training Project opportunities to explore how the Chinese system of government creates policy, with a focus on understanding of cross-cultural governance and tackling real-life policy challenges in mainland China."I hope to emerge from this experience enriched and better equipped to shape and inform Asia policy in Washington, D.C.," Li says.Colleen O'Connor '19Colleen O'Connor '19 describes herself as "a tri-lingual social entrepreneur passionate about creating social change through the private sector." She graduated as salutatorian and a class marshal. As an undergraduate O'Connor studied Chinese, economics, and human-centered design and was a leader of Women in Business and the Dartmouth Entrepreneurial Network, part of the Magnuson Center for Entrepreneurship at Dartmouth.She has spent the past three years promoting entrepreneurship as a vehicle for female empowerment in South America and East Asia, which she started as a Stamps Scholar at Dartmouth. Professionally, O'Connor works in business strategy consulting at EY-Parthenon in Boston, and formerly worked with startups and nonprofits in Japan, China, Mexico, and Peru."My heart is absolutely bursting with gratitudeboth for this amazing opportunity and for the family, friends, and professors who helped get me to this point," O'Connor says. "I am still in a little bit of shock that I get to return to China for a fourth time, but this time surrounded by a cohort of future leaders and supported by some of the preeminent forces in business, politics, and academia."At Tsinghua University, she plans to take classes in international relations and public policy with the aim of becoming a more globally oriented leader. O'Connor says she is interested in exploring the contradictions of a country that has the highest number of self-made female billionaires yet have remnants of culturally enforced gender discrimination and male preference that still affect female entrepreneurs within the economy's informal sectors."As someone passionate about social entrepreneurship, I hope to use this opportunity to fully embrace the culture and better understand why some of these seemingly contradictory practices occur simultaneously in China," she says.Since graduating from Dartmouth, O'Connor has also committed to attending Harvard Business School, where she has deferred enrollment until the fall of 2021, following the Schwarzman Scholars program.Load-Date: December 6, 2019End of Document

Now fake Facebook accounts are using fake facesCNN WireDecember 21, 2019 Saturday 6:04 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1419 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, Ireland (CNN Business) BodyDUBLIN, Ireland (CNN Business) --  Artificially-generated faces of people who don't exist are being used to front fake Facebook accounts in an attempt to trick users and game the company's systems, the social media network said Friday. Experts who reviewed the accounts say it is the first time they have seen fake images like this being used at scale as part of a single social media campaign.The accounts, which were removed by Facebook on Friday, were part of a network that generally posted in support of President Trump and against the Chinese government, experts who reviewed the accounts said. Many of the accounts promoted links to a Facebook page and website called "The BL." Facebook said the accounts were tied to the US-based Epoch Media Group, which owns The Epoch Times newspaper, a paper tied to the Falun Gong movement that is similarly pro-Trump. The publisher of the Epoch Times denied that Epoch and The BL were linked in emails to the fact-checking organization Snopes earlier this year.In a statement released after this story initially published on Friday, Epoch Times publisher Stephen Gregory said, "The Epoch Times and The BL media companies are unaffiliated. The BL was founded by a former employee, and employs some of our former employees. However, that some of our former employees work for BL is not evidence of any connection between the two organizations."The BL is a publication of Epoch Times Vietnam. As can be seen in archived pages of The Epoch Times website, Epoch Times Vietnam was no longer listed as part of Epoch Media Group in October 2018."In response, a Facebook spokesperson told CNN Business that executives at The BL were active administrators on Epoch Media Group Pages as recently as Friday morning. The dystopian revelation of the use of artificially-generated images in this way points to an increasingly complicated online information landscape as America enters a presidential election year. Silicon Valley and the US intelligence community are still struggling with the fallout from widespread online interference in the 2016 presidential election. The Facebook accounts used profile pictures that appeared to show real people smiling and looking directly into a camera. But the people do not and have never existed, according to Facebook and other researchers. The images were created using artificial intelligence technology. The same basic methods are used to produce deepfake videos --- fake videos that the US intelligence community has warned could be used as part of a foreign disinformation campaign targeting Americans. Other fake accounts that were part of the same network used stolen pictures of real people, according to the social media investigations company Graphika and the thinktank the Atlantic Council. Facebook provided information to Graphika and the Atlantic Council for analysis in advance of Friday's announcement. The accounts were used to run dozens of pro-Trump Facebook groups with names like "America Needs President Trump," and "WE STAND WITH TRUMP & PENCE!," according to Graphika and the Atlantic Council.The fact-checking organizations Snopes and Lead Stories had reported in recent weeks and months about the use of artificial images on Facebook that were part of this network of accounts. Snopes published a story last week criticizing Facebook's apparent inaction on the issue. Facebook said Friday it had "benefited from open source reporting" in the takedown but said that its own systems that monitor for coordinated and inauthentic behavior had proactively identified many of the accounts.In a joint report on their findings, Graphika and the Atlantic Council outlined how they were able to determine which of the profile photos had been generated using artificial intelligence. "This technology is rapidly evolving toward generating more believable pictures, but a few indicators still give these profile pictures away," they said. Images generated using artificial intelligence, specifically by a machine-learning method known as a GAN, or generative adversarial network, are "notorious for struggling with features that should be symmetrical on the human face, such as glasses or earrings, and with background details. Profile pictures from the network showed telltales of all three." GANs consist of two neural networks --- which are algorithms modeled on the neurons in a brain --- facing off against each other to produce real-looking images. One of the neural networks generates images (of, say, a woman's face), while the other tries to determine whether that image is a fake or a real face.While experts were able to spot these telltale signs on close inspection, it is likely the regular Facebook user would not. Over the past year, a number of websites have emerged online that create fake faces using artificial intelligence. Researchers from Graphika and the Atlantic Council could not conclusively determine if the people behind the fake accounts had used artificial pictures from these public sites or had generated their own.In their report released Friday, Graphika and the Atlantic Council said, "The ease with which the operation managed to generate so many synthetic pictures, in order to give its fake accounts (mostly) convincing faces, is a concern. Further research is needed to find ways to identify AI-generated profile pictures reliably and at scale, so that platforms and researchers can automate their detection."Connection to Epoch Media Group In all, Facebook said Friday, it had removed a network of 610 Facebook accounts, 89 pages, 90 groups, and 72 Instagram accounts. About 55 million accounts followed one or more of the pages, and the vast majority of followers were outside the United States, Facebook said. Facebook did not say if all of all these followers were real --- some of them may themselves have been fake accounts. The network of pages removed on Friday had spent almost $10 million on Facebook ads, according to Facebook. Facebook's investigation primarily focused on "The BL" (The Beauty of Life) --- a set of Facebook pages and a website that says its goal is to "present to the world the most beautiful aspects of life."The pages often shared pro-Trump and anti-China content.On its website, The BL outlined the dangers of "inaccurate and degenerate information" that it said "can be easily channeled toward vulnerable or uninformed people."The purpose of the fake accounts, including those using fake faces, appears to have been to promote links to The BL's website and Facebook pages, Ben Nimmo, director of investigations at Graphika told CNN Business on Friday.Facebook said the fake accounts were tied to the US-based Epoch Media Group and "individuals in Vietnam working on its behalf." The company did not outline precisely how it made the connection, but in recent years Facebook has hired a team of investigators to find fake accounts on the platform.The Epoch Times newspaper is part of the Epoch Media Group. The newspaper has almost 6 million followers on Facebook. Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of security policy, told CNN Business Thursday that Facebook was not suspending the newspaper's account but investigations into Epoch's behavior on Facebook were ongoing.Snopes reported earlier this month that the publisher of the Epoch Times denied that The BL and Epoch were linked.In August, Facebook banned ads from The Epoch Times after an NBC News investigation detailed how the newspaper was secretly running pro-Trump Facebook ads under alternate accounts. The Epoch Times' publisher said in a statement to NBC News, "The Epoch Times advertisements are print-subscription advertisements describing our paper's reporting --- a popular practice of many publishers --- and every one of these ads was approved by Facebook before publishing."A Facebook spokesperson said the company shared its findings with Twitter and Google, which owns YouTube. A Twitter spokesperson confirmed in a statement Friday, "today we identified and suspended approximately 700 accounts originating from Vietnam for violating our rules around platform manipulation --- specifically fake accounts and spam.""Investigations are still ongoing, but our initial findings have not identified links between these accounts and state-sponsored actors," the spokesperson added.Google did not immediately respond to CNN Business' request for comment-- CNN Business' Rachel Metz contributed reporting. TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

"I want to thank Dartmouth and my professors for their support and preparation over these past four years. This is an absolute dream come true, and I am excited to continue learning about the intersection of global affairs and science."Friel says she looks forward to learning more about China and thinking about how the global community can work to pursue innovation and improve healthcare delivery.Danny Li '19At Dartmouth, Danny Li '19 served as class president for four years, founded two student organizations focused on international diplomacy and foreign policy, and served at the helm of six other student organizations including the Dartmouth Law Journal, graduating as a class marshal. As a Rockefeller Leadership Fellow at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Center for Public Policy, he was involved in a range of public policy programs, including as an intern at the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training and writing memoranda on the 2018 National Defense Strategy.Li currently serves as an analyst at The Asia Group, leading the firm's portfolio in identifying and assessing geo-economics and trade trends in Asia, and conducting research for the firm's China practice, assessing political and market developments taking place in mainland China in order to provide insights for U.S. companies."I am excited for Schwarzman because I see it as an opportunity to engage in a deep yearlong discussion about the economic, political, and technological trends and developments that are taking place in China as well as Asia more broadly, and to think deeply about how the United States and China fit into that changing global landscape," Li says.At Tsinghua, Li plans to explore the economics, business, and international studies curriculum and take advantage of the Schwarzman Deep Dive and Practical Training Project opportunities to explore how the Chinese system of government creates policy, with a focus on understanding of cross-cultural governance and tackling real-life policy challenges in mainland China."I hope to emerge from this experience enriched and better equipped to shape and inform Asia policy in Washington, D.C.," Li says.Colleen O'Connor '19Colleen O'Connor '19 describes herself as "a tri-lingual social entrepreneur passionate about creating social change through the private sector." She graduated as salutatorian and a class marshal. As an undergraduate O'Connor studied Chinese, economics, and human-centered design and was a leader of Women in Business and the Dartmouth Entrepreneurial Network, part of the Magnuson Center for Entrepreneurship at Dartmouth.She has spent the past three years promoting entrepreneurship as a vehicle for female empowerment in South America and East Asia, which she started as a Stamps Scholar at Dartmouth. Professionally, O'Connor works in business strategy consulting at EY-Parthenon in Boston, and formerly worked with startups and nonprofits in Japan, China, Mexico, and Peru."My heart is absolutely bursting with gratitudeboth for this amazing opportunity and for the family, friends, and professors who helped get me to this point," O'Connor says. "I am still in a little bit of shock that I get to return to China for a fourth time, but this time surrounded by a cohort of future leaders and supported by some of the preeminent forces in business, politics, and academia."At Tsinghua University, she plans to take classes in international relations and public policy with the aim of becoming a more globally oriented leader. O'Connor says she is interested in exploring the contradictions of a country that has the highest number of self-made female billionaires yet have remnants of culturally enforced gender discrimination and male preference that still affect female entrepreneurs within the economy's informal sectors."As someone passionate about social entrepreneurship, I hope to use this opportunity to fully embrace the culture and better understand why some of these seemingly contradictory practices occur simultaneously in China," she says.Since graduating from Dartmouth, O'Connor has also committed to attending Harvard Business School, where she has deferred enrollment until the fall of 2021, following the Schwarzman Scholars program.Load-Date: December 12, 2019End of Document

At Harvard Law, German President Steinmeier Discusses Digital Technology EthicsTargeted News ServiceNovember 6, 2019 Wednesday 8:10 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1006 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts BodyHarvard Law School issued the following news:* * *- Expert panelists ponder the moral and practical issues related to the rise of technology and artificial intelligence* * *German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier was among the distinguished panelists who gathered at Harvard Law School for a panel and webcast, "Ethics of the Digital Transformation." Presented by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &#38; Society at Harvard University, the event brought together academics, philosophers, and scientists to ponder moral and practical issues related to the rise of technology and artificial intelligence.Introduced by Berkman Klein Center Executive Director Urs Gasser LL.M. '03, Steinmeier began his talk with a question that he said is key to his presidency and to the future of liberal democracy: How do social media and the internet, particularly Twitter and Facebook, change the democratic culture of debate?"Despite the daily waves of outrage that you have to live with, how can we make sure that we keep a general overview?" he asked through a translator. "How can we distinguish what is important from what is unimportant, and does this culture of thinking in simple opposites take away from our ability to see the nuances? Do we continue to be capable of entering into compromises, which I believe to be vital for any democracy ... if we no longer have time to differentiate because it's no longer popular?"Steinmeier was particularly concerned with the place of the individual in an age of technological advance. He saw an ethical dilemma in the practice of social credit scoring, which is now being widely used in China. Companies there are keeping extensive databases that quantify the economic trustworthiness of individuals, rewarding some and blacklisting others. This, he said, caused some debate between him and the Chinese government on a recent visit."We who live under different political circumstances are scared and shocked by the idea of having to submit to total surveillance of all aspects of our lives," he said. "No matter what we did, it might be linked up to a system that assesses our performance in a negative or positive way, and this of course has an effect on the way we develop as human beings. Hopes, wishes and dreams are becoming externalized; they are stored on a software that I no longer have any influence over. Our concept of individual responsibility and personal freedom is being called into question by such an approach."View attached video: https://youtu.be/kur0Ypsj3MkSteinmeier warned that German and American companies are likely to employ the same practice in the future, making it necessary to examine the morality of the digital age. "That brings me to the question of whether we really need a more intensive exchange between the tech community and the political scientists about the philosophy of the individual. I would like to leave Boston today having received the confirmation from all of you that I need not be afraid, that the debate is taking place."Other panelists explored issues related to the individual and the algorithm. HLS Professor Crystal Yang '13 looked at the criminal justice system, where algorithms are now used in pre-trial, bail, sentencing and parole decisions to measure "risk assessment," to predict someone's future criminality. In Los Angeles, historical data on crimes in specific locations is also used to determine the possibility of future crimes. Another new algorithm, called Compass, uses a subject's answers in a survey to determine their likelihood of recidivism. "These raise a huge host of issues and challenges," Yang said; including the possibility that using algorithms to predict future risk "will only entrench or exacerbate the inequality that we see in society at large." On the other hand, she noted, human decision-makers may prove to evince more bias than the algorithms.Matthew Liao, director of the Center of Bioethics at New York University, explored the mixed blessing of AI in health care. He noted recent medical advances using AI, which can detect cancer cells, determine the viability of an embryo, and even detect suicidal thoughts in the brain--and reduce health care costs accordingly. Yet they also open ethical concerns, particularly on the collection of personal data. "One of the things we need to worry about is whether they are collecting the data appropriately." More notably, data can be fallible: Machines can solve complex problems using images, but researchers have found that if a single pixel is changed, that can upset the whole equation--one pixel in a picture of a car will cause the machine to perceive it as a picture of a dog. "Just imagine deploying that kind of machine learning in health care or self-driving cars, where people's lives are at stake."Wolfgang Schulz, a professor of media and public law at the University of Hamburg, suggested that the discussion on humans and technology needs to be reframed. "We often have a distinction: Here is the society and here is the technology. That can be a dangerous thing because it frames technology as a natural disaster that is coming and we have to build walls to protect against it. Technology forces us to ask those hard questions about societal values and to better understand what makes human decision-making so special."Early in the panel, the audience also got a glimpse of the German president's humorous side. He recalled a previous trip to Boston, where he visited Fenway Park accompanied by Condoleezza Rice and agreed to throw a pitch. "I was extremely naive; never before had I held a baseball in my hands. My colleague was aghast when she heard what I was about to do. But this is typical of us Germans: I had accepted and didn't want to go back on my promise. The stadium was filled with people, and I had a certain feeling that they hadn't come because of me. The Red Sox were playing the Yankees and I realized this was not just any match; it was really about religious issues."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6916960 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 6, 2019End of Document

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 97.80.Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for November declined to 70 from 71 in October. Investors will receive Housing Starts and Building Permits for October on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +28.9% YTDS&P 500 +24.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.2% YTDRussell 2000 +18.1% YTD16:21T AT&T: Sony (SNE) subsidiary Sony Pictures Entertainment acquires AT&T's minority stake in Game Show Network (39.63 +0.13)Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) and AT&T announced that SPE has acquired AT&T's minority stake in Game Show Network. SPE now owns 100% of the multimedia entertainment company. Following the transaction, the Game Show Network channel will continue to be carried on DIRECTV.The sale is consistent with AT&T's strategy to monetize non-strategic assets as it de-levers its balance sheet and begins to retire shares. Prior to the transaction, SPE owned a 58% stake in Game Show Network, and AT&T owned the remaining 42%. In connection with the transaction, AT&T received approx. $500 mln, including proceeds for its equity stake valued at $380 mln (before transaction-related adjustments) and dividends of approx. $130 mln. Game Show Network will continue to be managed by Sony Pictures Television (SPT) with Mark Feldman continuing as President and CEO of the multimedia outlet.16:15EFC Ellington Financial commences public offering of 4.2 mln shares of common stock (18.81 +0.01)The company expects to use proceeds to acquire its targeted assets.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 97.80.Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for November declined to 70 from 71 in October.

SPE now owns 100% of the multimedia entertainment company. Following the transaction, the Game Show Network channel will continue to be carried on DIRECTV.The sale is consistent with AT&T's strategy to monetize non-strategic assets as it de-levers its balance sheet and begins to retire shares. Prior to the transaction, SPE owned a 58% stake in Game Show Network, and AT&T owned the remaining 42%. In connection with the transaction, AT&T received approx. $500 mln, including proceeds for its equity stake valued at $380 mln (before transaction-related adjustments) and dividends of approx. $130 mln.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc.

Banks, health care stocks and companies that rely on consumer spending powered much of the rebound, outweighing losses in technology, real estate and other sectors. Oil prices fell. Uncertainty about whether the U.S. and China can soon halt their trade dispute weighed on markets this week.___Stainless steel, broken glass and buzz, Tesla makes a pickupThe much-hyped unveil of Tesla's electric pickup truck went off script Thursday night when supposedly unbreakable window glass shattered twice when hit with a large metal ball. The failed stunt, which ranks high on the list of embarrassing auto industry rollouts, came just after CEO Elon Musk bragged about the strength of "Tesla Armor Glass" on the wedge-shaped "Cybertruck."___Boeing settles half of lawsuits tied to Indonesian crashCHICAGO (AP) - Boeing says it has settled more than 60 lawsuits filed by families of passengers who died in the first crash of a 737 Max jet. That's about half of the lawsuits filed after the October 2018 crash involving a Max off the coast of Indonesia that killed 157. Boeing faces dozens more lawsuits over a second Max crash, which happened in March in Ethiopia.___US regulators bar govt telecom funds for Huawei, ZTEWASHINGTON (AP) - U.S. communications regulators have cut off government funding for equipment from two Chinese companies, citing security threats. They are also proposing to require companies to also rip out existing equipment Huawei and ZTE. The move mostly affects small, rural companies, as larger carriers do not use such equipment. Huawei says the rule is unlawful, as there is no evidence it poses a security risk. It's the latest move by the U.S. government against Chinese tech and telecom companies.___European Central Bank chief asks governments to help growthFRANKFURT, Germany (AP) - The new president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, says better-targeted public spending would help support economic growth in the eurozone. In her first official speech Friday, Lagarde indirectly chided countries like Germany that have kept a tight grip on their budgets while making clear that a spendthrift approach to public spending would be hazardous, too.___In a first, IBM's computer debater faces off against itselfCAMBRIDGE, England (AP) - IBM's artificial intelligence debating robot faced off against itself at Cambridge University, in a demonstration of what the future might hold. Project Debater, a robot that has already debated humans, was for the first time pitted against itself, at least in the first round of arguments at the Cambridge Union, the world's oldest debating society. The topic was whether artificial intelligence would do more harm than good.___US officials: Don't eat romaine grown in Salinas, CaliforniaNEW YORK (AP) - U.S. health officials investigating a food poisoning outbreak are warning people not to eat romaine lettuce grown in Salinas, California. They say not to eat romaine if the label doesn't say where it's grown. The Food and Drug Administration says its investigation of people sickened with E. coli has led them to farms in Salinas and that they're looking for the source of the contamination. The warning follows repeated outbreaks tied to romaine.___Amazon pulls skin-lightening products off site amid pushbackST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - Amazon has pulled more than a dozen skin-lightening products with dangerous mercury levels off its website after pushback from Minnesota public-health and environmental activists. The company's change came after the BeautyWell Project and the Sierra Club's state branch delivered a petition on Wednesday with over 23,000 signatures to Amazon's fulfillment center in Shakopee.___California boosts pot taxes, shocking unsteady industryLOS ANGELES (AP) - California is increasing pot business taxes in the legal market, shocking the state's struggling marijuana companies. Hefty marijuana taxes that can approach 50 percent in some communities have been blamed for sending shoppers into the tax-free illegal market, which is thriving. The California Cannabis Industry Association says its members are "stunned and outraged." The group says the tax increases will be passed on to consumers, pushing more to shoppers underground.___Isolated Iceland newly vulnerable to computer scamsREYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) - The people of Iceland, who speak a dialect of Old Norse, are no longer protected from online fraud because of their linguistic isolation. Modern translation apps have become good at Icelandic. The government, meanwhile, has lifted limits on bank transfers out of the country that were imposed after the financial crisis. The combination has attracted scammers to target a population that had so far not had to worry about online fraud.___The S&P 500 rose 6.75 points, or 0.2%, to 3,110.29. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 109.33 points, or 0.4%, to 27,875.62. The Nasdaq composite added 13.67 points, or 0.2%, to 8,519.88.

XINJIANG AUTHORITIES UNDERMINE MUSLIM ABSTENTION FROM PORK IN BID TO ASSIMILATE UYGHURSStates News ServiceNovember 22, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1491 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Government work groups in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) are undermining the Muslim practice of abstaining from pork as part of a bid to assimilate Uyghurs into Han Chinese culture, according to sources, who also said officials are seeking to turn the region into a major pork producer.In recent years, RFA's Uyghur Service has received reports that Chinese authorities in the XUAR were delivering pork to Muslim households during the Lunar New Year holiday, and forcing some Muslims to drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, and eat pork, despite Islamic laws that designate them as "haram," or forbidden due to their perceived uncleanliness.Similar claims have been made about pork being made part of the diets provided for detainees in the XUAR's vast network of internment camps, where authorities are believed to have held up to 1.5 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities accused of harboring "strong religious views" and "politically incorrect" ideas since April 2017.While there is no hard evidence indicating a centralized government plan to force Muslims in the region to break the dietary laws of their religion, RFA recently interviewed officials, public servants and former camp detainees, who said that a quiet effort is in place to undermine the traditions under the guise of promoting "interethnic unity," while abstaining is branded a sign of "extremism."As part of the "Four Togethers" campaignwhich began last year and also includes "Living Together, Working Together, and Learning Togetherauthorities in the XUAR regularly host communal activities referred to as "Eating Together" events, where pork is included as a so-called "ethnic unity food."In October 2018, a photo was posted online by the government of Kashgar (in Chinese, Kashi) prefecture's Maralbeshi (Bachu) county, which portrayed a Uyghur village head eating a piece of pork and calling on other Uyghurs to join him. The photo was taken down shortly after publishing.RFA recently spoke with a village head in Maralbeshi who confirmed that the photo was real, and that local authorities are teaching people to eat pork as well.RFA also interviewed a government employee who was "sent down" to Kashgar's Makit (Maigaiti) county as part of a practice by China's ruling Communist Party cadres to deploy political and ideological "work groups" in southern XUAR, where concentrations of Uyghur populations are higher than in other parts of the region.The employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that while he has yet to participate in an "Eating Together" event, many of his colleagues had, and that they always serve "Han food."When asked if pork is included, the employee said no, but he added that it is forbidden to characterize the meat as "haram.""Come on," he said, laughing, "I think you know we can't say that."A Uyghur government employee in Kashgar's Peyziwat (Jiashi) county told RFA that his work group set up a restaurant and brought a Han Chinese chef in from Shanxi province to provide food that everyone eats, including many of the local Uyghur farmers.But when asked whether the restaurant distinguishes between "haram" foods and those that are considered "halal," or acceptable by Islamic traditions, the employee said, "you can't make a distinction like thatyou might as well give up on living in that case."Asked if he and others will eat food prepared with pork, the employee said he would, as "it's in the air" and couldn't be avoided, adding that one of the work group's roles is to encourage people to eat all kinds of meat and assimilate into Han Chinese culture."Since coming here, we've been explaining new things and new culture to the farmers," he said."We're teaching them that they need to walk in accordance with new culture, what they need to do to adapt to it."'Just another kind of meat'RFA also spoke with Zumuret Dawut, a Uyghur mother of three who in April last year was detained for months in an internment camp, where she was forced to recite Chinese propaganda, beaten for providing food to an ailing fellow prisoner, and injected with unknown drugs, according to an account she related in September during an event on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.While Dawut was released after her Pakistani husband advocated on her behalf, she was first forced to renounce her faith and promise not to speak about what happened to her there, and later subjected to official monitoring at her home and forced to eat pork, against the dietary restrictions of Islam.Dawut told RFA that each locality has its own "laws" with regard to cultural practices and how they are applied can be totally arbitrary, but said the promotion of pork is "rarely done in the open" by higher officials, while it is overt at the local level."From the outside, it appears as if they aren't saying anything, but that's because the higher-ups have ordered them to use different means to take care of this," she said.But she said she and others were routinely chastised for refusing to eat pork, which cadres from her local neighborhood committee would say is just another kind of meat."They said things like, 'This is meat, and this is too, so why are you being picky over them,'" she said."We couldn't even say, 'Oh, it's just what I'm used to,' because they'd see right through it and criticize us."Dawut said she had never seen any written documentation about the promotion of eating pork, but that local officials aren't concerned about people speaking out against the practice because "none of us stands equal with the government."A village secretary from Hotan (Hetian) prefecture told RFA that including pork in meals is also common as part of the "Pair Up and Become Family" campaign that since late 2017 has required Muslimand particularly Uyghurfamilies in the XUAR to invite officials into their homes and provide them with information about their lives and political views, while hosts are also subjected to political indoctrination.Reports suggest that Uyghurs who protest hosting "relatives" as part of the program, or refuse to take part in study sessions or other activitiesincluding eating meals containing porkwith the officials in their homes, are subject to additional restrictions or could face detention in the camp system.The village secretary said that while preparing meals, such as dumplings, hosts and "relatives" share the responsibility."If they prepare the filling, we'll prepare the doughwe work together like this and spend the whole week making dumplings," he said.But no one complains that the "relatives" might prepare the food in ways that are considered "haram" to the Muslim community."We'd be crazy to say thatthey're people just like we are, so they eat what we make, and we eat what they make," the secretary said."We've spent the last two years being relatives like this," he said, adding that if they were to offer them pork-based foods to eat, "we would."Pig productionThe revelations about the promotion of pork for the purpose of cultural assimilation come after the XUAR government held an executive meeting on Nov. 2 to discuss transitioning the region into one of the most important pig breeding and commodity pig production bases in northwest China, according to a report by the official Xinjiang Daily newspaper.The meeting, led by XUAR Chairman Shohret Zakir, stressed that accelerating the transformation and upgrading of pig production in the region is of great practical significance in promoting the high-quality development of the pig industry, and comprehensively improving the supply capacity of pork, the report said.China, which is home to half of the earth's pigs, has been decimated by an outbreak of African swine fever that has seen prices for pork skyrocket in the past year, leading the government in September to announce additional measures to encourage pig farmers and producers to breed more hogs.Shen Xue, a Chinese-Canadian author and human rights activist, told RFA that shifting agricultural priorities in the XUAR from crop farming to pig breeding is not the right way to address the problem, and would represent a further restriction of the rights of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in the region."In China, the worst persecuted people are Uyghurs and other minority groups in the Uyghur regionthe Chinese authorities are not only destroying their identity and culture, but also carrying out all sorts of inhuman forcible acts in order to change them and humiliate them by attacking their faith and cultural traditions," she said."This cannot be accepted. If the government's plan also includes the Muslim population, this is clearly a violation of their human rights for economic benefits; and it is a great insult against their religion, culture and way of life."Reported by RFA's Uyghur Service.

This week, several users of Outlook for Web and even Windows 10 OS came across Microsoft's attempts at integrating several of the popular Google Services within its own competing products and platforms.The integration works by tethering a Google account to an Outlook account.

Future present? How science fiction sees our world in 2050.; Science fiction writers, gazing into the future, envision space-based cargo movers and robots that may eliminate the need for humans to work.The Christian Science MonitorDecember 31, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights ReservedSection: BooksLength: 3333 wordsByline: Harry Bruinius Staff writerBodyJust over two years ago, when science fiction writer Mary Robinette Kowal took part in a strategic task force looking into a Department of Next at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, it didn't take long for her to realize why she'd been asked to attend.Faced with flat attendance and the pressure to remain relevant in an entertainment-saturated world, the museum was looking to inject a sense of urgency into its mission. The board wanted to reposition the 84-year-old institution as "a futurist and provocateur," as president and CEO David Mosena put it at the time. Exhibits moving forward should include plausible futurescapes and a narrative shape to how human beings might live. "And one of the things that happened during these massive brainstorming sessions was that people would keep saying things like, 'We don't think anyone has really thought through the ramifications of what would happen if you tried to colonize another planet, having to set out in a ship that would involve people living on it for generations before they got there,'" says Ms. Kowal, a four-time winner of the Hugo Award, science fiction's top prize. Some 50 thinkers participated in the museum's task force, including scientists, business leaders, and a few other science fiction writers. "I told them, that's called a 'generation ship,' and I can give you a reading list of people who've imagined that," says Ms. Kowal, whose own short story "For Want of a Nail" did so in 2011. On the cusp of this new year, 2020, the Monitor invited Ms. Kowal and a number of contemporary science fiction writers to take part in our own version of a Department of Next, asking them a simple, open-ended question: What will life be like in 2050?Their visions vary from cargo liners that will float down from space to move your furniture, to smart robots that might make it unnecessary for people to work, to buildings embedded with crops in a new network of global green cities.But before we get into their predictions, it might be worth asking something else: Why query science fiction writers at all? For starters, we thought that 2020 was a year practically begging for careful reflection on the future, it being a marker of two decades into the 21st century and both an election and a census year. Even its digital symmetry conjures something like a call for collective visions of the future and past.And science fiction writers do dabble in notions that sometimes become reality. Jules Verne, Gene Roddenberry, and Philip K. Dick dreamed up technical wonders such as submarines, hand-held communication devices, and touch-screen computers dec­ades before they became reality. They and other sci-fi writers are even credited with inspiring engineers and designers who later constructed these cutting-edge innovations."We are the ones who inspire; we're the ones who throw people into the future before we get there and say, 'Well, look, our world might be better than this,'" says Tade Thompson, author of the critically ­acclaimed "Wormwood" trilogy, a series of novels about the social and political state of the world in 2066, decades after an alien invasion in 2012.Thought experimentsThe Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago wasn't the only institution to invite the perspectives of science fiction writers. The consulting behemoth PwC (PricewaterhouseCoopers) published a 2017 corporate guide on "Using science fiction to explore business innovation," and that same year the Harvard Business Review produced a report on "Why Business Leaders Need to Read More Science Fiction." Since then a host of corporations, civic institutions, think tanks, and government agencies have been hiring science fiction writers to help them create their own visions of the future."A lot of what science fiction does is ... conduct thought experiments about the technology that we are currently grappling with, and extend the logical causal chains into the future to see what the ramifications of that technology will be on our social structure," says Ms. Kowal. "For me, it's less about what technology are we going to see in 2050, and more about what society is going to look like with the technology we have now, if it continues to develop in the way that it's going," she says.  In our conversations, however, nearly every author dismissed the idea of science fiction writers being able to predict new types of technology, à la the Vernes and Roddenberrys of the past."It's not going to be in the realm of technological advances, because we are already living in what was a science fictional world when I was a child," says Mr. Thompson, who sets his "Wormwood" trilogy in Nigeria, decades after the alien invasion decimates much of the West. "So to me, it's no longer about impressing audiences with futuristic designs of machines or spacecraft or whatever."The best, the most important area of exploration for a science fiction writer right now is how society will be built," he continues. "It's the Ursula K. Le Guin type of science fiction in which you think about alternative societies."But there was one thing Mr. Thompson and most all of the science fiction writers emphasized. "Science fiction cannot be 'scientific' if you don't talk about global warming, talk about the effects climate change will have on everything we're doing in 2050," he says. "To be a good science fiction writer in this day and age, you have to include the state of the environment."A 'little, vulnerable' EarthThat was certainly a dominant theme in writer Laura Lam's predictions about the world in 2050. When researching her forthcoming novel "Goldilocks," Ms. Lam asked a number of scientists what Earth might look like from orbit a few decades from now, in a worst-case climate scenario. In an extended written answer to our query, she included a description from "Goldilocks," a story about the first all-female space mission to an exosolar planet, part of a rush to the heavens because the Earth has only 30 years left of human habitation.It didn't look like a marble; it was too clearly alive. The clouds crawled slowly, the planet bisected by the line of day and night. ...The land on the other continents was too brown and golden, the green too sparse. There were swathes of land where humans could no longer survive, and the habitable areas were growing crowded. There was even some gold-green in the oceans from dust storms blowing off the continents and fertilising phytoplankton blooms.Earth was such a little, vulnerable thing in the grand scope of the universe.Yet the worst-case scenario envisioned in her novel, which will be published in 2020, is not the only possibility she sees for life in 2050. In her response to the Monitor, she weighs two different pathways. "Turn right: do everything we know we need to do, fix Earth, still look to space but with less urgency. Turn left: we'll be in space in 2050 because we ran out of time," she writes. "There was no planet in the magic Goldilocks zone. We might be in space stations, looking out the window down at what we did every morning. Well, the ones who can afford the ticket will. That won't be most of us."I wonder which direction we'll go."Why Africa is the futureWriter Tochi Onyebuchi foresees a world in which new power centers begin to emerge on the global stage, as climate change and fast-changing population patterns disrupt those of the past. "One of the things that I envision is a sort of rise of the global south," says the author of "Beasts Made of Night," a fantasy story also set in Nigeria that depicts a group of young "sin-eaters" called the aki, who must conjure and then battle beasts that materialize from the sins they discern in others. "I often say to almost anyone who will listen that, you know, Africa is the future."Mr. Onyebuchi has said that "Beasts Made of Night" is in many ways a metaphor for the effects of criminal justice systems and mass incarceration, a prism through which he explores concepts of guilt and sin, who gets punished for what and why.One of his specific predictions, however, is the growing influence of China throughout the African continent. And as China's economic and military might continues to expand in a region often dismissed or ignored by Western media, the relationships Beijing is cultivating with African governments will have enormous cultural effects on both regions of the world. "You look at, for instance, Brexit, and you look ... at all the current political turmoil in the U.S., and it's very easy to extrapolate a world in which China becomes the reigning superpower with this vast array of political and cultural influence," says Mr. Onyebuchi. "African countries are already sending their students to schools in China. There's the teaching of Mandarin in African schools, even as the interlocking of business interests between Chinese corporations and African governments continues to expand," he says. "That in itself is a reality that can completely decenter the U.S., and that can completely decenter the [United Kingdom], and it's essentially a sort of post-post-colonialism."A sleeping dragon in EnglandPart of the decline of the West will also have to do with the demographic challenges of an aging population, says the fantasy writer Priya Sharma, who is a London-based physician. "So I think in the future, in 2050, obviously this population is going to need people to look after it over the next 20 years, and that's going to affect social movements and global migration patterns," says Ms. Sharma. She is the award-winning author of "Fabulous Beasts" and the 2019 fantasy novel "Ormeshadow," a family drama set in the English countryside where the landscape, according to folklore, covers a buried, sleeping dragon that dreams of resentment, jealousy, estrangement, and death. "Countries like Japan, countries like those in the West with aging populations, are going to have to welcome immigration."In the U.K., we've historically poached highly trained professionals from the former colonies," she continues. "I mean, during the '60s, we had this whole generation of people from India and Africa who came in to be nurses, who came in to be doctors. Taking trained staff out of those countries raised questions about the morality and ethics of it all, but as living standards in the U.K. and in the Western world change, what if we get China and India and Africa poaching professionals from us?"Such migration patterns will also be set in motion by the effects of climate change in 2050. As the geography of coastlines begins to alter, once-powerful cities, which rose to prominence over the centuries because of their access to oceans and global trade routes, will begin to lose their clout, says Ms. Kowal. "California will not be a wine-growing region in 2050," she says. "My husband is a wine-maker, and this is something that the wine industry has been talking about for over a decade."So I have been thinking a lot about how one of the things that's likely to happen is that we're going to see a population shift as people move away from the areas that are hardest hit by climate change," Ms. Kowal says. "The coastlines' new boundaries are going to change the world's economic power centers as people migrate to other locations, and those locations are going to be around whatever is most conducive to power."Technology will play a role in these shifting global power centers. "If Elon Musk actually manages to do the things that he appears to be doing, the world's economic centers may, in fact, become something like orbiting platforms - but this is like serious speculation at this point, beyond 2050," Ms. Kowal says.She notes that spacecraft such as the Crew Dragon being developed by Mr. Musk's SpaceX and the Starliner by Boeing Co. could be perfect vehicles for moving a lot of cargo quickly. "The interesting thing is that, once you can mass-produce these kinds of rockets and containers, the cost per pound of payload when launching a container into a suborbital flight and then coming back down to, say, China could be the same as if we had a train that could run from New York directly to Shanghai, but now orders of magnitude faster. "Then you're looking at a future where the idea of suborbital flights, instead of airplanes or ships or trains, becomes economically viable," Ms. Kowal says. "Whether or not we actually wind up there by 2050, who knows? But it is a future that is plausible."Machine learning speeds up The science fiction writer Liu Cixin, author of "The Three-Body Problem," a richly layered Chinese novel that describes first contact with extraterrestrial life forms, foresees the transforming effect of artificial intelligence. "I don't believe that in 2050 strong artificial intelligence that surpasses human beings will appear, but AI will have developed enough to compete with humans for jobs," Mr. Liu says in a written statement to the Monitor, translated from Chinese by staff writer Ann Scott Tyson."This will have two possible profound implications for society," he says. "One is that the jobless public and AI will be in a long-standing conflict, causing long-term social turmoil and instability. The second is that humans will have smoothed out the relationship with AI and established a leisurely life in which people reduce their working hours or even don't need to work. The latter, however, will require major changes in the current political and economic distribution system of mankind." At first blush, the visions of the future many contemporary science fiction writers present, at least in their books, can seem unsettling and bleak. But for all the dystopian futurescapes and scenarios of impending doom - tropes that often define the genre - most of the authors here described the threat of catastrophe as an ironic metaphor about the resiliency of hope.In his novel "Tropic of Kansas," science fiction writer Christopher Brown describes an American dystopia in the middle of the 21st century, where the country's divisions metastasize into violence and rebellion. He writes about a heartland where "big swaths of the corn belt had turned sick, from bad [gene] splices, failed economics, burnt climate, broken politics, or divine retribution." The book opens with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police arresting and deporting an American immigrating illegally at a border crossing that Canada has fortified with a 30-foot wall buttressed with machine gun towers - its efforts to keep the disruptive violence of its southern neighbor at bay. "But talking about a bleak future, that can also be helpful in getting people to think about how they can avoid it," he says. Mr. Brown, who made climate change a major theme in "Tropic of Kansas," was in many ways the most optimistic about the future in 2050. "I talk a lot about ecology and about the idea of green cities," he says. He envisions urban areas restoring a lot of natural habitat. He cites as an example efforts by New York City to build tree-lined parks out of the dilapidated remnants of its industrial past - such as the High Line in Manhattan, which transformed century-old elevated train tracks into a haven for trees and indigenous plant life."[Such projects] show this yearning people have to bring back the urban green in the heart of the city," says Mr. Brown, a resident of Austin, Texas. "And the prospect of that dialing up by 2050 is very probable - and when you think about the idea of a green landscape, with urban architecture embedded with greenery and vegetable production, as human populations become concentrated in cities, that will become a central component of urban development and planning all over the world."Global competition or cooperation? The same ironic interplay between looming disaster and the resiliency of hope infused other authors' visions as well. In "Rosewater," the first novel in his "Wormwood" trilogy, Mr. Thompson describes an alien invasion that comes not with spaceships and ray guns, but partly with "strands of alien fungi-like filaments and neurotransmitters" that link to human skin. These filaments form a biopsychic network called the "xenosphere," and certain people use it to sense the activities of those around them."At the core of the whole thing, it is me criticizing a colonialist type of past and present, while seeking ideas about how the future could be run," says Mr. Thompson, who depicts the United States as having gone "dark," with no country having heard anything from the former superpower in 43 years. London, as well as the rest of Europe, was devastated by the initial landing of the alien presence, which arrived in a meteorlike rock the size of Hyde Park in 2012. In "The Calculating Stars," the second novel of her "Lady Astronaut" series, Ms. Kowal reimagines the space race in the 1950s, setting its urgency not in the looming presence of the menacing Soviet Union, but in the aftermath of an asteroid strike. Its impact wipes out most of the country's Eastern Seaboard, including Washington, D.C., and will soon make the Earth uninhabitable.Her alternate history is something of a metaphor for the globe's current climate crisis, in which cooperation rather than global competition is critical. "The question for me is, how do we structure our world so that the people that we're trying to protect in that first blush of disaster can survive?" she says. "When we get territorial, it's because of how we are defining an 'us versus them.'"Indeed, it's the social side of the future, the ways the societies of the near future will begin to evolve and reorganize, that's important, many contemporary science fiction writers insist. "We don't use the conventions that were used in early science fiction, those 'astounding tales' of the 1950s and 1960s, you know, the classical science fiction tales that use the language of conquest," Mr. Thompson says. "We now have to think of harmony. Now we have to use words like harmonization, like, how can we work in harmony with the places that we live in, and the people that we live with?"He says he'd like to see the optimistic parts of his work inspire children so that they think, "OK, yeah, this is a pretty good idea for the future. And then one day they will grow up to be in power, and the seed has been planted, so when they're older it has grown up with them."Meet the authorsTade Thompson is the author of "Rosewater," which won the United Kingdom's top science fiction award.

Mike Gallagher:Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-WI), alongside Reps. Joe Courtney (D-CT), Ted Yoho (R-FL), Donald Norcross (D-NJ), Mark Green (R-TN), and Jackie Speier (D-CA), today introduced the American Security Drone Act of 2019. This bill would prohibit the federal government from purchasing drones manufactured in countries identified as national security threats, such as China. Sens. Rick Scott (R-FL), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Josh Hawley (R-MO), and Marco Rubio (R-FL) introduced companion legislation the U.S. Senate. Click here for bill text."Drones manufactured by foreign adversaries should be nowhere near the federal government," said Rep. Gallagher. "Purchasing this equipment from countries like China uses taxpayer dollars to support the Chinese Communist Party's near-monopoly on this critical market, while also posing a serious national security threat. It is imperative that Congress pass this bipartisan bill to protect U.S. interests, our communities, and our national security supply-chain.""I'm proud to join my colleague Rep. Gallagher in introducing this important legislation, which would reduce our Defense and Homeland Security Departments' reliance on foreign-manufactured drone technology. It's clear that the continued use of this technology by the federal government poses a security risk, as evidenced by the Department of Interior's announcement on October 30 that it was grounding all non-emergency use of drones it purchased from DJI, a Chinese drone manufacturer, until a security review is completed. While the needs of these departments with regard to unmanned surveillance capabilities are clear, we cannot subvert our national security imperatives for the sake of expediency, particularly when American manufacturers have the ability to fill this need," said Rep. Courtney."Drones are an integral part of US military strategy and maintaining US superiority in the drone market is critical. However, China is actively stealing our drone technology and intellectual property in order to undercut the US drone market. Which is why I am proud to support the American Drone Security Act, which bans the federal acquisition of drones from China or other US adversaries. Our taxpayer dollars should not be used to purchase vital military equipment that can be compromised by our adversaries," said Rep. Yoho."We live in an uncertain world where there are serious threats to our country, our data security and our democracy. We must ensure our military, homeland security officials and other government agencies have the tools needed to defend our nation," said Congressman Donald Norcross. "This bill ensures that our government is protected against Chinese-developed technologies that pose a risk to data security, undercut American intellectual property and put our national security at risk."The American Security Drone Act:Prohibits federal departments and agencies from procuring any foreign commercial off-the-shelf drone or covered unmanned aircraft system manufactured or assembled in countries identified as national security threats, and provides a timeline to end current use of these drones.Prohibits the use of federal funds awarded through contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements to state or local governments from being used to purchase foreign commercial off-the-shelf drones or covered unmanned aircraft systems manufactured or assembled in a country identified as a national security threat.Requires the Comptroller General of the United States to submit a report to Congress detailing the amount of foreign commercial off-the-shelf drones and covered unmanned aircraft systems procured by federal departments and agencies from countries identified as national security threats.Load-Date: November 15, 2019End of Document

Huawei wins deal with Telefonica to expand 5G in GermanyCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 11, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 252 wordsBody       The Chinese technology giant has won an agreement to support German Telefonica, along with Finnish Nokia, in building a 5G network in Germany.                                 China's Huawei Technologies won a competition to collaborate with Telefonica's German unit, alongside Nokia, for the construction and expansion of a fifth-generation internet network.The announcement, made by Telefonica and released by Bloomberg, was good news for Huawei, especially after Deutsche Telekom decided to stop ordering equipment from Chinese suppliers.The German Government is currently designing a security plan for the expansion of the 5G network to certify some stations and antennas. Despite the constant accusations that Huawei is taking advantage of its knowledge of the matter for espionage purposes, the Chinese company has been fighting such incriminations.Huawei and Nokia will now split work into equal parts and will be responsible for providing the latest generation of the internet to Telefonica, who said both allies have already proven to be "strategic partners."Cooperation with both companies "will be subject to several stages of technology certification," Telefonica said, adding that the company "is taking into account political developments on the security plan without delaying the start of 5G expansion."The company's shares fell 3.8% on the Frankfurt stock exchange after the company said it could cut its dividend for the 2019 transaction to 17 cents per share from earlier 27 cents.       Load-Date: January 27, 2020End of Document

Wall Street closes at all-time highs out of business optimismCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 25, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 429 wordsBodyThe top three Wall Street indices closed in record levels for signals pointing to progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations, in a session in which optimism was also supported by a series of mergers and acquisitions.A Chinese newspaper reported that governments in the world's two largest economies are "very close" to sealing a preliminary trade pact, which spurred the actions of the information-sensitive semiconductor industry on trade. Read: Why does Huawei have so many problems with the United States?That increased optimism following the weekend comments from a top US official that a treaty was still possible by the end of the year, allaying fears that negotiations could be extended until 2020.Expectations for a trade deal and robust corporate gains for the third quarter have helped the top three Wall Street indices record all-time highs this month.On Monday, the Dow Jones rose 0.68%, to 28,065.39 units, the S&P; 500 won 0.75%, to 3,133.58 points and the Nasdaq climbed 1.32%, to 8,632.49 units.Analysts from different financial groups said the market is optimistic, for now, that China and the United States will reach a trade agreement.Among the companies, the most prominent of the session were Apple, whose shares rose 1.75% and was the biggest driver of the S&P; and Nasdaq. Tiffany shares climbed 6.2% and were the biggest winners of the S&P; 500 after agreeing to sell to LVMH, the firm that owns Louis Vuitton, at $16.2 billion.The main index of the Mexican Stock Exchange (BMV) closed virtually unchanged, detached from the positive trend among its Wall Street peers.The CPI index, made up of the stocks of the 35 most liquid firms on the market, rose 0.03% to 43,535.11 points. We recommend: ETFs, the most growing instruments on the stock exchange in the last 10 yearsThe weight depreciated amid an environment of caution among investors and after weak data on the country's economic growth were released, as well as doubts about the future of the China-U.S. trade relationship.The currency closed at 19.4420, a depreciation of 0.3%b compared to its closure on Friday, according to Banxico data.Mexico's economy entered a slight recession during the first half of 2019 and showed zero growth in the third quarter of the year, according to Inegi data."Strategists are more optimistic in the short term overweight, but in 12 months they remain negative mainly for the actions that qualifiers could exercise on the state oil company Pemex, in addition to the challenges in fiscal issues," they said Analysts from Citibanamex.With information from Reuters.Load-Date: February 24, 2020End of Document

Libations' new products, and the category-exclusive agreement gives it access to brand creation, brand building and consulting/insights services. Molson Coors will also have the option to purchase brands created by L.A. Libations. "Developing a strong portfolio outside the traditional beer category is an important part of our long-term strategy, and this partnership with L.A. Libations enables us to pursue opportunities in this space without needing an extensive nonalcohol infrastructure," said Molson Coors' president for emerging growth Pete Marino in a statement. Molson Coors shares fell 1.2%.Health CareHealth Care SPDR (XLV) fell 0.2% and other funds iShares Dow Jones US Healthcare (IYH) and Vanguard Health Care ETF (VHT) were in the red.
