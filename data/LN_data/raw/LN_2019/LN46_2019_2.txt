GRASSLEY OP-ED: FOREIGN THIEVES THREATEN AMERICA'S PROSPERITYStates News ServiceApril 15, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 819 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Iowa Senator Charles Grassley:By U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley of IowaAmerican innovation is second to none. Our creativity and forward-facing approach to everything from health care to telecom to artificial intelligence has made and kept us a world leader. It didn't happen by accident. It's been achieved through American ingenuity and, in part, taxpayer-funded research happening every day in universities, labs, and hospitals around the country.But serious and ongoing threats to our taxpayer-funded research puts America at risk of falling behind countries who want to steal our place at the top. Our government and institutions must take all reasonable and necessary steps to protect the integrity of our research and ensure that the intellectual property created here does not fall victim to criminals or foreign agents. There are several ways we can do this, all of which require cooperation and vigilance from Congress and our federal agencies.American intellectual property theft is rampant. In 2018, the Department of Justice (DOJ) investigated, charged or convicted at least 16 individuals and four corporate entities in eight separate cases involving theft of trade secrets. Over the past several years, six more individuals were either investigated, charged or convicted of stealing research from American universities.One case involved a Chinese intelligence officer who was a deputy division director from China's main spy agency. Another involved a number of other Chinese intelligence officers and hackers who were charged in a multi-year plan to steal sensitive commercial aviation data. In 2013, foreign researchers were charged with conspiring to steal research funded by a multi-million dollar grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) on behalf of a Chinese government entity and direct competitor of the American university where the research was conducted.These are just some of the cases we know about.The theft of American intellectual property by foreign agents will not stop any time soon. Federal agencies must take aggressive action to detect and deter these threats. One step federal agencies and research institutions should take is to conduct more thorough vetting of researchers working on taxpayer-funded projects. Another step is for NIH to take a more aggressive approach to ensuring that researchers disclose foreign financial contributions. According to the Department of Health and Human Services Inspector General, it recently received twelve referrals from NIH with most primarily involving the failure of researchers to disclose foreign affiliations. That is a positive development, but more must be done.Our academic institutions have been subjected to China's propaganda outlets through its Confucius Institutes, many of which are housed in American universities, and are directly funded by the Chinese government. China views the Confucius Institutes as a form of soft power and propaganda meant to influence a pro-China view of the world. These propaganda efforts, coupled with the effort to infiltrate our research institutions, is cause for serious concern.For its part, Congress must conduct diligent oversight to ensure government agencies are working to identify foreign threats to research before and after grant money is awarded and reporting when researchers fail to disclose foreign financial contributions to their research.Congress must also address the avenues through which bad actors infiltrate our industries and technology. We have to modernize our immigration laws to prevent the entry of hostile foreign actors who intend to steal intellectual property and trade secrets. Coveted high-skill positions at our research institutions and universities ought to be filled by people who want to contribute to American scientific and technological advancements, not by agents of foreign governments who seek to destroy us from within.When I was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I sent multiple letters and held hearings on foreign threats to American intellectual property. I'm continuing these oversight efforts as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and encourage my colleagues to do the same. It's critical that Congress understands the processes and steps that federal agencies are taking to ensure the integrity of their departments and the resulting studies produced by taxpayer-funded research.The only way for the United States to remain a world leader and economic force is to protect the innovations that keep us moving forward. We cannot be complacent. We cannot let our guard down. Countries like China want to take our place on the world stage and they will stop at nothing to achieve that goal. It's critical that we take every precaution to protect our taxpayer-funded research and continue to root out the waste, fraud and abuse that allows intellectual property theft to flourish.Load-Date: April 15, 2019End of Document

AP Explains: US sanctions on Huawei bite, but who gets hurt?Associated Press State & LocalMay 21, 2019 Tuesday 3:42 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: STATE AND REGIONALLength: 1062 wordsByline: By FRANK BAJAK and MICHAEL LIEDTKE, Associated PressBodyTrump administration sanctions against Huawei have begun to bite even though their dimensions remain unclear. U.S. companies that supply the Chinese tech powerhouse with computer chips saw their stock prices slump Monday, and Huawei faces decimated smartphone sales with the anticipated loss of Google's popular software and services.The U.S. move escalates trade-war tensions with Beijing, but also risks making China more self-sufficient over time.Here's a look at what's behind the dispute and what it means.___WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?Last week, the U.S. Commerce Department placed Huawei its so-called Entity List , effectively barring U.S. firms from selling it technology without government approval.Google said it would continue to support existing Huawei smartphones but future devices will not have its flagship apps and services, including maps, Gmail and search. Only basic services would be available, making Huawei phones less desirable. Separately, Huawei is the world's leading provider of networking equipment, but it relies on U.S. components including computer chips. About a third of Huawei's suppliers are American.___WHY PUNISH HUAWEI?The U.S. defense and intelligence communities have long accused Huawei of being an untrustworthy agent of Beijing's repressive rulers - though without providing evidence. The U.S. government's sanctions are widely seen as a means of pressuring reluctant allies in Europe to exclude Huawei equipment from their next-generation wireless networks. Washington says it's a question of national security and punishment of Huawei for skirting sanctions against Iran, but the backdrop is a struggle for economic and technological dominance.The politics of President Donald Trump's escalating tit-for-tat trade war have co-opted a longstanding policy goal of stemming state-backed Chinese cyber theft of trade and military secrets. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said last week that the sanctions on Huawei have nothing to do with the trade war and could be revoked if Huawei's behavior were to change.___THE SANCTIONS' BITEAnalysts predict consumers will abandon Huawei for other smartphone makers if Huawei can only use a stripped-down version of Android. Huawei, now the No. 2 smartphone supplier, could fall behind Apple to third place. Google could seek exemptions, but would not comment on whether it planned to do so.___WHO USES HUAWEI ANYWAY?While most consumers in the U.S. don't even know how to pronounce Huawei (it's "HWA-way"), its brand is well known in most of the rest of the world, where people have been buying its smartphones in droves.Huawei stealthily became an industry star by plowing into new markets, developing a lineup of phones that offer affordable options for low-income households and luxury models that are siphoning upper-crust sales from Apple and Samsung in China and Europe. About 13 percent of its phones are now sold in Europe, estimates Gartner analyst Annette Zimmermann.That formula helped Huawei establish itself as the world's second-largest seller of smartphones during the first three months of this year, according to the research firm IDC. Huawei shipped 59 million smartphones in the January-March period, nearly 23 million more than Apple.___RIPPLE EFFECTSThe U.S. sanctions could have unwelcome ripple effects in the U.S., given how much technology Huawei buys from U.S. companies, especially from makers of the microprocessors that go into smartphones, computers, internet networking gear and other gadgetry.The list of chip companies expected to be hit hardest includes Micron Technologies, Qualcomm, Qorvo and Skyworks Solutions, which all have listed Huawei as a major customer in their annual reports. Others likely to suffer are Xilinx, Broadcom and Texas Instruments, according to industry analysts.Being cut off from Huawei will also compound the pain the chip sector is already experiencing from the Trump administration's rising China tariffs.The Commerce Department on Monday announced an expected grace period of 90 days or more, easing the immediate hit on U.S. suppliers. It can extend that stay, and also has the option of issuing exemptions for especially hard-hit companies.Much could depend on whether countries including France, Germany, the U.K. and the Netherlands continue to refuse to completely exclude Huawei equipment from their wireless networks.The grace period allows U.S. providers to alert Huawei to security vulnerabilities and engage the Chinese company in research on standards for next-generation 5G wireless networks.It also gives operators of U.S. rural broadband networks that use Huawei routers time to switch them out.___COULD THIS BACKFIRE?Huawei is already the biggest global supplier of networking equipment, and is now likely to move toward making all components domestically. China already has a policy seeking technological independence by 2025.U.S. tech companies, facing a drop in sales, could respond with layoffs. More than 52,000 technology jobs in the U.S. are directly tied to China exports, according to the Computing Technology Industry Association, a trade group also known as CompTIA.___WHAT ABOUT HARM TO GOOGLE?Google may lose some licensing fees and opportunities to show ads on Huawei phones, but it still will probably be a financial hiccup for Google and its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., which is expected to generate $160 billion in revenue this year.___THE APPLE EFFECTIn theory, Huawei's losses could translate into gains for both Samsung and Apple at a time both of those companies are trying to reverse a sharp decline in smartphone sales.But Apple also stands to be hurt if China decides to target it in retaliation. Apple is particularly vulnerable because most iPhones are assembled in China. The Chinese government, for example could block crucial shipments to the factories assembling iPhones or take other measures that disrupt the supply chain.Any retaliatory move from China could come on top of a looming increase on tariffs by the U.S. that would hit the iPhone, forcing Apple to raise prices or reduce profits.What's more, the escalating trade war may trigger a backlash among Chinese consumers against U.S. products, including the iPhone. "Beijing could stoke nationalist sentiment over the treatment of Huawei, which could result in protests against major U.S. technology brands," CompTIA warned.Load-Date: May 21, 2019End of Document

Huawei shipped 59 million smartphones in the January-March period, nearly 23 million more than Apple.___RIPPLE EFFECTSThe U.S. sanctions could have unwelcome ripple effects in the U.S., given how much technology Huawei buys from U.S. companies, especially from makers of the microprocessors that go into smartphones, computers, internet networking gear and other gadgetry.The list of chip companies expected to be hit hardest includes Micron Technologies, Qualcomm, Qorvo and Skyworks Solutions, which all have listed Huawei as a major customer in their annual reports. Others likely to suffer are Xilinx, Broadcom and Texas Instruments, according to industry analysts.Being cut off from Huawei will also compound the pain the chip sector is already experiencing from the Trump administration's rising China tariffs.The Commerce Department on Monday announced an expected grace period of 90 days or more, easing the immediate hit on U.S. suppliers. It can extend that stay, and also has the option of issuing exemptions for especially hard-hit companies.Much could depend on whether countries including France, Germany, the U.K. and the Netherlands continue to refuse to completely exclude Huawei equipment from their wireless networks.The grace period allows U.S. providers to alert Huawei to security vulnerabilities and engage the Chinese company in research on standards for next-generation 5G wireless networks.It also gives operators of U.S. rural broadband networks that use Huawei routers time to switch them out.___COULD THIS BACKFIRE?Huawei is already the biggest global supplier of networking equipment, and is now likely to move toward making all components domestically. China already has a policy seeking technological independence by 2025.U.S. tech companies, facing a drop in sales, could respond with layoffs. More than 52,000 technology jobs in the U.S. are directly tied to China exports, according to the Computing Technology Industry Association, a trade group also known as CompTIA.___WHAT ABOUT HARM TO GOOGLE?Google may lose some licensing fees and opportunities to show ads on Huawei phones, but it still will probably be a financial hiccup for Google and its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., which is expected to generate $160 billion in revenue this year.___THE APPLE EFFECTIn theory, Huawei's losses could translate into gains for both Samsung and Apple at a time both of those companies are trying to reverse a sharp decline in smartphone sales.But Apple also stands to be hurt if China decides to target it in retaliation. Apple is particularly vulnerable because most iPhones are assembled in China. The Chinese government, for example could block crucial shipments to the factories assembling iPhones or take other measures that disrupt the supply chain.Any retaliatory move from China could come on top of a looming increase on tariffs by the U.S. that would hit the iPhone, forcing Apple to raise prices or reduce profits.What's more, the escalating trade war may trigger a backlash among Chinese consumers against U.S. products, including the iPhone. "Beijing could stoke nationalist sentiment over the treatment of Huawei, which could result in protests against major U.S. technology brands," CompTIA warned.Load-Date: May 21, 2019End of Document

U.S. companies that supply the Chinese tech powerhouse with computer chips saw their stock prices slump Monday, and Huawei faces decimated smartphone sales with the anticipated loss of Google's popular software and services.The U.S. move escalates trade-war tensions with Beijing, but also risks making China more self-sufficient over time.Here's a look at what's behind the dispute and what it means.___WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?Last week, the U.S. Commerce Department placed Huawei its so-called Entity List , effectively barring U.S. firms from selling it technology without government approval.Google said it would continue to support existing Huawei smartphones but future devices will not have its flagship apps and services, including maps, Gmail and search. Only basic services would be available, making Huawei phones less desirable. Separately, Huawei is the world's leading provider of networking equipment, but it relies on U.S. components including computer chips. About a third of Huawei's suppliers are American.___WHY PUNISH HUAWEI?The U.S. defense and intelligence communities have long accused Huawei of being an untrustworthy agent of Beijing's repressive rulers - though without providing evidence. The U.S. government's sanctions are widely seen as a means of pressuring reluctant allies in Europe to exclude Huawei equipment from their next-generation wireless networks. Washington says it's a question of national security and punishment of Huawei for skirting sanctions against Iran, but the backdrop is a struggle for economic and technological dominance.The politics of President Donald Trump's escalating tit-for-tat trade war have co-opted a longstanding policy goal of stemming state-backed Chinese cyber theft of trade and military secrets. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said last week that the sanctions on Huawei have nothing to do with the trade war and could be revoked if Huawei's behavior were to change.___THE SANCTIONS' BITEAnalysts predict consumers will abandon Huawei for other smartphone makers if Huawei can only use a stripped-down version of Android. Huawei, now the No. 2 smartphone supplier, could fall behind Apple to third place.

Tesla Puts Out Fire in China as Production Plant Gets Under WayRealMoneyApril 22, 2019 Monday 10:26 AM EDTCopyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 790 wordsByline: Alex Frew McMillanHighlight: China is the second-largest market globally for Tesla.BodyFootage has emerged purportedly of a first-generation Tesla  Model S smoking, then exploding in an underground car park in Shanghai. The electric carmaker has dispatched a team to China to investigate the incident, and it can't do it quickly enough.China is the second-largest market globally for Tesla. In the absence of a free press, social media has an even greater currency in China than elsewhere in the world, so the repeat viewing  is doing potentially permanent damage to the carmaker's reputation.Besides free press, Chinese people also do not benefit from free markets. As a result, they often have a dim view of how they work, particularly when they "lose" money.Price cuts announced by Tesla in late February would seem ostensibly to be good news. Hey, cheaper Tesla! In China, though, they were greeted by demonstrations from peeved previous buyers, who claim to have "lost money" on their vehicle.One social-media user joked that "buying a Tesla is more thrilling than buying stocks." Car owners in Changsha, in central China, put up a banner outside the local Tesla store claiming "Tesla cut prices on its own will, hurting the legal interests of consumers." These are probably the same people who rush into the Chinese stock market when it rallies, then complain that the Chinese government should bail it out when it all goes wrong.You certainly shouldn't believe everything you see, read, touch, eat or smell in China. My Chinese wife smells a rat - she says the fire could have been staged by a competitor. (I doubt it, but nod along). The online clip will most certainly be circulated eagerly by Tesla haters keen to bring the company down a notch.NIO  went public last September, and other startups such as Byton and Xpeng are keen to muscle in on Tesla's turf. So whatever the cause, the Tesla "fire" comes at a particularly bad time, and shares in Tesla were lower in morning trading.Tesla in March unveiled its Model Y small SUV to the Chinese market to mixed reviews. And Tesla began building its "Gigafactory Shanghai" in January, a joyous start to what should be a capitalist/socialist marriage made in heaven.Its first international factory should produce cars at half the cost - in terms of capital spend per unit of capacity - of its facility in Fremont, CA. It expects to have general assembly, stamping, body joining and paint shop operations up and running by the end of the year.The China factory is targeting a weekly production rate of 3,000 Model 3 vehicles per week, on top of the 7,000-vehicle pace now established in Fremont. The company therefore targets to hit a total annualized production rate of 500,000 Model 3s at some point between the end of this year and the middle of next, once the Shanghai plant is up and running.That's a substantial ramp-up, after it delivered 63,359 Model S vehicles to North American customers in Q4 2018, an annualized pace of half its final target. The company will be doing well, it says, to deliver 400,000 of all models of its vehicles in 2019.It's about to start delivering the Model 3 in China, as well as Europe, meaning North Americans get around 10,000 fewer of the vehicles per quarter for the time being. The increased production, and lower production cost in China, should allow the company to hit a gross margin of 25% on the vehicle at some point this year, it says.It should also start producing the Model Y by the end of next year, most likely in Nevada. That will share 75% of its components with the Model 3, and is based on that platform, so presumably it will also soon be made in Shanghai.The Shanghai factory will at first make a "truly affordable" version of the Model 3. Most of that compact sedan's competitors are locally made within China, so it's an essential step toward capturing the China market. Tesla will still be shipping higher-spec models from the U.S.Tesla's car would be far from the first to set fire in China. There were at least 40 fire-related incidents involving new-energy vehicles in 2018, according to the State Administration for Market Regulation.But electric vehicle sales continue to skyrocket while the combustion-engine market slumps. Electric passenger vehicles sold 788,000 units in China last year, up 68.4% over 2017, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers says. Total sales of passenger vehicles fell 4.1%, to 23.7 million vehicles, a lower tally than expected.The electric market is big enough in China for all the existing competitors. Tesla, with its foreign brand, has a leg up in reputation over Chinese manufacturers, which will look first and foremost to compete on price.Let's hope that reputation remains intact once Tesla's team finishes going over the footage of that wreckage in Shanghai.Load-Date: April 23, 2019End of Document

ICYMI: RUBIO RAISES CONCERNS OVER CHINA'S INFILTRATION OF U.S. CAPITAL MARKETSStates News ServiceJune 13, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 443 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Florida Senator Marco Rubio:China's infiltration of U.S. capital markets is a national security concernBy Josh RoginPart of the United States' awakening to the complex challenges posed by a rising China is the realization that America's economic vulnerabilities are also national security vulnerabilities. And it's not just about trade.U.S. capital markets are drastically increasing their holdings of Chinese companies, giving Beijing massive leverage inside the United States and posing huge risks to U.S. investors and the U.S. economy. This practice transfers billions of dollars out of the United States and into China, while also placing U.S. investors in the position of gambling their economic futures on Chinese companies that are beyond the reach of U.S. government oversight and accountability.For example, the world's largest index provider, MSCI, has been steadily increasing its holdings of Chinese assets this year, reportedly "after it came under heavy pressure by the Chinese government." MSCI will quadruple its mainland Chinese holdings this year, which will send about $80 billion of U.S. cash into the struggling Chinese economy right away...."We can no longer allow China's authoritarian government to reap the rewards of American and international capital markets while Chinese companies avoid financial disclosure and basic transparency, and place U.S. investors and pensioners at risk," Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) told me. "Firms like MSCI have an obligation to make sure investors know whether their investment dollars are unwittingly aiding Chinese state-owned and state-directed companies."Rubio sent a letter Wednesday to MSCI demanding that the index provider give Congress information on its decision to invest in several Chinese firms and increase the weighting of Chinese company shares in its indexes. For example, Rubio wants information on Hikvision, a Chinese video surveillance company that could soon be sanctioned for its role in surveillance and detention of more than 1 million Uighur Muslims inside China.If millions of Americans have invested in Hikvision, their financial interest would be set against the U.S. government's drive to hold Chinese companies accountable for human rights violations. More broadly, Wall Street is making Americans fund China's internal repression and Beijing's economic strategy against the United States."In reality, what MSCI is doing is allowing the Chinese Communist Party controlled market, and its state-owned national champion companies, to access a critical source of capital and clothe itself in a fa ade of legitimacy," the letter states.Load-Date: June 14, 2019End of Document

FCC Commissioner O'Rielly Issues Statement on China Mobile InternationalTargeted News ServiceMay 9, 2019 Thursday 9:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1277 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Federal Communications Commission issued the following statement by Commissioner Michael O'Rielly:Re: China Mobile International (USA) Inc., Application for Global Facilities-Based and Global Resale International Telecommunications Authority Pursuant to Section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as Amended, ITC-214-20110901-00289"Those who follow FCC proceedings may notice that I often start or finish meeting item statements by saying that I am pleased to support or approve this or that order, NPRM, or public notice under consideration. While I will vote in favor of today's item, I do not derive any joy from doing so due to the weighty nature of this issue. As a fierce supporter of promoting competition, permitting foreign ownership, and facilitating open markets, I nonetheless find the situation confronting us to be extremely serious, and the action we take today to block China Mobile from accessing the U.S. telecommunications market to be a necessary step, drastic though it may be. Being a fervent free trader, I strongly believe that participating in open markets comes with corresponding obligations to comport within established norms. That principle applies to all countries and providers, irrespective of their domestic form of government."As I read it, our action today is consistent with a speech I gave two weeks ago discussing the many fundamental concerns I have about Chinese government attempts to monopolize 5G development and deployment. One basic reality should go undisputed: there is nearly zero daylight between the communist government of China and its "companies." They use unfair advantages in an effort to take a dominant position in 5G and expand the reach of their networks and equipment. By providing improper government subsidies, throwing cheap labor at service projects, and stealing intellectual property, among other unsavory and illegal tactics, China effectively offers competitive products and services below cost, allowing wireless providers and manufacturers to gain market share not only in China but internationally. Further, the pervasive presence of Chinese equipment and providers in a nation's communications marketplace places these countries' national security at risk.Today's order sets forth a convincing case for why permitting China Mobile to provide telecommunications services between the U.S and foreign locations is not in the public interest. The item details why China Mobile is "vulnerable to exploitation, influence, and control" by the Chinese government, which could seriously jeopardize U.S. national security and law enforcement interests. Providing China Mobile with greater access to U.S. telephone lines, fiber-optic cable, and wireless networks will give China - with its track record of computer intrusions, economic espionage and other ongoing intelligence activities - access to information carried over these networks and the ability to disrupt communications. In fact, Chinese law requires organizations "to support, assist in, and cooperate in China's national intelligence work," "wherever they operate.""As part of our general process, the Commission sought input from the national security, law enforcement, and foreign and trade policy experts that comprise what is known as "Team Telecom." Team Telecom found substantial national security and law enforcement risks that could not be mitigated and requested that the Commission deny the application. While the Commission performs its own review, I acknowledge the expertise of these Executive Branch agencies when it comes to national security issues, recognize the value of their review, and agree with their conclusion. I appreciate the collective insight they provided into this important matter."At the same time, there is little dispute that Team Telecom must improve the transparency and timeliness of their decisions. By way of background, this particular application was filed on September 1, 2011, and NTIA didn't file the recommendation to deny it, on behalf of Team Telecom, until July 2018. I understand that these issues are complex, but all applicants deserve timely responses, and this decision, while inevitable, was far from timely. Luckily, those on the inside of Team Telecom are finally recognizing some of the deficiencies in this process. Recently, a leading figure within the Department of Justice's National Security Division, which is a key member of Team Telecom, stated publicly that "we must reform the ad hoc process by which the Executive Branch advises on FCC licenses" in order to "explore ways to make this process more efficient and expedient, so that the Executive Branch never again takes nearly seven years to make a recommendation." Of note, I have been calling for Team Telecom reform since 2015 and worked closely with former Chairman Wheeler on a proceeding to adopt deadlines and enhance transparency, only to have him inexplicably pull the plug a day or two after the 2016 election. I strongly believe in codifying the structure of Team Telecom and streamlining its procedures, and this can be done without jeopardizing our national security or undermining our ability to protect U.S. interests. I look forward to further action on this matter, whether internally at the FCC or by the Administration itself."Finally, certain perpetual critics have taken today's item as an opportunity to suggest that, while it is nice for the Commission to take this step to ensure our national security, it has not done enough to impose strict network security regulations on the provision of 5G wireless services. Some may even go further and demand that today's order affirmatively mandate new burdens to address general issues regarding 5G security. That is an intentional attempt to conflate issues and mangle the situation. Today's order considers the national security implications raised by China Mobile's international 214 application. This is not a rulemaking of general applicability, but a fact-specific adjudication raised by one individual entity's request. In other words, a particular application may have significant implications for national security, but it does not form the basis for taking far-reaching action. A consideration of national security implications is certainly within the Commission's authority when considering licensees with significant foreign investment, and it is consistent with the FCC's section 214 review process, but the question of how to secure the nation's communications networks is a broader matter, distinct from the issues we consider today."Separately, I would note that American wireless providers have been working hard to ensure robust security as part of their 5G offerings, including through the standards process. These entities appreciate that security is critical to consumers' and end users' comfort and willingness to use their underlying networks. Thanks to competition, providers have the incentive to provide the most secure network possible."Moreover, Congress has time and again decided that network security issues are to be led and handled by other federal agencies, particularly the Department of Homeland Security. Shoehorning network security into the Commission's jurisdiction amounts to a misreading of the statute and ignores congressional intent. If, in the future, Congress decides that the Commission should have this authority, I will be more than happy to take up this issue."In the end, the action we take today is justified. If circumstances change substantially, I am sure the Commission will have the opportunity to revisit the matter, as appropriate."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6724290 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: May 10, 2019End of Document

Welcome back, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, May 7th. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. U.S.-China trade turmoil, economists are saying that if the tariffs go up to 25 percent that could cut GDP by two-tenths of a percent. President Trump advisers are accusing China if reneging on commitments.U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer expected to issue a Federal registry to raise the tariffs on China by 12:01 Friday morning. This is China's top trade negotiation is headed to Washington. The top negotiator is going to be there on May 9th and 10th. That's Thursday and Friday of this week. Futures are worsening this morning indicating a decline at the start of trading of 191 points.The S&P futures are down 23 and the NASDAQ futures down 76. This after a big comeback yesterday after we got the official word that China's top negotiator would be back and continues those meetings that were in place. This Thursday markets come all the way back. Dow industrials finished down 66 points even though it had been down better than 400 points at the session lows.The S&P was down 13 and the NASDAQ was down 40 points at 4:00 yesterday. European indices are lower across the board. FT-100 in London down 77, CAC Quarante in Paris down 43 and the DAX Index in Germany down 85. We did have some weaker-than-expected factory orders out of Germany. They were on the light side and we did have a shortfall in reserves, charring out reserves as well.We're waiting on the job openings report at 10:00 a.m. Eastern today. The jolts. Take a look at Asian markets meanwhile. Japan open after a 10-day holiday, finishing down 1-1/2 percent. Shanghai Composite bouncing after that sharp 5-1/2 percent sell-off yesterday. The Shanghai Composite was up a fraction. We are watching the U.S.-China trade talks. Of course, that will impact these markets substantially.The Mueller report continues to fall out there. Democrats are calling for Attorney General Bill Barr to testify or be held in contempt. Google's latest tech. A preview of what the company is set to unveil today including new privacy tools. We've got that here. And then a bobcat in the tangle. Check this out. What Colorado officials are doing to try and keep this from happening again.They're telling people make sure to put the nets down after you use it. All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, global economist editor with the Wall Street Journal, Jon Hilsenrath, and the Washington Examiner columnist and Republican pollster, Kristen Soltis Anderson. Great to see you this morning.KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, REPUBLICAN POLLSTER: Great to see you.BARTIROMO: Thank so much for being here.JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Going to be interesting to see how markets respond on day two of this tariff dustup with China. You know, it was pretty tame response yesterday. It gives President Trump a lot of negotiating room.BARTIROMO: I was looking at some research from Nancy Lazar from Cornerstone Macro. She's telling clients today that should these tariffs go up to 25 percent on the 200 billion from 10. It's going to cut GDP by two-tenths of a percent in the U.S. It's going to cut GDP by two-tenths -- by two-tenths of a percent in China as well but should the rest of the Chinese imports get taxed? The other $325 billion, she thinks that's going to cut GDP by four-tenths of a percent and cut Chinese GDP by six-tenths of a percent.HILSENRATH: You know, there's a short term effect and a long-term effect. We have the head of Chuck Bicycles here earlier who suggested that they might be producing more in places like Germany and the U.S. than China if these tariffs go into effect. That's a long-term effect that I think really worries the Chinese if they become a less appealing place for global manufactures to put their operations or to cranked up production, it's a real problem for them.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: But Mike Lee, I think to start the show said this that companies will just move their production elsewhere, short run, it is not that easy, companies face the choice because again, it's companies and ultimately and potentially consumers that bear the cost of this. It's not the Chinese government directly paying these tariffs into the United States.And he said they will move production but in the short run you can see price hikes for consumers or the companies that are importing these goods eating the additional cost. And that hurts their bottom line.BARTIROMO: And then that's what the CEO of Trek told us as well when I said, well, what is the plan if the tariffs go up? Does the plan it include raising prices? He said, yes, that is the plan. Raise prices on bicycles. So we'll be watching all of that and that, of course, is our top story this hour. It's the China trade talks which are going to happen this Thursday. Investors are waiting and watching as the White House set to raise tariffs from 10 to 15 percent on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are accusing China of reneging on trade commitments made during these talks. Lighthizer will issue a Fed registry later today with changes going into effect Friday 12:01 a.m. Blake Burman is covering the story. He's at the White House right now. Blake, good morning to you.BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you as well. A fall of those good feelings surrounding the trade talks that we have been hearing about for several weeks aren't gone right now. I think it's safe to say at least for the moment they are missing in action. The U.S. team is accusing the Chinese team of reversing course on several agreements that had already been hashed out with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer saying at one point yesterday "We are moving backwards, instead of forwards." In an interview with reporters he also added "The progress is in the rear."Now, according to Lighthizer and the Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin in the latest draft of the trade agreement that the U.S. team received over the weekend, China rolled back concessions in multiple areas. That led President Trump to fire off that tweet over the weekend, saying that tariffs will increase, and steps will occur today to start that process. As USTR will post a Federal notice today which will announce that the tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods will go into effect on Friday.Going up from 10 to 25 percent, the very first minute that the calendar flips to May 10th. However, the trade talks with China will indeed resume later this week albeit delayed as the Vice Premier Liu He will be coming to Washington for talks on Thursday and Friday. His appearance for the trade talks have been in question with one source telling me that whether or not he would appear, would send a clear signal of China's intentions.Question now, Maria, comes whether or not the trade discussions can be put back on track. Remember, many had been looking forward to potentially Friday a deal being announced between the U.S. and China but now it appears as if, both sides are a ways away from that and keep in mind as we have been saying now for weeks, Maria, as of this moment there is still nothing officials set for President Trump and President Xi to sit down and meet face-to-face. Maria?BARTIROMO: All right. Blake, thank you. Blake Burman with the latest there. Joining us right now to weigh in on all of this is Pennsylvania Congressman, House Budget Committee member, Dan Meuser. And Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks so much for weighing in here.REP. DAN MEUSER (R-PA): You too.BARTIROMO: How significant --MEUSER: Good morning, Maria.BARTIROMO: -- is this from your standpoint, are we going to be able to see a deal between the two countries and what's plan B if the Chinese will not agree to the President's demands?MEUSER: Well, the Chinese delegation is coming, they're on their way, the Vice Premier, the so called closer is joining. It is very important, this is important for China as certainly as it --as it is for the United States. You know, the President very early showed that he was willing to negotiate, President Trump also showed that he would be willing to walk away, and now, with setting a Friday date, he said put a sense of urgency into this.You know, the oldest tactic in the book for trade negotiations or any international relations is to -- is to delay. And to -- you know, the old says, Russia used to come with -- carrying a month's worth of suitcases for what others thought was going to be a two-day negotiations. So, I think what the President is doing is right, we need a sense of urgency, at this point, this going on for a couple of months.And, you know, the fact that is look, our economy is doing very well, but we've lost literally millions of jobs due to the unfair trade practices of China. We didn't cause this, they did.BARTIROMO: Right.MEUSER: And I hope -- I'm with the President where he says that days of free trade must now -- they can't be free trade unless it's also a fair trade.BARTIROMO: Right.MEUSER: And that's where we are.HILSENRATH: Dan, I want to ask you a question about spending and some budget issues. The President is now talking about a $2 trillion infrastructure spending plan with Democrats. Are you for a big $2 trillion infrastructure spending plan? And if so, how do you want to pay for or does it need to be paid for at all, can it be deficit finance?MEUSER: Look, you know, once again, our country is doing well. Our economy is doing well but we're missing some parts. One part we're definitely missing is rebuilding and revitalizing our infrastructure. I'm all for it. I am not for a typically tax and spend way of handling this, I'm for a new plan that can just be summed up as we turn on investment, right? And the tax and jobs cut, we had the -- we had the opportunity zones that we need to maximize.We have public/private partnerships that we can maximize and there's also something else my certain colleagues are talking about called the -- called the Infrastructure Bank which can be created and can really do some great things. So --(CROSSTALK)HILSENRATH: So just to be clear, you donate want to put any money into it?MEUSER: Not if it's accountable money, not if it's simply taxing and spending the way things have been before. It's got to be got a lot smarter and that's what's being discussed and I plan to be part of those discussions.MCDOWELL: Well, Congressman, it's Dagen McDowell. Why shouldn't the people who use the roads and the bridges pay for their upkeep?MEUSER: Well, they already are.MCDOWELL: Not really. The Federal gas tax does not fund the reconstruction and the repair on the highway system. It's actually much of that money comes from general revenue. So it's people who it's not from the gas tax, it's from people say paying their income taxes.MEUSER: Look, I understand. I believe the federal gas tax is61 cents but states have the high gas taxes as well.MCDOWELL: It's roughly 18, it's under 19 cents a gallon, the Federal gas tax.MEUSER: Yes. I'm sorry. On average with state taxes, it's about 61 cents per gallon that people pay already for their state. Look, it's about accountability. We need a different mindset in Washington. People are not going to stand for simply a gas tax and be told, hey, everything is going to be great and we're going to -- we're going to modernize our roads and make them -- and make them safe.So, if we have discussions where my district, the ninth Congressional were to receive X dollars for X projects, that's something that we can talk about and that's the detail we're going to have to get into for such a bill.BARTIROMO: Congressman, when I interviewed Mick Mulvaney last week, the President's chief of staff, he said that there is a higher chance that USMCA passes than an infrastructure package passes at $2 trillion. And you have to wonder if you are going to have, you know, the Democrats come and do a hearing and really talk in a -- in a real genuine way about getting something done in infrastructure.I mean, you can't say OK, on a Monday we're going to have a hearing on impeachment and then on Tuesday we're going to come back and have a hearing on an infrastructure plan. I mean, it just -- it's just not very realistic. So I ask you the same question, what's likely to pass first, the USMCA or an infrastructure package?MEUSER: Yes. You're right. All these investigations are big distraction and because frankly the Congressional Democrats aren't all that interested in advancing at the President's agenda.BARTIROMO: But your constituents want to see USMCA done, right? You think it's going to pass?MEUSER: They sure do, Maria. It's going to help our agriculture in particular, it's going to help trade, it improves NAFTA, it's -- it -- the bill is done.BARTIROMO: Yes. But you know what your Democratic colleagues have said, right? They don't want to pass it.MEUSER: Well, Nancy Pelosi, it's up to Speaker Pelosi to bring it to the floor. There's no reason she shouldn't bring it to the floor. We think we likely have the votes, they're talking about some new labor requirements in Mexico, they're already in the bill.BARTIROMO: So you think it will pass?MEUSER: Canada is a -- I think it's going to be close. I think it will pass. I do think -- listen, we only need 19 to 20 Democrat votes. There are plenty of Democrats that have constituents that want our economy to continue to grow and continue to advance and stop all the nonsense.(CROSSTALK)MEUSER: So we can get 20 votes.BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, the House Judiciary Committee is going to vote tomorrow on whether to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt. So here you have them trying to rip down what appears to be honest broker in all of this. Why?MEUSER: Well, because it creates more distraction, it continues the problem. Here you have the Attorney General who is merely the legal definer of what Mueller -- the Mueller report findings were.BARTIROMO: Yes.MEUSER: And they don't like the findings so they want to shoot the messenger. It's ridiculous, to hold him in contempt is ridiculous. You know, what happened was he didn't like the procedure and the process that they were proposing. If you remember back for -- when Dr. Ford in the Kavanaugh case, she wasn't happy with the procedures. They went way out of their way to change things. So again, they're not dealing in good faith.BARTIROMO: Right. I think it's even more than that.MEUSER: The leadership on the Democrat calls.BARTIROMO: They don't want William Barr to do what he is promising he is going to do and that is investigate how the investigation into Donald trump started and the origins of that investigation. That's -- it's all coming out real clearly. You know what I think is really dangerous about the story by the way, unfortunately as we learn more about what FBI did to Donald Trump, we're learning sources and methods.We're learning all about the tools that the FBI uses. And that's unfortunate because this is supposed to be secret stuff like informants, et cetera. Dan Meuser, good to see you, sir. Thank you.MEUSER: I think you're right, Maria. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Congressman, we'll see you soon. Coming up. Galaxy fold on hold. Buyers now facing an even longer wake for the Samsung foldable phone. That's next.BARTIROMO: Well, Cash is king for Anadarko. Cheryl Casone with the details of this fight for Anadarko.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: It's crazy, Maria. Anadarko says it now prefers occidental petroleum's takeover offer more than Chevrons (INAUDIBLE) sweetening its $38 billion offer with more cash. Chevron's got until the end of this week to revise its bid or make another proposal that stands to receive a $1 billion termination fee. Shares of Anadarko slightly lower in the premarket.And the wait a little longer for Samsung Galaxy Fold. The company not yet confirming when its new phones going to ship. Even asking consumers if they want to keep their preorders. Now Samsung was first to delay global sales of a nearly $2000 phone following reports of display issues.Well, Amazon opening up its first Go store in New York City today. Another first. Now it accepts cash. The move comes after backlash from critics who say that cashless stores discriminate. The company says its 11 Amazon Go stores are in Seattle, Chicago and San Francisco, they also are going to be accepting cash. The stock is down half a percent in the premarket.And while live officials in Colorado are advising residents to take down their soccer nets when they're not using them after this happened on your screen. A bobcat got stuck in a soccer net. Officials shared the frightening photos. The cat is OK just if you're worried about the cat. He actually was lucky because animals often injure themselves or they even die trying to escape these soccer nets or any traps. So anyway, Maria, the cat is OK. Just not in that picture.BARTIROMO: Well, good. I'm glad that he's OK because I don't like that.CASONE: Kind of scary.BARTIROMO: Make down your nets.CASONE: Yes.MCDOWELL: But if you find a bobcat in a net in your backyard you call animal control because a bobcat will tear you up.BARTIROMO: You got bigger problems than just the net.HILSENRATH: Yes.MCDOWELL: If you see one in the woods, run.BARTIROMO: Yes. Exactly.MCDOWELL: Actually it will chase you.BARTIROMO: Coming up. Trade turmoil hitting the markets this morning. We're at the lows of the morning. What is at stake for a truce with China as the U.S. officials are confirming tariffs will be raised on Friday. Then, protecting your retirement plans. How to safeguard your finances even if you're faced with a sudden health scare. We're going to check that out when we come back.BARTIROMO: Planning in focus. Nearly 37 percent of people asks, say, they ended up retiring earlier than they planned. Overwhelmingly due to a health scare. That number from a new study by the Center for Retirement Research. And joining us right now is Ramsey Solutions financial expert, author of the book, Everyday Millionaires, Chris Hogan is here. And Chris, that's the thing. You never know when life is going to throw you a curveball. So you really need to be prepared financially.CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT, RAMSEY SOLUTIONS: You're absolutely right, Maria. Life can come out of nowhere. And so, the best way to be prepared is to have a plan. That's why I encourage people to have a three to six- month emergency fund that they set aside and you can just keep that liquid in a money market account and it's available if life were to happen. But it's also important, Maria, for people to understand their benefits.Oftentimes, you can look at those benefit hand books so they can feel a lot like reading the IRS tax code. So you may want to get connected with an insurance professional to help you understand what you -- what resources you have available.ANDERSON: One thing that I hear from a lot of millennials, young adults is I've got a lot of student loan debt, I'm -- I feel like I'm not making enough in my job. I barely have enough to make ends meet. How am I supposed to be saving for retirement that there is an understanding that saving now has really big payoffs down the road. But a sense that they just don't have the bandwidth to do it now. What's your advice for younger adults about how to just begin this process?HOGAN: Well, the first step, Kris and to begin is to get serious about getting yourself out of debt. When you get out of debt, you actually free up your money. You know, you give yourself a raise. And so it's really important for the student loan debt not to just hang out like it's a relative. But you actually treat it like an enemy. You get very, very serious. You downgrade lifestyle. You take on extra income.You do whatever is necessary to attack that debt. And so it's really important for people to understand that it's happening. I'm talking to millennials on "THE CHRIS HOGAN SHOW" every week and I'm hearing about people that are attacking debt and paying off debt. So it's possible, we just need to change our mindset and have a plan.HILSENRATH: Hey, Chris, you talked about the role that health scares have in driving people out of early retirement, causing financial chaos. It seems like one of the important lessons there is how important it is to have health insurance, to have at least some kind of basic coverage for emergencies. A lot of Americans, you know, have had problems getting basic insurance. What do you have to say to them?HOGAN: Well, I think, you know, insurance coverage is very, very important and helpful to protect ourselves as well as our family. That's the role and goal of insurance. But I would encourage people there are all kinds of plans and different options out there. I think the big thing is don't sit back and not be informed. Engage with an insurance professional so you can understand what's out there.Or what are some gaps in your coverage that you may need to purchase, an additional policy to be able to protect yourself and your family. I'm encouraging people to not only build their net worth by making sure they're using employer-sponsored retirement plans, 401(k)s and 403(b)s but we have to make sure we have insurance. That's what helps us to protect our nest egg as well as our families.MCDOWELL: Do you believe -- Chris, it's Dagen. Do you believe in long- term care insurance and extra disability insurance for people?HOGAN: Well, I think long-term care is very, very vital and it's important and I encourage people to have that in place, Dagen, prior to age 60. Beyond age 60, the price of it can really go up. And so, you know, the opportunity, the need nursing home care or in-home care is something that can really, really happen, especially in this day and age of different health things attacking people at various stages.Long-term disability is something I encourage people to look at as well. If you're unable to work or do the job that you've been trained in, you want to make sure that again, I'm able to cover and protect my family. So it's really important to engage with an insurance professional, really through these things and make sure you have all these items in a row and you're properly prepared.Don't turn a blind eye to it and think that the government is going to save the day. You and I both know better.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm. All right. We sure do. Chris, great to see you. Thanks so much.HOGAN: Thank you very much.BARTIROMO: Chris Hogan joining us there. Coming up. China trade turmoil. What is at stake for a truce with China. U.S. officials are confirming that the tariffs will be raised. First thing Friday morning. Then Google in focus. The technology giant kicks off its annual developers conference. We're taking you live to California with an inside look. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, May 7th. Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast. U.S.-China trade turmoil, President Trump's advisors are accusing China of reneging on commitments. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer expected to issue a Federal Registry today, which will effectively raise tariffs on China by 12:01 Friday morning. This is China's top trade negotiator is still headed to Washington. The meeting in Washington is Thursday and Friday of this week.Markets, nonetheless, are nervous about it. Take a look, we are off of the lows of the morning, but still showing a triple-digit decline at the start of trading. The Dow futures are now down 154 points, two-thirds of one percent, S&P futures down 18, and the NASDAQ futures lower by 60. In Europe this morning, similar story down across the board, take a look. European indices down 70 points on the FT-100, the CAC Quarante is down 34 points, the DAX Index in Germany down 58 points, you did have some weaker- than-expected German factory orders this morning, and that hit the markets.In Asia overnight, take a look at the markets, Japan was the loser after its 10-day holiday, the market opened after 10 days closed, and it was down 1-1/2 percent. Shanghai Composite bounced, of course it was down 5-1/2 percent yesterday. Google's latest technology, a preview of what the company is set to unveil later today, including new tools to protect your privacy. And cryptocurrency, Bitcoin versus gold, find out when one might be worth dropping, all that coming up this half an hour. Markets are set to open lower this moaning on worries of escalating trade tensions. Gerri Willis on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, looking at all the action. Gerri.GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Yes, Maria. So, listen, these traders down here are used to this that the -- President Trump tweets dictate the direction of the tape, that's exactly what's been going on here for a couple days. We're down again this morning, yesterday, traders were saying there was a negotiating tactic by the President to put on these additional tariffs to raise the level of the tariffs.Today they're saying that it's possible that they're going to have to wait longer than tend. Remember traders who were expecting the seal to be deal done quickly pronto right. Now they're seeing that it going to take longer than that. There is some people down here, starting to worry whether we're going to getting a deal at all, at the end of the day, 12:01 a.m. Friday's comes awful fast. They are encouraged however by this report that the Chinese Vice-Premier, Liu, will visit Thursday and Friday. That's seen as a positive.I don't I think anybody here coupled expected a China trade deal to be an thing, that we'd be done quickly. So, at some level, they're anticipating difficult negotiation, but I have to tell you, these headlines lately late have them a little anxious here. Maria, back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Gerri. Thank you so much. We'll be watching that. We're expecting a lower opening. Joining me right now is Grayscale Investments Founder and CEO Barry Silbert also the CEO of Digital Currency Group, which is the overall umbrella company. Good to see you.BARRY SILBERT, FOUNDER AND CEO, GRAYSCALE INVESTMENTS: Great to see you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us, Barry. So, look, you've been a bull on Bitcoin for a long time. You were a pioneer in this industry in terms of exchanges and investing here. Before we get to Bitcoin specifically, when you see a market that is lower the way it is today, on nervousness about what's going on in China, do you see people pivot toward Bitcoin? Do they change their investments and like this things like that, or do you think they shy away from everything?SILBERT: So what's really interesting is Bitcoin tends to perform really well in periods of financial dislocation just like gold used ti. In fact, Bitcoin over the past 24 hours, is up about 10 percent interestingly.BARTIROMO: Why?SILBERT: Well, it could be a lot of different things. It could be the news coming out of China, it could be just technically it looks great, the price is up almost a hundred percent year-to-date, or it could be that this campaign we launched last week to drop gold is having effect.BARTIROMO: Bill, that -- we want to talk about that in a second, but look at price now, 5,896. Yes, you're talking about a rally year to date, but you're still talking about a big decline from the highs. So, what's the sales pitch to buy Bitcoin today.SILBERT: So what's really interesting is last time I was on with you, the price of Bitcoin was $500.BARTIROMO: Yes.SILBERT: And Bitcoin has done a series of record highs, and then it drops 80 percent, and then record highs again. But the sales pitch is Bitcoin is the younger generation's version of gold. It has all the same characteristics as gold, scarce, it's divisible, it's portable, but it actually has real utility. The Bitcoin community is creating an entire new payment financial rail network that I think is going to transform the central markets.BARTIROMO: Yes. And you seed something in terms of -- as we continue to go deal, you want a payment system digitally. So, why Bitcoin and not something else? Because there are other alternatives.SILBERT: Of course, yes, look, there's thousands out provide out there. Bitcoin is first mover, has the biggest capital, a hundred billion dollars right now, has the most amazing passionate community, and I do think that there will be lots of competition for winning cryptocurrencies over time Bitcoin is dominating. It absolutely dominating the conversation.BARTIROMO: And that's really where the volume is, obviously. Let me ask you about this campaign, this drop gold campaign, that's the message from Grayscale Investments looking to challenge a trillion-dollar institution encouraging people to drop gold from their portfolios in favor of Bitcoin. You're speaking at the SALT Conference. I know you're going to be communicating this message, why should I drop gold when people say, look, gold is a real hedge. If I think things are negative elsewhere, I want to own gold because it's a tangible asset.SILBERT: So there's $8 trillion of gold held today. What's interesting is that the younger generation of investors, the people who have not yet allocated into gold don't view gold same way that our parents or grandparents did. We grew up after the gold standard, so the biggest buyers of gold, the largest increase in buyers of gold right now are central banks. So, there's this disconnect between gold bugs saying, OK, you vest in gold because you take issue with central banker, fiscal monetary policy decisions, yet they're the ones who are buying all the gold.So, if you do want to make an investment that will performer well when things don't go well, why are you aligning yourself with China, and Russia, and all of these countries that are amassing all the gold?BARTIROMO: But isn't that the reason you want to own gold? Because central banks are not the going to sell it so easily, then it's going to be stable, so if a market is plummeting in terms of stock, don't I want to go to something that's real tangible, that I know is not going to have that kind of volatility?SILBERT: Well, ultimately, the way that gold will have meaningful value is if the U.S. dollar declines in value. So essentially --BARTIROMO: And you're not expecting that.SILBERT: Well, no, and so why bet against the U.S.? So with Bitcoin, it has all the same characteristics of gold, but you're investing in something that has real utility and real upside. The total market cap of Bitcoin is $100,000 dollars, relative to $8 trillion of gold, it takes a lot for the gold price to double from 8 trillion, at a hundred billion, carve off a few percent from an $8 trillion gold market, that's meaningful upside.BARTIROMO: And there's a limited amount of Bitcoin, right?SILBERT: It's just like gold and that is it is finite in supply, it's scarce, but it actually has utility, and it's also much more accessible. Anybody who has a phone anywhere in the world can get Bitcoin now. Gold is heavy, it's expensive to store, and it doesn't really do anything other than make nice jewelry.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, that -- that's true, I mean except that it's seen as a hedge. You're going to have to change a whole generation of, you know, thinkers, of -- in terms of how do I save money and hedge against a decline of disruption elsewhere?SILBERT: Right, and I think this drop gold campaign is intended to be provocative. It's intended to start this conversation, because I do think that the gold industry has done a very, very good job marketing gold as this hedge investment when there's a better one called Bitcoin.BARTIROMO: Wow. All right. Let me ask you about cryptocurrency in Facebook, Facebook is recruiting financial firms and online merchants to launch a cryptocurrency-based payment system. This could greatly affect the current cryptocurrency marketplace. What's your take on Facebook getting involved?SILBERT: So we're under a nondisclosure agreement with Facebook so I can't speak specially to Facebook, but in general, you see what Facebook is doing, you see what Square is doing, you see what Fidelity is doing, even the New York Stock Exchange, they're all getting involved in creating infrastructure to support this new ecosystem, even Jamie Dimon, who hates Bitcoin --BARTIROMO: Right.SILBERT: -- is launching the JPMorgan coin.BARTIROMO: That's right.SILBERT: Yes.BARTIROMO: Well, he did hate Bitcoin until his daughter schooled him.SILBERT: Right. And she made a few bucks in buying Bitcoin.BARTIROMO: She made --SILBERT: That's right.BARTIROMO: She made him buy Bitcoin. What do you say to those investors who've gotten burnt on Bitcoin because they got in at the top, then it went down, and they're seeing this as a real risky bet, much riskier than gold.SILBERT: Well, look, it's certainly a risky bet, and you should never put more money into Bitcoin than you can afford to lose, absolutely, but this is -- this is a -- perhaps a generational opportunity, to get involved in an asset that is going to displace what gold did or play -- what role the gold played in portfolios for the past 20 years, and I think that that's a really interesting opportunity that provides a lot of upside.BARTIROMO: So tell me how Bitcoin changes in the next 20 years. What kind of a vision do you see for Bitcoin?SILBERT: Well, first it's going to displace gold as the store value investment that goes into portfolios, but really more importantly, there's amazing innovation that's happening right now, thousands of companies have been funded, $5 billion have been raised into these companies over the past five years that are building infrastructure to make it really, really easy to get on and off the cryptocurrency superhighway, and once you have access to digital money, the sky is the limit. You remove friction and middlemen, and costs. Think about the ability to move money anywhere around the world instantaneously basically free, think about how powerful that is for society.BARTIROMO: Yes, you're right. Barry, it's great stuff. You've been such an Innovator in this space. Congrats.SILBERT: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: Good to see you. Barry Silbert joining us there. Coming up, the heated Medicare for All debate, Stuart Varney weighs in on that when we come back, and then it is National Small Business Week. I'll be speak with the woman behind Farmgirl Flowers on how she transformed the online flower delivery business from her dining room table, how she did it coming up. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Medicare for All, a big sticky point from any of the 2020 democratic presidential hopefuls, but paying forward another issue, joining me now the host of "VARNEY & CO." Stuart Varney to weigh in there. Good morning, Stu.STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. Can't resist this. You know how Bernie says Medicare for All, just got to be? We're the only country in the world that doesn't have it, going to do it. OK. Well, Bernie's favorite country to demonstrate the virtues of Medicare for All and socialized medicine is Denmark. Now if you look at Denmark real closely, you'll find that they have a 56 percent tax rate on incomes of $80,000 a year or more. In other words, you get to $80,000 and in Denmark, you're paying for socialized to the tune of more than half your income.Plus Denmark has a 25 percent VAT, Value Added Tax, by any other name, that is a sales tax and it's on everything. That's what you got to pay. You want socialized medicine, that's what you got to pay. Now Bernie Sanders and several of the other major leading political contenders for the presidency, they're in favor of this Medicare for All, and they are sure that rich can pay for it just like that, that is absolutely not true.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.VARNEY: Even The Washington Post accepts this, that if you want Medicare for All, there are tradeoffs, specifically higher taxes on everybody.BARTIROMO: Yes.VARNEY: I think that's a damning argument.BARTIROMO: Not to mention, it wipes out their private insurance industry - -VARNEY: Oh, yes.BARTIROMO: -- where right now 180 million people get their insurance from.VARNEY: Not to mention that, yes. Right.BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly. Stu, great to see you.VARNEY: Sure.BARTIROMO: I know you'll have more in 15 minutes. Well will see you at the top of the hour.VARNEY: You got it.BARTIROMO: "VARNEY & CO." begins 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. But first, Google is in focus here. The technology giant kicks off its developers. We're going to take you live to California, get an inside look at what they're doing. Then it is National Small Business Week, and I'm speaking with the woman behind this, Farmgirl Flowers, how she launched her online flower deliver business from her dining room table, to across the country, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. In honor of National Small Business Week and with Mother's Day right around the corner, we are looking at booming the $23 million company right now, Farmgirl Flowers making a name for itself in the online flower delivery industry since 2010, from peonies to Technicolor tulips, the company arranges quality flowers from farms across America. Joining us right now is Farmgirl Flowers Founder and CEO, Christina Stembel. Christina, great to have you.CHRISTINA STEMBEL, CEO & FOUNDER, FARMGIRL FLOWERS: Thanks for having me, Maria.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us. These flowers are absolutely gorgeous. We love them. Tell us how you started this company.STEMBEL: Thanks, yes. I started it about eight years ago from my dining room, and have just worked boos trap, the company, every year doing about a hundred percent growth year over year until we hit some bigger numbers.BARTIROMO: But how did you do it? I mean how did you know where to get the flowers, and how did you know to get the word out, and we should point out you didn't even -- you don't have a college degree.STEMBEL: No, no, yes. So I knew I wanted to start a business, but I didn't know what industry I want it to be in. I didn't grow up frolicking in my grandmother's garden, I came up in a corn and soybean farm in Indiana and then ended up in San Francisco a few years later with a couple other cities in between, and in San Francisco, in The Valley especially, it's very infectious, this startup mentality, and everybody's doing something really amazing, and so I caught that bug and I wanted to start a business. I knew that.I wanted to check a couple of boxes. I want it to be innovative, I didn't want to just take someone else's idea, I wanted to do something good in the world and I knew it needed to about boot-strapped because I didn't have that pedigree that would be able to raise outside capital.HILSENRATH: You had to go up against some pretty big competition. How did you go about doing that and how did you decide to take on flowers when you have a lot of -- a lot of other flower ordering companies out there?STEMBEL: Yes. There are some big ones. People think I was a little crazy. I think I was just really naive. I didn't think about it as like, "Oh, I'm crazy to do this." I just thought it's -- there's a lot of big names out there, which means there's a lot of market share to be taken.HILSENRATH: Uh-hmm.STEMBEL: So there were predominantly three companies making up three quarters of the entire e-commerce space, and in 2010, it was actually declining, the e-commerce space. And I mean I started back then buying everything online like most young people at that time, and I thought that, you know, the flower space shouldn't be declining in that year, so I thought, OK, if it's declining, there's a reason so let me see if I can fix the reason, which I why I started Farmgirl Flowers.HILSENRATH: What was-- what was the reason? What problem --BARTIROMO: These peonies are so gorgeous.STEMBEL: Thank you.MCDOWELL: You have an eye, though, in terms of the bouquets because I've gotten flowers some of the other companies, and that's like twigs and weeds compared to this. Do you -- do you have eye for what women love in getting a bouquet? And it's -- we were talking about it in the greenroom, but it's the types of flowers like a peony or ranunculus, which have a lot of petals which just have this bloom on them, and that's really what kind of speaks to the beauty of all of your bouquets.STEMBEL: Thank you. I think -- I knew it'd be a creative space that I was going into. Ironically, we're the only female-founded large -- getting their large scale flower company and I think that matters. Most people think that men are the ones who buy flowers but that's not the case, 80 percent of people that but flowers are women buying for women. Now, man, if you take Valentine's Day out of it --MCDOWELL: Maria Bartiromo.(CROSSTALK)LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: I think I think it's so interesting about your model is the idea that instead of me going on a website and having to figure out, well, wait, what flowers are in season and that are going to look nice? You all kind of take that decision in your own hands and apply your own taste to it. Tell me about that decision to make that your model.STEMBEL: Yes. So that was what truly made us different. Now there's more and more companies that are doing the less is more, but back in 2010 when I came up with the idea, I took in-n-out burger as my example company, which is a hamburger joint, right? Like kind of like Shake Shack out here. And what I saw is that, you know, they do what they do and they do it well and there's always a huge line. And so, you know, I was just like if it works for them, why can't I apply that same thought process and strategy to flowers because who wants to spend an hour looking at, you know, hundreds of options online I? I'd rather go spend five mints, know that's it going to be beautiful.HILSENRATH: Is that why business was declining? That -- was that the problem that you saw that people were being given too many choices and were ending up getting mediocre products and the --STEMBEL: Honestly, I that the -- that and also just the flowers didn't look good.BARTIROMO: So I hope you're ready for a big weekend. Mother's Day's this weekend and shoppers are expected to spend more than $25 billion a year -- I'm sorry, gifts, on gifts this year including $2.6 billion on flowers alone according to the National Retail Federation. Are you ready? How do you get ready for Mother's Day this Sunday?STEMBEL: It is definitely the Super Bowl for us. Mother's Day is the biggest time of year, even more than Valentine's Day. My team is working around the clock. They come in starting at 10:00 p.m., we work straight through. We're definitely going to do six to seven times what we do in a normal week this week.BARTIROMO: All right.STEMBEL: So it's going to be huge.HILSENRATH: My mother is getting a facial this year.BARTIROMO: Good. That's a nice gift.MCDOWELL: Yes, in terms of -- in terms --HILSENRATH: Wait, wait, I want to change the subject. We were talking off set about marijuana. How is marijuana affecting your business?STEMBEL: Yes. So until 2017, we only sourced domestic grown flowers. That was core to my mission growing up on a farm in Indiana, it was very important to me, and we just ran out of supply, and with the legalization of cannabis, definitely that has changed the landscape of agriculture in the U.S. --BARTIROMO: How?STEMBEL: -- especially in California. So growers can make a lot more money growing that as opposed to flowers. Sometimes, if you have greenhouses, you can, you know, get $1.50 to $2.00 a square foot, versus like $0.05 to $0.10 cents a square foot growing like snapdragons, you know, so it's just it's more lucrative for them and I understand supply and demand.HILSENRATH: Is that driving up your cost?STEMBEL: Definitely drives up cost. It also drives up the -- just it's more difficult, it's more challenging with the inbound transportation and all the things, you need to learn, customs, things like that. Taxes. Things like that. It's definitely --BARTIROMO: Great stuff. Christina, congrats.STEMBEL: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much.STEMBEL: Thank you so much.BARTIROMO: Christina Stembel joining us there. Still ahead, Google is in focus. The technology giant is kicking off its Developers Conference. We're taking you live to California next. We got an inside look at that conference. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Google's latest tech. After a disappointing earnings report, Google is looking to reclaim the narrative at its Developers Conference. The company expected to unveil its latest products and features. Robert Gray is in Mountain View, California this morning where the conference is taking place. He's got a preview. Good morning.ROBERT GRAY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Hey, good morning, Maria. That's right. In just a few hours' time, 7,000 developers from around the globe expected to be here. As you mentioned, Google looking to put their best foot forward, expecting some product announcements for both hardware and software, and maybe a few words about privacy as CEO Sundar Pichai takes the stage at 10:00 a.m. local time. The -- so we'll be expecting to hear that. Of course, they've been under pressure from lawsuits and lawmakers over the past year about privacy.As far as the products go, well, we could hear something about a new Pixel 3 phone. It's expected perhaps with the same cameras that Pixel 3 released just six months ago. Google Home products such as a Nest Hub Max with a 10-inch screen, a new Android Q Mobile operating system, the Stadia game streaming service has been announced. We're awaiting details for launch and pricing there. Possibly some augmented reality game play as well and of course more about wearables and laptops waiting to see what all we're going to hear in a couple hours' time, Maria. Right now, back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Robert. Thank you so much. A big congratulations to our friends, Rachel Campos-Duffy and Sean Duffy, waiting for baby number nine on the way. Oh, my God. Congrats, you guys.MCDOWELL: I saw the announcement on Twitter --BARTIROMO: Fantastic.MCDOWELL: -- yesterday.BARTIROMO: I love it.MCDOWELL: I was like God bless you.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: God bless you.BARTIROMO: Great show, everybody.

REMARKS BY H.E. SONG YUMIN AT THE CELEBRATION CEREMONY OF "SEEDS FOR THE FUTURE" PROGRAMMEStates News ServiceJune 6, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1123 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:From Chinese Embassy in Trinidad and TobagoIt's a great pleasure for me to to be invited to speak at this celebration ceremony. On behalf of all my colleagues and the whole team of the Embassy, I warmly welcome you all to this newly built premises of the Embassy which bears striking features of China's Hui-style architecture. I am so pleased to join you all in extending our congratulations to the 10 students from universities in Trinidad and Tobago for their successful completion of this year's Huawei "Seeds For The Future" courses. So far since its launch in Trinidad and Tobago in 2016, around 30 students from this country have taken part in this programme out of its global context. Through the training programme, they further gained their knowledge on information and communications technology (ICT) and enhanced their understanding of China. I commend all the SFTF cohort for their contributions to the people-to-people and cultural exchanges and friendship between our two countries.Since its operation in Trinidad and Tobago, Huawei Technologies (TandT) Limited has won the recognition of the local public not only for its professional excellence but also for its efforts on practicing Corporate Social Responsibility. "Seeds For The Future" is Huawei's global CSR flagship programme focusing on strengthening its cooperation with local teaching and research institutions to foster local talents in ICT. To the large extent, this may contributes to the reasons why Huawei has gone from zero to hero in just a little over 30 years. Now Huawei is leading the world on 5G technology. "Despite efforts in markets creating fear about Huawei, using politics to interfere with growth, customers continue to trust us and continue to work with us and build networks with our technologies," I'm quoting Mr. Ken Hu, Deputy Chairman of Huawei technologies in saying so. The Chinese Government takes its responsibility in safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises.At this point, one might naturally think of the current Sino-US trade disputes. Five days ago, on 2nd of June, the State Council Information Office of China issued a white paper entitled "China's Position on the China-U.S. Economic and Trade Consultations." It provides a holistic picture of the Trade talks, and elaborates China's policy position on these consultations.In March 2018, the United States unilaterally initiated economic and trade frictions towards China. China had to take forceful measures to defend the interests of the nation and its people. At the same time, committed to resolving disputes through dialogue and consultation, China has engaged in multiple rounds of economic and trade consultations with the US in an effort to stabilize the bilateral commercial relationship. The Chinese Government rejects the idea that threats of a trade war and continuous tariff hikes can ever help resolve trade and economic issues. Disputes and conflicts on the trade and economic front, at the end of the day, need to be solved through dialogue and consultations. Striking a mutually beneficial and win-win agreement serves the interests of China and the US and meets the expectations of the world. We hope the US can pull in the same direction with China and, in a spirit of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, manage economic and trade differences, strengthen trade and economic cooperation, and jointly advance China-US relations based on coordination, cooperation and stability for the well-being of both nations and the world.Ladies and gentlemen, friends,China's development may not be all smooth sailing. Difficulties or even perils are inevitable. Whatever the future might bring, China is confident of meeting challenges head on, turning risks into opportunities, and opening new chapters. Over the past 70 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, especially after China started to implement reform and opening-up in 1978, Chinese people have gone through an epic journey with remarkable achievements scored that are recognized by the whole world. Opening-up was key to China's development over the past 40 years. In the same vein, high-quality development of China's economy in the future can only be achieved with greater openness. China will continue to deepen reform and opening-up. China's door will not be closed; it will only open even wider.China's development cannot be isolated from the world's development and vice versa. With its own development, China now is in a better position to provide Chinese solutions and Chinese wisdom to world governance. In 2013, President XI Jinping put forward the Belt and Road Initiative. Up to now, over 160 countries and international organizations have signed cooperation documents with China on the Initiative; a large number of cooperation projects have been launched and a general connectivity framework has been put in place.As a major country and an important partner of China in the Caribbean region, Trinidad and Tobago has always been attaching great importance to its relations with China. It leads the way in the Caribbean region in jointly building the Belt and Road to share the win-win outcomes from the Initiative. It signed on to the Belt and Road Initiative in May last year during the Prime Minister Dr. the Honourable Keith Rowley's official visit to China. With its emphasis on policy connectivity, infrastructure connectivity, trade connectivity, financial connectivity and people-to-people connectivity, the Belt and Road Initiative provides new impetus to the development of China-Trinidad and Tobago relations and serves as yet another platform on which bilateral pragmatic cooperation in various areas will be further intensified.Ladies and gentlemen,This year marks the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Trinidad and Tobago. With joint efforts of both sides, the bilateral relations have always been maintaining a good momentum of development and bringing about tangible benefits for the two countries and the two peoples. At present, the bilateral relations are in a new starting point, facing unprecedented historic development opportunities. The Chinese side attaches great importance to China-Trinidad and Tobago relations and will continue to deepen bilateral cooperation in various areas and take our bilateral relations to a new level.To conclude, once again, I applaud the cohort of the Future Seeds for their achievements. I thank Huawei Technologies (TandT) Ltd for organizing this wonderful event. I wish everyone enjoy the rest part of the evening.Thank you.Load-Date: June 12, 2019End of Document

Carter Says Trump Called Him To Discuss ChinaThe FrontrunnerApril 15, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 404 wordsBodyThe Hill (4/14, Rodrigo, 3.85M) reports Emma Hurt of NPR's Atlanta affiliate on Sunday tweeted, "In Sunday school this morning President Carter said he got a call from @realDonaldTrump last night, and they talked about China. Carter said Trump is rightly concerned that "China is getting ahead of us." #gapol." According to The Hill, the former president "has urged the US and Chinese governments to find areas of common concern and improve relations." He also "has warned that the current trade conflict could distract the two countries from potential for productive collaboration."FBI Prohibits Some Chinese Scholars From Visiting US Over Espionage Fears.The New York Times (4/14, Perlez, 17.3M) reports that the FBI "has mounted a counterintelligence operation that aims to bar Chinese academics from the United States if they are suspected of having links to Chinese intelligence agencies." According to US and Chinese academics, "As many as 30 Chinese professors in the social sciences, heads of academic institutes, and experts who help explain government policies have had their visas to the United States canceled in the past year, or put on administrative review." The development "follows the warning of the FBI director, Christopher A. Wray, at a Senate hearing last year that China presented 'a whole-of-society threat on their end' that required a 'whole-of-society response.'" Asked to comment, "a State Department official said that American law enforcement believed Chinese intelligence services were increasingly using visiting Chinese scholars to target American citizens for intelligence gathering purposes."NYTimes Analysis: China Using AI To Track Minority Uighurs.In what a New York Times (4/14, Mozur, 17.3M) analysis calls "a major ethical leap for the tech world, Chinese start-ups have built algorithms that the government uses to track" Uighurs, a "largely Muslim minority." While China's government "has drawn wide international condemnation for its harsh crackdown on ethnic Muslims in its western region, including holding as many as a million of them in detention camps," interviews and documents obtained by the Times "show that the authorities are also using a vast, secret system of advanced facial recognition technology to track and control the Uighurs." According to experts, "It is the first known example of a government intentionally using artificial intelligence for racial profiling."Load-Date: April 15, 2019End of Document

PHILIPPINE ACTIVISTS PROTEST AT CHINESE EMBASSY ON ANNIVERSARY OF TIANANMEN MASSACREStates News ServiceJune 4, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 472 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Dozens of Filipino activists lit candles during a peaceful demonstration outside the Chinese embassy in Manila on Tuesday to mark the 30th anniversary of Beijing's bloody crackdown against pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square.Members of the Philippine group, which calls itself Sentro, lit candles and carried anti-China banners in front of the embassy in Manila's financial district. They accused China's communist government of the "mass murder" on June 4, 1989 of students who were clamoring for democratization, freedom and accountability."To this day the casualty count of the event varies," the group said in a statement. "While official Chinese government estimates would continue to downplay statistics, independent witnesses worldwide would in fact place the number between several hundred and close to 1,000 dead mostly students and workers."Thirty years ago, hundreds, if not thousands, were killed when the Chinese government unleashed the military on unarmed demonstrators at the massive plaza in Beijing fronting the Forbidden City, after weeks of protests, reports said.The crackdown "halted any attempts at democratizing" Chinese society, the Filipino demonstrators pointed out."Any oppressive action that the Beijing politburo has taken under the panoptic eye of President Xi Jinping owes its existence since to the events of Tiananmen," Sentro's statement said, expressing solidarity with what it called the rising generation of Chinese citizens, especially activists, who are in prison or are in exile."The Chinese Communist Party would rather we forget those who fell in 1989," it said. "But not us. Never us."Francis Pangilinan, a Philippine senator, lawyer and president of the Liberal Party, said he stood in solidarity with "all the freedom-loving people" of China as the world marked the 30th year of that country's democracy movement.The massacre at Tiananmen Square remains a "blatant reminder" that people everywhere stand for truth and justice and will fight oppression and tyranny, Sen. Pangilinan said."The struggle continues as basic human rights and freedoms are still obscured by state forces," Pangilinan said."May the image of that young man who stood alone before a column of advancing tanks be forever be etched in our minds an image of defiance, of determination, of courage to claim our inherent basic human rights and freedoms," he said.Responding to a question at the Shangri-La regional security forum in Singapore on Sunday, Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe called the Tiananmen Square crackdown the right decision, pointing to the country's stability since then."The government was decisive in stopping the turbulence, that was the correct policy," he said.Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Load-Date: June 4, 2019End of Document

Gridsum Reports Unaudited First Quarter 2019 Financial ResultsPR NewswireJune 24, 2019 Monday 7:37 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3390 wordsDateline: BEIJING, June 24, 2019 BodyPR NewswireGridsum Holding Inc. ("Gridsum" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: GSUM), a leading provider of cloud-based big-data analytics and artificial intelligence ("AI") solutions in China, today reported its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2019.HighlightsNet revenues decreased by 56% to RMB58.7 million (US$8.7 million) from RMB132.4 million in the comparable period of 2018. Net loss attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders increased to RMB161.4 million (US$24.0 million) from RMB62.5 million in the comparable period of 2018.First Quarter 2019 Financial ResultsREVENUES: Net revenues decreased by 56% to RMB58.7 million (US$8.7 million) from RMB132.4 million in the comparable period of 2018.Enterprise revenues decreased by 52% to RMB57.9 million (US$8.6 million) from RMB119.8 million in the comparable period of 2018, mainly due to: an exceptionally strong performance in sales of Social Listening solutions recorded in the comparable period of 2018; the Company's ongoing strategic evolution to achieve a more optimal revenue mix by proactively optimizing its Search Engine Marketing (SEM) business toward higher return opportunities; and a slowdown in the Chinese economy.E-Government and other revenues decreased by 88% to RMB2.0 million (US$0.3 million) from RMB17.3 million in the comparable period of 2018, mainly due to the lengthening of the sales cycle and lower budgeted spending of the Chinese government for E-Government solutions caused by China's government reorganization activities in 2018.COST OF REVENUES: Cost of revenues was RMB17.9 million (US$2.7 million), compared with RMB16.3 million in the comparable period of 2018.GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS MARGIN: Gross profit decreased by 65% to RMB40.9 million (US$6.1 million) from RMB116.1 million in the comparable period of 2018, while gross margin decreased to 69.6% from 87.7%. This was mainly due to a change in revenue mix as well as a time-lag between the Company's restructuring/optimization of its revenue mix and its cost structure.OPERATING EXPENSES: Total operating expenses were RMB193.1 million (US$28.8 million), compared with RMB175.3 million in the comparable period of 2018. Sales and marketing expenses were RMB36.8 million (US$5.5 million), compared with RMB36.0 million in the comparable period of 2018. The increase was primarily due to a RMB3.3 million increase in staff costs, partially offset by a RMB1.5 million decrease in business development, marketing and promotion expenses. Research and development expenses were RMB95.1 million (US$14.2 million), compared with RMB109.2 million in the comparable period of 2018. The decrease was primarily due to the Company leveraging its substantial foundation investments in Industrial AI, knowledge graph, data warehouse, and IIoT platform and applications in the corresponding period in 2018. General and administrative expenses were RMB61.1 million (US$9.1 million), compared with RMB30.1 million in the comparable period of 2018. The increase was primarily due to a RMB10.5 million increase in provision for bad debt, a RMB5.1 million increase in staff costs and a RMB4.7 million increase in professional fees associated with delayed filing of the Company's periodic reports with the SEC.LOSS FROM OPERATIONS: Loss from operations was RMB152.2 million (US$22.7 million), compared with RMB59.2 million in the comparable period of 2018.NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GRIDSUM'S ORDINARY SHAREHOLDERS: Net loss attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders was RMB161.4 million (US$24.0 million), compared with RMB62.5 million in the comparable period of 2018. The increase was primarily due to the declines in net revenues and an increase in general and administrative expenses.NON-GAAP NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GRIDSUM'S ORDINARY SHAREHOLDERS: Non-GAAP net loss attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders, which is defined as net loss attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders before share-based compensation expense, was RMB150.3 million (US$22.4 million), compared with RMB55.0 million in the comparable period of 2018.EBITDA: Loss before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization was RMB155.8 million (US$23.2 million), compared with RMB51.6 million in the comparable period of 2018. The increase was mainly due to an increase in loss from operations of RMB93.0 million.ADJUSTED EBITDA: Adjusted loss before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization, which excludes share-based compensation expenses, was RMB144.7 million (US$21.6 million), compared with RMB44.1 million in the comparable period of 2018.NET LOSS PER ADS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GRIDSUM'S ORDINARY SHAREHOLDERS: Net loss per ADS attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders was RMB5.06 (US$0.75), compared with RMB2.03 in the comparable period of 2018.NON-GAAP NET LOSS PER ADS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GRIDSUM'S ORDINARY SHAREHOLDERS: Non-GAAP net loss per ADS attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders was RMB4.72 (US$0.70), compared with RMB1.78 in the comparable period of 2018.Each ADS represents one Class B ordinary share. For purposes of determining net loss per ADS attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders, the weighted average number of ordinary shares for the first quarter of 2019 was 31,876,482. As of March 31, 2019, the total number of ordinary shares outstanding was 34,302,710.Balance SheetAs of March 31, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of RMB38.8 million (US$5.8 million), and restricted cash of RMB1.3 million (US$0.2 million).First Quarter 2019 Review and OutlookThe Company's performance in the first quarter of 2019 continued to reflect the Company moving through resolution of some of the challenges, originating in 2018, where a number of events and issues negatively impacted the Company's business and performance. Revenue and growth momentum were further impacted by the slowdown in the Chinese economy.As a result of the Company's strategic evolution and restructuring to achieve a more optimal revenue mix and focus on higher return opportunities, revenues from Search Engine Marketing (SEM) solutions represented a smaller percentage of Enterprise revenues compared with the comparable period in 2018. Additionally, within SEM, the Company continued to evolve its client mix toward higher return opportunities.The first quarter of 2019 saw increased traction from the restructuring of the Company's sales and service functions to encourage more effective cross-sell and upsell of additional products and solutions to its client base, as well as to focus on higher return opportunities within the Company's revenue-mix. The Company has seen early indications of additional cross-sell and upsell of products and solutions across its client base. The Company believes that this is an important initiative that will help its financial performance in the coming months and years.The first quarter of 2019 continued to see solid traction in the Company's IIoT business leveraging its significant investments in its industrial AI and IIoT platforms during 2018.The Company expects to continue to stabilize its core businesses and regain growth momentum through 2019 with higher Enterprise revenues and revenue growth in its IIoT vertical. On the back of the Company's front-end investment in its IIoT and related platform and solutions in 2018, the Company is showing early signs of potentially emerging as a leader in certain verticals in this nascent but high-opportunity industry segment in China.Based on its current estimates and business trajectory, the Company expects a return to growth in net revenues in 2019.Exchange RateThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. Dollars ("US$") at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise stated, all translations from RMB to US$ were made at the rate of RMB6.7112 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate in effect on March 29, 2019 in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board. The Company makes no representation that the RMB or US$ amounts referred could be converted into US$ or RMB, as the case may be, at any particular rate or at all.Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn evaluating the Company's business, the Company considers and uses the following non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental measures to review and assess the Company's operating performance: non-GAAP net loss attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders, non-GAAP net loss per share attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders, non-GAAP net loss per ADS attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP net loss attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders is net loss attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders before share-based compensation, non-GAAP net loss per share attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders is the per share equivalent and non-GAAP net loss per ADS attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders is the per ADS equivalent, EBITDA is net loss before interest income and expenses, income tax expenses and depreciation expenses, and adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA before share-based compensation.The Company presents these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by the Company's management to evaluate the Company's operating performance and formulate the Company's business plans. These non-GAAP financial measures enable the Company's management to assess the Company's operating results without considering the impact of non-cash charges, including depreciation expenses and share-based compensation, and without considering the impact of non-operating items such as interest income and expenses and income tax expenses. The Company also believes that the use of these non-GAAP measures facilitates investors' assessment of the Company's operating performance.These non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the Company's operations. Interest income and expenses, income tax expenses, depreciation expenses and share-based compensation have been and may continue to be incurred in the Company's business and are not reflected in the presentation of adjusted EBITDA. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, including Gridsum's peer companies, so their utility for comparison purposes may be limited.The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the Company's non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. Investors are encouraged to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their closest U.S. GAAP financial measures appears at the end of this release.About GridsumGridsum Holding Inc.

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Happy Wednesday, it is Wednesday, May 29th. Your top stories right now, just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.U.S.-China trade turmoil hitting markets once again, my exclusive one-on- one interview with the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, this morning. With tensions on the rise, I asked Mike Pompeo about concerns of a war with China.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE, UNITED STATES: When you think about risk from a military perspective, it's all about capacity and intent. That is, what do they have the ability to do and what is it they seek to do, and we're concerned on both fronts.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: More with Secretary Pompeo this morning, on China trade, Huawei, I.P. theft and Chinese consideration of curbing rare Earth exports into the United States.Trade fears hitting markets this morning, and yesterday, big time. Futures pointing toward a selloff at the start of trading this morning, right now, down in the triple digits, after giving up early gains yesterday to finish the day at session lows.Huawei is now taking its fight all the way to court, the Chinese technology giant challenging the constitutionality of the United States limiting sales of its equipment in the country. What this could mean to the ongoing trade battle with China, coming up, right here.And the severe weather continues this morning, devastating tornadoes, touching down in Kansas, flooding and thunderstorms hitting the Midwest and Northeast.Teenage phone use, now a new survey finds phone use does not end at bedtime. Plus, turning sleep into a game, a look at the latest Pokemon app.MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.BARTIROMO: And markets are selling off this morning. Take a look at Futures, indicating a decline of 170 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average this morning, S&P Futures down 18 right now, and the NASDAQ Futures lower by 64 points.That is almost one percent, on top of a selloff yesterday, ending at the lows of the day at 4:00 yesterday, fueled by fears of a trade deal between the United States and China, hitting a stalemate at this point. This is going to be a long march as the President of China said recently.Reuters is reporting China is ready to use rare Earth exports as a bargaining chip in the ongoing dispute. They are threatening not to export these any longer to the United States. These are needed for certain chemicals. It comes as China's latest round of tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods is set to go into effect this Saturday, June 1.The Treasury Department, meanwhile, also declined to label China, a currency manipulator. Though, the Trump administration says it will keep them on a list of countries whose trade surpluses are closely tracked. China technology company, Huawei, now, is looking for a quick overturn of the new law that restricts the company from doing business in the U.S.I sat down for an exclusive interview with the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, yesterday. We covered it all and more. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: What are the implications of no trade deal with China? Do the two largest economies have to have a partnership?POMPEO: You know, we may or may not get a deal. I couldn't tell you the answer to that. Much will turn on whether China is prepared to do what President Trump has asked them to do. It's pretty simple, fair, reciprocal, a set of trading rules that apply to both countries.President Trump is perfectly prepared to allow American companies to compete against Chinese companies. But he's not prepared to allow them to continue to steal our intellectual property, force American businesses to transfer their technology.He's not prepared to allow them to put tariffs on American goods when there aren't any tariffs on their goods coming into our country. I hope that there's a deal. I hope there's an arrangement that will work to the benefit of each our two countries. But if there's not, I'm very convinced the American economy will continue to grow.BARTIROMO: Should we be worried about them lashing out at the United States? I mean, now, we know that China is considering U.S. rare Earth export curbs, these rare Earth -- that are 17 chemical elements used in high tech consumer equipment. There was a story recently the Chinese have taken all their panda bears.I mean, this is sort of, you know, opening up into consumerism and where people can understand what this means, that China may stop the exporting of important chemicals that the U.S. needs.POMPEO: When I -- when I hear these concerns, these worries, I'm always reminded that the American people have lost and suffered for decades under the current rules.So, there's this, somehow, this idea that President Trump's decision to push back against China caused problems for the American economy, when, in fact, the challenges have been the fact that the Chinese were in a trade war with us a long time ago.We're simply trying to get back to fair, to reasonable, to reciprocal, to transparent. That's the President's mission.BARTIROMO: This fight with Huawei is getting worse. The chairman of Huawei, over the weekend, gave an interview, basically saying, I'm not going to take the President's call if he calls me. We don't need the United States. There's real espionage that's going on, isn't there?POMPEO: So, Huawei is an instrument of the Chinese government. They're deeply connected. It's something that's hard for Americans to understand. We would -- our companies cooperate with the United States government, that is, they comply with our laws.But no president directs an American private company. That's very different in China. They just simply operate under a different set of rules.BARTIROMO: Can you talk us through the massive risks that exist today, in terms of China and the U.S.' national security?POMPEO: When you -- when you think about risk, from a military perspective, it's all about capacity and intent. That is, what do they have the ability to do and what is it they seek to do. And we're concerned on both fronts. We've watched President Xi make commitment that said he wouldn't go to the South China Sea and build out militarily, and yet, he's done so.We've watched them engage in a very significant arms build-up, not only in the quantity of arms, but in their (INAUDIBLE) their capability and their capacity. And so, on both fronts, it's something that Americans need to make sure that we do all we can to ensure that we stand a posture where we can deter these threats so that we don't ever have to send our soldiers, sailors, and marines to a war.I can't imagine that happening again amongst these two super powers. It's our job in the State Department to make sure we never put America in that position.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: More of my exclusive interview this morning with the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, beginning at 7:00 a.m. Eastern. Join us for the entire interview at that time. Be sure to tune, right here, on Friday, when I sit down exclusively with the vice president, Mike Pence, to talk more about China as well as USMCA, Canada and Mexico.Meanwhile, U.S. crude stockpiles climbing at their quickest pace since 2016, fueling fresh volatility in the oil market this morning. Dagen McDowell is on that this morning. Good morning, Dagen.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. Rising inventories of crude oil, this is despite concerns about production coming out of Venezuela. The tensions with Iran, rising inventories have powered an 11 percent drop in crude oil prices since they hit a nearly 6-month high in late April.U.S. stockpiles alone are up 8 percent in the first 4-1/2 months of this year. You mentioned 2016, how stockpiles are climbing at the quickest pace since going back to that date. Well, back then, there was such a build in supplies of oil, the cost of crude dipped below $27.00 a barrel back then.Take a look at where it's trading now. It closed at a little above $59.00 a barrel. We don't expect to see that kind of a price decline. Nevertheless, this is good news for drivers. If you take a look at gasoline prices in the United States, $2.82 a gallon is the national average for regular unleaded. That is lower than it was a year ago, but it was close to $3.00.But don't expect much more of a drop in gasoline prices. One of the problems is, there's a big build-up in crude supplies because the pipelines are in the United States, getting that crude to the refineries, are backed up. We don't have enough pipeline supply.So, you will see a drop in crude, maybe not such a decline beyond what we've already seen in gasoline prices, Maria, back to you.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll watch that, see you in a bit, Dagen, thank you so much.Meanwhile, Kansas is declaring a tornado emergency this morning. Cheryl Casone with headlines on that right now, Cheryl, good morning.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, Maria, good morning. It's been quite a night there. A large tornado touched down near Kansas City, Kansas. It's injured at least a dozen people. President Trump has approved a disaster declaration in Kansas, following that tornado as well as major flooding throughout the state.Dozens of homes east of Lawrence, Kansas, have been damaged. Kansas City international airport temporarily closed due to debris from the storm and passengers had to be moved to shelters from there.Well, a network outage causing flight cancellations and delays at Air Canada. The airline says its systems are starting to come back online following these problems, which began last night, Air Canada planning to add more flights or larger aircrafts (INAUDIBLE) today, to handle the backlog of passengers that are stranded.Boeing's 737 Max could remain grounded for another two months, maybe longer. The airline industry's largest trade group, the International Air Transport Association, says that airlines are bracing for 10 to 12 more weeks of delays before the plane can resume commercial service.Boeing's been working to fix the flight control flaw that was implicated in two deadly crashes, but they haven't submitted a formal submission to the FAA and, of course, that process for approval through the FAA, considering what has transpired between Boeing and the FAA, Maria, is going to be where this delay could really kick in.BARTIROMO: All right. Thank you, Cheryl. We will watch that. Quick break, and then markets are selling off this morning, investors are watching potential recession risks as bonds dip lower, yields continue to fall.Then, Fiat Chrysler's proposal to merge with Renault, presented to Nissan, what that means for the Japanese automaker, coming up. The stock is down two percent on Fiat this morning, markets down in the triple digit, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, big show this morning, coming up, my exclusive interview with Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, this morning, as we take a look at the national security issues around the China story. Anheuser- Busch North America CEO Michel Doukeris is here, talking about the impact on business.Great America PAC Chairman Ed Rollins joining us this morning, along with FOX News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano. Also with us is Dr. Mikhail Varshavski, a.k.a Dr. Mike. Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big 2-1/2 hours coming up right here.We want to turn to a possible major auto merger, Fiat Chrysler's proposal to merge with Renault was presented to Nissan today, in Japan, adding to the uncertainties facing the Japanese automaker, the possible tie-up stoking fears at Nissan that a deal could further weaken its position in their 20-year alliance with Renault.Joining the conversation this morning, to get his take is Former Chrysler CEO and Former Home Depot CEO, Bob Nardelli, right here, in studio, along with RealClearPolitics Co-Founder and President, Tom Bevan, Dagen, great to see you this morning, and thank you for joining us, everybody.First, I want to get your -- I want to get your take on this multiyear lows for bond yields. We've got to talk about that, but Bob, your reaction, in terms of this potential deal with Fiat and now, Renault?BOB NARDELLI, FORMER CHRYSLER CEO: Yes. Well, it's interesting, you know, the Fiat tie-up with Chrysler has really been somewhat of a disaster for all the things that they projected would happen are not. I mean, the small cars never did sell here. Chrysler had to buy emissions credits from Tesla a few months ago to be able to sell Fiat into the European market.So tying up with Renault, I mean, the one advantage would be, you know, I saw where the government's going to back down and take away voting rights. That's always an issue in France from my experience. They're going to have to create a manufacturing counsel as Carlos did with Nissan and Renault, where you can bundle all of the procurement side to get the volume leverage.So, I'm a little -- I'm a little jaundiced on the thing. You're going to have to deal with dealers, you know, how do you get Renault back into the U.S. dealership market? So, I think -- and the other thing I was disappointed to read where maybe Mike Manley would be pushed out of his CEO position. He's a great young man, doing a great job.If you think about Chrysler Jeep and the Dodge Ram, it's 80 percent of the operating profits today. So, I'm not sure a tie-up with Renault is that good a deal.BARTIROMO: So the Dodge Ram is really the jewel of the business then?NARDELLI: Well, the Jeep is number one SUV around the world.BARTIROMO: Yes.NARDELLI: I mean, it's an iconic brand. People love it. They're proud of it. Between that and the Ram 1500, you know, that's generating most of the profits.BARTIROMO: I see.NARDELLI: I'm not sure if Chrysler didn't bail Fiat out, where they would be today. I mean, they're desperate for a lock-up.BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, what does this mean for Nissan? Because Nissan was also, you know, is part of the alliance with Renault and with Mitsubishi, and Nissan was already facing serious upset and weakening positions.According to Carlos Ghosn, who told me, after he was released from prison, that the reason that they took him out in this coup to take him out was because they were afraid that he was going to cut jobs, cut his underling and that's why they were so upset about Carlos Ghosn being in charge, because Nissan was so weak, is what Carlos Ghosn said.NARDELLI: Well, I think Nissan is slightly better positioned than Renault, and that they have dealerships here. They have a good brand, a good quality brand established. I think the consolidation certainly would help, legitimately, on the technology side that we talk about, as we go to (INAUDIBLE) and some of the other advanced technologies, the autonomous car.So, any time you can bundle the research -- right now, everybody is doing their own. You pull that together, you get favorable leverage. You know, you get productivity. But operationally, pulling all that together -- don't forget, we didn't mention Mitsubishi also.BARTIROMO: Right.NARDELLI: So, it really becomes -- you know, they're talking a lot about being the third largest car manufacturer, production-wise. But I think you ought to focus on productivity and profitability.BARTIROMO: Yes. I would say so. By the way, there are also cuts to report at General Motor -- General Electric, pardon me, G.E. cutting jobs, announcing a plan to cut more than 1,000 jobs in France. The French finance minister says he will fight this move. The stock is now at 9.28, down almost another 1 percent this morning, long-time G.E. yourself.NARDELLI: My proof positive comment about tying up with the French. And, you know, they cut that deal where their guaranteed jobs. There was a penalty for not creating the jobs, there's going to be a penalty for eliminating job. But I don't think Larry doesn't have really an option here.He's got to he's got to continue to resize General Electric towards profitability. You know, he announced at the last conference he's still about $100 billion of debt. He still has an unfunded pension, close to $30 billion. So he's got to continue to shrink, to be able to generate cash, to be able to keep the company alive. They're burning about $2 billion just on the power system side.BARTIROMO: And it's an environment where the global story seems to be slowing down, at least that's what yields might be telling us this morning, Dagen. Once again, we see record lows for bond yields across the world, not just the U.S.MCDOWELL: Right. Let's look at Germany, just yesterday, the 10-year German bond fell into further negative territory on the yield. And we have to think about it in terms of this, that you have to pay Germany to loan that money. You don't get paid for loaning Germany, money. That's how crazy the world is.lowest closing level on the German bond yield since July 2016, that weakening further this morning, U.S. Treasury yields on the 10-year, closing yesterday at 2.268. Again, a further drop in those yields overnight, to 2.24 percent. That's significant. We'll see where it trades during the day as trading opens up here.But again, that takes the 10-year yield below where the Fed funds rate is, between two and a quarter and two and a half percent. It's already trading below the three-month yield here in the United States. That was further weakening yesterday, the three-month Treasury bill.But again, this is sending the signal, it's the trade war with China but it's also some weak economic data that we've gotten in the last few weeks here in the United States, whether there was retail sales, factory output, the durable goods orders for nondefense capital equipment, were down almost one percent, nine-tenths of a percent last week. We've got that on Friday.So, across the board, people are -- again, it's what was going on at the end of the year, last year. People are questioning whether this incredible economic run that we've had, for a decade, might be coming to an end.BARTIROMO: Well, we have the GDP in the first quarter up 3.2 percent. We'll get another revision this Thursday when we get the GDP number out (INAUDIBLE) window into what's going on, in fact. Even though some people say that's backward looking, we will get the window into whether or not things have slowed from that three and a quarter percent growth.MCDOWELL: But in the first quarter, if you looked at the earnings reports, the capital spending that we found out from major U.S. corporations, only grew at three percent. It was still growing. But that was off a 20 percent growth rate a year ago. So, there's a lot that's piling up that's causing concern and it's showing up in these bond yields.NARDELLI: I think you're starting to see a separation, Maria, consumer confidence was still strong.MCDOWELL: Right.NARDELLI: But Dagen is correct. I think my colleagues are starting to get a little bit concerned and a pullback on capital, Tom.TOM BEVAN, CO-FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, REALCLEARPOLITICS: Yes. I mean, it definitely seems like some of the data we've seen, the headwinds are building, and that is -- again, I look at all this stuff through the lens of politics, in the middle of a presidential campaign, that is not necessarily good news for Donald Trump.MCDOWELL: Well, expect President Trump to call on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates which you've heard from him before. But now, the bond market is telling the Fed it might be time to cut.BARTIROMO: And that's why Larry Kudlow has been saying it for a couple months now, he wants a cut in rates. We'll see. Coming up, confronting Iran, National Security Adviser John Bolton is calling out Tehran this morning, what he's saying today, then, saving very early for college, babies born today, in Vermont, getting a boost, the story when we come back. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets are lower this morning. Take a look. The Futures, indicating a decline at the start of trading of 158 points, on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, that's two-thirds of one percent, S&P Futures down 17 right now, and the NASDAQ Futures lower by 61.Worries about the U.S. and China and the stalemate right now, the next meeting that could happen is at the G20, between the President and President Xi-Jinping. We've got Mike Pompeo coming up, talking more about that.Headlines across America this morning, the Boston Globe reports Wynn Resorts will not appeal gaming commission's $35 million-dollar fine. Wynn Resorts says that it will not fight the Massachusetts Gaming Commission decision, to fine the gambling giant, while also noting that the company disagrees with the fining, that its chief executive violated company policy.The L.A. Times this morning, writes Lakers' story gets crazier with new details, and harder to sell to free agents, gaping cracks to the Lakers Foundation prompting questions about the organization's credibility and dramatically changing the conversation about who wants to play for the franchise. Internal problems, apparently, expected to haunt the team during the upcoming free agent season.And the Brattleboro reformer, this morning, says that Brattleboro Memorial Hospital will participate in 529 days, and very lucky babies born today, May 29th, at Brattleboro Memorial Hospital, will receive $100 deposits into Vermont 529 college savings accounts to jumpstart their path to higher education. Good idea. Who wouldn't want the money into the 529 account when you're born?MCDOWELL: Start saving young.BEVAN: Exactly. How much is college going to cost when they turn 18?BARTIROMO: Yes, good point. All right, we'll take a short break. When we come back, Treasury yields are declining this morning. Investors are watching bonds as recession fears are creeping in, the yield on the 10-year now down to 2.23 percent this morning, the market risks and the impact, coming up.And get comfortable, Netflix is offering enough content to keep you on that couch for years, literally. Wait until you hear all their content, right now, at Netflix. The stock is down this morning going into the day, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, May 29th, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.U.S.-China trade turmoil, once again, impacting markets. China is now threatening to cut off rare earth minerals going into the United States.I sat down yesterday for an exclusive one-on-one interview with Secretary Mike Pompeo to talk of a possible trade deal.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)POMPEO: I hope that there is a deal. I hope there's an arrangement that will work to the benefit of each of our two countries. But if there's not, I'm very convinced the American economy will continue to grow.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Secretary Pompeo, once again said that Huawei is an instrument of the Chinese government as the technology giant files new legal action to block the U.S. ban. Don't miss my full interview coming up with the secretary in the next hour, right here.Trade fears, we will are hitting Futures once again. We've got a market that is expected to open down in the triple digits. Dow futures now down 156 points that's two-thirds of one percent.S&P futures down 16. And the Nasdaq futures lowered by 60 points. It's almost one percent. On top of yesterday's losses, we had a pretty good rally earlier in the day but the markets gave up early all of the early gains and ended the day lower by 237 points. That was one percent.S&P was down 24 points and the Nasdaq was down 30 points, it's a third of a percent. In Europe this morning, similar story. Take a look, FT-100 is down 1-1/4 percent, 94 points. The CAC Quarante in Paris is down 84, 1-2/3 percent. And the DAX index in Germany lower by 138 points that's better than one percent.In Asia overnight, take a look at the markets. Japan was down 1-1/4 percent as was Korea. As you can -- as you can see, those two hit the hardest on the heels of the sell-off on Wall Street.The Iran crisis now, U.S. is claiming Iran was behind the recent attacks on the oil tankers. This is Facebook and Twitter. Removing accounts associated with Iran length misinformation. Jack Keane talked to us yesterday about this that in fact, yes, Iran was behind that upset.Plus, Twitter in chief, the social media giant is looking for somebody to be its face of its platform. The stock is down this morning by three- quarters of a percent.Teenage phone use. The startling new survey on phone use during the middle of the night. Plus, Pokemon is turning sleep into a game. We've got all those stories coming up this morning.But first, our top story this half an hour, markets are in focus. Government bond yields, dipping near multi-year lows yesterday due in part to growing concerns about slowing economic growth. We showed you earlier, bonds from the U.S. all the way to Germany are dropping like a rock.Joining us right now, as you see the 10-year is at 2.24 percent. Joining us now to talk more about all of that is Russell Investment's senior portfolio manager Kevin Divney. And Kevin, it's good to have you on the program.KEVIN DIVNEY, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, RUSSELL INVESTMENTS: Good morning.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us. Are you worried about this drop in yields? What's your take on the interest rate movement?DIVNEY: The interest rates are reflecting I think global deceleration of flight to quality, and a lot of capital is moving out of the European markets, and there's fear in Asia. The U.S. is still looking pretty strong. I think there's some technical measures here, where bond yields don't reflect everything that they used to because of flows and money going into there.Also, there's a bit of a rotation trade, people taking money out of equities after a tremendous Q1. At the same time, we don't see inflationary pressures on the -- on the other side of the coin. And the markets pricing and sort of this 50/50 what the feds going to do this year.BARTIROMO: Yes, but you said that the U.S. is hanging on and doing well. Dagen reported at the top of the show about some of these data points that have actually come in we could then expect. It was really CapEx that was troublesome, three percent from 20 percent.MCDOWELL: Factory output has been in decline, this year is been weak. Its capital spending, it is also retail sales, some of the retail earnings last week were not good, and you can -- the people like to attribute that to the computer chain by chain. But overall, retail sales were weak in the most recent month as well.Consumer confidence as Bob pointed out was the highest level it's been since October, but nevertheless. And again, you talk about flows, what money flows into treasuries usually, because people are looking for a haven from turmoil. So, it's the reason behind the flows that's concerning.DIVNEY: When you look at the macroeconomic data when you parse it and deconstruct it, it's really because of exposure to Europe and China. And you see, and the stocks are behaving that well as the same as well. Is that stocks with the U.S. exposure primarily, service companies without as much Chinese exposure and doing well, and the deceleration we're seeing as some of the macro data could just be, I don't think it's a trend yet.The manufacturing data in Europe was much, much worse that's going on here. But consumer confidence is still very, very high. And in the retail sector, it's a little tough because there's a lot of creative destruction going on for what's happening there. At the same time, we've had great retail run fundamentally for the past six or eight months.I don't hear CEOs being very concerned about their consumer, you see average tickets going up. And you still see spend, and there's also -- there's CapEx in that area, and there's a reformulation of the business model. This omnichannel marketing and things like that.So, when you're going from stores to Internet, there's the CapEx piece that's going on there. Also CapEx, a depreciation is still kind of in a low when you look at the aggregate S&P. So, I think it's really cause for concern that business is slowing. It's adjusting to not as rapid growth we had from the tail end from the fiscal stimulus from the -- to that tax cuts.BARTIROMO: So, what would you do then? Do you want to put new money to work in stocks right here?DIVNEY: Right now, we're looking at is rotating. So, we took a little money off the table, places like tech. I mean tech is up a lot this year. The consumer cyclical area, we were very much overweight going into the year, we see some strength there pulling back on that. Not getting too defensive, it's more trying to be down the middle because you have these barbell macroeconomic things.The Chinese thing is out there. We think its three phases to look at in. The short term is volatility. This administration does everything out in the open. There's not a collective meeting and then an anti-climax with the press conference. This is every, every moment, every degree of negotiation is out there in the market's pricing that in.Phase two, if it comes out a negative outcome, it's supply chain adjustment. I've heard CEOs say, they'll just adjust their supply chain, they can do that. Bangladesh, Vietnam, other places. And China was already not becoming the best source of cheap labor.The third phase, the long term phase where we think it's an opportunity if you hold pad is that if the negotiations to go where this administration wants, the Chinese economy is a larger addressable market for U.S. companies. And use -- a lot of U.S. companies don't have competitors on the ground in China. Especially in tech, and healthcare devices and other areas where they could be a market leader in an economy where disposable income is just going to keep on going up.BEVAN: So, the clip that Maria played at the top of the segment here, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, says he believes the U.S. economy will continue to grow even if there's no deal with China. Do you agree with that?DIVNEY: Yes, I think we can. I think there'll be an adjustment to that, there's a disruption. And you just see companies will adapt. I've heard CEOs say we'll just change our supply chain.Listening at different investor conferences recently, I'm actually -- people have asked me, the tariffs and the trade is about five percent of the conversation. And it's more about how we going to spend? How we going to grow? Where our customers?NARDELLI: Yes, the tariffs on the imports are not as significant as the medium makes to them. I think it's the certainty of uncertainty that's creating that froth out there. But wouldn't you agree -- I mean the consumer confidence is up.I do think the CEOs are a little more watchful, a little more of a jaundiced eye. They don't want to over-capacitize, you know, with heavy CapEx. So, the recent survey said, they're not as concerned about a major recession but they are a little more cautious of it. Is that -- is that what you're hearing out there also?DIVNEY: Yes, one thing their largest concern is generally find -- finding good people. So, as long as that stays at the top of surveys. And when you look at it, the biggest sectors exposed obviously, transportation is our biggest exporter to China. Agriculture and tech. And the market is pricing this all across or it's only -- I mean, it's three percent of GDP is the trade with China -- imports and exports. And then you have very localized sectors but it tends to spread across the whole market.So, I think the -- what you were saying, Bob was also why guidance was so depressed going into last quarter?NARDELLI: Yes.DIVNEY: You know having sat the chair, you don't want to -- you don't want to disappoint, you want to exceed expectations. So, I think the revisions going down were alter conservative. And it makes sense if you're a CEO because you have these unknown -- the things that either end.So, why not be a little conservative? So, I would expect earnings are going to beat expectations a little more going into the rest of the year. And we saw companies that we're beating, we're getting rewarded more after Q1 earnings, which hadn't been the case for the past (INAUDIBLE).NARDELLI: It's quite a mix. I mean, it was -- if you overcome it under- deliver, you get whacked. And if you pull back and a little more conservative manner, you get a whack. So, it's -- you know, I think it's a horse of peace, right? And that's what we -- I agree with you on the last earnings call. We saw some companies pull back on the retail side to be a little more cautious.DIVNEY: Sure. And the top line is still looking very robust.NARDELLI: Yes.DIVNEY: That's not decelerated as earnings did. And the big story -- the most important story, we still are looking at double-digit margins. There was not real guidance down on that for the S&P 500. They're double what they were 15 years ago. And so, we're at this sort of secular trend for margins. Part of that is economic mix, part of that is tech driving that. But that to me would be the warning sign if there's big guidance. The other stuff in between is adjusting and competitive pressure.BARTIROMO: Even as labor costs are going up, wages up 3-1/4 percent year- over-year?DIVNEY: So, the three things that we're looking at is, and I heard to some CEOs a couple of weeks ago talk about this in the consumer staples sector. So, you see wages going up and input prices going up. Wages are going up the most.Looking at productivity, there has been signs that productivity is going up. It's not as high as it should be, but if you're paying more and you're getting more out of it, that's that -- that's a good equation.But what I was surprised at, is lot of companies are talking about pricing power. It -- in basic commoditized sectors, they're not having to be as promotional as they normally would. This feels like a mid-cycle area when it comes to that. So, if you have pricing power that can --that can offset some of this wage pressure.BARTIROMO: Well, they better because they're probably going to have to pay more because of the tariffs and their retaliatory tariffs.NARDELLI: Yes, they said that most CEOs, Maria, said they can handle a 10 percent through price increase through negotiations with the supplier and productivity. But I think you get to 20-25 percent, they get a little more nervous. And it's not as easy as it's being said that you just move your supply chain. You know, particularly, in the high tech stuff --(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: I've been saying that. When people -- when people come on T.V., with all due respect, and say, "Companies are just going to move their supply chain, I'm like -- maybe if this goes on for another five years.NARDELLI: Because we were --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Because it's not so easy to go from China --MCDOWELL: I get, and there's expertise in China from --NARDELLI: Exactly.MCDOWELL: There's manufacturing expertise in a lot of these areas that they can't find in India, or Vietnam, or other Southeast Asian nations.NARDELLI: Yes. Let's understand how we got there, right? We were not competitive as a nation when you think about taxes and everything else. So, we had to move offshore. It wasn't an outsourcing, it was a global competitive strategy.DIVNEY: Right, right. And I think the supply chain, the reason I bring that up is when this --when the panic comes on, and volatility goes to 25, and we're down 400 points, there is an -- there is an adaptive mechanism, it is long-term. That's why we're looking at the supply chain as a medium- term sort of a two to five year.When a company commits to that, it's they're moving to that. And then it becomes a sort of permanent capital base as we have had with China. But it's not what's -- but there are options, they are --(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: I've talked to a lot of small business owners who are just getting their businesses in the United States off the ground. And they make their products or they source a lot of their supplies from China, and they are getting -- right now. And they're very upset about it.BARTIROMO: Well, we'll see. This is -- this is not going away anytime soon. We got both sides digging in. So, Kevin, we will watch this market. Certainly, you're still a believer in the U.S. That's --DIVNEY: Yes, I am.NARDELI: Stay strong, Kevin. Stay strong.BARTIROMO: Good to see you. Thank you so much. Kevin Divney, joining us there. We want to turn to the escalating Iran crisis. The national security adviser accusing Iran of sabotaging Saudi oil tankers. Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines this morning. Cheryl, good morning to you.CASONE: Yes, that's right, Maria. National Security Adviser John Bolton is claiming that the recent sabotage off the coast of the United Arab Emirates came from naval mines that are placed "almost certainly by Iran."Now, Bolton made the charge in Abu Dhabi ahead of today's security meeting with regional allies of the U.S. Now, Iran is denying any involvement. But Facebook and Twitter are now saying that they have removed Iran linked accounts that were spreading this information -- pro-Iranian information, basically, throughout the United States.And then let's stay with Twitter because there's a job open you might be interested. Tweeter in Chief. According to the job posting, the person will be in charge of promoting the social network on its own platform.Now, this requires setting editorial direction for the site, and also leading the company's community managers. They say they're pretty flexible about where the Tweeter in Chief wants to be located, anyway.And then there's one more I got this (INAUDIBLE) good story, Maria. Couch potatoes that have Netflix get real comfortable right now. It could take you nearly four years non-stop to binge watch all of the content that Netflix has on its site.According to Ampere Analysis, Netflix has 32,600 hours of movies and television shows. The closest competitor in a distant second is Amazon Prime Video that's clocking in more than 22,000 hours. Should I just retire now and never leave my apartment? Maybe I should.BARTIROMO: Yes, you know what, when I hear that story, I think, peak. That's it. With I mean, does it get any better than this in terms for content?CASONE: Well, ask yourself about Disney, and about Hulu.BARTIROMO: You're right.CASONE: I only mentioned two sites just now, there's a bunch more coming.BARTIROMO: Well, that's what I'm saying, there's so much content out there. I'm wondering if we could all actually watch all of this content. That's what I'm saying, peak.MCDOWELL: You don't -- you don't want to because it's garbage.BARTIROMO: A lot of it is.MCDOWELL: Most of the stuff on Netflix is garbage.BARTIROMO: Really?MCDOWELL: Yes. It is just awful.BARTIROMO: But you just have been able to pick out the jewels.MCDOWELL: Yes, Ozark, Narcos, are two of the great shows. Any of the original Netflix content is pretty good but the -- some -- a lot of it is just gas --(CROSSTALK)NARDELLI: Dagen is a very sophisticated selector of content.MCDOWELL: No, I am -- I am as down-home as it gets but nobody has time for garbage content anymore.BARTIROMO: Exactly. That's exactly.MCDOWELL: And Netflix is in abundance of it.BARTIROMO: Where -- it's a peak.NARDELLI: The competition is great though to your point. I mean Amazon's coming. (INAUDIBLE) is coming.BARTIROMO: Yes, Amazon is coming, Disney is coming.NARDELLI: They're all buying their content back from Netflix.BARTIROMO: Yes.NARDELLI: Marvel, all of the shows. France --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: It's about to get real competitive for Netflix.NARDELLI: Yes, yes.BARTIROMO: Are they going to be able to keep raising prices? I don't know.MCDOWELL: And better get the interface right, too. Because the interface on Hulu, for example, is terrible. Again, it's about how easy can you use it, let me find -- let me find what I'm looking for.BARTIROMO: Peak. Coming up, investigating the investigators. Former Trump campaign aide, Carter Page, detailing contact with an FBI informant. Saying, it was much more extensive than previously reported.Plus, a troubling trying to startling new study on teens checking their phones in the middle of the night, just like their parents. The eye- opening numbers we are addicted to these phones. All that coming up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Now, investigating the investigators. Former Trump Campaign Aide Carter Page says his contact with an FBI informant during the Russia probe was a lot more extensive than previously reports. This coming after the president's decision to declassify key documents related to the investigation. I recently sat down with Page and asked him about the declassification of that FISA warrant.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: This is the FISA warrant.CARTER PAGE, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN AIDE: FISA warrant --BARTIROMO: And this is what people want the president to declassify. Look at all this. It's all blacked out. So, they want the president to declassify this, so that we could know exactly what was in the FISA warrant. How did they get a warrant to wiretap you?PAGE: Look, I think I talked to George Papadopoulos maybe, you know, a couple of times. I can't even remember. You know, we had a big team of foreign policy experts we were working with. To the extent under these many pages they have stuff related to these crazy things that they were pulling with him and others.BARTIROMO: Right.PAGE: You know, if all these black lines relate to that stuff, it is just the ultimate scandal. You know, I had basically no interaction with him.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, him being former British spy, Christopher Steele. He reportedly will not talk to the prosecutor assigned to examine the origins of the Russia investigation, that's John Durham. Christopher Steele says he's not going to talk to him. Joining me right now is the Washington Examiner Commentary Writer and Editor Siraj Hashmi. Siraj, good to see you this morning.SIRAJ HASHMI, COMMENTARY WRITER, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Good to see you too, Maria.BARTIROMO: Why won't Christopher Steele talk with John Durham, do you think? I mean, obviously, John Durham is going to get to the bottom of it. Why they got warrants to wiretap Carter Page and George Papadopoulos, we believe? And George Papadopoulos was on this program telling us about all these informants that were thrown at him, FBI informants from Australia, London, the U.K., as well as the U.S.HASHMI: The answer seems pretty simple here. Christopher Steele probably would fall into, say, a perjury trap or even obstruction of justice trap if he speaks to the DOJ. Because a lot of information within the Steele dossier was uncorroborated and fabricated and there's a lot of information that he probably will say that will probably put him in legal jeopardy.BARTIROMO: So, Siraj, do you think we're going to see accountability here?HASHMI: That's a very good question, Maria. Because there's been a lot of heavy lifting from former Obama administration officials, a lot of House and Senate Democrats, to push this narrative that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government. And we're seeing right now these congressional investigations from the House Judiciary Committee, the House Intelligence Committee, looking at where, you know, the Trump campaign stood on all of this. At the same time, the DOJ looking into how the Trump campaign collusion with Russia started, it's all about where -- it's two different Americas we're living in right now.BARTIROMO: How far up the chain do you think this goes? Do you think President Obama directed all of this?HASHMI: That's really tough to say. It's possible that there was some plausible deniability here. But it's the -- a big irony here is that, Democrats seem to want to get down to the bottom of it but they're not telling the whole story.BARTIROMO: Right. Siraj, good to have you. Thanks so much. Siraj Hashmi, there.HASHMI: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Coming up, go to sleep, teens. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. So, we know that teens can't put their phones down but many adults cannot either. A new survey finds that smartphone use extends far past bedtime. Lauren Simonetti with all the details this morning. Good morning, Lauren.SIMONETTI: Do as I say, not as I do is essentially the message that parents are giving their teenagers. We have new numbers from Common Sense Media, and they show for people who sleep with their phones. 29 percent of teenagers -- for parents, it's not so bad, only 12 percent. But let's flip the screen and show this. For those that wake up in the middle of the night to check their devices, a quarter of parents, over a third of teenagers. This is a major-problems when you have buzz words in Silicon Valley about digital well-being.Is enough being done if we're interrupting, especially for children and teenagers that healthy sleeping habit by waking up when you should be resting to check your phone, particularly if it's for social media? And some researchers are also beginning to make this link between sleep deprivation as a potential cause between anxiety and depression in teenagers. We were saying, oh, it's social media, it's that fear of missing out, but maybe it's because we're waking up in the middle of the night to check our phones, and it's a sleep deprivation that could be causing depression.BARTIROMO: That's why they say you shouldn't really sleep with your phone next to you.SIMONETTI: Can you believe that many people are doing it?BARTIROMO: Put that in another room.SIMONETTI: Put it in another room.MCDOWELL: I can't help it. I'm worried about --BARTIROMO: What do you do every night?MCDOWELL: I wake up in the middle of the night several times and look at my phone.BARTIROMO: You do.MCDOWELL: To check the time. But I'm worried about over-sleeping because of the 2:00 a.m. wake-up call. So, part of it because --BARTIROMO: I sleep with my phone next to me too.MCDOWELL: Right, it's the anxiety.SIMONETTI: See, do as I say, not as I do.KEVIN KELLY, CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK INVESTMENTS: I think most people -- I certainly do this, this is my alarm clock too.BARTIROMO: Right, that's another thing -- it's the alarm clock.NARDELLI: Yes, but it's one thing to use it as an alarm. It's another when it's right there and you're checking it throughout the night, which I can attest, I have a wife that does that.SIMONETTI: Do you see the light in the middle of a night.NARDELLI: Yes, yes.BARTIROMO: Of course.SIMONETTI: Real quick, Pokemon Go is now coming up with Pokemon Sleep and you sleep with that device on your pillow.BARTIROMO: Wow! All right, good stuff, Lauren, thank you. My exclusive interview with Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State, coming up next hour right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Stay with us.Load-Date: May 30, 2019End of Document

Congress Wants to 'Chop Off' China's 5G 'Tentacles'InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.May 16, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Distributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWSLength: 818 wordsByline: Kate Patrick, InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.BodyMay 16--     May 16--Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) wants to "chop off" the "tentacles" of what he calls China's strategy to infiltrate U.S. 5G infrastructure -- but 5G and national security experts say that's much easier said than done.At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday discussing 5G and national security concerns, senators repeated their alarm over Chinese companies providing equipment for U.S. 5G efforts, while witnesses tried to explain that some U.S. telecom companies may not have other options.At the epicenter of their concerns is the Chinese telecom equipment provider, Huawei, considered a leader in the race to 5G. Many national security and tech experts believe Huawei's technology is purposefully designed to allow access by the Chinese government, raising national security concerns. Last year, the Pentagon banned the sale of mobile phones made by Huawei on military bases.Despite these concerns, many European countries plan to use Huawei infrastructure to deploy 5G. On Wednesday, President Trump issued an executive order banning American telecom companies from installing foreign-made equipment that could pose a threat to national security."This administration will do what it takes to keep America safe and prosperous and to protect America from foreign adversaries," White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement.While the Big Four telecom companies AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon do not use Huawei equipment, small telecom companies do, because Huawei equipment is so cheap. Telecom is a capex-heavy industry, so for small businesses, there isn't much wiggle room in the profit margins.In other words, a Huawei ban could help further consolidate telecom and dampen competition by hurting the small companies.At the hearing Tuesday, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said no one should use Huawei for economic reasons given the cybersecurity risk."Even if there were an economic advantage, it is outweighed by the security threat," he said.Christopher Krebs, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency at the Department of Homeland Security, told Blumenthal that if the federal government wants to tell telecom companies not to use Huawei, then telecom companies need more vendor options.He called 5G a "global supply chain challenge," mainly because there are only three vendors for wireless infrastructure: Ericcson, Huawei and Nokia."I think the concern is, some of our partners may not have alternative economic options," he said. "We've got to continue to push supply and also give them alternative options. There are only so many vendors available with so many financing options."Robert Strayer, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Cyber and International Communications and Information Policy at the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs for the Department of State, said the U.S. should opt for a gradual approach to improving cybersecurity and infrastructure integrity for 5G."We're not asking [telecom companies] to rip it out of the ground today, we're saying, find a pathway to make yourselves secure [economically and for national security]," he told senators at the Tuesday hearing.Krebs added that the U.S. won't necessarily "fall behind" in the 5G race by not using Huawei equipment because Huawei equipment isn't very high quality."You have to look at the total life-cycle cost," he said. "The quality of the products is not great, the existence of vulnerabilities...the ability to understand what's happening on the network is just not there."But none of the witnesses provided a solution to the problem of addressing national security concerns while also encouraging competition and innovation in an already heavily-consolidated telecom industry, other than gradually weaning U.S. companies off Chinese equipment providers and investing in research and development."This is the new cybersecurity, supply chain risk management," Krebs said.Peter Harrell, adjunct senior fellow at the Center for New American Security, told senators near the end of the hearing that "transitioning supply chains can take significant time," and Trump's trade war isn't helping. To adequately address 5G concerns, then, may require a significant policy shift in the administration."The U.S. will not benefit if China retaliates for the latest tariffs by further discriminating against U.S. companies that make key 5G technologies and sell them into the Chinese market, and China has announced plans to retaliate for President Trump's tariff hike," Harrell said. "The Trump Administration needs to tread cautiously in its just-announced tariff hikes on Chinese-made goods to avoid inadvertently impacting other U.S. goals, including U.S. goals related to 5G."Follow Kate on Twitter___ (c)2019 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

China's Mobile Market 2019-2025: Infrastructure, Broadband, Operators -- China is Predicted to Account for More Than Two-Thirds of All 5G Connections by 2025 - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireJune 19, 2019 Wednesday 5:19 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 853 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "China - Mobile Infrastructure, Broadband, Operators - Statistics and Analyses" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.Although China boasts the largest mobile market in the world, there is still much room for growth given the focus on large scale mobile broadband investment.Mobile subscriber growth is expected to be slower due to a saturated and mature market over the next five years to 2023. Operators will continue to focus on increasing ARPU in light of diminishing opportunities to acquire new subscribers and the need for operators to maximise monetization of 4G and 5G investments.In the short term the need to adequately serve subscribers based on handset type influences the allocation of limited radio frequency resources between the three technology platforms. In the medium to long term the need to maximise revenue is driving strategies encouraging subscribers to migrate to higher paying 4G and 5G products based on mobile broadband.Operators are also investing in technologies design to maximise the user experience such as Rich Communication Service (RCS), Voice over LTE (VoLTE) and Near Field Communications (NFC).Under the government's current plans for 5G development, the new technology will see pre-commercial use in 2019 with a full commercial launch to take place in 2020.Mobile broadband has seen very strong growth in China over the past five years. Proliferation of LTE and improving affordability of smartphones is driving growth both in mobile broadband subscribers as well as the amount of traffic used per subscriber. This strong growth is expected to continue over the next five years to 2023 but at an increasing slower grow rate due to a fast maturing market. The mobile broadband market will be driven by increasingly faster speeds offered by the mobile operators as they roll out their 4G and 5G networks and improving tariffs due to strong competition.China has emerged as one of the most aggressive countries promoting 5G and is projected to become the world's largest 5G market by 2025, as networks are rolled out in urban areas and handset vendors integrate 5G chipsets into mobile devices. China is predicted to account for more than two-thirds of all 5G connections by 2025. The Chinese government is a major driving force behind the country's adoption of IoT with plans such as the Made in China 2025 strategy.

What did Huawei do to land in such hot water with the US?CNN WireMay 21, 2019 Tuesday 12:16 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1046 wordsByline: By David Goldman, CNN BusinessDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  Huawei has endured a tenuous relationship with the United States for a decade, reaching a boiling point last week when the Trump administration banned American corporations from doing business with the Chinese company.Although the United States has long suspected Huawei of engaging in illegal activity, it's not clear that Huawei did anything specific recently to become the object of such concern. The ban came as something of a surprise to observers. The Trump administration temporarily eased up --- just a bit --- on its restrictions Monday. But the reprieve was narrow and aimed at a small group of rural American network providers that use Huawei equipment. For Huawei and most American companies, the ban remains firmly in place.What landed Huawei in such hot water with US officials?The US-China trade warThe United States and China have been embroiled in a bitter trade war for more than a year, and Huawei has been stuck in the middle of it.Huawei could serve as an enormous bargaining chip: It is a gigantic Chinese telecommunications company with ambitions to become the world's No. 1 smartphone maker and one of a small handful of companies that makes 5G networking equipment for wireless companies. Huawei posted $105 billion in sales last year, more than IBM.President Donald Trump has suggested that he could consider easing up on Huawei as part of ongoing trade talks with China. Ties to China's governmentIn 2012, the US House Intelligence Committee published a report following a year-long investigation that found Huawei posed a security threat to the United States. The report concluded that Huawei and fellow Chinese telecom company ZTE acted on behalf of the Chinese government, and they should not be allowed to operate critical US infrastructure that controls the country's wireless networks.Huawei says it operates independently of the Chinese government, but the United States has long suspected the company of spying on the networks its technology operates. Huawei has repeatedly denied allegations of spying, but the United States has passed over Huawei for broadband and wireless contracts, and the Trump administration has tried to pressure global to stop buying telecommunications equipment from Huawei.The company declined to comment for this article but has repeatedly denied ties to the Chinese government and disputed claims that its equipment poses a risk. ZTE denied the allegations but last year agreed to US government oversight.Ties to IranThe Trump administration filed criminal charges against Huawei earlier this year, claiming that the company schemed to circumvent US sanctions on Iran.As part of that case, Canada has detained Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou. She faces possible extradition to the United States.Huawei allegedly deceived financial institutions and the US government about its business in Iran. Among the charges against Huawei, the United States claims Huawei's founder, Ren Zhengfei, falsely told the FBI in 2007 that the company did not violate any US export laws, and that it had not dealt directly with any Iranian company.Huawei pled not guilty, and has denied the charges. China called the charges a smear campaign. Meng denies the charges. Ren has not commented on the charges but told CNN he does not plan to travel to the United States, where he could face prosecution.Alleged intellectual property theftThe Trump administration also sued Huawei for allegedly stealing trade secrets from T-Mobile.According to the federal lawsuit, Huawei worked for years to steal T-Mobile's proprietary phone testing technology, known as "Tappy." Huawei supplied phones to T-Mobile, and had access to some information about Tappy because of that relationship, according to the lawsuit. The company's employees were allegedly asked to send information such as photos, measurements and the serial numbers of various components.The US government alleges Huawei's management promised bonuses to employees who collected confidential information on competitors. Huawei pled not guilty, and has denied the charges in that case too.Battle for the future of technologyHuawei's technology is essential to the future of 5G, a technology the United States desperately wants to dominate. Huawei is the 5G leader, providing technology that supports wireless networks' 5G rollouts. Its only substantial competitors are Nokia and Ericsson, and Huawei is a much larger company, capable of providing the technology faster and cheaper.Although the United States has mostly avoided Huawei's networking technology, it remains prevalent in rural areas of America. It is also deeply entrenched in Europe, Asia and other regions.The United States wants to ensure that its telecommunications companies are at the forefront of the new technology. 5G could help usher in the next wave of economy-changing technologies, including driverless cars.Hope for the future?Despite the recent impasse between Huawei and the United States, a previous spat between the Trump administration and a Chinese technology company shows a potential path forward for Huawei.In April 2018, the US Commerce Department said that ZTE lied to American officials about punishing employees who violated US sanctions against North Korea and Iran. The United States banned American companies from selling components to ZTE, preventing the company from buying chips and glass from its key suppliers.Yet a month later, Trump said he would personally work with Chinese President Xi Jinping to get ZTE "back into business, fast." He said the US punishment was costing too many Chinese jobs. The Trump administration lifted those sanctions in July after ZTE agreed to oversight.If the Trump administration is using Huawei --- a much bigger company than ZTE --- as a similar bargaining chip in its trade war with China, it could demand political concessions from China in exchange for easing restrictions on the company.Huawei, however, isn't waiting for the two countries to resolve the problem. Huawei sued the US government in March to fight back against America's efforts to curb its global influence. US government officials have not commented on the case.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.Load-Date: May 21, 2019End of Document

Spanberger: United States &#38; NATO Partners Must Strengthen Cyber Defenses Amid 5G Threats From ChinaTargeted News ServiceMay 9, 2019 Thursday 8:31 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 713 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Virginia, issued the following news release:* * *- A 2018 NATO Report Recommended that Western Countries Build Alternative 5G Technologies to Compete with Huawei, Mitigate Threats Posed by Chinese Government* * *U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger today called on the United States and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) partners to recognize the national security threats posed by an increased Chinese telecommunications presence in Europe.According to a recent report, Huawei's growing influence as a leading supplier of 5G technology in Europe could be exploited by China to engage in espionage, monitor foreign corporations and governments, and support Chinese military operations. To combat the potential cyber threats associated with a Huawei 5G monopoly, the report recommends that non-Chinese companies invest in 5G research and development--and it calls on European companies to reconsider the integration of Huawei technology into their 5G infrastructure.During a hearing focused on China's expanding influence in Europe and Eurasia, Spanberger underscored security concerns regarding Huawei's 5G development, Chinese intelligence operations, and the potential vulnerabilities to U.S. and European cyber infrastructure. Additionally, she called on U.S. and European officials to prioritize 5G research and development as a component of a tough, smart strategy to check Chinese influence around the world. Click here to watch her remarks."As cell phones make the 5G transition, we need to recognize the real risks that this emerging technology presents--including the threat of espionage. As a former CIA case officer, I am particularly concerned about Huawei's coordination with Chinese intelligence agencies and the Chinese military," said Spanberger. "Because of this known cooperation, we need to take concrete steps to protect the cyber infrastructure of our homes, businesses, intellectual property, and defense systems. Today, I stressed that the expansion of Huawei should not be perceived as 'business as usual,' but it should be viewed as a strategic move by an intelligence adversary. We need to remain vigilant in addressing this threat--and as a Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I'll keep fighting to raise awareness about 5G manipulation, strengthen the integrity of our networks, and improve our overall security."The 2018 report from the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) warned that integration of Huawei as a 5G provider could create long-term negative consequences--and rolling back this process could be expensive, time-intensive, and too late to prevent potential security breaches. During the hearing today, Spanberger referenced these concerns and outlined the clear national security threat that Huawei's European expansion poses to the United States.Spanberger serves as Vice-Chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee's Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia, Energy, and the Environment--in which today's hearing was held.BACKGROUNDSince arriving in the U.S. House, Spanberger has worked to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to NATO, support key allies in Europe, and promote the NATO member states' shared mission of mutual security. Spanberger is a cosponsor of the NATO Support Act, which passed overwhelmingly in the U.S. House in January. And during a March 2019 hearing, Spanberger called on Congress to recognize the security contributions of NATO and to reaffirm the alliance's indispensable role in promoting U.S. national security, economic strength, and successful diplomatic engagement efforts.Spanberger is also promoting diplomacy, human rights, and humanitarian assistance as key components of U.S. foreign policy in the Asia-Pacific. During a February 2019 hearing, Spanberger pushed for the administration to pursue effective denuclearization steps with North Korea, respect the assessments of career public servants in the intelligence community, and hold North Korea accountable for its human rights abuses amid ongoing talks. Click here for a video of her remarks.As a Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Spanberger also serves on the Asia, the Pacific, and Non-Proliferation Subcommittee.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6724330 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: May 10, 2019End of Document

At stake in Huawei's German bid, economic gain vs. national security; Huawei wants to build 5G infrastructure across the world. Decisions on whether to allow the Chinese firm access hinge on national security.The Christian Science MonitorJune 6, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights ReservedSection: WorldLength: 1244 wordsByline: Clifford Coonan ContributorBodyWhen the White House announced May 15 that it was effectively barring Chinese telecom giant Huawei from selling its products in the United States, it was perhaps the most extreme position taken by a nation against the colossal communications firm.But the competing interests behind it - national security versus commercial and technological benefit - are being calculated across the West, as countries weigh whether to allow the Chinese firm a role in building their future telecommunications infrastructure.In Germany, the math came to a very different result - but also highlights the challenges that countries will face as they try to balance security with economic competition as they pursue partnerships with Huawei and, by extension, the Chinese government.Huawei's German riseInside a former army barracks in March, Germany's telecoms regulator set a large clock ticking. The country's multibillion-dollar auction for bandwidth in cutting-edge 5G mobile networks was on.Germany's three main operators - Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone, and Telefonica - all use Huawei equipment in their networks. (A fourth company, newcomer 1&1 Drillisch, is also taking place in the auction.)In fact, Huawei has been ensconced in the German telecommunications landscape for decades. In a story that mirrors China's metamorphosis into a global power, the company opened its first German office in Eschborn, near Frankfurt, back in 2001.Four years later it signed its first major contract for DSL technology, and since then it has become a real presence. Revenues in Germany last year were around (EURO)2.2 billion ($2.5 billion) and the company now employs 2,500 people. Its Western Europe headquarters has been in Düsseldorf since 2007, and it started selling Huawei-branded smartphones in Germany in 2011.But providing 5G network infrastructure touches a higher level of national security than simple smartphones. 5G technology will create high-speed links for everything from autonomous vehicles to factories. German intelligence services argue there are particular risks from the hitherto unseen degree of interconnectedness between 5G and other areas of critical national infrastructure in Germany. It is this concern that prompted the White House action in May. The U.S. argues Huawei is too close to the Chinese government, which could press the company for backdoor access to networks using its technology.Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei - whose career as a People's Liberation Army officer is one of the reasons many fear the company is too close to the Beijing government - has responded to Germany's concerns by saying he would "not do anything to harm mankind." And Huawei has stressed its role as a good corporate citizen in Germany committed to fulfilling all security criteria that are currently being developed by the government for technology vendors."Huawei has established a fruitful working relationship with the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) and opened a cybersecurity lab in Bonn where cooperation with the BSI on several levels takes place," says Patrick Berger, Huawei's head of media affairs for Germany.'German economy rises and falls with China'For Germany, the Huawei problem may indeed be rooted in its integration with China, but not in the espionage risk. Rather, the problem may be that Germany needs China too much.China was Germany's most important trading partner for the third consecutive year last year with a total trade volume of (EURO)199.3 billion ($225.7 billion). Germany sent exports to China worth (EURO)93 billion ($105 billion) in 2018, a rise of 8%.Germany's auto firms like Volkswagen and industrial giants have become too dependent on China for economic expansion. Now that it is so deeply invested in its relationship with China, Berlin needs to balance security concerns with trade. As Jörg Krämer of Commerzbank put it: "The German economy rises and falls with China."The Chambers of Industry and Commerce estimates some 900,000 jobs in Germany depend on exports to China."If technological key competences are lost and if this affects our position in the global economy as a result, this would have dramatic consequences for our way of life, for the state's ability to act and for its ability to create in almost all areas of politics," said German Economics Minister Peter Altmaier.Also, Germany sees the development of 5G technology as crucial to the country's future as a leading industrial nation."If 5G delivers on its promise, it will be the backbone of the 'internet of things' infrastructure. This creates dependency," says a European cybersecurity expert who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of his research in the sector."Thus, I would not worry 'only' about espionage, I would worry about the larger dependency on Chinese tech, including availability, but also leverage due to the dependency. Thus, the bigger question is how to manage the increasing dependency on the Chinese trade relationship, and what the long-term game in this is."Espionage concerns Nonetheless, concerns about Huawei's inclusion in the development of 5G infrastructure linger, especially in the intelligence community.Germany's foreign intelligence service, the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND), has warned the Chinese government could install electronic "backdoors" in Huawei 5G technology for espionage and surveillance and could even use hidden "kill switches" to disable the 5G infrastructure.Gerhard Schindler, former director of the BND, said most of the risks were because China was not a democratic state, but a strongly authoritarian regime with security organs that can require any companies, even private ones, to supply information if they want it."Anyone who installs this technology is also in a position to monitor them," Mr. Schindler told German radio.Samantha Hoffman, an analyst at the International Cyber Policy Centre at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, warns the German government would be irresponsible to ignore the BND's advice."One issue is that it seems Germany has bought the Chinese Communist Party's argument that the bilateral trade relationship can be separated from politics, but the party itself doesn't separate political and economic issues, so why would it do so in the bilateral relationship with Germany?" says Ms. Hoffman, a former visiting academic fellow at the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin."For a long time, the German government and business have operated as if these are two distinct relationships, and they continue to do so," she says. "Now Germany finds itself in a difficult position where it must deal with the reality that its bilateral trade relationship with China exposes it to national security risk.""I'm certain that state actors will attempt to compromise 5G networks to enable spying," says Tom Uren, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. "We've seen other telecoms networks at times being used for espionage, and there have been state sponsored groups that have compromised internet routers too. In general telecommunications are attractive to state sponsored intelligence because that is where communications take place.""Whether Huawei itself will be pressured to assist is a different question, and is entirely up to the Chinese state," he adds. "I think Huawei has relatively little ability to resist if the Chinese Communist Party asks. After all, it's written into Chinese law that they must assist."Load-Date: June 6, 2019End of Document

"We've seen other telecoms networks at times being used for espionage, and there have been state sponsored groups that have compromised internet routers too. In general telecommunications are attractive to state sponsored intelligence because that is where communications take place.""Whether Huawei itself will be pressured to assist is a different question, and is entirely up to the Chinese state," he adds. "I think Huawei has relatively little ability to resist if the Chinese Communist Party asks. After all, it's written into Chinese law that they must assist."Load-Date: June 6, 2019End of Document

At stake in Huawei's German bid, economic gain vs. national security; Huawei wants to build 5G infrastructure across the world. Decisions on whether to allow the Chinese firm access hinge on national security.The Christian Science MonitorJune 6, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights ReservedSection: WorldLength: 1244 wordsByline: Clifford Coonan ContributorBodyWhen the White House announced May 15 that it was effectively barring Chinese telecom giant Huawei from selling its products in the United States, it was perhaps the most extreme position taken by a nation against the colossal communications firm.But the competing interests behind it - national security versus commercial and technological benefit - are being calculated across the West, as countries weigh whether to allow the Chinese firm a role in building their future telecommunications infrastructure.In Germany, the math came to a very different result - but also highlights the challenges that countries will face as they try to balance security with economic competition as they pursue partnerships with Huawei and, by extension, the Chinese government.Huawei's German riseInside a former army barracks in March, Germany's telecoms regulator set a large clock ticking. The country's multibillion-dollar auction for bandwidth in cutting-edge 5G mobile networks was on.Germany's three main operators - Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone, and Telefonica - all use Huawei equipment in their networks. (A fourth company, newcomer 1&1 Drillisch, is also taking place in the auction.)In fact, Huawei has been ensconced in the German telecommunications landscape for decades. In a story that mirrors China's metamorphosis into a global power, the company opened its first German office in Eschborn, near Frankfurt, back in 2001.Four years later it signed its first major contract for DSL technology, and since then it has become a real presence. Revenues in Germany last year were around (EURO)2.2 billion ($2.5 billion) and the company now employs 2,500 people. Its Western Europe headquarters has been in Düsseldorf since 2007, and it started selling Huawei-branded smartphones in Germany in 2011.But providing 5G network infrastructure touches a higher level of national security than simple smartphones. 5G technology will create high-speed links for everything from autonomous vehicles to factories. German intelligence services argue there are particular risks from the hitherto unseen degree of interconnectedness between 5G and other areas of critical national infrastructure in Germany. It is this concern that prompted the White House action in May. The U.S. argues Huawei is too close to the Chinese government, which could press the company for backdoor access to networks using its technology.Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei - whose career as a People's Liberation Army officer is one of the reasons many fear the company is too close to the Beijing government - has responded to Germany's concerns by saying he would "not do anything to harm mankind." And Huawei has stressed its role as a good corporate citizen in Germany committed to fulfilling all security criteria that are currently being developed by the government for technology vendors."Huawei has established a fruitful working relationship with the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) and opened a cybersecurity lab in Bonn where cooperation with the BSI on several levels takes place," says Patrick Berger, Huawei's head of media affairs for Germany.'German economy rises and falls with China'For Germany, the Huawei problem may indeed be rooted in its integration with China, but not in the espionage risk. Rather, the problem may be that Germany needs China too much.China was Germany's most important trading partner for the third consecutive year last year with a total trade volume of (EURO)199.3 billion ($225.7 billion). Germany sent exports to China worth (EURO)93 billion ($105 billion) in 2018, a rise of 8%.Germany's auto firms like Volkswagen and industrial giants have become too dependent on China for economic expansion. Now that it is so deeply invested in its relationship with China, Berlin needs to balance security concerns with trade. As Jörg Krämer of Commerzbank put it: "The German economy rises and falls with China."The Chambers of Industry and Commerce estimates some 900,000 jobs in Germany depend on exports to China."If technological key competences are lost and if this affects our position in the global economy as a result, this would have dramatic consequences for our way of life, for the state's ability to act and for its ability to create in almost all areas of politics," said German Economics Minister Peter Altmaier.Also, Germany sees the development of 5G technology as crucial to the country's future as a leading industrial nation."If 5G delivers on its promise, it will be the backbone of the 'internet of things' infrastructure. This creates dependency," says a European cybersecurity expert who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of his research in the sector."Thus, I would not worry 'only' about espionage, I would worry about the larger dependency on Chinese tech, including availability, but also leverage due to the dependency. Thus, the bigger question is how to manage the increasing dependency on the Chinese trade relationship, and what the long-term game in this is."Espionage concerns Nonetheless, concerns about Huawei's inclusion in the development of 5G infrastructure linger, especially in the intelligence community.Germany's foreign intelligence service, the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND), has warned the Chinese government could install electronic "backdoors" in Huawei 5G technology for espionage and surveillance and could even use hidden "kill switches" to disable the 5G infrastructure.Gerhard Schindler, former director of the BND, said most of the risks were because China was not a democratic state, but a strongly authoritarian regime with security organs that can require any companies, even private ones, to supply information if they want it."Anyone who installs this technology is also in a position to monitor them," Mr. Schindler told German radio.Samantha Hoffman, an analyst at the International Cyber Policy Centre at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, warns the German government would be irresponsible to ignore the BND's advice."One issue is that it seems Germany has bought the Chinese Communist Party's argument that the bilateral trade relationship can be separated from politics, but the party itself doesn't separate political and economic issues, so why would it do so in the bilateral relationship with Germany?" says Ms. Hoffman, a former visiting academic fellow at the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin."For a long time, the German government and business have operated as if these are two distinct relationships, and they continue to do so," she says.

A lot of our sources too telling us this is actually a surprise, this deal. Which is why we're seeing the stocks move so much premarket. This was not picked up I know our colleagues at the Journal broke it. But aside from that, I really haven't seen too much work on that.KELLY: Yes and this is off the heels of yesterday when Bristol-Myers Squibb was down about seven percent, because they actually did $74 billion merger with Celgene and some of the patents are going off then. And talking about drug divestiture, so this is actually interesting because Allergan has been beaten down and they were talking about doing some corporate actions. So they actually got a deal done.BARTIROMO: They had to do something because of what you said and that is, that it's the number one drug on the market, and it's going off patent.KELLY: Yes, AbbVie had to do something. And so, find the next leg of growth and it's actually in that cosmetic side of the business, where it's cash payments.BOLTON: And we're talking as well about baby boomers write in the Journal again has done some really good lifestyle reporting about how people get to a certain age and they still feel young, they've been successful and they want to enjoy themselves and this is a little bit part of it.BARTIROMO: Well, Botox has been sort of the miracle drug for a long time and it's boosted shares of Allergan for a lot of years but the stock has languished in the last year.KELLY: Yes, it's had a tough 18 to -- 18 to 24 months certainly. I mean, it was just -- I mean, they're getting paid actually. If you're an Allergan shareholder, it was at a $129 yesterday. You're actually getting $120.30 a share. So this is a good win and then you're going to get .866 shares of AbbVie. So, I think, you know, this is actually a really good deal for Allergan shareholders.BARTIROMO: And that's what the stock performance this morning reflects, up 30 percent.Joining the conversation this morning, California Congressman Ro Khanna is here, don't miss that interview coming up. "VARNEY & CO." host, Stuart Varney joining in as well and Ramsey Solutions Financial expert Chris Hogan is here as well. We got a big hour, coming up.And we want to kick the hour off with this, Middle East tensions once again. Iran is saying that new U.S. sanctions closed the door in diplomacy between the U.S. and Iran. It is threatening global stability as well according to Iran. President Trump is designating Iran's supreme leader in a new round of sanctions. National Security adviser John Bolton defended the sanctions earlier in Jerusalem.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN BOLTON, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, UNITED STATES: Iran is threatened to exceed the key limits imposed by the inadequate 2015 Iran nuclear deal exposing once again, the fatal deficiencies of that failed agreement.As I indicated on Sunday Mr. Prime Minister, President Trump yesterday imposed significant new sanctions on Iran's supreme leader and other top leadership into digitals and entities. At the same time, the president has held the door open, to real negotiations, to completely and verifiably eliminate Iran's nuclear weapons program, its pursuit of ballistic missile delivery systems, its support for international terrorism and its other maligned behavior worldwide.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is former Trump and George W. Bush State Department Senior Adviser, former North Korean Human Rights Deputy Special Envoy Christian Whiton. Christian, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.CHRISTIAN WHITON, FORMER DEPUTY SPECIAL ENVOY, NORTH KOREAN HUMAN RIGHTS: Good morning, Maria.BARTIROMO: Is there anything that's going to change Iran's behavior? Here's a country that has probably one of the best portfolios in terms of oil and gas. Huge potential to be an incredibly rich nation and yet they're not using the energy for that reason. They are in fact, supporting terrorism.WHITON: Right, and it's a reminder that despotic regimes, that Islamist regimes like this really don't care much for the welfare of their people. This is also a factor of North Korea where you have leaders that probably just don't care. They like to be rich but if it does anything to threaten their political power, it's unlikely they would take those paths. So yes, you have a government here that may someday be interested in negotiations but I think that's an important distinction.The pressure that has been put on this government by the administration, and by our allies is very considerable but it can take years for that to lead. If you think back to the 1980s, what it took to soften up the Soviets to where they had a reformist leader who was willing to cut a serious arms control agreement with President Reagan, it just takes time.BARTIROMO: So is there anything else the U.S. should be doing in terms of a response to Iran at this point?WHITON: You know, I think we're going to have to attack them militarily. I know people don't want to hear that. But Iran has repeatedly drawn the wrong impression from U.S. actions because frankly, they've gotten away with so much. This is a government that came to power, taking American diplomats hostage, they took U.S. officials hostage, tortured them, killed them in the -- in Beirut in the 80s. They blew up the Marine Barracks killing more than 200 Marines in the 80s. They blew up the Khobar Towers militarily dormitory in Saudi Arabia, killing that are naming dozens of Americans. And then they killed more than a thousand Americans potentially in Iraq in the 2000s and 2010s. They've gotten away with so much.And this latest thing where the administration I think thinks they demonstrated to Iran that they were willing to go the military route. I think Iran will concluded that once again, they got away with it. So they're going to keep provoking until they are put back in to a box.BARTIROMO: Wow, so you -- so you think that there will be a military conflict here at some point?WHITON: Eventually, yes. I think it can be limit. It's not going to look anything like Iraq or Afghanistan or Libya. It can just be frankly like Ronald Reagan's attack in Libya.BARTIROMO: I got to turn to China because there's a new threat there as well, just on the eve of the president meeting at the G20 with Xi Jinping. Hackers believed to be backed by the Chinese government, infiltrated the cell networks of at least 10 global telecom carriers. This is according to a report cited by The Wall Street Journal. The report says that hackers stole user locations along with call and text records. What do you make of this? The fact that you can have these hackers infiltrating these global telecom companies and on the direction of the Chinese government?WHITON: Right, and it's -- what shows the length and the cape of length the Chinese government will go, because the thought is that they're looking after dissidents and opponents abroad especially Chinese nationals. And you know, basically like a combination of the KGB and d highest tech entities you can think of. But also it reminds us that China breaks almost every international agreement it reaches. This report doesn't say which companies were affected but presumably they included U.S. companies.And remember, China promised President Obama in 2015 to cease cyberattacks against U.S. Companies. Well, you know, going into the G20, we don't know what will happen but there's always the question if we can trust China to implement any sort of agreement since they break all of them. And also, you know, we saw millions of people on the street of Hong Kong that is also the result of China breaking a promise and in an international agreement to have universal suffrage in Hong Kong to respect Hong Kong's autonomy.So, you know, I think it speaks to the importance that Trump has put in maintaining a enforcement mechanism on any trade deal with China, the ability to re-impose tariffs which they don't like. I think it probably indicates we're not likely to get a deal with China, but the administration will probably focus more on one with Japan, and, of course, implementing the replacement for NAFTA.BARTIROMO: So you think that maybe the U.S. ends up doing a deal with Japan, India perhaps and then maybe bilateral deals with other Asian countries like a Vietnam, Malaysia, etcetera? How does this play out? Can the U.S. just go it alone and not do a deal with China?WHITON: Yes, I think so. And you know, it takes two to tango. Here in China has all of the economic incentives to cut a deal and frankly to comply with a deal. But again, I think Xi Jinping is going to need to feel more pain. He's under pressure at home. Economically Chinese imports off 8.5 percent in May. This is the economy that somewhat sputtering and he's facing political challenges again with Hong Kong.But it's just they seem not to be there. They're not willing to take the fundamental changes that would disempower some of their state owned enterprises and stop some of the practices that have built them up mainly stealing intellectual property. It hasn't been in the news much but a mini deal with Japan, something that brings us basically, to the levels of the Trans-Pacific Partnership on agriculture which would be great for especially American beef exporters. Something on autos and auto parts and you can get that done.You know, Trump meets with Abe at the G20, and again at the G7 in France and then the U.N. General Assembly this fall. So those are three big way points where you could get potentially a deal together with Japan done by the end of the year going in to the reelection.BARTIROMO: How does Huawei fit into the Chinese debacle? Tell me your reaction and thoughts about Huawei right now.WHITON: Huawei is basically if you sort of combined Apple, Qualcomm and the NSA, that's what it is. A very dangerous company and perhaps, you know, involved in or at least sort of re-linked conceptually to what was revealed by The Wall Street Journal today. An espionage in electronic intelligence agency.So, you know, U.S. companies have -- because this has been a designated entity in a Huawei going to have more and more trouble, doing business with Huawei, but they still have access around the world. And I think you'll see the U.S. government putting more pressure on allies not to invite this basically mechanism of Chinese espionage even if they do sell pretty good equipment at lower prices, it comes with a poison pill.BARTIROMO: Well, that's apparently what we're hearing. Christian, it's great to have you on the program. Thanks so much.WHITON: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Christian Whiton, joining us there.Coming up, breaking news this morning, a blockbuster deal in the pharmaceutical industry. AbbVie is acquiring Allergan in a $63 billion deal of cash and stock. We're getting reaction from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange when we come back.And then FedEx fights back this morning, the shipping giant says it will sue the U.S. government over the Huawei blacklist. More on that next up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. President Trump is tweeting on the markets this morning. He just said this. "Stock market is headed for one of the best months, June, in our history of our country. Thank you, Mr. President.BOLTON: He's got to call out yourself when you need to, you know.KELLY: Yes. Did you say about name when it would down pretty significantly?BOLTON: Oh, boy.BARTIROMO: Oh, good points.KELLY: Yes, I don't think he did.BARTIROMO: No. Meanwhile, drug maker AbbVie making a bid to buy Botox maker Allergan, in a blockbuster deal. It's a 63 plus billion dollar deal. Jackie DeAngelis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, looking at that and the impact. Good morning, Jackie.JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning to you, Maria. And that's the big headline on the floor this morning. $63 billion deal there, as you said. Allergan shareholders are going to get $120.30 cash per share. AbbVie stock included as well.So, you can see Allergan is trading higher on this, AbbVie shares are trading lower. But, of course, AbbVie is been under pressure to diversify its portfolio. Heavily reliant on the drug Humira, but it's going to face competition from cheaper versions of that drug in Europe.And remember that Allergan has been struggling since Pfizer walked away from a deal to buy it for $160 billion that was in 2016.Meantime, I want to move on and talk about FedEx because it's suing the Commerce Department over export restrictions. The issue, of course, stemming from Huawei and restricted packages moving overseas. FedEx is saying, it's impossible for it as a business and a company to be able to police all these packages. Here is what CEO Fred Smith had to say about trade issues.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FREDERICK SMITH, CHAIRMAN, FEDEX: We believe that the international situation will resolve itself, hopefully, maybe as early as this weekend with President Trump. All 440,000 or 450,000 FedExers are one way or another involved in international trade. So, it's in everybody's best interest hopefully to resolve these issues and get back to open markets.(END VIDEO CLIP)DEANGELIS: And everyone will be watching very closely what happens with President Trump and President Xi at the G20 this week. And, of course, we'll also be keeping our eye on FedEx this afternoon, it reports earnings, Maria.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll be watching that. Jack, thank you. Jackie DeAngelis on Wall Street this morning.Coming up. Democrats divided over the border. Nancy Pelosi, facing backlash from her own party as the House gears up to vote at a new emergency aid package.Then, Washington in your wallet. A new study reveals Americans are still anxious about their finances despite the booming economy. All that right after this.BARTIROMO: Are you stressed about money? The economy may be booming, but many Americans are still having anxiety when it comes to finances. According to a new study by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, it shows that more than half of respondents say that their finances make them nervous. Only 31 percent say that they're satisfied with their current financial situation.Joining us right now is Ramsey Solutions financial expert, author of Everyday Millionaires, Chris Hogan. Chris, it's great to see you.CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT, RAMSEY SOLUTIONS: Thank you. Good to be with you.BARTIROMO: So, much anxiety because we know that a lot of people out there when faced with an urgent issue may not have money and savings to deal with it.HOGAN: That's very true, Maria. And what's the reality is that people are stressed because they don't understand really what's going on. They know they've got real-world things that are requirements for them financially, but they don't have a plan.And so, I have found the best way to get rid of stress is to have a plan and to understand the steps that you're taking.KELLY: Chris, it's Kevin Kelly here, and I guess my main question is we're starting to see financial hardship especially when it's coming to the right side of the ledger. I mean we're starting to see costs go up, but you know, the Fed says there's no inflation. But one thing that's gone up every year is right college education has gone up every single year.There's actually real inflation in consumers daily lives that the Fed is just I guess impervious to that -- you know, they don't see it happening. But how do we -- how do we take a plan and address these issues? Because I can see how people are nervous because if the rents going to be up next year, and the year after, what are they supposed to do?HOGAN: Well, Kevin, you're absolutely right. We know this for to be true. The cost of living is going to increase each year. So, we've got to get better. We've got to understand what we need to do.So, I advise people to take these four steps. Start budgeting right now today. That means you're going to tell your money where to go instead of wondering where it went. Then, I want you to get yourself out of debt. When you get out of debt, you give yourself a raise which gives you more of an opportunity to understand what you're attacking.Next, then I want you to build up an emergency fund. This is a cushion between you and life. So, if something does come up out of the blue, you've got money to reach and grab to be able to take care of it.And as always, I want people to invest for their future. When you have a plan and you're following these steps, you gain confidence and you feel better about what you're doing. Financial peace --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Yes, let me ask you about --HOGAN: Go ahead.BARTIROMO: Investing for your future. Let's say you've got some money from whatever -- your salary or a big deal you just did. 100,000 let's call it. What do you do with that money? How do you make sure you get that money to grow?HOGAN: OK, Maria, if we're going to invest, I want people to first and foremost understand what it is you're investing in. I tell people to look at growth stock mutual funds because we want the investment to grow over time.BARTIROMO: Right.HOGAN: Compound interest is your friend.BARTIROMO: All right. So, put mutual funds or ETFs. Also, since ETFs are lower fees.HOGAN: Oh, right. Absolutely.BARTIROMO: Yes.HOGAN: But I want you to only invest after you got yourself out of debt and you've built up an emergency fund. So, that's the best overall plan. We talk about this in Financial Peace University, and they can find out more at my web site, chrishogan360.com.BARTIROMO: So, the net worth of the average millennial is only $8,000. That's according to a new study by Deloitte. The latest sign that millennials are actually worse off than their parents were at the same age. What do you do then? And I know what you're going to say. First, give me the news on your debt. Do you have debt to pay down?HOGAN: Well, Maria, I'm surprised that we're surprised at this. I mean, look at the cost of things. The average cellphone is a thousand dollars, the cost of rent. You know, there are a lot of expenses out there. But millennials have to make some choices for themselves.There's so much information pulling and tugging at them, and they're more focused on experiences than they are stuff. So, they need to learn to be in control early of their money and not get caught up with what their friends are doing, in the comparison game.BOLTON: And Chris, what do you make of the cashless society that we seem to be moving towards? I read something from Harvard that said we are willing to pay 130 percent premium if no cash changes hands. So, as we go towards automatic pay, digital pay, that seems dangerous. Do you agree?BARTIROMO: That's a great question, Deirdre you're right.HOGAN: Well, I think, Deirdre, the most important thing is that we keep knowledge and understand exactly where we are. The things that makes me nervous about a cashless society that we stay out of control with how we're spending. We'll take a look, Target recently had outage where registers weren't working.And so, if you didn't have cash, you couldn't get things. So, I want people to stay in control and understand what's going on whether their using real money or digital.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's funny because monopolies modern makeover has no paper money. It realize on a voice controlled tap at.BOLTON: Well, yes. And also, if you're just paying with your --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: OK? Look at this.BOLTON: Yes. And if you're just paying with -- that's great, actually. But I know in real life, if you're just paying with a little thumb print, it's pretty easy.BARTIROMO: By the way, Ii wouldn't like this game at all. Because, first of all, I like to be banker.BOLTON: Yes.BARTIROMO: And secondly, I -- it's just -- it ruins the whole game for me.KELLY: Yes, the whole point is you're supposed to look across and see, OK, if you're doing deals, you just kind of look at those stacks.BOLTON: The fury in your sibling's eyes.KELLY: Yes, and you just see the stacks and stacks of cash.BARTIROMO: Yes, but I mean, the point -- exactly, you want to know what your competitor's up.KELLY: Right.BARTIROMO: But it's just bad for kids because like you just never actually seem not -- you never see the cash, Chris.BOLTON: Yes, I think so.BARTIROMO: So, you don't really -- you don't have an account -- an accounting of what you have, it is all digital.(CROSSTALK)HOGAN: No, I agree with you, Maria. I agree with you 100 percent, because when you look down, you see how much money you have.BARTIROMO: Right.HOGAN: And what you can afford to do. So, I don't like this new game, I'm keeping my old version and that's what my kids like.BARTIROMO: Yes, me too. I'm keeping old version of monopoly.BEVAN: Easier to clean up, though my kids just played monopoly in the basement and the money was everywhere.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's true.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Yes.BOLTON: Yes. How about in front of the charm? For -- in stepping on that little dog and having to go right through your heel, you know, it's one of the charm.KELLY: Well, that's how you learned the value of what -- of an actual bucker -- monopoly buck, right? I mean, that's the whole thing.And that there's a reason why casino has given you chips instead of cash. Because, if you're seeing the cash being lost --BARTIROMO: No.KELLY: So, that's the whole thing about this cashless society that you're bringing up because it doesn't really resonate with us.So, we start to lose the touch and feel of what the hard earned value of a dollar is than that -- this is what happens.BARTIROMO: Yes, and it also -- is very good to teach about socialism. For example, I'd like some of the celebrities that are doing all videos, talking about socialism, and talking about how bad --(CROSSTALK)BOLTON: We should invite them to play monopoly.BARTIROMO: No, I mean, like, for example, that celebrity who made a hundred million dollars on the movie. Well, OK, give me 50 million.KELLY: Yes.BARTIROMO: You can have this. We're taking -- I mean, like let's explain what it means in terms of socialism, by taking their money.KELLY: Yes.BARTIROMO: Chris, thank you. Good to see you, sir.HOGAN: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Chris Hogan joining us there. We want -- we've got some serious issues this morning. And we are looking at the anger coming out of Iran. The rogue regime slamming the U.S. sanctions as "outrageous and idiotic". We're breaking that down when we come back.Then, Pelosi is under pressure again. The House Speaker working to pass a multibillion dollar border funding bill today. Democrats are divided on the issue. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, June 25th. Your top stories right now 8:31 a.m. on the East Coast. Markets are lower this morning, 60 minutes ahead of the opening bell, the Dow Futures down 21, S&P Futures down three, and the NASDAQ Futures lower by 13. The President just tweeted that the stock market is headed for one of the best months in history. The Dow, the S&P, and the NASDAQ are all up, better than seven percent in the month of June.European indices this morning are flat, take a look, FT-100 down three points, CAC Quarante down six, DAX Index down 12. In Asia overnight, markets pulled back a bit, investors are awaiting the G20 meeting, and any movement on U.S.-China trade when the President meets with Xi Jinping on Friday. The battle at the border is now taking place on Capitol Hill, a $4-1/2 billion bill to provide more funding for migrant families detained at the border might not come up for a vote today after all. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is facing backlash within her own party over it. We're taking a closer look at the Democrats divided. Cracking down on robocalls, the very latest weapon in this battle coming up.And the big money of college sports, re NCAA could be banning California consumes from championships due to a new bill that could mean more money for the athletes. All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning. But first, our top story this half an hour, heighted tensions with Iran. Iran now says that new U.S. sanctions have closed the door on any diplomacy between the two nations. It has also threatened global stability according to Iran. President Trump has designated Iran's supreme leader in a new round of sanctions, this coming as Iran will reportedly begin the second phase of reducing its commitments under the nuclear deal on July 7th. National Security Advisor John Bolton spoke earlier in Jerusalem about what would happen if Iran exceeds uranium enrichment limit in that deal.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BOLTON: The President would say that all options remain on the table. I wouldn't give Iran advice on what they ought to do. They should give up their pursuit of deliverable nuclear weapons. They should make that strategic decision. They haven't done it yet. It would be a very serious mistake for Iran to ignore those limits.(END VIDEO CLIP)FBN "MORNINGS WITH MARIA" INTERVIEW WITH REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA)JUNE 25, 2019SPEAKERS: REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA)MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR[*] BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is California Congressman and House Armed Services Committee Member and House Oversight and Budget Committee Member, Ro Khanna. Congressman, it's good to have you on the program this morning. Thanks so much for joining me.REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA): Maria, thanks so much for having me back on.BARTIROMO: First, let's talk about Iran, and what the reaction from the United States ought to be should Iran further ignore the nuclear deal and its limitations.KHANNA: Well, we don't need another war in the Middle East. Representative Matt Gaetz, a Republican and I today, are actually going to offer an amendment to make it clear that the -- before the President can do anything in Iran, he needs to come to Congress for authorization. And I don't think the additional sanctions are going to work. Look, we tried that in Iraq. We tried this maximum pressure campaign for 10 years, we had sanctions tougher than the sanctions on Iran and Saddam Hussein never bent and it ended up leading to war.The experts tell us that additional sanctions aren't going to get the Iranian regime to fold. They have too much pride. They're actually going to start lashing out. And what we need to do is, what all our other allies want us to do, including Japan and Norway who were hit, which is renegotiate with Iran and get back in the nuclear agreement.BARTIROMO: So what do you do in terms of the renegotiation? Iran clearly wants to enrich uranium, so if your answer is to renegotiate the deal, get back into a nuclear deal, what would that negotiation look like? Allow them to enrich uranium?KHANNA: No. And the deal prohibited them from enriching uranium. Look, I'm clear --BARTIROMO: But they're breaking the deal anyway, right? They just said, "Look, July 7th? We're going to do what we want. We're going to break the limitations on the deal."KHANNA: Well, they're breaking the deal because we got out of the deal and then we designated their Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization. Now, I'm clear-eyed about Iran. I mean they --BARTIROMO: Are they not a terrorist organization, sir?KHANNA: They have sponsored and -- with Hezbollah and Hamas, terrorist activities, but I think the designation of them as a terrorist organization and pulling out of the nuclear agreement has exacerbated the situation. And this escalation wasn't taking place before we pulled up, and there's not a single ally of ours. I mean we should stop to think about that, including the countries that were directly attacked, there's not a single ally of ours that wants us to pull out of the nuclear agreement or not negotiate.So, my question is, why aren't we listening to everyone else in the world, including people who actually have stakes there? In fact, it was the Saudis and the United Arab Emirates that convinced, in my view, a -- or part of the reason that the President didn't attack because they understand if we attack, Iran could attack them and you could have a regional war.BARTIROMO: You know, it's interesting, because most people will say, look, the United States should not be the policing of the world, right? The U.S. is not our -- our job to police everybody and yet when you have a nation that is supporting terrorists, when you have a nation that actually has an opportunity to have really become a rich nation with all of the potential of oil and gas in Iran and yet they choose not to, and in fact to use their have efforts to support things like Hamas, and Hezbollah, what do you do? What should the U.S. do?KHANNA: Well, we need to strengthen our regional allies and negotiate. Here is the reason, Maria, because we don't need another Middle East war. I mean this President has said it's cost us $6 trillion and if we view China as our rival, look, China is 15 percent of global GDP. America, we're 24.4 percent. Iran is .55 percent, the entire Middle East is 3.5 percent, what are we doing getting bogged down there when would should be investing in our own country and our people and making sure we win this 21st century. And that's a bipartisan sentiment on the Hill and that's Matt Gaetz and I going to be introducing this amendment that think will pass.BARTIROMO: Well, you make a good point about the 0.5 percent, or 0.5 but of course that little 0.5 percent can certainly cause disruption across the world.KHANNA: That is true.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you --KHANNA: That is true.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about the battle at the border because House Speaker Nancy Pelosi obviously scrambling to secure votes for a $4-1/2- billion funding bill aimed at helping migrant females detained at the Southern Border. The move dividing Democrats in Congress. Some arguing the bill doesn't go far enough. Where are you on this?KHANNA: We have a moral obligation to act. I want to get to a "yes," we have some things I think that can be done to improve the bill, specifically two things. One, right now, you can have unlicensed facilities that are holding these kids for up to a year, I think that needs to be reduced so these facilitates have to be licensed. And secondly, I would have a cooler standard, so it's made obvious that you need give these kids soap and sanitary conditions, and allow them to sleep on a cot. If we can get those provisions in, I want to vote yes, I think that we have a duty to get funding to solve the humanitarian issue.BARTIROMO: But you and all your colleagues had a chance to increase money. I mean these detention centers obviously are busting. We don't have any room for anybody else, that's one of the reasons that you've got border patrol agents actually acting as nurses and taking kids to hospitals. Kids are so sick, there's no room for them in the -- in these detention centers, how come this hasn't been fixed yet?KHANNA: Well, we have offered funding. I don't think it's fair to blame Congress. I think the administration hasn't upheld some very basic standards, which is making sure that there's basic hygiene, making sure that babies --BARTIROMO: Well, hasn't the administration been asking for money now for about a year?KHANNA: But that -- but that money has been for ICE enforcement, for more detention beds. They haven't been asking for the money --BARTIROMO: Yes, more detention beds. Exactly.KHANNA: But they haven't -- they haven't been asking for money, for health and human services to take care of the kids and they have -- it doesn't cost a lot of money to provide toothbrushes and soap to people who are opposed to this and I'm not, I'm -- actually want to get to a yes, but there are concerns that the administration is going to take the money, use it simply for enforcement and not actually change the behavior and help those kids.Look, there's not a single American who thinks what's going on at the border and how these kids are being treated is right, and we should, as a Congress, come together, get the funding, and uphold our values, which is that we treat every human life with dignity and respect, that sort of foundational to what America stands for.BARTIROMO: Right. And I keep hearing that, treat every human with dignity and respect and yet you and your colleagues are not doing that because you have kids at the border right now who are showing up sick after hitchhiking and walking four months because of all of these loopholes. You've got the Flores Agreement, you've got the asylum standards, why can't you and your colleagues just get together and change those loopholes?KHANNA: Well, the issue of treating them with dignity and respect is just making sure they have soap, water, basic hygiene.BARTIROMO: Yes, but I'm talking about the loopholes, Congressman, how come we can't fix loopholes? Come on now.KHANNA: I think -- I don't think the loopholes are the issue. The issue is that they need to have due process, they need to have immigration judges there, we don't have enough judges, and the issue is that we need more funding, which, by the way, the Republicans are saying that they don't want to support. I mean Nancy Pelosi is going to have to get the votes for 4.5 billion, and if you ask leader McCarthy, he's -- he and his caucus aren't willing to even vote for that.So, you know, I think that this is a situation that shouldn't be partisan. Everyone knows we need to have some basic care for these children, and this administration hasn't upheld those standards.BARTIROMO: So you don't -- so you don't think the issues at the border then are the -- are the story? We're talking about a million apprehensions this year. Is that not an issue?KHANNA: Of course it is. And what I --BARTIROMO: So then why not change the loopholes, Congressman?KHANNA: Well, what I have proposed is what President Obama was doing that this administration discontinued and his solution was that we would process people in country. In other words, set up in country processing, in Guatemala, in Honduras, in El Salvador, so folks don't even get to the border and process them there. And secondly, increase the U.S. aid, which was taking on gang violence and succeeding, let's do that. Those two things actually would decrease the flow to the border and help alleviate the situation.BARTIROMO: This is obviously going to be one of the hot topics tomorrow night and Thursday night on --during the Democratic debates, 20 Democratic contenders facing off in two separate debates Wednesday and Thursday night. Current frontrunner Joe Biden appears in Thursday's debate. He's going to face candidates including Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Senators Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders.Congressman, I know you're tied to Bernie Sanders and his campaign. How does Bernie Sanders differentiate himself in this crowded field Wednesday night?KHANNA: I think on three policies, one Bernie Sanders needs to make it clear that he is not going to get us into more unconstitutional wars, he's not going to spend trillions of dollars in the Middle East and overseas, he's going to invest in this country. Second, he needs to make it clear that he always stood up to bad trade deals. The trade deals that have really led to deindustrialization and he's going to invest again in rural America and invest again in manufacturing in this country and raising worker wages.And third, I would say that he should talk about the support he has in the Midwest, how well he's done in the heartland of this country and why he's going to be a successful candidate against the president.BARTIROMO: Well, one of his main policies has been Medicare For All. How can you justify eliminating the current 180 million people who are currently getting their insurance from the private sector because of course Medicare For All wipes that out?KHANNA: Well, his bill actually doesn't do that. It says that you can have private insurance, but it has to be supplemental. So, what his bill says everyone gets basic Medicare, you get basic health care including dental and vision, it's going to cost you less. If you're not happy with it and you want more, you can still go keep your insurance company, but his bill is basically saying that the government has an obligation to provide people with basic health care, it will reduce premiums and increase benefits.And by the way, President Trump was for it in 2000. He in his book, The America We Deserve, said that a single payer system is the best way to get health care to people.BARTIROMO: Do you think the country is ready for some of these policies which appear socialist?KHANNA: Well, I'm a Progressive Capitalist. I represent Silicon Valley. We have the most economic growth and I think what Bernie Sanders is talking about in terms of investing in people's health care and education is what we need to compete with China and to prepare for the 21st century. I think we have to start investing in our people again.BARTIROMO: So he -- you think he is going to be the Democratic candidate?KHANNA: I think he's a strong contender, I think he's a top three contender to go after President Trump. I don't know anything could predict what's going to happen, but he's definitely going to be in the hunt.BARTIROMO: Congressman, good to see you this morning. Thanks so much.KHANNA: Great to see you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Congressman Ro Khanna joining us there. Coming up, cracking down on robocalls. Stuart Varney with details on a new solution, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Robocalls, we'll get them. It would great if there was an effective way to stop them.

What he's doing is throwing the onus on the cell phone companies. It's up to them to sort this out and stop it. Now I don't quite know the mechanism, but I have great hopes that sooner or later, somebody's going to come up with, and maybe Greg Walden has done it, come up with a way to absolutely stop this because it's a pet peeve of all of our viewers and every single person I know.Because when you get these calls coming at you, you can't use your phone. It's messed up until the caller stops, so let's hope Mr. Walden has the right stuff to fix this thing, and he's on the show in a half hour and I hope you can join us.BARTIROMO: Awesome. I will be there, Stu.VARNEY: Sure.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. We will see you in about 10 minutes.VARNEY: You got it.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much.

China-Russia relations offer lifeline to the CaribbeanCaribbean News Now, Grand Cayman, Cayman IslandsJune 10, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Caribbean News Now, Grand Cayman, Cayman IslandsDistributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWSLength: 672 wordsByline: Caribbean News Now, Grand Cayman, Cayman IslandsBodyJune 10--     Jun. 10--Washington, USA -- At the opening of Caribbean legislative week on Capitol Hill, June 5, Antigua and Barbuda's ambassador to the United States, Sir Ronald Sanders, stated "China offers Caribbean countries a lifeline for development in the absence of others.""Caribbean countries have welcomed Chinese investment, including loans from the government of China, not because they wish to displace traditional friends or to diminish their valued relations, but because China offers a lifeline for development in the absence of others.""We would be ducking an important issue if we did not note the expressed unhappiness in some quarters by the presence of the Peoples Republic of China as a partner in the economic development of the Caribbean," Sanders continued."Without China's investment over the last decade, the Caribbean region, as in Latin America, would have stagnated, if not reversed," Sanders explained: "Typically, Chinese government loans are for 20 years at two percent interest and because of them, Caribbean countries have been able to build infrastructures, such as seaports, airports, low-cost housing, roads and schools. No other government, nor commercial or development bank offers such beneficial terms," he said.Pertaining to concerns expressed by US government representatives about China's involvement in the Caribbean, Sir Ronald explained that, "Today, the majority of CARICOM countries are stable democracies. But these conditions are only sustainable in conditions of sustained development."Meanwhile in Moscow, Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda Gaston Browne attending the St Petersburg Economic conference, participated in the signing ceremony for the Visa Waiver- Visa Free agreement with Russian Foreign Minister H.E Sergei Lavrov.Collaboration between Russian and Chinese small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has been a key driver of increasing economic relations between the two nations in recent years; an aim that is estimated to grow thanks to e-commerce, technology and expanding assistance for SMEs from each country.Bilateral trade exceeded US$100 billion for the first time in 2018, a 27.8 percent year-on-year gain that recorded an all-time high. The SMEs and private sector from both sides represented an essential purpose in the surge in trade, with small businesses profiting from better China-Russia relations and collaboration in industries such as e-commerce.Online exports of Russian products grew by 36 percent in 2018 to US $746 million, according to The Moscow Times. Just two years prior, only 0.3 percent of Russian SMEs were utilising the internet to trade their products.According to a report by the Gaidar Institute, the prospect for Russian SMEs looking to trade their products online overseas is bright. The whole Russian e-commerce market could be worth US $43 billion by 2024.Cross-border economic collaboration zones, such as the Heilongjiang-Blagoveshchensk zone, are encouraging closer brick-and-mortar trade and collaboration between Chinese and Russian SMEs.According to Global Times, most of the businesses in a cross-border import and export industrial park in Heihe, northeast China's Heilongjiang Province are SMEs, with cargo volume in the first half of 2017 hitting 175,000 tons.Russian President Vladimir Putin has designated 2024 as a breakthrough year for Russia's SMEs, with state businesses set to boost spending on goods and services from SMEs to 5 trillion rubles annually (US $76.9 billion).Beijing and Moscow have both promised more meaningful assistance for SMEs and the private sector in recent years. Further to that strategy, China has proclaimed various measures this year to facilitate access to funding and cut expenses for SMEs, with Premier Li Keqiang stating "when SMEs are vibrant, our economy will bloom as well."___ (c)2019 the Caribbean News Now (Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands) Visit the Caribbean News Now (Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands) at www.caribbeannewsnow.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.Load-Date: June 11, 2019End of Document

China's technology tactics irk its trading partnersAssociated Press InternationalMay 20, 2019 Monday 2:39 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 1425 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - For four decades, Beijing has cajoled or pressured foreign companies to hand over technology. And its trading partners say if that didn't work, China stole what it wanted.Communist leaders deflected demands for change until foreign frustration erupted into a showdown with President Donald Trump. He sent shockwaves through their export industries by slapping punitive tariffs of up to 25% on Chinese goods.Europe, Japan and other trading partners object to Trump's tactics but echo American complaints. They say Beijing's tactics violate its market-opening commitments under the World Trade Organization.American prosecutors go further. They say the Communist Party is the ringleader of a global industrial spying operation.Chinese leaders have promised stronger patent protections and other legal changes. Foreign experts say that will make little difference if the party won't enforce them."Chinese government efforts to encourage and direct firms to acquire technology from the United States are likely to continue as Beijing seeks to further develop its domestic high-tech industries," an American government panel, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, said in a report this month.Here are some tactics Beijing's trading partners complain it uses to improperly obtain foreign technology.___JOINT VENTURES: The strongest tool in Beijing's arsenal is the longstanding requirement for companies in most industries to work through state-owned local partners.The goal is for the Chinese partner to learn and eventually displace its foreign competitor.Some balked but thousands of companies cooperated as the price of admission to the most populous global market.Many companies say Chinese partners abide by promises not to abuse their access to technology. But some say partners have copied chemical formulas, industrial processes and other secrets for their own operations, sometimes with local government support.Beijing denies it forces foreign companies to hand over technology, but joint ventures won't work without foreign technology and manufacturing expertise.In the auto industry, China has promised to lift requirements for joint ventures and allow full foreign ownership by 2023. Experts say that suggests they believe Chinese automakers no longer need foreign tutors.___LEGAL PRESSURE: Pressure to hand over technology pervades Chinese law and action by regulators.Beijing promised when it joined the rules-making World Trade Organization in 2001 to treat Chinese and foreign companies equally. Eighteen years later, business groups and governments say foreign companies still face special burdens, including sharing technology.The European Union filed a WTO challenge last June to Chinese laws on technology licensing it says discriminate against foreign companies. It said China's own companies are free to negotiate licensing terms, but Chinese law dictates terms for foreign companies in advance.A law approved in March bans using "administrative measures" to compel foreign companies to hand over technology. Business groups welcomed that but said Chinese officials can still use other pressure tactics.Business groups say Chinese regulators misuse a 2008 Anti-Monopoly Law to pressure foreign companies in negotiations on technology licensing.The law includes an unusual provision prohibiting "abuse of intellectual property right." Lawyers say that runs counter to the spirit of patents and copyrights, which are meant to encourage technology creation by giving the owner a temporary monopoly and the right to charge others for using it.Lawyers said Chinese regulators sometimes intervene in contract negotiations and push foreign companies to accept lower fees by threatening to launch an anti-monopoly investigation.___REGULATORY PRESSUREAuthorities also use "window guidance," or verbal orders given to companies in secret, to compel companies to support Chinese technology development in ways the government doesn't publicly acknowledge.A decade ago, for example, global automakers agreed to help Chinese partners create new local brands.That injected foreign expertise into fledgling brands the Communist Party hoped eventually will compete in global markets in a way joint venture vehicles made under foreign brand names cannot.It made life harder for automakers by spreading their resources more thinly and adding to competition in a glutted market. Despite that, global automakers said they had commercial motivations and regulators denied they applied any pressure.The real reason? Industry researchers say regulators told automakers in private they had to cooperate if they wanted permission to expand production of their own brands.___MORE REGULATORY PRESSURERegulators also pressure foreign companies to help potential Chinese rivals develop technology.Global companies in engineering, software, pharmaceuticals and other fields have set up research centers with Chinese partners. Many say they are to take advantage of China's scientific talent pool, but such arrangements benefit potential Chinese competitors and are unusual abroad.This month, Microsoft Corp. opened an artificial intelligence research lab in Shanghai with the state-owned Zhangjiang Group.Other prominent examples include General Motors Co.'s Pan-Asia Technical Automotive Center with state-owned SAIC Motor. SAIC is the main Chinese manufacturing partner for GM and Volkswagen AG but also sells its own auto brands.___AND MORE REGULATORY PRESSURECompanies complain regulators use patent, safety and other official examinations to learn about technology, often including employees of Chinese rivals in review panels.Companies are required to provide what they say is an unusually large amount of information about products and industrial processes, including competitive secrets, to obtain patents or approval for operations.The Wall Street Journal in September cited an employee of a foreign automaker as saying there was "clear evidence of collusion" between regulators and Chinese automakers.The employee said regulators asked for blueprints of components the company was trying to prevent its Chinese partner from seeing but ignored other parts of the vehicle.___"LOCALIZING TECHNOLOGY"For decades, the ruling party has rewarded businesspeople, academics and others who "localize technology" - a euphemism for unauthorized copying of foreign know-how - with promotions, research grants, money and public praise.Security researchers say the government operates a network of research institutes and business parks to turn stolen technology into commercial products.In 2013, three Chinese scientists at New York University were charged with sending U.S. taxpayer-financed research on magnetic resonance imaging to a Chinese government-run institute.Other Chinese-born researchers in the United States have been charged with stealing chemical, seed, turbine and other technologies. Prosecutors say some had partners waiting in China to turn them into products.___OUTRIGHT THEFTAmerican prosecutors say when all else fails, top-level state companies steal foreign secrets.Pangang Group, a steelmaker owned by China's Cabinet, was indicted in 2014 on U.S. charges it paid industrial spies to steal a process from DuPont for making titanium dioxide, a white pigment widely used in toothpaste, Oreo cookies and other products.Defendants including an industry consultant and a retired DuPont employee admitted working for Pangang. But the case stalled because prosecutors had no access to Pangang Group and Chinese authorities took no action.___MILITARY SPYINGU.S. prosecutors say the Communist Party uses its military's cyber warfare skills to steal commercial secrets.The People's Liberation Army is regarded as, along with the U.S. and Russian militaries, a leader in research on breaking into or disabling an enemy's computer networks.Security experts say hackers believed to be Chinese soldiers or military contractors have stolen secrets including product designs, chemical processes and details of commercial negotiations.In 2014, five members of China's military cyber warfare unit were indicted on U.S. industrial spying charges.The following year, President Xi Jinping agreed with President Barack Obama to avoid using military resources to steal commercial secrets. But the U.S. National Security Agency said in November that Beijing appeared to be violating its pledge.In October, an employee of China's main spy agency was charged with trying to steal trade secrets from U.S. aviation and aerospace companies.Load-Date: May 20, 2019End of Document

China rejects 'unfounded hype' after GE spying accusationAssociated Press Financial WireApril 24, 2019 Wednesday 11:38 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 463 wordsDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - China's government on Wednesday rejected accusations that it steals technology after a former General Electric Co. engineer and his Chinese business partner were indicted on charges of industrial spying.The charges announced Tuesday come amid a tariff war between Beijing and Washington over U.S. complaints including that China steals or pressures companies to hand over technology.The foreign ministry said charges against Xiaoqing Zheng, a former employee of GE's power division, and Zhaoxi Zhang, a businessman in northeastern China, appear to be a "common commercial case" that shouldn't be "over-interpreted and politicized.""The achievements of China's development have not come from theft. It is the result of the Chinese people's wisdom and sweat," said a ministry statement. "We hope the relevant sides can stop unfounded hype and view and deal with the relevant issues objectively and rationally."The ministry said it had no details of the case beyond what was reported in the press.Zheng and Zhang are accused of receiving money from the Chinese government and coordinating with officials to make agreements with official institutions to develop turbine technologies. The indictment said Zheng, who specialized in sealing technology, took proprietary information and emailed it to Zhang, who is his nephew.His lawyer, Kevin Luibrand, said he wasn't commenting on the charges.Foreign security researchers say China's government has for decades encouraged engineers and scientists to bring home foreign technology, whether obtained lawfully or not. They say Beijing offers financial rewards and operates business parks where people can turn stolen technology into commercial products.In October, the Justice Department charged an operative of China's Ministry of State Security with attempting to steal trade secrets from GE Aviation and other aerospace companies.Chinese officials have complained the U.S. accusations are aimed at stopping an emerging competitor.Tuesday's indictment cited Chinese companies and institutions it said were linked to Zheng and Zhang's case.They included Liaoning Tianyi Aviation Technology Co. Ltd. and Nanjing Tianyi Avi Tech Co. Ltd. and Shenyang Aerospace University, Shenyang Aeroengine Research Institute and Huaihai Institute of Technology.A man who answered the phone in the president's office at the Huaihai Institute said he hadn't heard of the case but defended the university."My university is a university with a nature of public good," said the man, who would give only his surname, Wang. "I don't know where the allegation has come from."A woman who answered the phone at Nanjing Tianyi Aviation Technology said the company's boss wasn't available.Phone calls to Shenyang Aerospace University weren't answered.Load-Date: April 25, 2019End of Document

"We hope the relevant sides can stop unfounded hype and view and deal with the relevant issues objectively and rationally."The ministry said it had no details of the case beyond what was reported in the press.Zheng and Zhang are accused of receiving money from the Chinese government and coordinating with officials to make agreements with official institutions to develop turbine technologies. The indictment said Zheng, who specialized in sealing technology, took proprietary information and emailed it to Zhang, who is his nephew.His lawyer, Kevin Luibrand, said he wasn't commenting on the charges.Foreign security researchers say China's government has for decades encouraged engineers and scientists to bring home foreign technology, whether obtained lawfully or not. They say Beijing offers financial rewards and operates business parks where people can turn stolen technology into commercial products.In October, the Justice Department charged an operative of China's Ministry of State Security with attempting to steal trade secrets from GE Aviation and other aerospace companies.Chinese officials have complained the U.S. accusations are aimed at stopping an emerging competitor.Tuesday's indictment cited Chinese companies and institutions it said were linked to Zheng and Zhang's case.They included Liaoning Tianyi Aviation Technology Co. Ltd. and Nanjing Tianyi Avi Tech Co. Ltd. and Shenyang Aerospace University, Shenyang Aeroengine Research Institute and Huaihai Institute of Technology.A man who answered the phone in the president's office at the Huaihai Institute said he hadn't heard of the case but defended the university."My university is a university with a nature of public good," said the man, who would give only his surname, Wang. "I don't know where the allegation has come from."A woman who answered the phone at Nanjing Tianyi Aviation Technology said the company's boss wasn't available.Phone calls to Shenyang Aerospace University weren't answered.Load-Date: April 25, 2019End of Document

Chinese crackdown on foreign names draws protestAssociated Press InternationalJune 21, 2019 Friday 4:11 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 493 wordsByline: By FU TING, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - The Manhattan neighborhood, Venice Garden, the Vienna hotel chain - to the ears of the Chinese government, the names are too foreign-sounding and must go.Provinces and cities across China have been issuing notices pressuring both private and public officials to rename businesses, bridges and neighborhoods, reflecting renewed efforts by President Xi Jinping's government to "sinicize" China.The move came to light after Vienna Hotels, which according to its website operates 2,500 properties in China, fought back on social media this week, and other users jumped in to ridicule the move.China's Ministry of Civil Affairs confirmed Friday that the campaign is underway, but said that some local governments are not implementing the new rule accurately. It maintained though that foreign names have an ugly social influence that needs to be cleaned up.The post on the ministry's website added that along with foreign names, names that are "weird, repetitive, or self-aggrandizing" should also be changed.Local governments, from Inner Mongolia in the north to Hainan island off the southern coast, have been sending out instructions urging the change.Last week, the Civil Affairs Department in Hainan posted on its official website a list of 84 names of hotels, neighborhoods, cinemas, roads and bridges in 10 cities, three counties and one economic development zone. It said the names need to be cleaned up for several reasons, most of which had to do with "worshipping of and having blind faith in foreign things."Fifteen of the 84 names are hotels run by the Vienna Hotel Group.Vienna Hotels, in a post Tuesday on Weibo - a Twitter-like app and website in China - said it had complained to the Hainan Civil Affairs Department and is awaiting a response.

China steals military technologies through espionage, warns the PentagonCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 6, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 814 wordsBody (CNN) - China continues to modernize its armed forces in order to transform them into a great world power and uses espionage to steal cutting-edge technologies for military purposes, according to one on China's armed forces.  "China uses various methods to acquire foreign military and dual-use technologies, including targeted direct investment, cyber-theft and exploitation of Chinese citizens' access to these technologies, as well as taking advantage of their intelligence services, intrusions to computers and other illicit approaches, "reads the report that the United States Department of Defense conducted on the orders of Congress.  "China obtains foreign technology through imports, direct investment, the establishment of research and development centers, joint ventures, research and academic alliances, talent recruitment, and industrial and cybernetic espionage," the report adds.  General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that companies doing business in China often benefited the Chinese armed forces indirectly and gave Google an example.  The report states that China had used these techniques to acquire sensitive, double-use or military-grade US equipment, such as aviation and anti-submarine defense technologies.  According to the report, the Chinese government is also taking advantage of its citizens and people of Chinese descent living abroad to promote the goals of the Communist Party of China; the report notes that "a central strategy of China includes appealing to Chinese citizens abroad or citizens of Chinese descent in other countries to promote the aims of the CCP through persuasion or, sometimes, coercion and blackmail".  The Chinese government develops advanced weaponry  Among the most advanced technologies that China is developing are hypersonic missiles, weapons that travel at least five times the speed of sound.  "China has tested hypersonic sliding vehicles." In August 2018, China successfully tested the XINGKONG-2 (Starry Sky 2), which it publicly described as a hypersonic glider vehicle, "the report said, referring to a missile that can fly very near the water to evade detection and anti-missile defenses.  The report also details the increase in China's defense budget and its military capabilities, to which is added that "China's defense budget has almost doubled in the past ten years."  Much of that money is going to strengthen the Chinese Navy; the report indicates that China has "the largest Armada Navy in the region with more than 300 surface fighters, submarines, amphibious ships, patrol ships and specialized vessels."  In the report, it is pointed out that the Chinese Navy is "an increasingly modern and flexible force" and adds that the "modernization of the Chinese fleet of submarines continues to be a priority".  The report adds that the total fleet of submarines "will probably increase to between 65 and 70 submarines by 2020" and that China will introduce a new nuclear attack submarine with guided missiles "in the mid-2020s", bringing the Chinese government will have "a more clandestine ground attack option".  It is also likely that the first aircraft carrier that China has built "will join the fleet by the end of 2019" and that the second aircraft carrier built in China will be operational by 2022.  The Chinese government is expanding its Coast Guard to consolidate the domain it claims over the disputed islands in the China SeaSouthern, according to the report.  Since 2010, the Chinese Coast Guard has doubled its fleet of large patrol boats and now has about 130 large ships, "so it is by far the largest coastguard force in the world and is increasing its capacity to execute simultaneous maritime operations. and extended in several disputed areas. "  The report adds that China uses the Militia of the Maritime Forces of the People, a reserve of civilians ready to move, "to meet the political objectives of China" in the South China Sea without fighting.  China has tried to increase its control over the geography and sea lanes of the South China Sea, where 78% of its oil imports and 16% of natural gas imports transit.  The report notes that "in the South China Sea, China has continued militarization, anti-ship cruise missiles and long-range surface-to-air missiles have been deployed at points on the Spratly Islands, and China's strategic bombers have rehearsed takeoffs and landings on Woody Island, in the Paracelsus Islands, "adding that the missiles deployed in the Spratly Islands in 2018 are" the most capable land weapon systems that China has deployed in the disputed sea of China Southern".  The report adds that "China asserts that the presence of international armed forces in the South China Sea is a challenge to its sovereignty.China has continued to intensify coercive tactics to consolidate the dominance it claims in the South China Sea." Load-Date: May 7, 2019End of Document

Good Monday morning. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Monday, May 13th. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Trade you turmoil once again working its way on markets. China is threatening to retaliate for tariff increases on goods. $200 billion of goods going to 25 percent on Friday.President Trump tweeted that China will be hurt badly if President Xi does not make a deal. The rising trade tensions are impacting futures this morning and we are expecting a decline at the start of trading of 350 points. We are now at the lows of the morning right here. As you see the Dow futures are down 349, that 1-1/3 percent, S&P are futures down 42 points, 1-1/2 percent and the NASDAQ down 152 points right now. That's two percent lower on NASDAQ.Even though Friday we saw a huge turnaround by the end of the day, in fact, the Dow and the NASDAQ were lower heading intra -- the Dow had an intra-day swing of 549 points but at the close, Dow Industrials were up 114 points. S&P was up 10 points and the NASDAQ was up six at the close on Friday. In Europe this morning we are seeing the selling accelerate. FT-100 down 10 points, CAC Quarante is down 33 and the DAX Index in Germany down 108 points.In Asia overnight, we did have some U.S.-China trade fears impacting markets. Shanghai Composite was down 1-1/4 percent but weaker than expected auto sales numbers out of China. Nikkei Average was down two- thirds of a percent as you see. The Hang Seng was closed in Hong Kong for a holiday. Uber had a rough ride for its debut. The second day of trading for the ride-sharing giant hitting a speed bump after a disappointing debut. That stock is worsening here. It is down 5-2/3 percent right now. Uber now $39.00 and change.Breaking up Facebook. Calls to dismantle the social media giant increasing. What some key Democrats are saying about this idea. And Wal- Mart and Target are quietly exploring a controversial product. We'll you what the retail giants are reportedly looking to add to their shelves coming up. All those stories coming up right here this Monday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network Jackie DeAngelis, assistant editorial page editor at the Wall Street Journal, James Freeman, and PwC Partner, Mitch Roschelle. Great show so far guys.MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC CHARITABLE FOUNDATION: Good morning. This China trade thing is really wreaking havoc on the markets.BARTIROMO: Things are worsening right now.ROSCHELLE: Yes.BARTIROMO: 350 points and even Uber is worsening. So, I guess when you're uncertain, you want to sell first and think later and you might want to sell things that maybe your -- feeling like aren't going to -- obviously aren't going to go up much more but I don't know, does Uber get caught in this spiral of a sales sell- off-- of a sell-off? .JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. Pressure -- obviously, some pressure in the U.S. markets more so in China, I think it's a question we've been talking about the President and his strategy. On the China side, we are seeing people at the margin moving to buy from other countries, U.S. exports -- sorry, I should say imports from China lately going down.,BARTIROMO: Yes.FREEMAN: Imports from other countries rising. Do -- as the President suggested in a tweet people respond to this tax but just substituting products from somewhere other than China.BARTIROMO: So you think maybe they'll import from places like Vietnam --FREEMAN: Well --BARTIROMO: -- and elsewhere?FREEMAN: If he can't get a deal one thing really ought to think about is reconstituting some version of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Don't call it that, I understand he said that was disaster.BARTIROMO: Yes.FREEMAN: One of the worst ever but I think he wants to have freer trade with other countries if he's going to maintain tariffs with China.BARTIROMO: Yes.(CROSSTALK)JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: How do we get a deal with no talks on the table? There is no date for talks. The next opportunity would be the end of June, maybe, at the G20.BARTIROMO: Yes. That's true. That's is being talked about that maybe President Xi and President Trump can meet at the G20. But China is inviting, it says it's inviting the U.S. officials to continue talking. I don't know what that means but you're right, no date is set. We got a big show, a lot of conversation around that, of course. And joining the conversation this morning is former Speaker of the House, Fox News Contributor, Newt Gingrich this morning.Former Connecticut Senator and United Against Nuclear Iran Chairman, Joe Lieberman is here along with the host of "VARNEY & COMPANY" Stuart Varney. Don't miss a moment of it. We got a big hour coming up. We're going to kick the hour off here with U.S.-China trade. Investors are watching these trade sensations as Beijing says it will never surrender to outside pressure. Blake Burman with the latest right now. He's at the White House this morning as usual. Blake, good morning to you.BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you as well. The trade war continuing over the weekend and into this morning with President Trump warning. Some would even say threatening China at one point this morning already in a host of tweets, the president saying that China should not retaliate or else it will "Only get worse." Among the tweets from the President today, he writes "I say openly to President Xi and all of my friends in China that China will be hurt very badly if you don't make a deal because companies will be forced to leave China for other countries."Too expensive to buy in China, the President writes. You had a great deal, almost completed, and you backed out. He also says the tariffs have been good for growth here at home, writing the "The Unexpectedly good first quarter, 3.2 percent GDP was greatly helped by tariffs from China, some people just don't get it." Now, over the weekend, the President's Top Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow says that they feel that the economy won't be too badly hurt from this trade war and also said that the administration will help out the farmers.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LARRY KUDLOW, DIRECTOR, UNITED STATES NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: I think this is a risk we should and can take without damaging our economy in any appreciable way. I will note as others have maybe this is part of your lightning round bullets, maybe the toughest burdens on the farmers, the agriculture sector, we get that, we've helped them before on loss exports. I think we had an authorization of $12 billion. We will do it again if we have to be and if the number show that up.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: Maria, Liu He who is the Vice Premier of China said after the talks on Friday when he gave an interview to Chinese media that there are a few different conditions for a trade deal, one he said the deal has to be balanced. Secondly as well he said that the purchases from China have to be realistic to what the demands of the markets are and he also said that the tariffs will have to go away.It is tougher to see when that happens or if that could happen any time soon. Maria?BARTIROMO: Yes. I don't know that the President was even planning on removing all tariffs at all, even with a deal. So we'll see. Blake, thank you. Blake Burman is at the White House this morning. I want to stay on trade, also turn to the 2020 presidential election, President Trump tweeted last night about former Vice President Joe Biden. He said this, China is dreaming that Sleepy Joe Biden or any of the others gets elected in 2020, they love ripping off America."Joining us right now is former House Speaker, Fox News Contributor and the author of the new political thriller, Collusion, Newt Gingrich is with us. And good to see you Mr. Speaker. Thank you so much for joining us.NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I'm glad to be with you.BARTIROMO: So what do you think about? Is that -- is that what this is about you think China, that figures maybe their days are numbered with Donald Trump and they could just wait it out?GINGRICH: No, I think the Chinese are caught in a real box because frankly, even if you think Trump is not going to get reelected and I think that personally he's going to get reelected. But even if you thought he wasn't you're talking about January of 2021. Well, their economy is not going to take battering that Trump can deliver if they refuse to negotiate. Remember, the biggest customer has a huge advantage in negotiations because the other side needs the sale.We don't need the sale, the Chinese do. And the basic argument that Trump makes which I agree with is that we've had a very one-sided relationship, they've used intellectual property theft, they've taken enormous advantage. They have a closed market. They don't allow many of our high-tech companies to compete. They subsidize in many ways. And so the Chinese are faced with a real crisis because we're telling them we're going to change the rules of the game, that have grow taskly favored you.And they're saying, we don't want to change the rules of the game, we like the fact they favor us. And that's what the core of this argument is, it's not anything complicated, the details are complex but the core principle is simple. China got to be this big and this wealthy because all the rules of the game favored them and we tolerated behavior that's intolerable.BARTIROMO: Right.GINGRICH: But I got a president who said enough and I think the Chinese have a big problem.BARTIROMO: Newt, look at these markets. I mean, the Chinese have a big problem, yes, I get that but are we going to have a big problem as well? Is this going to cut into economic growth take away all the benefits from the tax cut plan and look at our markets down 400 points right now.GINGRICH: Look, I think the market is responding psychologically, the underlying momentum of the American economy is fine and is going to accelerate. And in fact, if we rebuild our manufacturing as we have been under Trump with -- I think over 400,000 new manufacturing jobs, we're going to end up substituting American products. I tell you, you look at 5G and Huawei for example, you want to produce chips in the U.S. not produce chips in China.Now there are whole range of these issues where -- yes, you may actually see a bigger American economy, not a smaller one. And, again, I'm not a theoretical free trader and neither was Adam Smith who wrote The Wealth of Nations. I think when it's to our advantage we ought to have about open markets when it's not to our advantage, we ought to have closed markets.DEANGELIS: Speaker Gingrich, it's Jackie DeAngelis. The President taking a hard line here with China, it's unprecedented actually in many ways and a lot of economists are saying, if there's any time to do this and to have these negotiations play out even if it brings volatility to the stock market it's now because there is strength in this economy.GINGRICH: Right. I mean, the truth is, the Europeans are totally messed up with a welfare state system that doesn't work and with increasing pressure on Europe to fall apart as they are with Great Britain for example. The Chinese aren't going to have a lot of alternative markets. And ultimately we can take a fight with China on economics. So a lot better than the Chinese can take a fight with us.Their stock market will suffer worse. But I also -- and I know this goes against the spirit of a daily show, so I apologize. I don't worry about ups and downs in the stock market.BARTIROMO: Right.GINGRICH: I worry about long-term patterns and the long-term pattern right now for the U.S. is remarkable and the truth as Larry Kudlow has said, we are engaging in a prosperity cycle and there's every reason to believe it's going to continue and accelerate. We may be the only country in the world that can withstand this kind of pressure because our domestic economy has been liberated and our entrepreneurs are going a back to work.FREEMAN: Newt, Hi. James freeman at the Wall Street Journal. I want to ask you about -- how do you get a deal with China? We mentioned, Liu He is negotiating for China. Everyone seems to think he is a reformer. We saw with Blake Burman's report the things he was asking publicly seemed fairly reasonable. But then we read that paper has a story about China demanding that the deals of the trade agreement not be disclosed publicly.GINGRICH: Right.FREEMAN: Also saying they don't want to legislate against intellectual property theft. I mean, obviously, some of these demands we can take more seriously than others.BARTIROMO: Yes.GINGRICH: Look, first of all, understand, the People's Liberation Army runs entire units designed to steal. I mean, this is not some random behavior by three teenagers in Beijing, they entire units of People's Liberation Army who do nothing o full time except steal American intellectual property. So you're asking now to undertake changes in behavior that are excruciating.And I want to make a point here but in the audience so they understand what we're dealing with. Xi Jinping is the secretary general of the Communist Party, the chairman of the Military Commission and the President of China in that order.BARTIROMO: Yes.GINGRICH: This isn't -- automatically, they're not -- there are no moderates in China.BARTIROMO: Yes. There's also -- there's also a rule that no company can have any important or big innovation before going to the military. First all innovations have to be used for the military, that's the priority. So this is -- this is so much bigger than just trade. And I -- and I agree with you especially since --GINGRICH: And by the way --BARTIROMO: Yes. As China is like building up, you know, military bases across the world, setting up islands in the South China Sea, putting military bases on those islands.GINGRICH: Well, that's why I wrote a paper recently for members of Congress.BARTIROMO: Yes.GINGRICH: Outlining that the real issue with 5G and Huawei is it's the first worldwide struggle with China where they've had a very clever, very intelligent strategy. My hats off to them. They're smart people but we need -- we need to understand, this is going to be a big, long-term struggle and they're not going to cave.BARTIROMO: Yes.GINGRICH: They're not going to suddenly turn around and say, oh, gee, let us be nice people.BARTIROMO: Well, we'll see -- I mean, we'll see if it takes economic growth out of the good numbers that we've been seeing. Before you go, Newt, I got to ask you about the Mueller report in the fallout. The President tweeted last night this, despite two years and millions of dollars spent, the Democrats are acting like crazed lunatics. Ever since the results of the Mueller report will made public but they knew there was nothing even before the report was started.It was all a big hoax, the biggest in American history. On "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" yesterday, my exclusive interview with Senator Lindsey Graham. He gave us an update on declassifying documents related to the Steele dossier and the FISA abuse. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: I don't know why the President hasn't done it yet, he said that he will do it, he told me that and others. Do you expect him to do it and what will we learn from those documents?SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Well, I think you will learn that the FBI was on notice that Christopher Steele was not a reliable informant when it came to Trump that he was being paid for by the Democratic Party, that his work product had not been vetted and that he was out to get Trump and they used the dossier anyway. I think you're going to learn a hot about how the counterintelligence investigation actually opened up.That Papadopoulos wasn't working with the Russians. They put it in his head that the Russians stole Clinton e-mails. All this will be coming sooner rather than later.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: So Newt, your reaction?GINGRICH: Well, first of all, Lindsey Graham is doing a very good job as chairman of the Judiciary Committee.BARTIROMO: Yes.FREEMAN: And he's laying out the right framework. My view as a historian is very simply, you had an attempted coup d'etat from Obama through the Attorney General to the FBI and we're going to learn more and more about it really sick it was.BARTIROMO: All right. Newt, it's great to see you this morning. Thank you so much. We are just getting headlines. China is issuing a statement on proposed tariffs. They're going to raise tariffs on U.S. We've got all the numbers for you right after this.BARTIROMO: All right. Welcome back. We have breaking news. And this is what seems to have caused another leg down in futures. China is specifying details of retaliatory tariffs this morning. Beijing raising import tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods. It's raising the rate from five percent to 25 percent on more than 5,000 U.S. products. The increased tariffs take effect June 1st.Futures have extended losses on this news. Beijing announcing this just in the last 10 minutes. Futures now showing a decline at the start of trading 500 points, that's two percent lower on the Dow. The S&P futures are down 58 points, also two percent. And the NASDAQ down almost three percent. It is down 206 points right now. 2.7 percent as China plans to set import tariffs against $60 billion of U.S. goods.This is likely going to impact the Chinese economy, as well as the U.S. economy. It is clear this is getting worse with these retaliatory tariffs. Uber also had a tough day on Friday falling below the offering price in the premarket. Trading this morning, it is down again. Deirdre Bolton is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with Uber now trading down 6.6 percent at 38 and change after being priced at 45. Deirde, this is just one story in a whole sea of red down there. How does it look?DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Yes, Maria. To your point we are watching Uber trade lower in this premarket and it has the unfortunate distinction this company of basically having one of the worst IPO days ever on Friday. We knew this. I noted down the statistic. First day dollar loss in U.S. history basically ever. So it looks like we're set up for that day two here.And of course, there's a lot of investors concerned about the fact that while the company has a lot of sales. It does not yet have a profit, that's a problem when you -- when you come to the public market. We're watching Lyft trading lower as well and you recall this of course, Maria, Lyft going public towards the end of March. Really casting this long shadow over Uber's IPO. There are even people who say Uber so mistimed coming public especially with all you've been discussing with your guests about China.It probably cause the delay Uber billions of dollars. Quick look at Wal- Mart and Target. Not quite selling CBD, oil-based products yet but gearing up. Our sources say for the day when they will, quietly meeting with retailers of numerous products including gummies and creams. Maria, back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Deirde. Thanks very much. Over the weekend, China said it will not be forced to swallow any bitter fruit. The Chinese have announced that they are going to be raising tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods. Market has taken another leg down on this news because this is going to cut into growth.FREEMAN: Yes, absolutely. I don't think you're being asked to swallow bitter fruit or loss face if the demand is stop stealing intellectual property. But look, these are the cause. You see the markets, it's almost like a law and physics. Tariffs go up stocks come down.BARTIROMO: Absolutely. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We have breaking news this morning. China has announced it will impose tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods. Effective June 1st. Earlier President Trump warned that retaliation against tariffs will only make the situation worse certainly has made things worse in terms of markets. Dow Industrials right now down 500 points, a minute ago down 474 right now.S& futures down 55 and the NASDAQ down 195 points, that is 2-1/2 percent. Joining us right now is Brandy Wine, Global Fixed Income Portfolio Manager, Jack McIntyre. And Jack, when stocks sell off people go and they buy treasuries at --(CROSSTALK)JACK MCINTYRE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER , GLOBAL FIXED INCOME: Yes. And they should -- they should always have treasuries in their asset allocation. This is probably a time to be adding to that because now that China is sort of retaliating, it's a matter of time until Trump sends out a tweet saying we're going to escalate it or something to that effect. So, yes, you need something that's a port in the storm U.S. treasury's sort of that role.BARTIROMO: And do you think yields stay where they are? What's your expectation on yields?MCINTYRE: So I've actually been bullish on treasury even before this escalation of trade tariffs because I think inflation is going to stay low. And I expect the 10-year treasury yields to head lower to that 210 area.BARTIROMO: Yes. 210. Right. 242 right now.MCINTYRE: Yes. I'm a big believer in the secular disinflationary influences versus the cyclical inflation. Where is the inflation? OK. So, wages are moving higher but there's something that's preventing that from heading into actual inflation.ROSCHELLE: If it goes to 210, the two-year now is at 210 or does it invert?MCINTYRE: It will stay -- it will invert. But, you know, OK, so I'm --ROSCHELLE: It will invert for different reasons.MCINTYRE: Yes. Because I -- but I think the curve is flat inverted because of inflation expectations are so anchored, I'm not sure if the growth scare that normally is embedded in a flat or inverted yield curve.BARTIROMO: So, you think the next move from the Fed is going to be a cut?MCINTYRE: I do and I think what we're seeing now is going to escalate. I know everybody is talking about the China is in a worse shape than the U.S. in terms of this trade escalation but hey, remember there's other things like tighten financial conditions. If U.S. equities continue to sell off there's a huge amount of wealth tied up in equities. That's going to be tightening financial conditions.If the dollar rallies as a -- sort of safe haven currency, that's a tightening of financial conditions. So, all those things point towards sort of the reason to own U.S. treasuries.ROSCHELLE: If more people who are treasury players, buyers, start thinking that the Fed is going to go cut. does that start to lower short-term rates down below two?MCINTYRE: It certainly could but I think the bar is very high for the fed to cut right now. It just -- I didn't think so until the last FMC when Powell talked about inflation sort of being transitory. I think that tells us that OK, the bar is got to be pretty for them to -- actually, I think either to cut rates or to tighten rates.BARTIROMO: Wow.ROSCHELLE: Now, the U.S. currency rising, China is falling. So maybe consumers are going to notice these tariffs after producers.BARTIROMO: Yes. And I think it's going to be -- so it's going to be a little bit interesting in here because -- right, if the companies are able to pass on the higher tariffs and that's going to be a tax on the consumer but if the dollar strengthens and maybe that's going to help offset some of that rise in price but, you know, it's going to be interesting. We know this administration does not want a strong dollar.I mean the trade negotiations, they are bringing currencies into play. So again, we're going to see this uncertainty here for a while.BARTIROMO: So you come into work this morning, you see a market down 500 points. What do you do?MCINTYRE: I'm going to stand pat, I'm going -- because I don't want to be reactionary because this is the environment where there's headlined risk, good or bad, I mean, I was surprised last week that we saw equities rally off their off lows Monday and Friday. I think we need to do more downside, you know, in terms of where price action goes. So we're going to sit here and watch and, you know, we just added treasuries recently. So we're going to kind of sort of ride this out --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: All right. We will be riding it out as well (INAUDIBLE) thank you so much. Jack McIntyre joining us there from Brandy Wine. Coming up. Breaking news. Futures are tanking this morning on new information this morning that China will place retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods going into China. Market is down 471 points on the Dow right now.Coming up next. We look at Iran. Former Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman will weigh in on China and Iran among other places. Back in a minute. .BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Monday, May 13th, your top stories right now at 8:31 a.m. East Coast. We have breaking news this morning. China has announced details of its retaliatory tariffs. Beijing setting import tariffs on $60 billion-worth of U.S. goods. They go into effect on June 1st from five percent to 25 percent. Futures have extended the losses on the news.Take a look, Futures right now indicating a decline of the start of trading 460 points on the Dow Industrials, S&P down 53, and the NASDAQ Futures right now down 188 points, that is 2.5 percent. Joining me right now is former Connecticut Senator, former Democratic Vice-Presidential Candidate and the Chairman of United Against Nuclear Iran, Chairman Joe Lieberman. Senator, it's great to have you.JOE LIEBERMAN, CHAIRMAN, UNITED AGAINST NUCLEAR IRAN: Maria, good to be with you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. I want to get to Iran in a minute, but let's start with China.LIEBERMAN: OK.BARTIROMO: They said that they would retaliate, they are retaliating. What is your reaction to this, and how big of an issue is this going to be for the U.S. economy?LIEBERMAN: Well, this is all predictable. I mean, not just a typical trade negotiation. President Trump has decided to challenge some of the policies of China and not just on the tariffs, but really more importantly I think to the administration, and to U.S., is the so-called structural economic policies that China follows; the way the government supports industries, the way they demand that American companies doing business, they give their technologies over to Chinese government. So, we're into -- if it's not a trade war, it certainly a trade tit-for-tat, and that hurts both economies and it will begin to affect the markets. But both economies, frankly, are strong including ours, which is at a high point right now. So, we can take it. But it we shouldn't let it go on too long.BARTIROMO: How do you stop, though? Because when you look at things that the Chinese pulled out on or backtracked out of, things like forcing the transfer of technology, things like, you know, putting into law that it is against the law to steal intellectual property, they don't want to go that extra step of actually making it a law. This is a cultural thing as I said a long time. How do you motive the move the needle on that?LIEBERMAN: Yes, it is cultural -- and basically, I think we've got to move the needle by saying to them, these policies that they've been following for decades now, no longer fit them. They're a mature economy. They're the second greatest economy in the world after ours. And if they continue to pursue these policies, it's going to hurt them economically because America is not going to buy their stuff and we're not going to sell there and that's not good for them. We're really intertwined with them. But here is the problem: A lot of this comes down to people, and leaders, President Trump, President Xi. For both in their own interest to have an agreement because the continuation of this trade war between U.S. and China, can cause problems for both economies. On the other hand, neither one of them wants to look like they lost the competition.BARTIROMO: Yes, they want to save face.LIEBERMAN: So, they got to both to save face, and they've got to figure out a way to do that, because really, that is in their mutual interest and I would say this the Chinese have to begin to step back on some of those so-called structural policies that are just not fair anymore.BARTIROMO: Well, it's not even just a business situation. I mean, this is also about the military. I mentioned, something earlier, that I had heard yesterday on my Sunday morning program: civil military fusion -- this is basically a rule in China, whereas if you're an innovator and your technology company coming out with a new idea, before going forward with it you have to first check with the military in China, to see if the military needs that technology. That's their priority. It's not just about being bigger than the United States, in terms of people, which of course, they are 1.4 billion people -- but it's being number one in many of the important industries that the U.S. wants to be number one in. So, they are right there competing with us on so many levels even militarily.LIEBERMAN: Yes, I've not heard of the idea of civil military fusion before. It's obviously not impossible. I mean, they a controlled economy, the government plays a large role in it. And their military, the people's liberation army, is a business, too. I mean, it runs businesses, it's like, the IRGC in Iran, unlike our Defense Department doesn't run businesses. So, it's truly human history that when new technologies are created, they tend to be when they can be used for military purposes.BARTIROMO: It makes perfect sense.LIEBERMAN: But the civil military fusion idea, turns it upside down. But let me go to your larger point, China is a -- it's not a communist company in the old-fashioned way anymore but it's still a country in which the government plays a large role they have dominant -- they have plans and government invest, and they want to about first in 5G technology. They want to be first in pharma in the future. So, they're going to be real competitors. And I think what these trade negotiations are really saying is: OK, let's compete U.S. and China, but you got to play by some rules that everybody else plays by.BARTIROMO: And there's no rules in terms of espionage, you know, they've got Huawei telecom throughout the world, and obviously, they are sending information data back to China, whether they're in countries in Africa, or countries in Europe. So, this is a lot bigger than just the trade sayings we've been talking about. You mentioned Iran; I want to talk about pressure on Iran because the U.S. Air Force says that B-52 bombers have been deployed to the Middle East as message to Iran.This comes as U.S. announced it's no longer extending waivers to countries doing any business with Iran; eight countries now losing that opportunity. Joe, you're out with new op-ed with former U.N. Ambassador Mark Wallace on Foxnews.com titled this: "Trump should toughen sanctions on Iran." In it you write, "To truly achieve maximum pressure on regime, President Trump needs to make sanctions airtight across Iran's economy. This means, plugging the sanctions gaps on the other critical pillar of Iran's energy export dependent economy: petrochemicals." Tell us more.LIEBERMAN: OK. So, the main point of the op-ed on the Fox News Web site, but also generally, (INAUDIBLE) United Against Nuclear Iran -- thank you to Trump administration. Thanks to President Trump he had the guts to take us out of a bad nuclear agreement with Iran. That's the beginning. Big change. Second, he imposed sanctions on the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, also big change in the -- and increased sanctions. Iran is hurting. So, it's begun to threaten us and I appreciate very much that the president has basically said with the action sending American military forces over to the region don't think you're going to strike at us and not have us strike back at you.So, now you've got the Iranian government the last few days, saying: one, President Rouhani says, this is going to believe to on our people, it's going October like Iran-Iraq war of the 80s when conditions were miserable in Iran and that shows you how seriously we're hurting -- Iranian government, really has a choice. Either they're going to come back to the table and negotiate, a good nuclear agreement, and stop supporting terrorism, or I think they're going to face an uprising by their own people the possibility of a regime change. And in my opinion, that would be the best of all.BARTIROMO: So, where do we go now? Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on his way there now making a stop in Brussels to talk about this threat from Iran. How do you see this playing out?LIEBERMAN: Well, I think we've got to hold tough, and we are holding tough. And the Iranians are on the defensive, our European allies, the Russians, the Chinese who signed that Iran nuclear agreement are complaining that we've -- come out of it. But I think in this one with Iran, we've got the -- you might say momentum on our side, this is not going to be easy, it's not without risk. But we changed reality on the ground and I think we've got to stick with where we're we are. The Russians will always, we've got to understand, try to take advantage of every situation to our detriment. They are not our allies. And that's why I think Secretary Pompeo talks directly with President Putin coming up in the next couple of days are really important.BARTIROMO: Well, what should be said during that meeting with Putin?LIEBERMAN: Well, I think -- I have enough confidence in Mike Pompeo to believe that he will say this to say that we have decided that, that Iran nuclear agreement is dead. And nobody is going to bring it back, and that the Iranians are our enemy: they're supporters of terrorism, they're supporting aggression through the Middle East, and they're threatening us, long term, that Russia better understand that this -- we've decided this is a priority national interest. In my opinion, it's the most significant threat; Iran constitutes the most significant threat to U.S. that there is in the world. And therefore, really, the basically say to President Putin stay out of this! Now, he's too often come into it in a calculating way to keep Iran going.BARTIROMO: Apparently, he even came into it on Venezuela, right?LIEBERMAN: He did way out of his part of the world.BARTIROMO: Right, exactly.LIEBERMAN: There is a story today, and it's alarming, but it's to be expected that some oil tankers too, which are owned by Saudi Arabia were victims of sabotage over the weekend. And although the Iranians have put out a diversionary statement, it's pretty clear that they're suspect number one -- we're in a major conflict in the Middle East between Iran one side and our allies: Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, Egypt, et cetera, and Israel on the other side -- and we've got to stick with our allies against our enemies.BARTIROMO: Do we have a coalition on any of the stuff? I mean, when you look at the rest of the world, our partners in Europe for example, do they get the Iran threat, and what about the China threat? Because I know that when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo came back from Poland a couple months ago, he was trying to explain to the European countries, our friends, not to use Huawei telecom. They've already paid for it. They've already, you know, put Huawei entrepreneur in place. But Pompeo was basically saying look, if you have Huawei Telecom, we'll need to share less with you; we will not be sharing as much information. So, do we have the coalition across the world?LIEBERMAN: It's not the same as it used to be. It's not the same as it was let's say in the cold war with Russia when we were clearly on the side of -- of the Europeans and we were on same side Western Europeans. Part of it is that China is intertwined with the world economy in a way that Soviet Union never was. If I'm not mistaken, China actually does more trade with European Union than it does with us today. And, therefore, we got to stand tough with our allies and say to them basically you can't always do what may bring a few more Euros.This is our security on the line we've got to stand together. So far, we've had an effect on their relations, European relations with China, but they're basically trying to walk a narrow line in some ways between us and China, also being closer to us, and that's one of the great tests. That's why, the strength and persistence of the Trump administration, including Secretary Pompeo, John Bolton, is going to be really important in the months ahead.BARTIROMO: Well, we are, this is the test. We're going to be facing another --LIEBERMAN: Amen.BARTIROMO: -- test right here as the Chinese have announced, that they will increase tariffs on $60 billion-worth of goods, beginning June 1. Senator, it's good to see you.LIEBERMAN: You, too, Maria. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Joe Lieberman, joining us on all of that. The markets have deteriorated further on this breaking news that the Chinese will pull in place $60 billion of new tariff on $60 billion-worth of goods coming from the U.S. into China. That tariff as high as 25 percent. Dow Futures down better than 500 points right now on these retaliatory tariffs coming out of China. Stuart Varney will weigh in when we come right back. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Futures have extended losses this morning as China has announced it will officially retaliate on tariffs. Beijing is imposing tariffs on $60 billion worth of goods, and they go into effect on June 1st. Markets are down 486 points on Dow right now.We are watching Uber as well, the second day of trading this morning after disaster on Friday. The company broke issue price and it is down another five percent right now. As you see 6 1/2 percent lower now on Uber. Joining me now host of "VARNEY & COMPANY" Stuart Varney to weigh in all above. Looks like we're going to have a tough day at the office this morning, Stu.STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I think you can say that for sure, Maria. I'm wondering is Uber being swept down in the general down market that we've got today because of China trade, or is it special problems to Uber and Lyft which are surfacing after public introduction last Friday.I see Uber on the screen now at $38.00 a share, went out $45.00 on Friday. With a private valuations put on company before they went public, were they just too high? Were they so high because of a scramble from angel investors who want to get down on ground floor for something new, they just bid up and bid it up to evaluation of about $120 billion one stage?That was clearly too high a private valuation, because they are below $70 billion. And as for Lyft, I think they suffer from same problems, a very high private valuation and then they're not making any money, and it's hard to see how they are going to make money.I'm troubled by all this because I really like these two companies on what they're doing in the marketplace of transportation. But unless they come up with a definite path to profitability in the future, I think they're going to have a hard time recovering from where they are now and I think other new tech companies coming to market this year will also have -- also have a very hard time.When is a unicorn not a dot-com? The answer, when it makes some serious money.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a good point. And I think that you are -- your comment about the path to profitability is really important. Uber lost $1.8 billion in EBITDA last year. The company whose money-losing -- but the key is they will growth investors will buy into it if they see that path. We don't see that path to profitability just yet.VARNEY: I don't -- I don't -- I'd like to see it -- because I love the technology, I love the company, it's not lot to invest.BARTIROMO: And it's a good idea.VARNEY: But I'm not going to invest until I see profit.BARTIROMO: Bigger issue today is obviously China, Stu, and I know you're going to have a lot more in ten minutes. We will see you at the top of the hour. "VARNEY & CO." begins every at 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after mornings with Maria so don't miss Stuart.We have breaking news that we are all covering this morning. The Dow plummeting more than 500 points, and moments ago on news that China is issuing retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods going into China. We're taking a closer look when we come right back. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Breaking news, Futures have extended the losses this morning. We are looking at a decline at the start of trading of 516 points after Beijing announced it will impose tariffs on $60 billion worth of goods. These new increased tariffs go into effect on June first. Markets took another leg down.And as you can see, James Freeman, many of the companies that are directly impacted by this trading down sharply this morning, Boeing jets obviously one of the most important exports the U.S. has into China, Caterpillar same thing, Apple, the iPhone, all these stocks trading down on the idea that the products are about to get much more expensive.FREEMAN: Yes, this is sand in the gears of commerce. So it's more expensive for consumers, obviously, it's more expensive for producers as they buy components, and now as they sell into China. So the President is saying that this is helping the economy, it's long-term.We know that higher tariffs add costs, reduce investment, reduce incomes. The question is will this work as leverage to force the better deal we want?BARTIROMO: Yes, because President has another whole $300 billion -- $350 billion worth of goods, that he has threatened could see a tariff as well. So far, that he hasn't touched.DEANGELIS: He hasn't but that's his counterpunch, right. He was waiting to see what China would do. Now they have done it so I think that's the next step we watch for.BARTIROMO: And he already said, I think it was last week, Mitch, that the plans are in place. We've begun looking at this.FREEMAN: Right. It will be -- anything we import from China will be subject to a tariff of some amount.BARTIROMO: Now, Nancy Lazar from Cornerstone Macro says it's going to take two-tenths of a percent out of the U.S. economy. Does that jive with what you are thinking in terms of how much growth this takes away?ROSCHELLE: The -- you have to follow the point of question which is that short term or long term. Long term, yes. In short term, actually the trade war has been positive for GDP growth, but that is short term number not a long term.BARTIROMO: All right, let's slip in a quick break. When we come back, we are digesting news of China retaliatory tariffs this morning. We're watching these markets fall out of bed down 495 points on the Dow. More in a minute.BARTIROMO: Well, we are watching a breakdown in markets. Dow Industrials down 505 points. Futures extending the losses after China retaliates on tariffs. Beijing will impose tariffs of $60 billion worth of goods that go into effect on June 1st. Where does this go, Mitch Roschelle?ROSCHELLE: I think that this is just going to continue to be a new story, it's going to continue to disrupt the markets. All the while, negotiations are going on behind the scenes, in front of the scenes, but the market is going to look for puffs of white smoke for something that is positive.BARTIROMO: James?FREEMAN: Yes, it's bad for growth but it does hurt China more than it hurts us. I think the big question is how long Xi Jinping can hold the hard line.BARTIROMO: Yes, good point because China's economy is going to worsen.DEANGELIS: It's definitely going to get worse here too, in terms of the market before it gets better.BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. Jackie DeAngelis, James Freeman, Mitch Roschelle, thank you. Great show. Have a great day, everybody.Load-Date: May 13, 2019End of Document

Summers, Tung Chee-hwa, Zhang Lei, Zhou Xiaochuan and 500 global business and government leaders gather at second annual forum to discuss emerging economies and technologiesPR NewswireMay 20, 2019 Monday 7:00 PM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2444 wordsDateline: NEW YORK and BEIJING, May 20, 2019 BodyPR Newswire Bloomberg and the China Center for International Economic Exchanges (CCIEE) today announced that the 2019New Economy Forum will be held in Beijing on November 20-22 on the shores of Yanqi Lake, looking out at the Great Wall. Nearly 500 of the world's most influential business executives, technology innovators, government officials, experts and academics from over 60 countries and regions will gather in Beijing to propose solutions to the massive disruption that's occurring, as the balance of global economic power shifts towards the Asia Pacific.The new economy will increasingly be shaped by emerging powers as well as by advanced technologies, while an industrial revolution is fostering critical developments in the fields of science and technology, trade and finance.  At the same time, trade protectionism is on the rise and multilateral institutions such as the WTO are facing challenges. Will conflicts over trade push countries to continue building walls that impede the flow of ideas, people, capital and other critical elements of production? Can collaboration enable growth that is inclusive and sustainable? The leaders attending the New Economy Forum are committed to working together and sharing insights to address looming challenges that could imperil prosperity and social stability.Launched in 2018 by Michael R. Bloomberg, Founder of Bloomberg L.P. and Bloomberg Philanthropies, and Three-Term Mayor of New York City, the New Economy Forum is committed to promoting the smooth transition from the old economy -- one based on labor-intensive manufacturing and trade in goods -- to a new one focused on industrial automation, digital services and exchanges of data. The New Economy Forum has become a unique global convening platform where businesses and governments, using facts and data, can engage in an open exchange of ideas on how to ease the global transition that is underway.Co-hosted by Bloomberg and the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, the 2019 New Economy Forum will focus on the topics of global economic governance, trade, technology, finance and capital markets, climate change, urbanization and inclusion. The forum will search for solutions to key challenges and issues brought about by global economic transitions, explore how to foster critical development drivers in the new economic era, promote sustainable development, reduce inequality and address climate change worldwide."We are experiencing a period of profound change in the world, where new economic centers are emerging, new trading alliances are being formed and new technologies are upending industries," said Michael R. Bloomberg. "The New Economy Forum will address these seismic shifts through high-level and frank dialogue, while also fostering private-public collaboration. China is an integral part of these discussions, and the New Economy Forum will bring leaders there from around the world to tackle common challenges and advance our shared interests."The forum's Advisory Board includes many of the world's most influential government and business leaders, led by former U.S. Secretary of State and National Security AdvisorDr. Henry A. Kissingeras Honorary Chair, along with former U.S. Treasury Secretary and Paulson Institute ChairmanHenry M. Paulson, Jr.andZeng Peiyan, Former Vice Premier of the State Council, PRC and Chairman of CCIEE, as co-Chairs.  Dr. Henry A. Kissinger said, "The world is undergoing a historic transformation. Different societies, themselves in flux, are seeking ways of shaping their relationships with each other in a manner that promotes new avenues of peace and progress. China and the United States, as the two largest economies and technologically most advanced countries, have a critical role in this process. The New Economy Forum will provide an opportunity for this global dialogue among outstanding personalities. I support the visionary initiative of my long-time friend, Mike Bloomberg, in setting up this forum and look forward to participating."Zeng Peiyan said, "Today's world is facing a once-in-a-century transition. A new round of technological revolution and industrial transformations are profoundly changing the world. New economies, new businesses and new growth drivers are developing robustly, emerging economies are growing rapidly, and the reform of global governance systems and international order are accelerating. The world is full of hope and challenges. Developed and developing countries should work together to build a peaceful, prosperous and beautiful community for all mankind."Henry M. Paulson, Jr. said, "In the spirit of its founder, The Bloomberg New Economy Forum is action-oriented and focused on achieving real results. At a time when governments and businesses around the world are buffeted by new and emerging risks, the forum provides an opportunity for leaders to better understand these challenges and forge joint solutions."We are pleased to receive the support and participation of our advisors, including:Henry A.

Rep. Harley Rouda Introduces Bipartisan House Bill to Protect Rail and Bus Manufacturing From Chinese ThreatsTargeted News ServiceMay 15, 2019 Wednesday 7:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 955 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Harley Rouda, D-California, issued the following news release:Today Rep. Harley Rouda (D-CA), along with a bipartisan group of lawmakers, Reps. Rick Crawford (R-AR), Scott Perry (R-PA), Kay Granger (R-TX), Tim Ryan (D-OH), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), Randy Weber (R-TX), and John Garamendi (D-CA) introduced the Transportation Infrastructure Vehicle Security Act, a bill combatting Chinese efforts to undermine the U.S. economy and national security. The bill would prevent federal transit funds from being used by transit agencies to procure Chinese rail assets and ensure transit agencies develop and execute a cybersecurity plan. In the Senate, the bill is led by Senators John Cornyn (R-TX), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Mike Crapo (R-ID), and Sherrod Brown (D-OH)."I'm proud to be the lead sponsor of this important piece of legislation with Senator John Cornyn (R-TX)," said Rouda. "China's 'Made in China 2025' initiative is an unmistakable effort to harm American manufacturers by subsidizing Chinese rail and bus industries. Chinese companies misrepresent themselves as benevolent actors, but let's be clear: this is an attack on our economy and national security. I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for coming together to stop the flow of Americans' taxpayer dollars to Chinese state-owned or state-supported companies."Said Congressman Crawford, "When Chinese companies swoop in to undercut contract bids for American rail projects, their only goal is to decimate our manufacturing sector by dumping cheap parts into our economy, while stealing intelligence and threatening our national security. The Transportation Infrastructure Vehicle Security Act is absolutely critical to protect our nation against foreign threats and cybersecurity attacks which have become more prevalent in this digital age.""Our government should use taxpayer dollars to support American manufacturing and jobs, not Chinese state-owned companies. By consistently underbidding, these heavily-subsidized Chinese rail and bus manufacturers have already won transit contracts in Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles. It should concern every American that we have entrusted the safety and security of U.S. transit systems to the Chinese government--our fierce competitor and cyber adversary," said Congressman Ryan. "While we're stuck in a 24-hour news cycle, China is devising and executing plans to dominate global industries and markets over the next 10, 50, and 100 years. Let this be a wake-up call for the United States. It's time we take the economic and national security threat posed by China seriously, and this bill does just that.""I appreciate the bipartisan leadership in this effort to counter China's growing threat to infiltrate and undermine American industries. Our bipartisan proposal is a common sense way to protect the American People and defend our National security. Thanks to Congressman Harley Rouda and Senator John Cornyn for their work on this important legislation," Said Congressman Perry."The security of public transit in the nation's capital must be a top priority," Congresswoman Norton said. "China is not making these railcars so cheaply out of the goodness of its heart. Until we have irrefutable evidence, we must not turn a blind eye to the clear incentive China has to monitor our capital and undermine our security."The Chinese government continues to use a range of state subsidies and predatory practices to support its market ascension in certain sectors of the United States' economy. Two of these sectors, rail manufacturing and bus manufacturing, are included as part of China's "Made in China 2025" initiative, a plan targeting global dominance in areas that the Chinese government considers most strategic to its global aims.Chinese state-owned and state-supported enterprises have used subsidized "bargain prices" well-below competitive market price to win contracts throughout the United States. A number of large, metropolitan areas have recently awarded rail rolling stock procurements to a Chinese state-owned enterprise. There are a number of threats these procurements pose including impeding economic competitiveness and overtaking the supply chains that support United States public transportation agencies. Chinese state-owned and state-supported enterprises have increased security vulnerabilities and create new risks for rolling stock procurements.Specifically, the Transit Infrastructure Vehicle Security Act would enact:- Limitation on Certain Rolling Stock Procurements: This legislation prevents federal transit dollars from being used to award a contract or subcontract for the procurement of passenger rail cars or transit buses to Chinese state-owned, controlled or subsidized enterprises. The bill would create a certification process for transit agencies to ensure their funds are not being used to purchase rolling stock from a covered manufacturer. A narrow exception would be made for transportation agencies with a pre-existing contract or subcontract with a covered rail rolling stock manufacturer executed prior to the date of enactment.- Cybersecurity Certification: Given the level of technology and growing complexity of rail rolling stock assets, it is important that proper cybersecurity standards are in place. This legislation would require any transit operator that operates rail transit service to develop and execute a plan for identifying and reducing cybersecurity risks. Recipients of federal transit assistance would be required to review best practices and to identify any hardware and software components of new rolling stock assets that should undergo third-party testing.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6729695 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: May 16, 2019End of Document

U.S. EASES UP ON HUAWEI AS TAIWAN BOOSTS CHINA-LINKED TRADE, MEDIA PENALTIESStates News ServiceMay 21, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1001 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Washington on Tuesday moved to temporarily dial back trade restrictions on Chinese telecoms giant Huawei in a bid to limit disruption to its customers, extending the company's license to buy U.S.-made goods until August.Huawei was banned from buying U.S. goods by the Commerce Department last week over national security concerns, while Google on Monday announced it was terminating some updates to its Android operating system supplied to the company.The administration of President Donald Trump had earlier added Huawei, the second-biggest manufacturer of smartphones, to a list of banned companies.U.S. companies can only sell to or buy from those companies if they are granted a special license to do so.Google said on Monday it was "complying with the order and reviewing the implications," amid fears that users of Huawei smartphones would experience a loss of functionality and access to Google apps.Huawei has been awarded a license to buy U.S. goods until Aug. 19, in a bid to maintain existing telecoms networks and provide software updates to Huawei smartphones.However, the company is still barred from buying U.S.-made hardware and software to make new products.The move against Huawei came amid an ongoing trade war between Beijing and Washington.Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei said his company had been making preparations for such a scenario anyway."The U.S. government's actions at the moment underestimate our capabilities," Ren said in an interview with state broadcaster CCTV.He said Huawei wouldn't change its mission as a result of the U.S. sanctions, however."Huawei won't reject the United States or pursue narrow and self-centered development," Ren said. "We still need to grow together."Supply claims questionedBut he said Huawei has everything it needs."Even if we do run into supply problems, we won't be in difficulty, because we already have all of the high-end chips we need," he said.A government insider in China said Ren's words were mostly addressed to the ruling Chinese Communist Party leadership in Beijing."Ren Zhengfei's comments spring from the situation he finds himself in, and they're aimed at the party; at the people who control him," the source said. "There are many layers of meaning here."And a U.S.-based industry insider said there are doubts about Ren's claim to have plenty of supply options."This isn't very likely," the source said. "However, it does have another option, if Google refuses to collaborate with Huawei any more, and that is to develop the Android open source operating system.""They could take the open source version of Android and develop that," he said.Meanwhile, Taiwan's government is likely to approve draft amendments to the democratic island's Foreign Trade Act that would prevent companies from shipping products made in China with a "Made in Taiwan" certificate of origin.Chinese exporters have been routing their products, transferring them to new containers, and sending to the U.S. under Taiwan certificates of origin, Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs has said.Companies found guilty of illegally exporting "strategic high-tech goods" or using false certificates of origin for transshipped goods could be fined up to U.S.$96,000, under the newly amended law.Lawmakers also outlined plans to tighten restrictions on Chinese media and lobbying activities ahead of the 2020 presidential elections in Taiwan, a sovereign state known as the Republic of China.'Red media' controversyNew Power Party convenor Hsu Yung-ming said the goal is to prevent the Chinese Communist Party government or military from interfering with Taiwan's democracy through advertising and political lobbying."There has been quite a lot of controversy around the 'red media' lately," Hsu told journalists. "We believe that, this close to the elections, [the Chinese threat isn't just about] an actual warship... actually, media penetration is more powerful than that."The China Times media group was cited as having received Chinese funds and blurred the line between advertising and news, lawmaker Huang Kuo-chang said, but was only sanctioned with a small fine."It is clear from these violations that the regulations, penalties and implementation have proved inadequate for dealing with serious problems in the past ... [the penalties are] too lenient," Hwang said.Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council has warned that media outlets ultimately controlled by the Chinese Communist Party often "disseminate misinformation" among the island's 23 million residents.It has warned that the ultimate goal of Chinese President Xi Jinping is to destroy the 1911 Republic of China, which retreated to the islands of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu after the then-ruling Kuomintang (KMT) lost a civil war to Mao Zedong's communists in 1949.In a Jan. 2 speech titled "Letter to our Taiwan compatriots," Xi said Taiwan must be "unified" with China, and refused to rule out the use of military force to annex the island.President Tsai Ing-wen replied that Taiwan would never give up its sovereignty to be "unified" with China under the "one country, two systems" framework applied to the former colonial cities of Hong Kong and Macau.Taiwan was ruled as a Japanese colony in the 50 years prior to the end of World War II, but was handed back to the 1911 Republic of China under the Kuomintang (KMT) government as part of Tokyo's post-war reparation deal.It has never been controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, nor formed part of the People's Republic of China.The country began a transition to democracy following the death of Chiang Kai-shek's son, President Chiang Ching-kuo, in January 1988 , starting with direct elections to the legislature in the early 1990s and culminating in the first direct election of a president, Lee Teng-hui, in 1996.Reported by Qiao Long for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Chung Kuang-cheng and Ma Lap-hak for the Cantonese Service.

Google may just have killed Huawei's bid to become the world's top smartphone brandCNN WireMay 20, 2019 Monday 9:50 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 844 wordsByline: By Sherisse Pham, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Google is restricting Huawei's access to its Android operating system and apps after the Trump administration blacklisted the Chinese tech firm.The move is a huge blow to Huawei, whose goal is to be the top smartphone brand by the end of 2020.Last week, the Trump administration barred American companies from selling to Huawei without a US government license in a significant escalation of the trade war with China."We are complying with the order and reviewing the implications," a Google spokesperson said on Monday. Huawei, the world's No. 2 smartphone seller, relies on a suite of Google services for its devices, including the Android system and the Google Play app store. The Silicon Valley giant is suspending much of that access, according to multiple reports, after Washington placed Huawei on a list of foreign firms deemed to undermine American national security or foreign policy interests. Listed companies are barred from receiving components and software unless the trade is licensed. Existing Huawei phones unaffectedHuawei will only be able to use the public version of Android and will not be able to access apps and services from Google. The news was first reported by Reuters. Google said consumers who already own Huawei smartphones will be largely unaffected for now."Google Play and the security protections from Google Play Protect will continue to function on existing Huawei devices," the spokesperson added, without providing further details. The ban threatens Huawei's supply chain and could delay the rollout of 5G services around the world. But the most immediate headache for Huawei is what the decision means for future smartphone sales. Most of Google's most popular products --- like Gmail, YouTube and Google Maps --- are banned in China, where Huawei offers domestic alternatives like Tencent's WeChat and Baidu Maps. But the company is hugely dependent on countries other than China. Roughly half its smartphone sales last year were made outside China, according to research firms Canalys and IDC.Huawei said it is "examining the implications from the US actions for consumers," adding that it will continue to provide "security updates and after sales services" for all existing smartphones and tablets, including its Honor budget brand. China's response: 'Wait and see'The Chinese tech company said it has spent at least three years working on its own operating system. "Huawei has been building an alternative operating system just in case it is needed," said Huawei spokesperson Glenn Schloss. "We would like to be able to continue operating in the Microsoft and Google ecosystems," he added. Huawei licenses Microsoft's operating system for its laptops and tablets. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Beijing has repeatedly criticized the US-led campaign against Huawei, and called the addition of the company to the trade blacklist a political move. "China supports Chinese companies defending their legitimate rights according to laws," Lu Kang, a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a press briefing on Monday. "In terms of what measures either Chinese companies or Chinese government would take, please wait and see," he said. Killing Huawei outside China?Being cut off from the Google ecosystem would be a huge blow to Huawei's ambitions to overtake Samsung as the world's biggest smartphone maker. The consumer business --- which includes smartphones, laptops, tablets and wearable devices like smart watches --- was the biggest contributor to Huawei's earnings last year. The division made nearly 349 billion yuan ($50 billion) in 2018, accounting for more than 45% of revenue. For the millions of users outside of China, being cut off from Google's apps and services "kills the attractiveness of a Huawei phone," said IDC analyst Bryan Ma. "It kills the usability of a Huawei phone outside of China, thus rendering them dead in the water," he added.Theoretically, Huawei can try to win over consumers with its competitive hardware and innovation, and then convince them to download Google apps after they buy a Huawei phone, said Nicole Peng, an analyst with Canalys. But evidence shows that "after sales installation is very challenging for users, unless they know what they're doing," said Peng. Moreover, when customers start finding out that Huawei can't get Google's ecosystem on their phones, "it will affect trust, they will question if anything is wrong with the device," she added. Even if customers were able to independently download Google apps on Huawei phones, the phones may still not have access to so-called Google Mobile Services.Many third party apps, like ride hailing and food delivery platforms, rely on services like Google Maps. Most of those apps may no longer be supported on Huawei devices, said IDC's Ma. Without that access, "the Huawei phone is a brick," he said. Rob Mclean and Nanlin Fang contributed to this report. TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

FedEx Denies Delivery of Huawei P30 Pro in the USStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeJune 24, 2019 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MARKETS; Pg. 1Length: 439 wordsByline: Jean GarciaBodyIn the second such incident since the U.S. government placed China's Huawei on its Entity List, a package sent to the United States by Huawei Technologies through US-based FedEx was returned to the company, causing the Chinese government to threaten to place FedEx on an "Unreliable entities list", according to a new report by Reuters. Two packages containing "urgent documents" which were sent from Japan ended up being sent to the US.FedEx Corp has apologized for another Huawei delivery "mistake", reigniting Chinese ire and drawing the fire of state media which suggested the us delivery firm could end up on China's upcoming list of companies that harm national interests. But he was surprised by the phone did not reach its destination in the US, but was instead returned to him in the United Kingdom.Huawei's future especially as it concerns smartphones continues to be in doubt in the face of the recent U.S. ban. Huawei, which is controlled by the Chinese government according to some of its critics, said the ban will cost it $30 billion in revenue a year. A new report says that American shipping company FedEx is refusing to ship Huawei phones now. No. Representatives from #Huawei, UPS and PCMag slam the courier's vendetta.The latest incident has sparked renewed criticism of FedEx on Chinese social media.Indian central bank deputy governor Acharya resigns earlyIn an unexpected development, RBI deputy governor Viral Acharya quit, almost six months ahead of the end of his three-year term. The institution and the cabinet, in particular, have been at odds over the use of the RBI's excess reserves.FedEx did not respond immediately to a Reuters request for comment early on Sunday.This development means the trade war between the United States and China has now assumed a new dimension; and could adversely worsen the situation Huawei found itself since the trade embargo was announced by the USA government.The protracted battle between the United States and China ramped up Monday - not over a new slate of tariffs or political jousting, but over a FedEx package.China's state-run newspaper the Global Times tweeted on Sunday that FedEx is likely to be added to the Chinese government's upcoming "unreliable entities" list of foreign firms, groups and individuals that harm the interests of Chinese companies. It's because of that we now know that FedEx is taking a rather unusual stance against Huawei and the Chinese government in light of the trade ban. "China could get our attention pretty quick if it did something like that", said Miller, adding that such a move would significantly disrupt global trade networks.Load-Date: June 25, 2019End of Document

Chinese surveillance firm's stock plunges after reports of possible US banCNN WireMay 22, 2019 Wednesday 7:44 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 509 wordsByline: By Sherisse Pham, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Shares in Chinese surveillance company Hikvision plunged on Wednesday, following a report that the Trump administration is mulling slapping it with a US export ban. Hikvision stock plummeted the daily limit of 10% during early morning trading in Shenzhen. It recovered some of those losses to close about 6% lower. The drop came after the New York Times reported that the United States is considering placing the Chinese surveillance technology firm on a trade blacklist, citing people familiar with the matter. The move would be Washington's latest attempt to curb Beijing's tech ambitions, and a further escalation of the US-China trade war. "Hikvision takes these concerns very seriously and has engaged with the US government regarding all of this since last October," a company spokesperson said in a statement on Wednesday. "Separately, Hikvision takes cybersecurity very seriously as a company and follows all applicable laws and regulations in the markets we operate," the spokesperson said. The US Department of Commerce did not respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours. Hikvision manufactures surveillance cameras and security products powered by artificial intelligence. The company says its products can track people using facial recognition or physical characteristics such as gait, count the number of people who visit specific areas, and detect "unusual behavior like a violent action." Hikvision has faced international criticism for its surveillance deals in Tibet and Xinjiang, with US lawmakers last year urging sanctions against the company and accusing it of helping China create a "high-tech police state."The Chinese government has stepped up surveillance in the country's western Xinjiang province as part of a crackdown on the region's Uyghur Muslim population. Its presence in Tibet, an internationally recognized autonomous region, is also disputed by the Tibetan population and has boiled over into large scale riots in the past.The reported US move on Hikvision would be similar to the restrictions placed on Chinese tech giant Huawei last week. The US Department of Commerce would place Hikvision on a list of foreign firms deemed to undermine American national security or foreign policy interests. Listed companies are barred from receiving components and software unless the trade is licensed.Hikvision buys computer chips and components from US companies such as Nvidia, Western Digital, Intel and Seagate. Brokerage firm Jefferies said in a note Wednesday that a US ban would not hit Hikvision as hard as it did Huawei. The company can buy critical parts for its artificial intelligence products from local distributors, said Jefferies analyst Rex Wu. In a note last month, Wu said he expects Hikvision's annual revenue to be boosted by "China's central government procurement platform," noting that "Xinjiang's public security budget for 2019 is still rising" compared to a year earlier. TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

CONGRESS: Republicans say transition to renewables empowers ChinaClimateWireApril 30, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLCSection: Politics; Vol. 10; No. 9Length: 780 wordsBodyEvery wind turbine installed in the United States could make us more vulnerable to Chinese threats. That's the concern of a number of Republicans who want to transition more slowly to a carbon-free economy. In recent discussions around the Green New Deal, some Republican lawmakers have raised new worries about clean energy: Increasing renewable power undermines America's global position compared with China. At a hearing earlier this month in the Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) said that moving away from fossil fuels would empower China, which supplies much of the rare earth metals used in clean energy componentry. It was an argument for not addressing climate change based on issues of economics and national security. "From a national security standpoint, are we playing right into China's hands by eschewing what we have in our country, literally hundreds of years of resources at our availability and into an economy based on what they have essentially dominating and continue to seek to be dominant in," he said. More than 90% of the world's supply of rare earth metals are mined in China. That touches on many facets of everyday life, because the metals are found in smartphones, battery-powered devices and advanced weapons systems. Now, some Republicans are pointing to the origin of those metals as an argument for supporting fossil fuels, like U.S.-based coal. It comes as most countries across the globe are scaling up their use of wind, solar, hydro and other renewable energies to meet their commitments under the Paris climate agreement. The current supply of some rare earth metals is insufficient for such a large transition, according to a report by the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management published late last year. "Looking at the global scale, scenarios in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement require the global production of some metals to grow at least twelvefold towards 2050, compared to today's output," the report said. "Specifically, the demand for neodymium, terbium, indium, dysprosium, and praseodymium stands out. This calculation does not include the demand for these specific metals in other applications, such as electric vehicles or consumer electronics." Mining rare earth metals is costly and time consuming. It can take 10 to 20 years to open a mine, according to the Dutch report. China mines about 93% of the world's rare earth metals, according to the Stanford University School of Earth, Energy and Environmental Sciences. Solar panels use tellurium, which is one of the rarest elements on Earth. A single Tesla uses 15 pounds of lithium, according to Stanford researchers. Republicans from oil- and gas-producing states say the Green New Deal, an ambitious vision to confront climate change by halting the use of fossil fuels, threatens to make the United States less secure. At an Oversight and Reform Committee hearing earlier this month, Rep. Kelly Armstrong (R-N.D.) said he was concerned that the conversation around increasing renewables doesn't acknowledge that it could benefit America's adversaries. He said that "there's no separating the Chinese government, the Chinese communist government from Chinese business." Armstrong also raised a concern that importing more metals means more pollution is outsourced to other countries. "As we transition to more batteries, whether it's large-scale storage batteries for solar, large-scale batteries for wind, car batteries as we move to more electric, market pressures that are going to create processing -- or incentives for processing plants in countries that, again, have none of our environmental incentives," he said, "I don't want to export pollution, and I think we have to be continuing to have that conversation." Armstrong cited China's reaction after Japan detained a fishing captain near the disputed East China Sea islands in 2010. As retaliation, China enacted a de facto ban on exporting rare earth metals to Japan that lasted for months, and the captain was returned, he said. At the same hearing, Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) said that "Democrat socialists" want to get rid of all energy sources except wind, solar and batteries by 2030. He said the Green New Deal must address the national security implications of accepting rare earth metals from China. "This comes from the Mojave Desert out in Arizona," Gosar said as he held up a chunk of metal that he said was mined in his state. "It's all over the desert. Yet we have no ambition whatsoever. We are anti-mining on the other side. We don't want to do any of this. So how are we going to do that when we allow China to be the monopoly? Batteries are another problem."Load-Date: May 28, 2019End of Document

How the Trump administration won a major policy shift from the Chinese on fentanylCNN WireMay 2, 2019 Thursday 6:14 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1851 wordsByline: By David Shortell, CNNDateline: WASHINGTON (CNN) BodyWASHINGTON (CNN) --  Officials from the Office of National Drug Control Policy were preparing a briefing for President Donald Trump late last year ahead of his meeting with the Chinese President at the G20 summit when they decided they needed a visual aid to drive home their point.An aide ran down to the group's office and pulled up a Los Angeles Times article headlined "Fentanyl smuggled from China is killing thousands of Americans." ONDCP Director Jim Carroll handed it to the President minutes later in the Oval Office."That's what I want," Trump said, scrawling "you have to help us with this" onto the printed story and telling his staff to send it to Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to a senior White House official familiar with the incident. Days later, Trump pressed Xi on the issue in person, in the opening moments of a steak dinner that capped the Buenos Aires conference.An agreement won in that meal -- and taking effect this week -- will see China schedule fentanyl and its derivatives as a controlled substance, a victory for the Trump administration that the White House says could initiate an immediate and "fairly rapid decrease" in overdose deaths in the US.The move, which came as the two countries grappled in an escalating trade war, was the product of months of lobbying by the Trump administration after a turn towards a harder line on the topic in 2017, multiple officials involved in the process told CNN.Over the next year and a half, negotiators chipped away at Chinese recalcitrance towards policy change to their drug market, and their belief that fentanyl enforcement was only a political whim of Trump's. Senior congressional leaders, and Trump himself, were dispatched to bring it home.When Trump sat down with Xi in Buenos Aires, the table had been set for the deal."This could be a game changer on what is considered to be the worst and most dangerous, addictive and deadly substance of them all," Trump tweeted after winning the concession from Xi.Fentanyl, an extremely potent synthetic opioid, has been the driver of record overdose deaths in recent years. In 2017, fentanyl and its derivatives were behind close to 30,000 of the 72,000 overdose deaths in the US, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.While it has legitimate use as a painkiller, illicit fentanyl has been used by drug traffickers as an inexpensive additive to other illegal drugs, namely heroin.Import from ChinaChina is the leading producer of illegal fentanyl, according to drug enforcement officials, and outside the legal pharmaceutical industry, it is readily available for purchase on dark web marketplaces where its shipped to the US and Mexico through the mail.Since the two countries began cooperating over the drug's enforcement, China has scheduled dozens of fentanyl derivatives as controlled substances, enabling law enforcement there to arrest manufacturers of certain strands outside of the regulatory framework, and creating a measurable downturn in the shipment of those strands to the US, according to DEA statistics.Fentanyl's chemical compound, however, can be easily manipulated to create endless new analogues outside of the prohibited classes, and the Chinese, who officials involved in the negotiations say challenged the drug's role in the US opioid crisis, were reluctant to address the flow of fentanyl in a systemic way.The Chinese pharmaceutical landscape is inherently hard to police, and some global drug experts are skeptical that the country's new policy will be successful. Official counts put the number of chemical companies in China at 160,000, with some estimates as high as 400,000. Drug production facilities range from corporate conglomerates to backwoods operations.At the same time, China is believed to have only about 2,000 drug inspectors, according to Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institute."There are still too few regulators," Felbab-Brown said. "Now, legally, China is capable of taking action and going after people who illegally sell fentanyl into the United States. That does not necessarily mean that China easily has the capacity to in fact enforce the new law."Earlier attempts by the US to propose more moderate changes to China's drug scheduling laws were met with handwringing."We got varying responses from the Chinese that were, 'the legislation's too hard,' 'it's going to take a long time,' 'we can't do that,' 'it's not right to ask us to do that,' " the senior White House official said.In the summer of 2017, US drug enforcement officials decided to aim for a loftier goal: full class scheduling of fentanyl and all of its derivatives, a regulatory framework that would institutionalize Chinese fentanyl production and leave any rogue producers subject to arrest.Later that year, Trump presented the idea to Xi on a visit to China and secured nominal support. That first outreach, according to a State Department official, signaled the seriousness of the US resolve on the issue, and kickstarted a lobbying effort by the US Embassy in Beijing and drug enforcement officials across the administration.When Terry Branstad, a former governor of Iowa, was installed that year as the ambassador to China, stemming the flow of Chinese fentanyl to the US was one of the top stated priorities of his posting.Over the next several months, diplomats in China honed their pitch to show the Chinese that full class scheduling would be an opportunity for them to fix a bad reputation they had earned in the US."Dating back to the Obama administration, the US argument has been that China has a reputational challenge in the United States, where it more often is associated with problems for American people than solutions. Curbing the flow of fentanyl provides an opportunity for Beijing to show it is helping to solve problems for Americans, rather than be the source of them," said Ryan Hass, a former director for China at the National Security Council.The US Embassy in Beijing also struggled to convince the Chinese that the fentanyl problem in the US wasn't just a political interest of the Trump administration, but a more widespread US government priority, according to a second State Department official.That changed in late October 2018, just days before the US midterm elections, when a group of seven congressional leaders on a trade mission arrived in Beijing with a directive from Branstad."Before we went, Ambassador Branstad said when you come don't just talk about trade, persuade the Chinese leaders of the importance of them stopping the flow of fentanyl into the United States because they don't believe it's that big a problem," Sen. Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican who lead the delegation, said in an interview."Every meeting we had it was the first question we brought up," Alexander said. "They were skeptical and disbelieving and I think a little insulted that I would say that almost all the fentanyl that comes into the United States one way or the other starts in China according to our drug enforcement agency."After several meetings over the course of the four-day trip, senior officials in China "were convinced that it was important," Alexander said. When he returned to Washington, Alexander phoned Ivanka Trump, the President's daughter and adviser who was helping with her father's preparation for the G20, to brief her on the developments.Still, after Trump's breakthrough with Xi in Buenos Aires, drug enforcement officials in the White House knew they needed to keep the pressure on the Chinese to convert the promise into action."We just know that when the President got that commitment from President Xi that we weren't going to let that go," the senior White House official said. "It now gave everybody who interacted with a Chinese official on this particular issue a specific ask, a specific talking point, and the federal government followed through in making sure that everybody mentioned it in all of their interactions."Carroll, the ONDCP director, drew up an ultimatum in a meeting with the Chinese ambassador in the period after the December announcement. Sitting across from Cui Tiankai in a room of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in DC, Carroll said that he would cancel a planned trip to China if progress hadn't been made on the fentanyl scheduling agreement, the senior White House official said.The China trip -- on the books for that spring -- was later canceled by the US as the Chinese government went more than three months without announcing any new policy.In a meeting of a United Nations drug commission in Vienna that March, the top State Department official for international narcotics was also pressing the Chinese for information on their promised change.Assistant Secretary Kirsten Madison was told only that China was still committed to the shift, and that they would be making the official regulations "soon," the first State Department official said. Then, on April 1, in the middle of the night, an email arrived."It was Sunday night, middle of the night our time. I woke up at 5:15 in the morning and I immediately grab my work phone and I've got an email from US Embassy Beijing. I open it up and there's the announcement," the senior White House official recalled. "We're all there at 5:15 in the morning going, you've got to be kidding me. There's always that first -- is this the real deal?"At a press conference in Beijing that Monday, China's Ministry of Public Security, National Health Commission and the National Medical Products Administration came together to make the announcement.Liu Yuejin, deputy head of China's National Narcotics Control Commission, called the move a "major innovative measure" in the country's contribution to the global war on drugs.While the Chinese still denied Washington's accusation that they are the primary source for fentanyl substances in the US, Liu stressed that China would enforce its laws "even more comprehensively" after the latest announcement and "bring violators to justice without mercy."Internal administration forecasts predict the announcement will lead to a "fairly rapid decrease" in overdose numbers as well as in the amount of illegal fentanyl seized by authorities at ports of entry into the United states, the senior White House official said, and drug enforcement officials remain optimistic that China will be able to enforce the new policy.The senior White House official said there have already been "indicators" that the Chinese are taking their next steps seriously.In a statement to CNN, Carroll praised Trump for a "strong posture and commitment to saving American lives" that enabled the "historic agreement" with China, and pressed the country to follow through on their change. "In order for us to save American lives, it's critical China follows through on their pledge to schedule all fentanyl-related drugs as a class and crack down on those producing these deadly substances," Carroll said.CNN's Kylie Atwood contributed to this report.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

There's always that first -- is this the real deal?"At a press conference in Beijing that Monday, China's Ministry of Public Security, National Health Commission and the National Medical Products Administration came together to make the announcement.Liu Yuejin, deputy head of China's National Narcotics Control Commission, called the move a "major innovative measure" in the country's contribution to the global war on drugs.While the Chinese still denied Washington's accusation that they are the primary source for fentanyl substances in the US, Liu stressed that China would enforce its laws "even more comprehensively" after the latest announcement and "bring violators to justice without mercy."Internal administration forecasts predict the announcement will lead to a "fairly rapid decrease" in overdose numbers as well as in the amount of illegal fentanyl seized by authorities at ports of entry into the United states, the senior White House official said, and drug enforcement officials remain optimistic that China will be able to enforce the new policy.The senior White House official said there have already been "indicators" that the Chinese are taking their next steps seriously.In a statement to CNN, Carroll praised Trump for a "strong posture and commitment to saving American lives" that enabled the "historic agreement" with China, and pressed the country to follow through on their change."In order for us to save American lives, it's critical China follows through on their pledge to schedule all fentanyl-related drugs as a class and crack down on those producing these deadly substances," Carroll said.Load-Date: May 3, 2019End of Document

Global and China Electric Vehicle Industries Report, 2019-2023GlobeNewswireJune 5, 2019 Wednesday 3:59 AM PTCopyright 2019 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: RESEARCH ANALYSIS AND REPORTSLength: 1183 wordsBodyDublin, June  05, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The     "Research Report on Global and China's Electric Vehicle Industries, 2019-2023"   report has been added to     ResearchAndMarkets.com's  offering.        Most of the world's traditional automobile brands have launched electric vehicles. In China, in addition to traditional automobile brands, some Internet companies have also begun to develop, produce and sell electric vehicles. The Chinese government has set lower barriers to entry in electric vehicle manufacturing than in fuel vehicle manufacturing, which allows more capital to the electric vehicle industry. As the structure of an electric vehicle is quite different from that of a fuel vehicle, the industry chain of electric vehicles also differs greatly from that of fuel vehicles. Li-ion power battery manufacturing and the manufacturing of other electric vehicle parts have become independent industries. Besides, the operating model of the electric vehicle charging pile industry is also different from that of the traditional gas station industry.In 2018, the global sales volume of electric vehicles (new energy vehicles) was about 2.02 million units, accounting for about 2.30% of the global automobile sales. In China, the sales volume of electric vehicles reached about 1,256,000 units, accounting for 4.50% of automobile sales. China has become the world's largest electric vehicle market. By the sales volume of new energy vehicles, in 2018, Tesla ranked the first on the global market, followed by Chinese automakers BYD Auto Co., Ltd. that sold 227,364 new energy vehicles and Beijing Electric Vehicle Co., Ltd. The global rankings of electric vehicle manufacturers also included five Chinese automakers with self-developed brands, which took up a market share of 49%. Considering the prices of electricity and refined oil products in China, it costs much less to drive a battery electric vehicle than to drive a fuel vehicle. However, the development of battery electric vehicles is restricted by a short driving range, expensive batteries, and insufficient charging stations. The plug-in hybrid electric vehicle popular in recent years is a new-type hybrid electric vehicle. It can be powered by a rechargeable battery. When the battery runs out, it can be powered by the internal combustion engine. The plug-in hybrid electric vehicle is superior to the battery electric vehicle in both endurance and practicability. However, Chinese consumers do not care much about endurance because they mostly drive electric vehicles in cities. Moreover, the Chinese government gives higher subsidies to the buyers of battery electric vehicles. Therefore, battery electric vehicles dominate China's electric vehicle market. To reduce air pollution and enhance the competitiveness of domestic automakers, the Chinese government set the target of bringing the sales volume of electric vehicles to 7 million units, or at least one-fifth of the automobile sales in China by 2025. It is expected that the Chinese government will continue to directly subsidize the electric vehicle industry from 2019 to 2023, but the average subsidy amount will decrease and the subsidies will cover fewer vehicle models. In 2018, the central government cancelled the subsidies for electric vehicles with a driving range below 150 kilometers. But as many Chinese cities restrict the purchase and passage of fuel vehicles and the use of electric vehicles costs less, from 2019 to 2023, the CAGRs of electric vehicle production and sales in China are expected to stay above 30%, far exceeding those of automobile production and sales.Key Topics Covered:          1 Basic Concepts of Electric Vehicles1.1 Definition and Classification of Electric Vehicles1.1.1 Definition1.1.2 Classification1.2 Industry Chain of Electric Vehicles1.2.1 Constitution of Industry Chain of Electric Vehicles1.2.2 Parts of Electric Vehicles1.2.3 Suppliers of Electric Vehicles1.3 Business Model of the Electric Vehicle Industry2 Analysis on Global Electric Vehicle Industry, 2014-20182.1 Development Environment2.1.1 Economic Environment2.1.2 Policy Environment2.2 Global Supply of Electric Vehicles2.3 Global Demand for Electric Vehicles3 Analysis on China's Electric Vehicle Industry, 2014-20183.1 Development Environment3.1.1 Economic Environment3.1.2 Policy Environment3.1.3 Catalog of Vehicle Models Recommended for the Promotion and Application of New Energy Vehicles3.1.4 Status of China's Charging Pile Industry3.1.5 Status of China's Li-ion Power Battery Industry3.2 Supply of Electric Vehicles in China3.2.1 Overall Production3.2.2 Production by Market Segment3.3 Demand for Electric Vehicles in China3.3.1 Overall Demand3.3.2 Demand by Market Segment4 Analysis on China's Market of Electric Passenger Vehicles, 2018-20194.1 Market of Battery Electric Passenger Vehicles4.1.1 Production of Battery Electric Passenger Vehicles4.1.2 Demand for Battery Electric Passenger Vehicles4.2 Market of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Passenger Vehicles4.2.1 Production of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Passenger Vehicles4.2.2 Demand for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Passenger Vehicles5 Analysis on China's Market of Electric Commercial Vehicles, 2018-20195.1 Market of Battery Electric Commercial Vehicles5.1.1 Production of Battery Electric Commercial Vehicles5.1.2 Demand for Battery Electric Commercial Vehicles5.2 Market of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Commercial Vehicles5.2.1 Production of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Commercial Vehicles5.2.2 Demand for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Commercial Vehicles6 Major Electric Vehicle Manufacturers in the World, 2018-20196.1 Tesla6.2 BYD Auto Co., Ltd. 6.3 Beijing Electric Vehicle Co., Ltd. 6.4 BMW6.5 Nissan6.6 Toyota6.7 Mitsubishi Motors6.8 Hyundai6.9 Renault6.10 Volkswagen6.11 SAIC Motor Passenger Vehicle Company6.12 Chery Automobile Co., Ltd. 6.13 Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group Corp., Ltd. 6.14 Zhejiang Geely Holding Group6.15 Hawtai Motor Group6.16 JMEV6.17 Zotye Automobile Co., Ltd. 6.18 BAIC Motor Corporation Ltd. 6.19 Chongqing Changan Automobile Co., Ltd. 6.20 SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile Co., Ltd. 6.21 BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. 6.22 GAC New Energy Automobile Co., Ltd. 6.23 Zhidou Electric Vehicle Co., Ltd. 6.24 Haima Automobile Group Co., Ltd. 6.25 Linktour Motors Co., Ltd. 6.26 Great Wall Motor Company Limited6.27 SAIC General Motors Corporation Limited6.28 Kandi Electric Vehicles Group Co., Ltd.7 Prospect of Global and China's Electric Vehicle Industries, 2019-20237.1 Factors Influencing Development of the Electric Vehicle Industry7.1.1 Driving Forces and Market Opportunities7.1.2 Threats and Challenges7.2 Forecast on Development of Global and China's Electric Vehicle Industries, 2019-20237.3 Forecast on Supply of Electric Vehicles on Global and Chinese Markets, 2019-20237.4 Forecast on Demand for Electric Vehicles on Global and Chinese Markets, 2019-2023For more information         about this  report  visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/hw5jw5         Research and Markets also offers Custom Research services providing focused, comprehensive and tailored research.      CONTACT: ResearchAndMarkets.com          Laura Wood, Senior Press Manager          press@researchandmarkets.com          For E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470          For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630          For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900 Related Topics: Electric and Hybrid Vehicles Load-Date: June 6, 2019End of Document

USANA Health Sciences Reports First Quarter 2019 ResultsBusiness WireApril 30, 2019 Tuesday 8:17 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business EditorsLength: 2222 wordsDateline: SALT LAKE CITY BodyUSANA Health Sciences, Inc. (NYSE: USNA) today announced financial results for its fiscal first quarter ended March 30, 2019 that were in line with the preliminary results provided on April 2, 2019.Financial PerformanceFirst quarter 2019 net sales were $273.0 million, compared with $292.0 million in the prior-year period, or a 6.5% decrease year-over-year. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar unfavorably impacted net sales by $13.3 million for the quarter. The Company's total number of active customers at the end of the first quarter was 586,000, compared to 585,000 in the prior-year period.First quarter net earnings were $24.2 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, compared with $28.9 million, or $1.19 per share during the prior-year period."As we reported in early April, three factors unfavorably affected our sales results for the first quarter of 2019," said Kevin Guest, Chief Executive Officer. "First, our 2019 operating plan contained very little promotional activity during the first quarter but calls for increasing promotional activity as the year progresses. This had a more significant impact on our global momentum than we anticipated, particularly during the seasonal slow-down that we experience each year in many of our markets during Chinese New Year. Second, the Chinese government's 100-day review of the health product and direct selling industries that occurred during the quarter was accompanied by unexpected, persistent, negative media coverage about these industries in China. This media coverage affected our sales in China for the quarter. Finally, the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on net sales was also significant."Regional ResultsNet sales in the Asia Pacific region decreased by 4.8% to $220.9 million for the first quarter of 2019. On a constant currency-basis, net sales in the Asia Pacific region increased 0.3% during the first quarter of 2019. The total number of active customers in the Asia Pacific region increased by 2.9% year-over-year. Within Asia Pacific, net sales:• Decreased 8.7% in Greater China;• Decreased 3.0% in Southeast Asia Pacific; and• Increased 22.9% in North Asia.Active customers increased modestly by 1.8% and 0.7% in Southeast Asia Pacific and Greater China, respectively. Net sales growth in North Asia resulted from 27.3% growth in active customers in South Korea.Net sales in the Americas and Europe region decreased by 13.0% to $52.1 million for the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to an 8.6% decrease in active customers."Despite our softer than expected start to the year, we continue to believe that we can deliver growth in 2019," added Mr. Guest. "Our promotional calendar kicked off during the second quarter and we remain confident that these promotions and initiatives will generate sales momentum during the year. Additionally, the 100-day review in China concluded in mid-April, and we expect to see a more typical operating environment in China going forward. Although it takes time to recapture momentum, we believe we will begin to do so during the second quarter and that our results will further accelerate during the second half of the year. We are confident in the strategies we have in place around the world and believe that 2019 will be another record year for USANA."Share Repurchase Program UpdateDuring the quarter, the Company repurchased 283,595 shares of common stock for $30.0 million and ended with weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 23.9 million. The Company continues to have a strong balance sheet with no debt, $225.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, and $26.9 million invested in short-term securities. As of March 30, 2019, there was $40.2 million remaining under the current share repurchase authorization. The Company's Board of Directors has authorized up to $150 million in share repurchase authorization, which is inclusive of the $40.2 million currently authorized. Repurchases may be made from time to time, in the open market, through block trades or otherwise, subject to applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on market conditions, the level of cash balances, general business opportunities, and other factors.OutlookThe Company reiterated the following consolidated net sales and earnings per share outlook for fiscal year 2019:• Consolidated net sales between $1.21 billion and $1.26 billion, representing growth between 1.7% and 5.9% (or growth of 3.6% to 7.9% in constant currency);• Earnings per share between $5.00 and $5.35.The Company's outlook for the year reflects:• An estimated operating margin of between 14.3% and 14.7%;• An effective tax rate of approximately 34%;• An annualized diluted share count of approximately 23.7 million, which does not reflect future share repurchases; and• An unfavorable impact of approximately $23 million related to a stronger U.S. dollar.Chief Financial Officer Doug Hekking commented, "We remain confident in the underlying strength of our business around the world and the strategies in place to generate growth as the year progresses. While our operating margin may be modestly impacted in the short-term, I expect it to remain in line with our long-term strategy, which is intended to drive long-term sustainable growth in active customers."Internal Investigation of China OperationsAs the Company first disclosed in February 2017, it is voluntarily conducting an internal investigation of its China operations, BabyCare Ltd. The investigation focuses on compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and certain conduct and policies at BabyCare, including BabyCare's expense reimbursement policies. The Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors has assumed direct responsibility for reviewing these matters and has hired experienced counsel to conduct the investigation. While the Company does not believe that the subject amounts are quantitatively material, or will materially affect its financial statements, it cannot currently predict the outcome of the investigation on its business, results of operations, or financial condition. The Company's internal investigation is substantially complete, however, the Company continues to cooperate with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States Department of Justice. The Company cannot currently predict the duration, scope, or result of the investigation.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe Company prepares its financial statements using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Constant currency net sales, earnings, EPS and other currency-related financial information (collectively, "Financial Results") are non-GAAP financial measures that remove the impact of fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates and help facilitate period-to-period comparisons of the Company's Financial Results that we believe provide investors an additional perspective on trends and underlying business results. Constant currency Financial Results are calculated by translating the current period's Financial Results at the same average exchange rates in effect during the applicable prior-year period and then comparing this amount to the prior-year period's Financial Results.Conference CallThe Company has posted the "Management Commentary, Results and Outlook" document on the Company's website ( http://ir.usana.com ) under the "Investor Relations" section of the site. USANA will hold a conference call and webcast to discuss today's announcement with investors on Wednesday, May 1, 2019 at 11:00 AM Eastern Time. Investors may listen to the call by accessing USANA's website at            http://ir.usana.com . The call will consist of brief opening remarks by the Company's management team, before moving directly into questions and answers.About USANAUSANA develops and manufactures high-quality nutritional supplements, healthy foods and personal care products that are sold directly to Associates and Preferred Customers throughout the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, China, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Mexico, Malaysia, the Philippines, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Thailand, France, Belgium, Colombia, Indonesia, Germany, Spain, Romania, and Italy.

Made in China, Exported to the World: The Surveillance StateTargeted News ServiceApril 24, 2019 Wednesday 7:30 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2831 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: QUITO, Ecuador BodyThe U.S. Embassy in El Salvador issued the following news release:The squat gray building in Ecuador's capital commands a sweeping view of the city's sparkling sprawl, from the high-rises at the base of the Andean valley to the pastel neighborhoods that spill up its mountainsides.The police who work inside are looking elsewhere. They spend their days poring over computer screens, watching footage that comes in from 4,300 cameras across the country.The high-powered cameras send what they see to 16 monitoring centers in Ecuador that employ more than 3,000 people. Armed with joysticks, the police control the cameras and scan the streets for drug deals, muggings and murders. If they spy something, they zoom in.This voyeur's paradise is made with technology from what is fast becoming the global capital of surveillance: China.Ecuador's system, which was installed beginning in 2011, is a basic version of a program of computerized controls that Beijing has spent billions to build out over a decade of technological progress. According to Ecuador's government, these cameras feed footage to the police for manual review.But a New York Times investigation found that the footage also goes to the country's feared domestic intelligence agency, which under the previous president, Rafael Correa, had a lengthy track record of following, intimidating and attacking political opponents. Even as a new administration under President Lenin Moreno investigates the agency's abuses, the group still gets the videos.Under President Xi Jinping, the Chinese government has vastly expanded domestic surveillance, fueling a new generation of companies that make sophisticated technology at ever lower prices. A global infrastructure initiative is spreading that technology even further.Ecuador shows how technology built for China's political system is now being applied -- and sometimes abused -- by other governments. Today, 18 countries -- including Zimbabwe, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Kenya, the United Arab Emirates and Germany -- are using Chinese-made intelligent monitoring systems, and 36 have received training in topics like "public opinion guidance," which is typically a euphemism for censorship, according to an October report from Freedom House, a pro-democracy research group.With China's surveillance know-how and equipment now flowing to the world, critics warn that it could help underpin a future of tech-driven authoritarianism, potentially leading to a loss of privacy on an industrial scale. Often described as public security systems, the technologies have darker potential uses as tools of political repression."They're selling this as the future of governance; the future will be all about controlling the masses through technology," Adrian Shahbaz, research director at Freedom House, said of China's new tech exports.Companies worldwide provide the components and code of dystopian digital surveillance and democratic nations like Britain and the United States also have ways of watching their citizens. But China's growing market dominance has changed things. Loans from Beijing have made surveillance technology available to governments that could not previously afford it, while China's authoritarian system has diminished the transparency and accountability of its use.For locals seeking to push back, there is little recourse. Chinese companies operate with less scrutiny and regard for corporate social responsibility than their Western counterparts. Activists in Ecuador say that while they have succeeded in working with civil society groups in Europe and America to oppose sales of surveillance technologies, similar campaigns in China have not been possible."We don't have the capacity to demand information from China -- it's really difficult," said the former Ecuadorean legislator Martha Roldos.Ecuador's system, called ECU-911, was largely made by two Chinese companies, the state-controlled C.E.I.E.C. and Huawei.In a statement, Huawei said: "Huawei provides technology to support smart city and safe city programs across the world. In each case, Huawei does not get involved in setting public policy in terms of how that technology is used."In Ecuador, the cameras that are part of ECU-911 hang from poles and rooftops, from the Galapagos Islands to the Amazonian jungle. The system lets the authorities track phones and may soon get facial-recognition capabilities. Recordings allow the police to review and reconstruct past incidents.While ECU-911 was sold to the public as a way to get a grip on dizzying murder rates and drug-related petty crime, it also served Mr. Correa's authoritarian streak, supporting his feared National Intelligence Secretariat, or Senain, according to a former head of the group. In a rare interview last year at Senain's headquarters in a bunker outside Quito, its leader at the time, Jorge Costa, confirmed that the domestic intelligence group had access to a mirror of the Chinese-built surveillance system.The irony is that ECU-911 has not been effective at stopping crime, many Ecuadoreans said, though the system's installation paralleled a period of falling crime rates. Ecuadoreans cite muggings and attacks that happened in front of the cameras without police response. Still, the police have built public support, partly by releasing clips on Twitter and television of thieves and muggers caught on camera.Left to choose between privacy and safety, many Ecuadoreans opt for the unblinking gaze of the electronic eyes. With the mass surveillance genie out of the bottle, community leaders have called for cameras to help secure their neighborhoods, even when their own experiences are that the devices do not work well. Concerns about the long-term political implications trail behind the pressing realities of violence and drugs.Mr. Moreno, who came to power in 2017 and has walked back some of Mr. Correa's autocratic policies, has vowed to investigate Senain's abuses and is remaking the intelligence collection agency under a new name. His government helped open up ECU-911 and Senain to The Times."The government viewed espionage as a toolbox, and they could use any tool they wanted," Ms. Roldos said. "They could spy on your emails, your phone calls, they would set microphones on your vehicle. At the same time, you had people following you. It was a whole system."For a system that was supposed to fight drug dealers and murderers, ECU-911 traces its origins to a different security challenge: the 2008 Olympics.Before those Games, a delegation from Ecuador visited Beijing and toured the Chinese capital's surveillance system. At the time, Beijing was pulling footage from 300,000 cameras to keep tabs on 17 million people. The Ecuadoreans left impressed."For the Olympics, China developed emergency response centers which had state-of-the-art technology for its time," Francisco Robayo, then the general director of ECU-911, said in an interview last year. "Our authorities saw these as ideal to bring to Ecuador."The timing was fortuitous. Mr. Correa was newly in power and facing high crime rates. In January 2011, he made surveillance a priority.Mr. Correa's ministers turned to China. In two months, details to install a Chinese-made technology system were ironed out with the help of military attaches from the Chinese Embassy in Quito, according to a person familiar with the process and to publicly available documents from Ecuador's comptroller. Ecuadorean officials traveled again to Beijing to scope out the system, which featured technology made by the parent company of the state-backed C.E.I.E.C.By February 2011, with guarantees of state funding from the attaches, Ecuador signed a deal with no public bidding process. The country got a Chinese-designed surveillance system financed by Chinese loans. In exchange, Ecuador provided one of its main exports, oil. The money for the cameras and computing flowed straight to C.E.I.E.C. and Huawei."The money always ends up going back to China," Ms. Roldos said.It became a pattern. In exchange for credit facilities that totaled more than $19 billion, Ecuador signed away large portions of its oil reserves. A surge of Chinese-built infrastructure projects, including hydroelectric dams and refineries, followed.By comparison, ECU-911 was a small line item.With an initial sticker price of more than $200 million, construction started near Guayaquil, a booming coastal city where crime rates are high, Mr. Robayo said. Over the next four years, the system expanded across Ecuador.Cameras were hung anywhere that provided a good view. Operation centers were set up. Top Ecuadorean officials traveled to China for training, and Chinese engineers visited to teach their Ecuadorean counterparts how to work the system.The activity attracted attention from Ecuador's neighbors. Venezuelan officials came to see the system, according to a 2013 account from an Ecuadorean official working on the project. In an effort led by the onetime head of intelligence for Hugo Chavez, Venezuela then sprang for a larger version of the system, with a goal of adding 30,000 cameras. Bolivia followed.Beijing's ambitions go much further than the abilities those countries bought. Today, the police across China gather material from tens of millions of cameras, and billions of records of travel, internet use and business activities, to keep tabs on citizens. The national watch list of would-be criminals and potential political agitators includes 20 million to 30 million people -- more than Ecuador's population of 16 million.Chinese start-ups, backed in part by American investment, are competing to build methods for automated policing. They create algorithms that look for suspicious patterns in social media use and computer-vision software to track minorities and petitioners across cities. The spending spree has driven down prices for all types of policing gadgets, as varied as identity-card checkers and high-resolution security cameras.In China, Ecuador's project received praise. State media held it up as an example of a new China exporting advanced technology, instead of providing low-cost labor to assemble it.In 2016, when President Xi visited Ecuador, he stopped by ECU-911 headquarters. Mr. Robayo said Mr. Xi had shown up for about five minutes, enough time for photo opportunities. The snapshots went up on C.E.I.E.C.'s website, a sign of official support from the most powerful Chinese leader in a generation.A ZOOM WITH A VIEWTo the government of Mr. Correa, Mario Pazmino was a known man.A retired Ecuadorean Army colonel who adopted stray dogs -- more than a dozen -- to keep himself busy in the twilight of his career, Mr. Pazmino kept up another pet hobby: criticizing the government of Mr. Correa.He complained about police corruption. He argued that Mr. Correa's government was complicit in Ecuador's growing drug trade. He called out what he perceived as the administration's incompetence.Mr. Pazmino's efforts earned him his own retinue of secret police. They set up in an apartment across from his house, and followed him when he went out.Just as Mr. Chavez had done in Venezuela, Mr. Correa tightened the reins in Ecuador. He eliminated presidential term limits, intimidated and ejected judges, and sent henchmen to follow and attack political opponents and activists, like Mr. Pazmino and Ms. Roldos.His government also turned to ECU-911."I think few people know about it or are actually aware of the huge power of ECU-911," Ms. Roldos said. "There are few people who really know the extent of the tracking." She added that Senain used just about any technology it could get its hands on to harass and follow Mr. Correa's political opponents.A seasoned intelligence officer, Mr. Pazmino, 59, said even he was surprised when, in 2013, a video camera that was part of ECU-911 was installed directly outside his house. It hung from a pole on a traffic divider in the middle of the street, with a full view through a window into his second-story apartment."There is a direct collaboration between ECU-911, the Intelligence Secretariat and also those who surveil and persecute political or social actors," said Mr. Pazmino, citing his own experience, as well as documents and people who had worked in Senain.Mr. Pazmino said that after the camera went in, surveillance teams following him backed off. The camera otherwise made no real sense where it was. Mr. Pazmino lives in a relatively safe neighborhood, and no other ECU-911 cameras were installed nearby. It was a move out of the police playbook in China, where cameras are positioned outside the doors of high-profile activists.A visit to Senain's headquarters confirmed Mr. Pazmino's suspicion. On a wall of screens that served as a sort of agency control room, Times reporters recognized footage from the ECU-911 system.Mr. Costa, who was in charge of the transition between Senain and its successor, acknowledged the transmissions -- but said he was not responsible for how they had been used in Mr. Correa's administration.Mr. Pazmino said he had an idea of who should be held accountable: China. He said the country had supported and emboldened Mr. Correa, just as it had leaders in neighboring Venezuela. As conditions deteriorated in Venezuela last year, Huawei engineers helped train Venezuelan engineers on how to maintain their version of Ecuador's system."I believe what the Chinese model generates is control over society," he said. "A rigid control."THE LIMITS OF SURVEILLANCEEl Tejar has some of the best views in Quito -- and some of its worst crime.As Lidia Rueda, a community organizer, walked the steep, winding streets of this neighborhood, where she has lived for 30 years, she pointed down the hill to where the bodies of several murdered women were found. Drug dealers come and go with impunity, she said. Muggings are common. Thieves break streetlights to get the cover of darkness.ADVERTISEMENTThe crime has not subsided even though ECU-911 cameras arrived at the base of the hill several years ago. Ms. Rueda gestured to a pedestrian bridge there, where one man had grabbed her and threatened her with a knife while another had taken her money. The 2014 mugging happened directly beneath a police camera. No help came.Ms. Rueda's experience encapsulates the complex relationship many Ecuadoreans have with the cameras. While the authorities said the cameras had reduced crime, anecdotes of its dysfunction abound."Where there are cameras, they often don't work," said Ms. Rueda, 61. Another possibility was simply that no one was watching.The odds are against Ecuador's police force. Quito has more than 800 cameras. But during a Times visit, 30 police officers were on duty to check the footage. In their gray building atop the hill, officers spend a few minutes looking at footage from one camera and then switch. Preventing crime is only part of the job. In a control room, dispatchers supported responses to emergency calls.Most of the time, no one was on the other side of the lens.It was a reminder that the system, and others like it, are more easily used for snooping than crime prevention. Following someone on the streets requires a small team, while large numbers of well-coordinated police are necessary to stop crime.Mr. Robayo argued that ECU-911 had been responsible for a major drop in murders and an almost 13 percent drop in crime in 2018 from the previous year. The mere existence of a camera can also have a profound effect, he said.Many Ecuadoreans agree. Despite Ms. Rueda's mugging, she has called for the installation of more cameras in El Tejar. The best way to fix the neighborhood's crime problems is to fix the surveillance system, she said.The police have told her that the cameras are too expensive for her neighborhood. To that, Ms. Rueda took a fatalistic view."It is always the same problem, a budget shortage," she said. "Only when someone is killed, then the authorities come and say, 'Now we're going to do it.'"Arturo Torres Ramirez contributed reporting.Melissa Chan is a reporter focused on transnational issues, often involving China's influence beyond its borders.

CONGRESSMAN TIM RYAN INTRODUCES BIPARTISAN BILL TO PROTECT U.S. MANUFACTURING, NATIONAL SECURITY FROM CHINESE THREATSStates News ServiceMay 16, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 959 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by the office of Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan:Congressman Tim Ryan (D-OH) and a bipartisan group of lawmakersReps. Harley Rouda (D-CA), Rick Crawford (R-AR), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), Kay Granger (R-TX), John Garamendi (D-CA), Randy Weber (R-TX), and Scott Perry (R-PA)introduced H.R. 2729, the Transportation Infrastructure Vehicle Security Act, a bill combatting Chinese efforts to undermine the U.S. economy and national security. The bill would prevent federal transit funds from being used by transit agencies to procure Chinese rail assets from state-owned companies, while ensuring U.S. transit agencies develop and execute a cybersecurity plan to mitigate potential risks. In the Senate, the companion bill was led by Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), John Cornyn (R-TX), and Mike Crapo (R-ID)."Our government should use taxpayer dollars to support American manufacturing and jobs, not Chinese state-owned companies. By consistently underbidding, these heavily-subsidized Chinese rail and bus manufacturers have won transit contracts in Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles. It should concern every American that we have entrusted the safety and security of U.S. transit systems to the Chinese governmenta fierce competitor and cyber adversary," said Congressman Ryan. "While we're stuck in a 24-hour news cycle, China is devising and executing plans to dominate global industries and markets over the next 10, 50, and 100 years. Let this be a wake-up call for the United States. It's time we take the economic and national security threat posed by China seriously, and this bill does just that.""I'm proud to be the lead sponsor of this important piece of legislation with Senator John Cornyn (R-TX)," said Congressman Rouda. "China's 'Made in China 2025' initiative is an unmistakable effort to harm American manufacturers by subsidizing Chinese rail and bus industries. Chinese companies misrepresent themselves as benevolent actors, but let's be clear: this is an attack on our economy and national security. I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for coming together to stop the flow of Americans' taxpayer dollars to Chinese state-owned or state-supported companies."Said Congressman Crawford, "When Chinese companies swoop in to undercut contract bids for American rail projects, their only goal is to decimate our manufacturing sector by dumping cheap parts into our economy, while stealing intelligence and threatening our national security. The Transportation Infrastructure Vehicle Security Act is absolutely critical to protect our nation against foreign threats and cybersecurity attacks which have become more prevalent in this digital age.""I appreciate the bipartisan leadership in this effort to counter China's growing threat to infiltrate and undermine American industries. Our bipartisan proposal is a common sense way to protect the American People and defend our National security. Thanks to Congressman Harley Rouda and Senator John Cornyn for their work on this important legislation," said Congressman Perry."The security of public transit in the nation's capital must be a top priority," Congresswoman Norton said. "China is not making these railcars so cheaply out of the goodness of its heart. Until we have irrefutable evidence, we must not turn a blind eye to the clear incentive China has to monitor our capital and undermine our security."The Chinese government continues to use a range of state subsidies and predatory practices to support its market ascension in certain sectors of the United States' economy. Two of these sectors, rail manufacturing and bus manufacturing, are included as part of China's "Made in China 2025" initiative, a plan targeting global dominance in areas that the Chinese government considers most strategic to its global aims.Chinese state-owned and state-supported enterprises have used subsidized "bargain prices" well-below competitive market price to win contracts throughout the United States. A number of large, metropolitan areas have recently awarded rail rolling stock procurements to a Chinese state-owned enterprise. There are a number of threats these procurements pose including impeding economic competitiveness and overtaking the supply chains that support United States public transportation agencies. Chinese state-owned and state-supported enterprises have increased security vulnerabilities and create new risks for rolling stock procurements.Specifically, the Transit Infrastructure Vehicle Security Act would enact:Limitation on Certain Rolling Stock Procurements: This legislation prevents federal transit dollars from being used to award a contract or subcontract for the procurement of passenger rail cars or transit buses to Chinese state-owned, controlled or subsidized enterprises. The bill would create a certification process for transit agencies to ensure their funds are not being used to purchase rolling stock from a covered manufacturer. A narrow exception would be made for transportation agencies with a pre-existing contract or subcontract with a covered rail rolling stock manufacturer executed prior to the date of enactment.Cybersecurity Certification: Given the level of technology and growing complexity of rail rolling stock assets, it is important that proper cybersecurity standards are in place. This legislation would require any transit operator that operates rail transit service to develop and execute a plan for identifying and reducing cybersecurity risks. Recipients of federal transit assistance would be required to review best practices and to identify any hardware and software components of new rolling stock assets that should undergo third-party testing.Load-Date: May 16, 2019End of Document

Microsoft worked IA with Chinese Army UniversityCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 11, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 905 wordsBody Microsoft worked with a Chinese military-led university on artificial intelligence research that can be used for surveillance and censorship, a revelation that provoked anger among hard-line politicians with China on Capitol Hill.  Three articles, published between March and November last year, were written collaboratively by academics from Microsoft Research Asia in Beijing and researchers affiliated with the National Defense Technology University of China (NUDT). ), which is under the control of the main military body of the Asian country, the Central Military Commission.  One of the documents describes a new method of artificial intelligence to recreate detailed environmental maps by analyzing human faces, which experts say may have clear applications for surveillance and censorship.  The document recognizes that the system provides a better understanding of the surrounding environment "that does not see the camera", which may have a "variety of vision applications".  Samm Sacks, a senior member of the New America think tank and China's technology policy expert, said the documents raise "red flags because of the nature of the technology, the affiliations of the authors, in combination with what we know about how this technology is deployed in China at this time. "  "The Chinese government uses these technologies to develop surveillance systems and stop minorities (in Xinjiang)," Sacks added.  The US government is debating whether research collaborations, especially in sensitive areas such as artificial intelligence and augmented reality, should be subject to stricter export controls.  After the Financial Times reported on Microsoft's work, Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who became one of the leading hardliners on China, warned that "we must make sure that US business interests are not allowing the oppression of the Chinese Communist Party. "  "American companies must understand that doing business in China carries a significant and increasingly profound risk," Cruz added. "In addition to being the target of the Chinese Communist Party for espionage, US companies are at increasing risk of increasing the human rights atrocities of the Chinese Communist Party."  Microsoft defended the research and said it was part of a global effort by its scientists, who are often academics, to work with their international counterparts on cutting-edge technology issues.  "The research is guided by our principles, fully complies with local and US laws and is published to ensure transparency so that everyone can benefit from our work," the company said.  But Adam Segal, director of cyberspace policy in the reflection group of the Council on Foreign Relations, said the revelation comes at a time when US authorities, including the FBI, put "under the microscope" academic associations with Beijing due to fears that Chinese students and scientists working on "cutting-edge technologies" may end up helping the People's Liberation Army of China.  Last week, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) cut ties with telecoms group Huawei and initiated a "high risk" review process for its Chinese collaborations.  Pedro Domingos, professor of artificial intelligence at the University of Washington, pointed out that Microsoft's document on environmental mapping could helpcrucial to the authorities that seek to monitor people.  "Let's say I'm an intelligence agency and I have pictures of people of interest," Domingos said. "I can use the system to tell something about where they are and they did not realize they were revealing."  Microsoft's research division in Beijing has collaborated on at least two other articles with NUDT researchers, including in the field of optical reading, a way that computers can understand text online.  "The understanding of optical reading may not seem directly troubling, but it could be used for censorship, which is in the interest of the Chinese government," said Elsa Kania, Chinese military technology expert and member of the think tank Center for a New American Security. "They see the processing of natural language as a way to allow censorship at scale."  The documents underscore Microsoft Research's long-standing ties to the academy funded by the Chinese military, including the operation of several "technology clubs" for students at Chinese universities that have military ties such as NUDT, Beihang University and the Institute of Technology. Harbin technology.  The US Department of Commerce is seeking public comment to help identify emerging technologies that are essential to US national security, because they can improve intelligence gathering, weapons of mass destruction, have terrorist applications or provide the US with a qualitative military or intelligence advantage, according to the law firm White & Case.  "These documents are at the center of a perfect storm with the highest priority issues while the US redesigns its relationship with China," said Sacks.  "There is a massive revision of the export regime, and the emerging technology and base, particularly artificial intelligence, is a category considered under that," he added. "Because this is an open academic research, the question is to what extent the Chinese government is exploiting the opening ... and an extensive history of joint partnerships."  With information from Madhumita Murgia, Yuan Yang, Christian Shepherd, Richard Waters and Kiran Stacey. Load-Date: April 11, 2019End of Document

We've never gotten $0.10 from China, now we're getting a lot of money from China.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is former Mitt Romney Policy Director and Research Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Lanhee Chen, and Lanhee, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.LANHEE CHEN, RESEARCH FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Hi, Maria, good to be with you.BARTIROMO: What's your take on this standoff between the U.S. and China at this point?CHEN: Well, look, I think that the dynamic here is interesting because both sides could benefit from a deal, there's no question about it on United States side for President Trump. Their political benefits would obviously be huge economic benefits.And the Chinese economy is hurting, Maria, we all know that they could certainly benefit from a deal as well, but there seems to be a little bit of mano a mano here, between President Trump and President Xi, in terms of who will blink first.And, you know, the G20 summit in Osaka here, at the end of the month, was always considered to be the milestone. We'll have to see. I'm still optimistic the two sides sit down and that they make some progress toward a deal. But all bets have been off here, recently, with the tension mounting both with respect to trade, but also with respect to national security issues such as the Huawei issue.BARTIROMO: Yes, I know, but what if a deal is not done? I mean, we know that China reneged on the initial agreement that the two sides came together on, and that included making it into law, that the Chinese could not steal intellectual property, force the transfer of technology, and then they reneged, so there is a chance that there's no deal, what kind of impact would that have to the U.S.?CHEN: Well, absolutely there's a chance there's no deal because the changes that the President is asking China to make are quite fundamental, I mean, this is the way they've done business for some time, Maria, you're aware the fact that this is how they have conducted themselves.They have talked about forced technology transfers, they have required them, they've required joint ventures with Chinese state enterprises for the U.S. businesses to compete, they've required intellectual property in order to do business, and so these are all things the Chinese have done.What the President is asking for, in that sense, is fundamental change. So yes, it's entirely possible the Chinese say, look, we are not willing to do this. But I tend to think that Xi Jinping has an existential problem, Maria, and that is unless he is willing to make some of these changes, unless he's willing to do this, there's not going to be a deal.And without a deal, his economy and his potential to stay in power without there being any kind of domestic unrest decreases significantly, I think.BARTIROMO: Yes.CHEN: So, he's got to be able to do a deal for his own domestic concerns.BARTIROMO: Well, then there's the spying, right, Chinese spying? Now, the U.S. is banning the energy department researchers from accepting jobs with foreign military affiliated groups, your reaction? Because, I mean, there's a whole host of espionage going on.We're going to speak with the chief security officer of Huawei, later today. And he may very well, you know, dispute this. But, you know, look at the -- look at what the U.S. is doing to stop the potential espionage?CHEN: Unquestionably, this is part of China's playbook. They did it in Australia several years ago. They did it in other countries with western influence. The United States is now placed where China is looking to gain influence, whether that influence is in the private sector, in the nonprofit sector, we see it on academic campuses all over the country with the so-called Confucius institutes.Obviously, China understands that the influence game is incredibly important, which is why these issues that we're talking about here, Maria, it goes so much beyond trade. There's a tendency in the conventional media to cover this as a trade story. It's not just that, it's a national security story as you alluded to.And so it's very important for the United States to understand that China is looking to leverage influence in many places across the country and that is something that's very important as we consider this next round of discussions President Trump is going to have with President Xi.BARTIROMO: Yes, we'll be watching that, very important story. Lanhee, thanks very much for weighing in this morning.CHEN: Good to be with you.BARTIROMO: Lanhee Chen, joining us. And stay with us, I will be speaking with the Chief Security Officer at Huawei, Andy Purdy, in my exclusive interview this morning, in less than an hour, that's 7:00 a.m. Eastern, hear what Huawei has to say about all of this, coming up.First, though, let's look at gasoline prices, they're falling, as Americans hit the road for summer vacations, Dagen is on that this morning, what's your take? Good morning, Dagen.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria, two words, road trip, that, why, because gasoline prices are so low, so the average retail gasoline price has fallen for five straight weeks, and now it's at $2.73 a gallon, that is sharply lower, down about $0.19 from a year ago.This is the lowest level since early April that we've seen, and part of it, of course, is the drop in crude oil prices, crude oil last week, down more than 20 percent from its April peak, now in bear market territory. Why is this good news?Because it puts more money in consumers' pockets, period, in a time where people are a little bit concerned about the U.S. economy looking soft, this would give people more money to spend, maybe go on that road trip for a vacation this summer.We've got retail sales that are coming out on Friday, so maybe we'll see a little bit of life in that number because that has been a little weak spot in the economy, Maria, back to you.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll watch that. Dagen, we'll see you in a few minutes.Meanwhile, big technology in the hot seat today, Cheryl is on that this morning, Cheryl, good morning to you.CASONE: Good morning, Maria, going to be an interesting day in Capitol Hill, as they are on the hot seat. The House Judiciary committee is going to be holding a hearing. It's going to be this afternoon on anticompetitive practices among technology giants.Now, today's hearing expected to focus on the ways that big tech has changed the landscape for the news industry. And, of course, that's more of a revenue story for newspapers. They basically say that Google and Facebook are threatening their survival and responding to growing calls to break up big technology companies.Instagram's chief says that breaking it off from Facebook will make Instagram a less safe space.All right, a congressional panel, naming witnesses for next week's hearing on Boeing's 737 Max jets, the list includes Chesley Sullenberger, the former U.S. Airways pilot who safely landed an Airbus jet on New York's Hudson River, back in 2009, of course, that was known as the Miracle on the Hudson, and former Federal Aviation Administration Head Randy Babbitt is going to be speaking.This is the second hearing on the grounded 737 Max, held by the House Aviation Subcommittee, the panel going to gather information to make sure that these jets are safe, of course, before they are allowed to fly again.Well, investigators are combing through wreckage of a helicopter that crashed on top of a building here in midtown Manhattan yesterday afternoon. The chopper was flying in restricted air space, and in rain and fog, when it crashed. The pilot was killed. He was the only person on board.He's been identified as Tim McCormack, a veteran pilot and former volunteer fire chief from Upstate New York. Now, in the wake of this accident, New York Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney is calling for a ban on all nonessential helicopter flights over the city.Just an hour or so, our very own Susan Li is going to be talking with the head of Uber's helicopter venture and get his take on, of course, that crash yesterday, Maria, and it was such a thick -- it was almost a white out in the skies above Manhattan yesterday, I'm sure you saw.BARTIROMO: Yes, and a lot of fog for sure. All right, we'll wait for that. Thank you, Cheryl. We'll take a short break. When we come back, a lot more to come, plus my exclusive interview with Huawei's security officer, stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, big show this morning, coming up, my exclusive interview with Huawei Technologies Chief Security Officer, Andy Purdy, back with us this morning, to respond to criticism about Huawei.White House Council of Economic Advisors Chairman Kevin Hassett is here, along with Michigan Congresswoman House Energy and Commerce Committee Member, Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, joining us.My first on FOX interview with Uber Aviation Programs Head, Eric Allison is here, along with my exclusive interview with the CEO of Lands' End, Jerome Griffith, joining us, plus, my first on FOX interview with the Knot Worldwide CMO, the Chief Marketing Officer, Dhanusha Sivajee, joining us this morning. Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big show this Tuesday morning.Meanwhile, now, the Mueller report, House of Representatives preparing to bring Attorney General William Barr and former White House Counsel Don McGahn to court over subpoenaing documents. This coming after a former White House counsel to Richard Nixon, John Dean, testified on Capitol Hill yesterday, where he said, "remarkable parallels between Watergate and the findings of the Mueller report." Watch.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)JOHN DEAN, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL TO PRESIDENT NIXON: In many ways, the Mueller report is to President Trump, what the so-called Watergate road map, was to President Richard Nixon. Stated a little differently, Special Counsel Mueller has provided this committee with a road map.REP. DOUG COLLINS (R-GA): This committee is now hearing from the 70s and they want their star witness back. They have the godfather here.REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): So, you instructed Michael Cohen's lawyer to keep information from Republicans to obstruct the committee work.DEAN: I didn't quite phrase it that way, no.JORDAN: You know what? They took your advice.REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): Mr. Dean has made a cottage industry out of accusing presidents of acting like Richard Nixon.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: Joining the conversation this morning, Forbes Media chairman, former Republican presidential candidate, Steve Forbes is here, Washington Examiner columnist and Republican pollster, Kristen Soltis Anderson is here, Dagen McDowell, as well. Thanks, everybody, great to see you this morning. Good morning.STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Good to be with you.BARTIROMO: Pretty aggressive comments coming out of Mr. Dean. What was your take?FORBES: Well, he got pushed back too, and the parallels to Watergate are false. In Watergate, there was a crime, there was no Russian collusion here, so what's the parallel, other than he wants to be in the limelight?BARTIROMO: In fact, I see a parallel with the origins of the Russia investigation which William Barr and Mr. (INAUDIBLE) are looking at. I mean, no mention, Kristen, of the fact that you had cabal of people putting their finger on the scale early on in '16, no mention of what the parallel to Watergate is there.KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, COLUMNIST, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Well, I think, by in large, I'm looking at what voters are thinking about this, they have mostly moved on. I mean, there are things outlined in the Mueller report that are very concerning about what Russia was trying to do.And so, absolutely, good that the report was done, good that there was information, sort of, pulled together about what Russia was attempting to do. But, in terms of this president, you know, his job approval hasn't moved since the release of the report, if anything, it ticked up a little bit.With all of these new information out there, by in large, voters have said, OK, I'm glad it's done, now let's move on to fixing infrastructure, getting our economy even better, et cetera, et cetera.FORBES: The Democrats base won't let them drop the issue. They still want a crime even though there's no crime.BARTIROMO: Right.FORBES: And the real crime is what was done leading up to this Russian collusion story.BARTIROMO: That's exactly right. And what I keep saying, Dagen, probably, a million times, they've got their guy, now they're looking for the crime. That's not how we do things in America. First, you see a crime, and then you follow the crime. Here, they've got their guy, Donald Trump, and they're just going to investigate him until they find something.MCDOWELL: John Dean wasn't even a fact witness, he was essentially an opinion witness, that he doesn't know anything about the Mueller report other than maybe reading the whole thing, which I did, and he seems to be there to be the narrator for the left-wing nuts, who are trying to school the American people on what was in it or what wasn't in it.And I'll just turn to the Democrats on the House Committee, if you're going to pick somebody to go in front of cameras, why not pick somebody from a network that people actually watch? Nobody knows who this guy is. Again, this is the era -- the Brady Bunch was still on the air when this guy was relevant.Nobody recognizes him. And by the way, Dana Perino said on "THE FIVE" yesterday, you know, that this testimony by John Dean yesterday was completely wiped out by that helicopter crash here, in New York City, which was probably, and I'm paraphrasing, beneficial to the Democrats, because this was not the way to go.ANDERSON: The time that a hearing like that is going to make news is if someone is producing new information, saying something that hasn't been heard before, presenting something that people did not know before, sort of bringing someone who, you know, participated in things in the past that are bad, to say, I think this seems bad.And you're right, it's opinion, it's not introducing a new piece of evidence to the American people.FORBES: And almost half a century ago when Dean achieved his fame, talking about a cancer in the presidency. The real cancer is what the CIA and the FBI and others tried to do, semi-coup, either influence the campaign or try to destroy a legitimately elected president.BARTIROMO: That's right.FORBES: That's the real cancer.BARTIROMO: And they used, you know, misinformation to get a FISA warrant to spy on an American citizen, and yet, here we have House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler, going for contempt. He has announced yesterday that he will not look to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt in connection with the Mueller report. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY): I am pleased that we have reached an agreement to review at least some of the evidence underlying the Mueller report, including interview notes, firsthand accounts of misconduct and other critical evidence. And that this material will be made available without delay to members of committee on both sides of the aisle.As a result, I see no need to resort to the criminal contempt statute to enforce or able 19th subpoena, at least, for now, so long as the department upholds its end of the bargain.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: I mean, it's pretty incredible that they could get away with this, completely ignoring what you just mentioned, ignoring this misuse of power, putting their most important, most aggressive tools as an intel division of the government, to work against Donald Trump, these are tools that we use for terrorists, I'm talking about informants and wire-tapping.FORBES: Well, what they're also were worried about is what Barr is going to uncover with the new investigation. They know that's going to be very, very bad, and anything they can do to divert it, anything they can do to destroy Barr's reputation. In the meantime, they're going to go all out to do it.BARTIROMO: including scrubbing every other word in the Mueller report to come up with this hearing, right?ANDERSON: Yes, I mean, I think when it comes to trying to figure out what happened to lead us to this place, again, I think it's good that our intelligence agencies were trying to figure out what foreign countries were trying to do to hack into the DNC, et cetera, but when it comes to U.S. citizens, the rules are different, and the rules are different for a reason.So, I think, making sure that things like our FISA courts are being used appropriately and not being used against, sort of, political opponents, is a very important, sort of, oversight, things that the government needs to - -FORBES: opposition research from a presidential campaign.BARTIROMO: And they never even told Donald Trump that they were investigating Russia, as the president-elect, you know, because they were actually investigating him.MCDOWELL: Right. I said, if you're going to call a witness about obstruction of justice, why not call President Bill Clinton? He has more modern -- I said this yesterday, a more modern view of what obstruction would be like, because he was find --I mean, he was impeached by the House, and not the Senate, and that should be a warning to these Democrats of what could blow up in their face if they move ahead with impeachment.BARTIROMO: This, the same person who met with the (INAUDIBLE) sitting Attorney General Loretta Lynch, just a few days before Hillary was to be interviewed by the FBI. Talk about obstruction.MCDOWELL: Yes, that tarmac meeting.BARTIROMO: Right there on the tarmac.FORBES: They just got together to talk about grandkids and golf stories.BARTIROMO: Yes, and yoga (INAUDIBLE) we'll take a quick break, when we come back, United Tech fleeting Connecticut after its merger with Raytheon, once again, companies leaving because of the high taxes, we'll talk about that, then Google's new investment, the technology giant setting its sights on the Midwest now, where and why, next, right here, stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, headlines across America this morning, the Caledonian Record reports Vermont's Republican governor vetoing a bill that would have established a 24-hour waiting period to buy handguns, supporters of the legislation arguing that it would have reduced suicide rates in Vermont by protecting residents from expulsive acts of self-harm.Governor Scott deciding existing restrictions on gun ownership that he signed into law last year, adequately address the supply side of the gun violence problem.The Mercury News this morning, writing 2,220-acre Northern California Sand Fire now at 20 percent containment; heat wave forecast throughout the week. The biggest wildfire in Northern California so far this year, it was fanned by strong winds after first being reported Saturday afternoon, leading to the closure of Highway 16 and mandatory evacuations in several communities.And the Detroit News says that Google is investing $17 million into Detroit, Ann Arbor. The tech giant says it's going to be pouring those millions into 14 states as it sees faster growth outside the San Francisco Bay Area, the Michigan investment adding nearly 100,000 square feet of space, and "significant number of jobs."Interesting, see Google investing in America. These companies, of course, have been under severe pressure for all the reasons, wondering if there's going to be regulatory action on them and here we have Google, investing in America.FORBES: And in Michigan and near Detroit, which is a city that's remarkably is making a great comeback, we're going to have a great conference there in the fall. That city is on the move again.BARTIROMO: Yes, it is, and you -- and so you're having a conference this fall.FORBES: Yes, 30 under 30.BARTIROMO: And you're expecting -- you're expecting --FORBES: thousands of people.BARTIROMO: Yes.FORBES: Welcome (INAUDIBLE) states are doing it. City is alive again. It's great to see.BARTIROMO: Why did you choose Detroit?FORBES: Because the city is making a comeback and we want to highlight it.BARTIROMO: That's terrific.FORBES: Yes.BARTIROMO: Great.MCDOWELL: And it's on Eastern Time, which helps, so you don't have time shift.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: If you're there. And it' a very short flight from --FORBES: Want to travel to Asia recently, I'd love that.MCDOWELL: Right. See? And it's a great hub between Chicago and New York as well, and Google with all the investment here in New York City is running into problems with the cost of living here, with the --Because Google has taken over a swath of buildings around the meat-packing district and the rents are so high and the cost of owning of apartment here, in New York, is so high, that they end up having to pay the employees a lot more too.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a good point. All right, we'll take a break. When we come back, border crack-down, Mexico steps up to curb illegal immigration, what's compromising the effort, coming up. And then a $450- million mystery solved, the missing Leonardo Da Vinci painting discovered in an unlikely place, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, June 11th. Your top stories right now 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.Markets are higher and the Dow looking to make it seven straight. Futures pointing to gains at the opening of trading this morning.

The new sign that U.S. pressure is weighing on the company. Next hour my exclusive interview with the chief security officer of Huawei, Andy Purdy, once again joining us this morning.The list of companies leaving Connecticut over taxes adding another member. United Technologies joining the exodus following its deal with Raytheon. Plus, a $415 million mystery has been solved. We will tell you where the missing Leonardo da Vinci painting. Salvator on Monday was reportedly found. All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.But first, our top story this half-an-hour. Crisis at the border. Mexican president, Obrador, cracking down on migrants heading to the United States after making a deal with President Trump to avert U.S. tariffs on Mexican exports. The president weighed in yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Mexico is doing more for the United States as of now than Congress. And then that specifically, the Democrats, they have to get their act together. They have to work and get something done because you get a tremendous problem at the border if people pouring in. And it means crime, it means drugs, have been so many other things.We're building the wall. We're going to have close to 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year, that's a lot. And we're moving along very rapidly.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: This as the cyber-attack was unleashed against a federal subcontractor working for U.S. Customs and Border Patrol. Compromising tens of thousands of photos, including traveler's faces, license plates.Joining me right now is retired four-star general and Fox News senior strategic analyst General Jack Keane. General, good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: Yes. Good to see you, Maria.BARTIROMO: That was pretty extraordinary. Your reaction to what's taking place.KEANE: Well, the cyber attacks, I mean, we've just got to take it as routine because they're happening all over the United States and with our allies. And it's our adversaries are doing this, Maria. I mean, China is the most prolific, Russia is the most talented. Even Iran and North Korea are involved.And what I really appreciate is that this administration has loosened up the regulations and the policies for us to be able to retaliate. And I'm confident they are retaliating. We have the number one cyber offensive capability in the world. Nobody is as good as we are at that capability.And we have been reluctant to use it in the past. And the fact that they're going to do that now, once we identify someone who's doing that to us, I believe we should use that capability to retaliate. Then, the United States will never announce that's going to happen. They're never going to talk about the results of it. It's going to largely be done by Cyber Command, which is a military organization work -- working with the National Security Agency that does that kind of work.BARTIROMO: I mean, do we know who this subcontract you're working for U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, compromising tens of thousands of photos? Because that's traveler's faces and license plates, do we know what the goal of the perpetrator was? What -- why are they taking these pictures and license plates?KEANE: Well, an adversary has the intention of doing something like that because they gain information about people, then they use it for manipulation. I mean, they stole, as you know, just a few years ago, all of the United States military's personnel records to include my. I got a letter from the military saying your entire personnel file has been compromised.Nothing has been done to manipulate me, of course, but I don't know what else is being done by an adversary who's taking that kind of information.Listen, I was a director at General Dynamics, Maria. And every single month, every month, they had hundreds of millions of penetrations by the Chinese. I'm not talking about a few thousand. I am talking about hundreds of millions. The FBI was in residence and they had some subcontractors that helped them build the most classified program in the United States, a nuclear-powered submarine. That is it.And they penetrated that. They penetrated that through a subcontractor because they -- those subcontractors are spread out all over the United States. They may not have as good a defense as General Dynamics has. And then, they ride into that system and get into it.Fortunately, we detected that. But that is how prolific they are every single day working against the United States of America.BARTIROMO: Yes, and the actors are pretty much the same over and over again. China, Russia, North Korea. Let me ask about North Korea, because North Korean state media is out with a message for the United States, calling for the end of the "hostile policy toward Pyongyang.Nearly one year since President Trump met with Kim Jong-un in Singapore, this is new reports say that Kim Jong-nam the half-brother of Kim Jong-un, who was murdered in 2017, you remember, was actually a CIA operative working in the United States. Your thoughts.KEANE: Well, we don't know that for a fact that he's a CIA operative. That's for sure. But it wouldn't surprise me and it certainly explains the aggressiveness that Kim Jong-un was used -- using to kill his stepbrother. BARTIROMO: Wow.KEANE: Yes, obviously, he detected that kind of information. But, we go back to where are we with North Korea. I mean, he failed at the Hanoi summit. Because he came home empty-handed, he didn't get sanction relief that he wanted, we know now for a fact, he killed his chief negotiator who he fired him first, and then killed them, who was involved in that. And because he presented the same deal that they had done with previous administrations, and he always got sanction relief. With the Trump team, they did not get it.He is leveraging everything he can to get back to another summit. Our administration wants to see some progress being done at lower levels before we involve the head of state again. And I think that's the right road to take. After all, Maria, they have never disclosed to us any inventory of something we desired at our first meeting which is give us the inventory of all your weapon systems. Let's put a timetable together to dismantle those weapon systems, and let's also have independent observers to monitor that. None of that has ever happened.So, that's on the table and hopefully, before we have a meeting the next time, some of that is will be resolved and we can finally make some progress. After all, there has been no progress made on actual denuclearization. There's been progress made on return of remains, on the -- on the reciprocation of their relationship and relationship with South Korea.BARTIROMO: Right.KEANE: But not on the actual denuclearization.BARTIROMO: You know, it's interesting because they go back and forth on this and have these meetings, and yet nothing solid on denuclearization at all so far. So, again, it's interesting to see what this president and the administration is going to do to really change the needle on what has become a culture. We'll see.Before you go, General, let me ask you any thoughts on this merger in the defense business? I mean you've got United Technologies and Raytheon. You've watched various -- you know mergers within defense before. To see the impact on defense spending and the impacts on our defenses. Do you have any reaction?KEANE: No, my instincts at consolidation in the defense industry is largely a good thing, not a bad thing. I mean, certainly, if you got downs only two or three, then, major OEMs and that, that would be a problem.BARTIROMO: Yes.KEANE: But, when I was a director of General Dynamics, we looked at this kind of consolidation, actually with Raytheon itself. So, I think that's likely what will coming out of that, will be better defense capabilities for the United States.BARTIROMO: OK.KEANE: That's the way I see it. These are positive things that happen with the kind of consolidation. Taking advantage of the capabilities that each company has consolidated, bringing that together. Building a more effective, efficient company.BARTIROMO: General, it's great to see this morning thanks so much.KEANE: Yes, good talking to you, Maria.BARTIROMO: General Jack Keane, joining us there.Meanwhile, Audi is recalling its new electric E-Tron SUV. Cheryl Casone with that story now. Cheryl.CASONE: That's right, Maria. More than 1,600 vehicles being called back to fix a seal in the battery compartment that would avoid a fire. There have been no reports of fires, not only about a third of the E-Tron's affected by the recall are currently being driven by consumers right now on the roads.Well, a mystery looks like it may be solved. The owner of this $450 million, Leonardo da Vinci painting is reportedly, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The painting's whereabouts have been unknown since its 2017 auction at Christie's.Artnet.com, says the 500-year-old painting is being kept on a super yacht that is owned by the Saudi crown prince.Back here at home. New York's Time Square are getting the glaze over. Krispy Kreme plans to open flagship doughnut shop, a big one that right in the heart of Midtown Manhattan. A sweet location, and going to have a glaze waterfall, oh yes. Stadium-style seating inside a larger than life doughnut box.This at the renderings, Maria, obviously. They expect to open this mega doughnut shop in 2020. Looking to serve more guest a year than any other location around the world. And you know me and doughnuts, Maria. It's right down the street from the studio. So, if I'm missing one morning, you'll know where I'm at.BARTIROMO: That'll be a big attraction.CASONE: I cannot wait.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Cheryl.CASONE: You bet.BARTIROMO: All right, quick break, and then, United Tech leaving Connecticut after the merger with Raytheon. Yet another corporation fleeing a high-tax state. We'll check that out.Then, healthcare in America. What doctors say is the key to reversing effects of the most common, costly, and disabling illnesses? All right here, stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. New developments in the United Technologies- Raytheon merger, recording plans for their new headquarters. Here's Lauren Simonetti with the details now. Lauren, good morning.SIMONETTI: Hey, good morning, Maria. So, there's questions about the location, United Technologies employs 19,000 at its headquarters in Connecticut. When its merger with Raytheon closes next year, to Massachusetts, those headquarters go. No job cuts expected in Connecticut. But United Technologies is the latest of several high-profile companies to leave high-taxed Connecticut. Aetna is leaving, pending the outcome its deal with CVS. General Electric left for Boston -- that was back in 2017.Now, Connecticut Republicans are worried about more than the high taxes. They have the state's debt load, unfunded pension liabilities, new legislation that requires paid family medical leave and a higher minimum wage. That's perk for workers in a tight labor market but it's often a burden on business. And not much has changed under Democratic Governor, Ned Lamont. He has background in business in the cable industry. He campaigned on reversing some of the economic losses Connecticut saw under eight years, Dan Malloy. Connecticut actually ranked one of the worst states for business by Forbes last year, and to fill the coffers, they're looking at dealing things like increasing tolls and putting a tax on sweetened beverages -- a soda tax. Steve Forbes, you're here.BARTIROMO: Wow.FORBES: Stay away from Connecticut. Stay away from New York, New Jersey, they're all so bad. And that's why a lot of people live in Pennsylvania where they have a three percent income tax rate, 3-1/4 percent. On route 78 which crosses New Jersey. The morning, it's a caravan. People from Pennsylvania --MCDOWELL: Know it well. Oh, know it well. I have to take 78 to get down to Virginia. But again, what happens is, all the left-wing liberals move into these lower-taxed states which is part of what happened to Connecticut. Connecticut, at one point, I think in early 90s didn't even have a state income tax.FORBES: Didn't have income tax.MCDOWELL: And liberals start pouring in from New York City proper and they basically impose the same policies that destroyed places that they left in the first place.BARTIROMO: Which is why I get worried about Texas. Because Texas as well, no state income tax, lower taxes, and a place where high-tax state residents like to --FORBES: Maybe they should just carve out Austin.BARTIROMO: They're turning purple, because Austin, just what you say, these liberals go there and these other policies. And so now, Austin is very different from Dallas or others.FORBES: Dallas is starting to go to.BARTIROMO: Dallas is starting to go purple, too.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A lot of these blue states have elected Republican governors in recent years, and it's places like Massachusetts with Charlie Baker, Maryland with Larry Hogan -- some of these Republican governors in blue states, and the most popular governors.SIMONETTI: And a lot of these companies are moving to that area because of the way they encourage business research and development and the like. But Connecticut is just filled can so much money in terms of the wealthy people --MCDOWELL: Wait, Connecticut's housing market has never recovered. Fairfield County, even in Greenwich, Connecticut, that housing market is weak. And outside of that, because, again, these policies drove G.E. out of Connecticut. So, you're going to layer on more of what is destroying business, sending them to other states and basically hurting working-class people in Connecticut. It's appalling and it's really sad. It's beautiful state with great people, but their leadership is just --FORBES: For decades Connecticut was the richest state in the union.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.BARTIROMO: Yes.SIMONETTI: And it's when New York who is bad, crime and all of that. A lot of people went to beautiful suburbs, the safe suburbs of Connecticut but things have changed.STEVE: You see a purplish impact in New Hampshire. People moving from Massachusetts into New Hampshire thanks to political climate there.MCDOWELL: Even you came in Connecticut, you can get a pristine mid-center modern house by a famed architect, 4,000 square feet on at least acre of land for less than what you would pay for a one-bedroom apartment in New York City in a bad neighborhood and they have the greatest schools in Connecticut.BARTIROMO: God, wow. Unbelievable. Well, no wonder people are leaving Connecticut, and companies are leaving Connecticut. There you go. Lauren, thank you. Lauren Simonetti. Coming up, staying healthy in America; simple changes can change your life in a big way. Elongate your life. We have an expert advice coming up. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Reversing unhealthy trends, specifically when it comes to chronic disease. My next guest says basic lifestyle changes can be key to reversing the effects of the most common costly and disabling illnesses. Joining us right now is the author of "Undo It", the President and Founder of the Preventative Medicine Research Institute, Dean Ornish. Dean, it's great to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.DEAN ORNISH, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER, PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE RESEARCH INSTITUTE: Thanks, Maria. It's great to see you.BARTIROMO: Well, this seems like real, simple advice. Take us through some of the lifestyle changes that people should do to reverse chronic disease.ORNISH: Thank you, and thanks for having me. We found in 40 years of research that simple lifestyle changes. Eat well, move more, stress less, love more can actually reverse the progression of the most common chronic diseases. We found, for the first time, heart disease, and diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol. We did a study where we found with that with Craig Venture, who decoded the human genome, that when you change your lifestyle, it changes your gene, turns on the good genes, turns off the bad genes. We did a study with (INAUDIBLE) and got the Nobel Prize for discovering Telomeres (INAUDIBLE) our chromosomes that regulate how long we live, that we could lengthen Telomeres. And when (INAUDIBLE) have published it, they called reversing aging at a cellular level. So, the more diseases we study, the evidence we have. How these simple changes can be so powerful, and how quickly you can feel --BARTIROMO: And you've seen that these changes can actually have an impact in just a few weeks.ORNISH: In just a few weeks, these mechanisms are so dynamic that when you make these changes, most people find it feeling so much better so quickly. It reframes the reason for making them from fear to prevent something bad from happening years later. But you think more clearly, you have more energy, you look younger, you feel better, sexual function even improves. So, these are choices worth making not just to live longer but to live better.MCDOWELL: What's the one change that gives you the most bang, so to speak? The one thing that everybody should do?ORNISH: It's really not one thing. It's all four.MCDOWELL: Give me one idea. The biggest one.ORNISH: I think it's important what we eat. You know, we found that that what you eat, not only are you avoiding the things that cause diseases, but there are hundreds of thousands of protective substances in fruits and vegetables that have anti-cancer, anti-heart disease, and even anti-aging properties.FORBES: Like some bacon after the show?ORNISH: Probably not. And these are actually cost effective as well. We've done studies -- we did a study with (INAUDIBLE) Blue Cross, Blue Shield, that they cut their cost -- their overall healthcare costs in half in the first year. You know, five percent of people account for 80 percent of the healthcare costs -- these are the ones who have chronic diseases.FORBES: A friend of mine had terrible back problems, couldn't play golf anymore, went vegetarian plus fish and he's playing golf again.ORNISH: Well, that's a go because inflammation is one of the mechanisms that underlies all of these different chronic diseases. It turns out that 86 percent of the $3.6 trillion we spent last year on healthcare, is for treating chronic diseases that are often preventable or even reversible by making these lifestyle changes.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, the four things that are on the front of your booking. It was eat well --ORNISH: Eat well, move more, stress less, love more.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Love more. I want to ask about that. Because there's a lot of really fascinating research about the loneliness crisis and the way that loneliness kind of correlates with all of these bad health outcomes. What's your advice for love more?ORNISH: Well, you know, it turns out that 50 years ago, most people have an extended family. They had a job they felt secured, they had a church for synagogue they went to regularly, they had a neighborhood with two or three generations of people, and we've lost something. It turns out that study after study have shown that people who are lonely and depressed are three to 10 times more likely to get sick and die prematurely from all causes when compared to those who have a sense of love and connection with community.BARTIROMO: It's probably this cycle because you end up -- you're alone and depressed and you're eating the wrongs foods.ORNISH: That's right and you kind of spiral downwards.BARTIROMO: You'll lose the judgment. You're also conducting the first randomized trial to determine if these lifestyle changes can reverse the progression of early stage Alzheimer's disease. This is a big good one.ORNISH: It's a big one, because as you know, there are no good drugs for treating it or for preventing it that are really effective. My mom dies of Alzheimer's out of personal interest. And so, we're doing the first randomized trial to see because Alzheimer's shares many of the same mechanisms that these other diseases, too. And you know, early -- less intensive interventions can slow the progression. We're hoping to see, we don't know, of course, if we will, that we might be able to stop and reverse it. But whatever we show, it will be important. If we show we can reverse it, that will be landmark. Even if we show it does nothing, I think people need to know that, too.BARTIROMO: How long did your mom suffer from Alzheimer's before passing?ORNISH: It was about seven years, and she was brilliant. And it was just -- you know, when you lose your memory, you lose everything. So, if we can prevent that -- if we can reverse it, then we can prevent that. And since there are no good drugs, we're doing that. That would give a lot of people new hope and new choices.BARTIROMO: Really, great advice, Dean. Great book. Congrats, number two or number one.ORNISH: Well, it was number two yesterday, we'll hope it will be number one today.BARTIROMO: Check out the books. Still ahead, my exclusive interview with the chief security officer of Huawei Technologies, that's next.Load-Date: June 11, 2019End of Document

Really think. That's what happened when Cathy Zhang, host of "Engage America," a Chinese radio show, called and asked if I would agree to an interview about my new report, "Why Companies Leave California." She wanted to know whether its findings might be useful to China's business interests. I replied: "Yes, they sure are." Frankly, I also figured I'd have an audience of millions of people. The program is part of the Sound of Hope Radio, the most listened-to network among Chinese expatriates throughout the United States and around the world. The network operates independently of the Chinese government, whose policies it has criticized, but can be heard via shortwave in China. Part of my new out-of-California report addresses disinvestment events when companies relocate California facilities to China and Chinese-owned companies avoid California when locating new facilities in this country. It also examines California-related events in other nations. Confucius I should point out that years ago I had studied the life of Confucius (551 - 479 BC), China's most famous philosopher. I learned, thanks to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, that at one point, when he realized that his superiors were uninterested in his policies, Confucius left the country to find another state to which he could render his service. I think that if Confucius lived in California today, he might do the same. California's government is so unstable, and its policies among the most incomprehensible in the nation, that many companies and individuals are motivated to relocate to friendlier places. Moreover, Confucius experienced life under an unstable government and perceived that the political institutions of his day had completely broken down. . (Many Californians can identify with that observation.) The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy noted that Confucius believed that a ruler should learn self-discipline, should govern his subjects by his own example, and should treat them with love and concern. Well, maybe love is too much, but how about some concern? I don't know of a single California business owner or executive who can say with a straight face that politicians are concerned about their enterprise. The Facts About Leaving California The out-of-California report outlines the who, what, when, where and why more than 13,000 companies over a nine-year period moved facilities to other states and nations. The study discusses the leading countries, states and metropolitan areas that were selected to be the new homes for migrating Californians. It also summarizes how California's insensitivity to businesses motivates departures. Reasons include punitive laws and regulations, high taxes and an absurd legal environment that is excessively unfair to companies even those who work conscientiously to respect all laws. Conceiving a Better Future Aiming high brings good fortune, said Confucius. Indeed, some California companies improved their fortunes by migrating offshore. In the 2008-2016 period, the nations gaining the most from California events were Mexico in the number one spot, followed by India, and in third place was China. Here are a few examples of work that went to China: Mellanox Technologies Silicon Photonics, Inc. (formerly Kolura, Inc.) moved silicon photonics work out of Monterey Park, in Los Angeles County. Fluke Corp. shifted manufacturing of laser tools from San Rafael, in Marin County. Lumileds LLC, subsidiary of Royal Philips, moved LED lighting manufacturing out of San Jose, in Santa Clara County. A number of years ago, China Zhongwang Holdings Ltd. cancelled plans to build a $1.5 billion aluminum manufacturing facility even though Southern California Edison offered substantial savings for the project. A consultant noted that electricity costs were 50 percent higher than the second-most expensive state west of the Mississippi River. Reshoring A category receiving recent attention is reshoring bringing back to the United States jobs that had previously been offshored. According to the Reshoring Institute, California has a difficult time competing against other states when it comes to labor laws, property costs, wage rates, taxes and energy costs. California's hostility to business is so well known that in many cases the state is completely bypassed during location searches. California's reshoring ranking, at number 20, is far below the leading states of South Carolina, Tennessee and Michigan all of which are smaller in size and population. An example of a California company moving work back from China but putting it in another state is Elemental LED, a manufacturer of LED lighting. They moved their manufacturing from China, along with their headquarters from Emeryville, in Alameda County, to Reno, Nevada, where they consolidated everything. Adverse Conduct California politicians ought to give thought to other advice from Confucius, namely, "When you are in public life, any lapse in conduct can bring disfavor. The laws and regulations that emerge from California's political system show indecent conduct, which is why more companies and people will flee. If Confucius were still alive, he, too, might be packing his bags for a more wholesome environment one where businesses and citizens are given the respect they deserve. (Side note: Why I studied the life of Confucius. Some time ago I participated in the creation of a website that sells greeting cards and apparel that revolve around a cartoon character with a similar name Computious. That website is here: Computious The Everyday Sage of the Digital Age!) Link for a summary of "Why Companies Leave California." Joseph Vranich is a site selection consultant providing location advisory services to corporations and small businesses. His motto is Helping Businesses Grow in Great Locations. In recent years, he has discussed California's difficult business environment with more than 100 economic development agencies located in North America and Europe.

GOVERNMENT-GUIDED FUNDS IN CHINA: FINANCING VEHICLES FOR STATE INDUSTRIAL POLICYStates News ServiceJune 17, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1460 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Peterson Institute for International Economics:Tianlei HuangBeijing's ambitious Made in China 2025 program continues to draw scrutiny and criticism, despite its dropping the use of that provocative slogan. Concerns have arisen over the Chinese government's expanding financial support for industry, particularly targeting high-tech and advanced manufacturing sectors.For all these concerns, it has been difficult for the rest of the world to track the Made in China effort because its implementation is overseen by an estimated 1,600 government-guided investment funds making investments across thousands of companies in chosen advanced industries. Except in the high-priority semiconductors area, it is not clear whether there is much central control over investments by local government-guided funds, which are undertaken with little transparency, opening the risks of corruption and lack of accountability for potential misallocation of resources.Although information about these investments is publicly available in some cases, greater transparency is urgently needed to ensure efficient and effective use of state capital and to establish accountability at a time when China's involvement in the private sector has attracted concern around the world. The fact that government-guided funds endowed with hundreds of billions of dollars in capital have emerged as engaged investors in China's equity investment market lends urgency to that concern. Most government-guided funds do not even have their own websites, and their investments are barely known to the publicexcept for the cases where publicly traded companies are involved.The 2019 budget report submitted to the National People's Congress (NPC) stressed that the government would "give full play to the leveraging role of government funds in guiding capital and resources toward key areas of strategic importance." According to Zero2IPO Research, a consultancy focused on China's venture capital and private equity, China was home to over 1,600 government-guided funds with more than RMB4.05 trillion (US$584.8 billion)[2] in capital by the end of 2018. On average, 7.57 new government-guided funds are created every month, and each fund has close to RMB2.5 billion (US$360.99 million) in capital.Making matters more complicated, the funds are mostly financed by central and local governments, large state-owned enterprises, and state-owned financial institutions. The state encourages private capital to participate in these investments, but according to the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), as long as the government is one of the investors, the fund should be considered a government-guided fund and the government needs to assess its performance. The Shanghai Integrated Circuit Industry Fund, for example, is a joint effort by Shanghai Municipality's Venture Capital Guiding Fund and the private Summit View Capital. Interestingly, the Taiwanese chip designer MediaTek Inc. also has an RMB300 million (US$43.32 million) stake in the Shanghai Integrated Circuit Industry Fund.Government-guided funds primarily make equity investments in nonlisted companies and startups in chosen sectors. In some cases, these funds also invest in listed companies through private placements in the secondary market and mergers and acquisitions. The NDRC lists seven areas that government-guided funds are encouraged to invest in: (1) nonbasic public services, such as higher education and culture and entertainment, (2) infrastructure, (3) social housing, (4) environmental protection, (5) underdeveloped regions, (6) strategic emerging industries and advanced manufacturing industries, and (7) innovation and entrepreneurship. In recent years, most visible investments made by these funds have focused on the last two areas.As noted in The State Strikes Back: The End of Economic Reform in China? by Nicholas R. Lardy, the National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, sometimes called the "Big Fund," is one of the best known government-guided investment funds. It was created in September 2014 following the promulgation of the Outline of the Program for National Integrated Circuit Industry Development by the State Council in July that year. In its initial round of fundraising, the Big Fund collected RMB138.72 billion (US$20.03 billion), well above its announced RMB120 billion (US$17.33 billion) target. The Big Fund's largest shareholders include the Ministry of Finance (36 percent) and several state-owned enterprisesChina Development Bank Capital Corporation (22 percent), China Tobacco (11 percent), Beijing E-Town International Investment and Development Corporation (10 percent), and China Mobile (5 percent).[2] The fund makes equity investments in promising semiconductor companies (mostly private), sometimes coinvesting with local government-guided funds and private venture capital. It is also a major shareholder in many local government-guided funds, including the Beijing Integrated Circuit Manufacturing Fund and the above-mentioned Shanghai Integrated Circuit Industry Fund.The Big Fund is charged with creating national champions in semiconductors. The most notable transaction was the US$780 million buyout of Singapore-listed STATS ChipPAC by Jiangsu Changjiang Electronics Technology Co. Ltd. in October 2015. With US$240 million from the Big Fund and US$150 million from a subsidiary of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation or SMIC (in which the fund was the second largest shareholder), Jiangsu Changjiang Electronics acquired STATS ChipPAC, the world's fourth largest chip-packaging and testing firm by market share at the time, and turned itself into the world's third largest in this field overnight.The Big Fund invested in more than 70 companies and projects during its first phase of investment from September 2014 to August 2018. A dozen of them are now public companies listed on the Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, and NASDAQ stock exchanges (see table 1). In most cases, the fund's investment did not change the companies' ownership status, and almost all companies in which the Big Fund invested remained private, which was in accordance with a statement made by the president of the Big Fund, Ding Wenwu, four years ago that the Big Fund did not seek to be the largest shareholder in companies it invested in.Table 1 The Big Fund's Shareholding in Listed CompaniesCompany namePlace of listingShare of the Big Fund (percent)Tongfu MicroelectronicsShenzhen Stock Exchange22Jiangsu Changjiang Electronics TechnologyShanghai Stock Exchange19Semiconductor Manufacturing InternationalHong Kong Stock Exchange16Hunan Goke MicroelectronicsShenzhen Stock Exchange16Beijing BDStar NavigationShenzhen Stock Exchange11Sanan OptoelectronicsShanghai Stock Exchange11Gigadevice SemiconductorShanghai Stock Exchange11Smit Holdings LimitedHong Kong Stock Exchange9NAURA TechnologyShenzhen Stock Exchange8Hangzhou Changchuan TechnologyShenzhen Stock Exchange7Shenzhen Goodix TechnologyShanghai Stock Exchange7ACM ResearchNASDAQ6Source: Wind Financial Information.There is one exception, howeverthe above-mentioned Jiangsu Changjiang Electronics. It was a private-owned enterprise until the Big Fund became the largest shareholder (19 percent) and SMIC became the second largest shareholder (14 percent). The company's management also changed with the Big Fund's investment. Currently, among the six directors of the board, two work for the Big Fund and two for SMIC. Only one director had served on the board before the Big Fund's investment was made.The Big Fund has launched a second round of fundraising to raise around RMB200 billion (US$28.88 billion). By the end of April 2018, the fund had already secured nearly RMB120 billion. Earlier in 2019, the Zhejiang provincial government pledged RMB15 billion (US$2.17 billion). It seems the Big Fund will soon reach its second-phase fundraising target, allowing it to continue to play an active role in propelling the development of China's semiconductor industry.In May 2019, the NPC Standing Committee (NPCSC) released its first ever five-year plan on overseeing the State Council's management of state assets. Government-guided funds will be covered in the State Council's comprehensive report to be submitted to the NPCSC in 2020 at the earliest, according to the plan. This is good news for improving accountability, but it is too early to tell if the NPCSC oversight is going to be a meaningful way to scrutinize these financing vehicles for the state's industrial policy.Notes1.

China and its revolution of robots in production chainsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 30, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 745 wordsBody Where they welded 28, now they supervise three. Where they painted 12, now they review two. The revolution of robots in production chains is advancing by leaps and bounds in China, a country that plans to multiply the number of industrial automata by ten over the next five years.  "The robots have revolutionized the entire production line and we have figures: while previously 430 people worked, now only 138 are needed to do the same tasks", tells Efe Zhang Rongzhong, deputy director of the DE & E company, manufacturer of household appliances.  In a tour of his factory located in the city of Hangzhou (in the east) these changes are evident in each of their positions. Little staff and sophisticated robots inserted in the production chain.  "Robotic laser welding has a very high precision, it is the most advanced welding method and the quality of welded products is very consistent," says a factory employee who toured the facilities.  With the traditional manual machine, 28 people were needed in this position. Now there are only three, who move the pieces while the "Motoman Yaskawa" releases the heat to weld at a much higher speed than the human.  In the area of sheet metal pressing before nine people worked. Today only one supervises how the machines make housings for the appliances.  And, in the paint shop, one of the biggest advances, thanks to two robots that spray high-pressure electrostatic powder at high speed with 24 pistols, a team of twelve people who previously painted by hand avoids being in direct contact with the chemical  "In the past we had many health problems for workers, it is not advisable to spend so much time working with chemical substances," says the spokeswoman.  Also in the handling of the plates, counts Zhang, "we recorded some accidents in the past because they are very sharp and accidents happened but now using machines for certain dangerous tasks we can protect the health of our workers," he says.  With its industrial plan "Made in China 2025", the Chinese Government plans to increase the number of industrial automata operating in the country by ten in the next five years, reaching 1.8 million units by 2025.  Although not in a way as overwhelming as it was believed a decade ago, when he imagined robots leaving humans out of work, the truth is that robotics is called to transform the labor market and there is "an evolution and reconversion of the Job positions".  This is what the World Economic Forum believes in its report "The Future of Work" of 2018: by 2025 more than half of the jobs that exist today will be replaced by tasks that will make machines.  It is estimated that about 50 million jobs will be destroyed, although at the same time about 130 will be created around this sector, so both workers and governments will have to make "a huge effort of training and adaptation" during the coming years.  Zhang confirms it. Not all the workers that have been dispensed with during the last years have gone to the streets. "Some have trained and gone to work at our technological qualification center or technological development centers, although it is true that people with a lower qualification had to be fired," he explains.  The directive ensures that its factory is one of the most technified in the country, as evidenced by its jewel in the crown, a robotic warehouse, which among other things has increased the use of space by 5 times and with elements such as data intelligence ( big data), has reduced the rate to zeroof delivery error.  24,000 cubic meters of total capacity that were previously operated by 120 workers and now only need two thanks to four robots and 24 strollers that move through the warehouse moving the pieces.  However, compared to other countries such as Japan, China still has a low rate of automation and in 2018 was 68 robots per 10,000 industrial workers, compared to 631 in South Korea, the world leader in automation.  But the impulse of the Government is strong and, based on large subsidies, in recent years the robotic companies in the country are multiplying, also driven by the change of economic model of the Asian giant.  "The labor costs are increasing," the executive chairman of the Guangdong Robotics Association, Ren Yutong recently reminded the independent newspaper South China Morning Post, and that is why "if the country wants to maintain its first position as a global exporter , every Chinese manufacturer must replace humans with robots.

Puma Teeth Seizure in China Illustrates Danger Posed to All Big Cats by Chinese DemandTargeted News ServiceMay 1, 2019 Wednesday 8:25 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 424 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: LONDON, England BodyThe Environmental Investigation Agency issued the following news release:Nine canine teeth seized in Xiamen, China have been confirmed to be from pumas, according to reports in the Chinese media.The teeth had been discovered last month in a parcel mailed from Peru to China and it appears to be the first reported case of puma canines being seized from illegal trade in China, pointing to a continuing escalation of threats posed to all the world's big cat species by Chinese demand for their parts.Demand for tiger canine teeth among Chinese and Vietnamese consumers - who may wear them as jewellery or talismans - is fuelling the illegal killing and trade of not just tigers but other big cat species whose teeth may be passed off as tiger or sold as a cheaper alternative.Each big cat has four canines. Our research has documented reported seizures of at least 441 tiger canines and 110 leopard canines since 2010. Going by these figures alone, this would indicate that at least 110 tigers and 28 leopards have been traded since 2010.However, comparing these figures to seizures of whole animals - represented by skins, carcasses, live animals and taxidermy specimens - we know that at least 1,143 tigers and 1,548 leopards have been seized from trade since 2010, with the true numbers in trade likely far higher.The huge numbers of big cat canines and claws offered for sale on WeChat and Facebook in South-East Asia, targeting Chinese and Vietnamese consumers, indicate a thriving trade. Evidently, this is a market being largely ignored by enforcement, offering criminals opportunities to reap high profits with little risk.That the market for tiger and big cat canines is impacting on South America's jaguars has been well documented and recommendations to address this threat will be discussed at the next Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Based on seizures of canines alone, a minimum of 171 jaguars are known to have been poached and trafficked between Bolivia and China between 2013-18.Aron White, Wildlife Campaigner, said: "News that this market is also driving illegal trade in puma teeth should be a wake-up call to all those working in big cat conservation and to the Chinese Government."Until demand in the main consumer market is tackled, including an unambiguous ban on any trade in big cat parts from any source and targeted consumer behaviour change efforts, all the world's big felines are under threat."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6717030 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: May 2, 2019End of Document

China says Mike Pompeo will end up on 'the ash heap of history' for marking 30th anniversary of Tiananmen Square, which Beijing is desperate to ignoreBusiness Insider USJune 4, 2019 Tuesday 06:23 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 988 wordsByline: ama@businessinsider.com,  (Alexandra Ma)Highlight: Chinese troops cleared a pro-democracy protest in Beijing with brutal violence on June 4, 1989. China is trying to erase that memory from history.BodyJeff Widener/AP; Jason Lee/Reuters; Sait Serkan Gurbuz/AP• June 4, 2019, is the thirtieth anniversary of the bloody Tiananmen Square crackdown, where Chinese troops violently shut down out a pro-democracy occupation in central Beijing.• China has more or less written the crackdown out of its history, and routinely censors discussion of it from the internet and public life.• US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo paid tribute to the victims on Monday, and called out China, which he said "tolerates no dissent and abuses human rights whenever it serves its interests."• Beijing officials hit back at Pompeo's statement, saying that critics like him "will only end up in the ash heap of history."• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.Beijing attacked US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown, a bloody event which saw the Chinese army clear out a pro-democracy protest in the capital city by shooting and mowing down protesters.In the early hours of June 4, 1989, the Chinese Communist Party sent a column of tanks and troops into downtown Beijing to break up a long-running occupation in the central Tiananmen Square. Within a matter of hours, hundreds of people were killed and thousands more were injured.China has more or less written the event out of its history, and routinely censors any mention of the incident from its internet. Many young Chinese people now have have no idea that June 4, 1989, was a significant date, according to recent reports by the BBC and            New York Times.Read more: 30 photos from the Tiananmen Square protests that China has tried to erase from historyMark Avery/APPompeo on Monday issued a scathing statement commemorating the protesters who "suffered grievously in pursuit of a better future for their country," "salut[ing] the heroes of the Chinese people who bravely stood up thirty years ago," and called on Beijing to make a full public account of those who were killed or missing in the crackdown.The Chinese Communist Party said at the time that a total of 241 civilians and security officers were killed, but other official estimates put the figure as high as 10,000. Beijing has repeatedly refused to revise their official figures, or verify other ones.Pompeo's statement added that "over the decades that followed" the Tiananmen Square crackdown, "the United States hoped that China's integration into the international system would lead to a more open, tolerant society.""Those hopes have been dashed," he said. "China's one-party state tolerates no dissent and abuses human rights whenever it serves its interests."Read more: China still gets annoyed with images showing the famous Tiananmen Square 'Tank Man,' 30 years after he became a symbol of the government's brutalityMark Avery/AP'The ash heap of history'An unidentified spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington slammed Pompeo's statement, which he said was bortn of "prejudice and arrogance," and called it an "affront to the Chinese people and a serious violation of international law and basic norms governing international relations."In a Tuesday statement, the spokesperson said: "Whoever attempt[s] to patronize and bully the Chinese people in any name, or preach a 'clash of civilizations' to resist the trend of times will never succeed. They will only end up in the ash heap of history."The mention of a "clash of civilizations" likely refers to a controversial remark by Kiron Skinner, the State Department's director of policy planning, last month where she described competition with Beijing as a "fight with a really different civilization and a different ideology," and called China a "great power competitor that is not Caucasian."Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang also told reporters on Tuesday: "The deranged babbling of these people will only end up in the trash can of history," according to Washington Post Beijing bureau chief Anna Fifield.Forrest Anderson/The LIFE Images Collection/GettyThis is not the first time Pompeo has stood up to China over Tiananmen Square.In a statement last year, Pompeo remembered "the tragic loss of innocent lives" and called on the Chinese government to fully account for those who were killed, detained, or missing in the crackdown.He also cited famous Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo's 2010 Nobel Peace Prize speech, which said: "The ghosts of June 4th have not yet been laid to rest."Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China's foreign ministry, responded then by saying that Pompeo "has absolutely no qualifications to demand the Chinese government do anything," and slammed the US's "gratuitous criticism" of China.REUTERS/Carlos BarriaPompeo's criticism and provocation of China has increased over the past few months as US-China tensions continue to mount over trade-war tensions and President Donald Trump's crackdown on Chinese tech.In March, Pompeo also met with four members of the Uighur minority, the            majority-Muslim ethnic group based in western China which is under unprecedented attack from the Communist Party.Congressmen have for months called for sanctions against those involved in the Uighur crackdown, but the Trump administration has yet to take action.In February, he also threatened the US's European allies with consequences if they do not distance themselves from the            Chinese telcom giant Huawei.           NOW WATCH: Fox News pundits are using white supremacist language tied to 'The Great Replacement' conspiracy theorySee Also:• Mike Pompeo says the US is investigating if Kim Jong Un executed a North Korean official after his summit with Trump• From iPhones to fighter jets: Here's a list of American products that could be affected if China banned rare-earth metal exports to the US as a trade-war weapon• China is reportedly on the brink of 'major retaliative measures' against the US as the trade war escalates furtherLoad-Date: June 4, 2019End of Document

Nuclear Site Activity; 2020 Vision; Bernie Fundraising; China's Economic Growth; Big Change At TwitterMORNINGS WITH MARIA MORNINGS WITH MARIA 6:00 AM ESTApril 17, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; DomesticLength: 7639 wordsByline: Maria Bartiromo, Dagen McDowell, Amy Kellogg, Ashley Webster, Richard Fowler, Cheryl CasoneGuests: Tuna Amobi, Jon Steinberg, John Thomas, Brian BelskiBodyMARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Ladies, good morning to you. Happy Wednesday, everybody, thanks for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, April 17th, your top stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the east coast. Another big morning for earnings this morning and the markets, PepsiCo is due out any moment now. We are waiting on the numbers. We will also hear from Morgan Stanley this morning. Plus, markets reacting to Netflix, a new China data overnight, the Netflix subscriber count is up, but growth is slowing. Settlement reached, Apple and Qualcomm coming to an agreement just hours after the trial began over patent royalties. What it means for the future of iPhones. And the 2020 race, President Trump predicting who will be the two finalist in the Democratic primary race. Plus, he's given them new nicknames this morning. Twitter changes, Jack Dorsey suggesting a big shift. Find out what it is, and why users are revolting. MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: All right, welcome back. We've got Futures pretty strong today. Take a look, Dow Industrials up 28 points, the S&P is up 5-3/4, and the NASDAQ up 20 points. We did have news out of China overnight, better- than-expected growth in first -- in the first-quarter economy, numbers, and retail sales better than expected. We are seeing some firmness in the Chinese market overnight, Shanghai Composite up a quarter of a percent. The Nikkei Average in Japan up a quarter of a percent, as well. We are also, of course, watching earnings, that has been setting the tone notably. PepsiCo and Morgan Stanley are out this morning. We are waiting on those numbers from PepsiCo. We want to look at earnings in terms of the growth numbers here because so far, things have been better than lowered expectations. Netflix is also reporting first-quarter results after yesterday's close, beating on earnings per share and revenue. The streaming giant gaining subscribers abroad, but also reporting lower domestic growth.Joining me right now is CFRA Research Media and Entertainment Analyst, Tuna Amobi. And Tuna, it's always a pleasure to see you, thank you for joining us.TUNA AMOBI, MEDIA & ENTERTAINMENT ANALYST, CFRA RESEARCH: Good morning. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Your reaction to the Netflix quarter?AMOBI: You know, I think, Maria, I think those earnings has yielded to where actually better than expected. The bottom line number, the revenue growth came in all very nicely. The main question was the Q2 guidance, which was lower than expectations. I think the reason for that is that they're just still cycling through the price increases that they just implemented in the U.S. a few months ago. That is also a seasonally slow quarter, but overall, I think, while growth has slowed in the U.S. unquestionably, we expect this year when all is said and done to be another record quarter subscriber growth driven by international markets.BARTIROMO: So, how do you see the streaming wars playing out here with Disney+ now ready to go head-to-head against Netflix, we've got Hulu, and then, there's, of course, Amazon, Apple, and others?AMOBI: Right, I mean it's really literally exploded, the streaming wars. I think Disney's entry is nothing short of groundbreaking, the Disney+ offering. You've got other companies, Apple, Warner Media, Comcast. So, I think when we all is said and done, this year could actually be the most remarkable year in terms of the evolution of streaming. Netflix has been getting ready for this for quite some time. They've ramped up their program investments. At the end of the day, we think there is going to be enough pie to spread around in near-term. Longer-term, there's going to be a potential shake-out of which Disney and Netflix, we expect, to be among the potential winners.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, Netflix released a public service announcement on Twitter, asking people to stop labeling films as chick flicks. What was that about? They don't like the term chick flicks?AMOBI: Right. I think, you know, frankly, I thought it was a little bit hilarious, but -- you know, it kind of goes back to, you know, the perception of the brand and kind of how they evolved, so my sense is that they want to kind of, you know, try to convey some image that is consistent with where they see the brand going, and also the fact that they're getting away from the second-run window content from the license from -- license from the studious towards their original brands.BARTIROMO: So, would you buy Netflix today, stock is under pressure on the heels of the quarter?AMOBI: Maria, we are still recommending the stock, with (INAUDIBLE) target of $425. The way we think about Netflix, three to five years out, we expect there will be a convergence of valuation metrics. In other words, companies profitable to the (INAUDIBLE) basis, we expect the free cash flow inflection to occur in next three or four years where they're going to be self-funding. Investors are going to be looking at free cash metrics, price earnings metrics, and a whole bunch of other things that we think will make them much more comparable.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Great to see you, Tuna, thanks so much.AMOBI: Thank you so much.BARTIROMO: And as you saw, Netflix shares active this morning. Meanwhile, there's this, Apple and Qualcomm reaching a settlement on patents. Dagen is on that this morning. Good morning, Dagen.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: This is a very big deal. And maybe Apple stock didn't react to it initially, but it really opens the door in terms of 5G technology for Apple. So, Apple and Qualcomm agreed yesterday to dismiss all patent litigation between the two companies around the globe. And ink a new license agreement. This is a long-running legal battle over how royalties are collected on innovation in smartphone technologies, smartphone chips. So, the settlement actually came during the opening arguments in the trial between the two companies, right after the day it started. It includes an undisclosed payment from Apple to Qualcomm. Also, a new six-year license agreement and a multi-year deal for Qualcomm to supply Apple with modem chips.Qualcomm had been claiming Apple was violating its patents by withholding royalties. That had been going on for a couple of years. Apple, meantime, was arguing that Qualcomm had been overcharging for those patents for years, abusing its dominant market position. But here's what it means, well, for Qualcomm had lost about $25 billion in market value with this looming legal threat, but for Apple, here's what it does, it will let Apple deploy Qualcomm's 5G chips in its phones. It had been working with Intel which was behind. Intel, in fact, said that it would stop developing those chips. This will let Apple keep up with Samsung, it will hope the door -- will give it a step up to compete directly with android competitors with this 5G modem technology. The modem chips, really incredible settlement. It involve --Let's take a look at how the stocks performed yesterday. So, Apple stocks really not much move yesterday. Right now, it's up one-tenth of a percent, but yesterday -- this is the premarket. Do we have what these stocks did yesterday? Because Qualcomm stock was up 23 percent when -- after this news broke. So, again, it's probably a win for both companies. And there was this weird Kentucky Fried Chicken analogy that both the lawyers were using in the opening arguments. There's some joking after the settlement was announced, after the trial is now over.BARTIROMO: Yes, big deal. Both stocks are moving this morning.MCDOWELL: Yes.BARTIROMO: Qualcomm is up about six percent on top of that big rally recently. Dagen, thanks, we will see you in a bit on that. Meanwhile, the search for answers after the iconic Notre Dame Cathedral goes up in flames. Amy Kellogg is in Paris on the ground, where the rehabilitation efforts have begun. Amy?AMY KELLOGG, FOX NEWS SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Maria. Well, one of the leading theories this morning is that the fire was caused by an electrical short that would have been generated by some service elevator that was used to reach the spire, and some sources quoted in Le Parisien Newspaper were saying that the fire actually took hold in that spire, it spread from there. But the problem is that these are -- these are theories right now. Investigators haven't been able to get inside the cathedral, Maria, because it's not safe.The next 24 to 48 hours are going to be critical in terms of determining just how good the structural integrity of the building is, because with so much water and fire damage, there's concern now that the walls may not be stable. It stands, but investigators, police, firefighters are just not sure how safe it is to be in there. However, we have seen people up on the bell towers this morning. We're learning more about policemen up on -- the firemen up on those bell towers.We've learned more about the sequence of events, the first alarm went off at 6:20 on Friday evening, but somehow, it was concluded that there was no fire in the cathedral. Then, there was another alarm that sounded at 6:43, at that point, the fire was fully engaged. The weather cock, the rooster that sat atop the spire has been recovered. The French were very excited about that this morning when the pictures emerged. There were a couple of relics embedded within that rooster, it's not clear, though, whether or not those have survived. A pieta, a beautiful marble statue from 1725, Maria, of the Virgin Mary holding Jesus also survived. There's been somber vigils, again, last night -- people praying for the survival and the -- and the regeneration of this cathedral, it's very important both religious and national symbol during this Holy Week. Maria?BARTIROMO: Wow, really interesting to see the -- those relics that did survive. Amy, thank you. Amy Kellogg in Paris this morning. Meanwhile, back here, PepsiCo just reported earnings for the first quarter. Ashley Webster has the details on what looks like a better-than-expected number, Ashley.ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: And they do, Maria. We're just going through them now. And good morning to you. PepsiCo reporting on earnings per basis, $0.97, that's a beat of $0.05. And on revenue, coming in at 12.88 billion, that's also a beat. The estimate was 12.69 billion.I was just looking at the numbers for Frito-Lay North America. Believe it or not, this segment of the company contributes more than 25 percent of the company's total revenue. That number coming in for the quarter at 3.82 billion. That seems very healthy, indeed. Latin-America revenue over a billion, Europe, the sub-Saharan African region, 1.69. Overall, pretty strong numbers. This is a company that is trying to adapt to consumers' tastes. They talk about NCDs, which means noncarbonated drinks, as people look for healthy snacks. That's very important area or cause for Pepsi as it is for others in this particular industry. But overall, Maria, pretty strong numbers.BARTIROMO: All right, we'll see any movement on the stock. PepsiCo has had a pretty good year, as we were looking at that year-to-date chart. Ashley, thank you. We'll get back to you as the earnings are coming in fast and furious this morning.Coming up, competing with Huawei, Nokia ready to expand its reach, what that means for 5G technology here at home. We're going to check out Huawei's plans. And, by the way, they've got lots of orders throughout Europe. Plus, Twitter's big shift, CEO Jack Dorsey suggesting a big change. Users are quick to react as well. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Big show this morning on the -- in the face of a big earnings week. Coming up, my "FIRST ON FOX INTERVIEW" with Lincoln President and Ford CMO, Joy Falotico is here. She's showing us the brand- new 2020 Corsair this morning. It will be on the plaza. Just Born Incorporated President and COO David Yale is with us this morning along -- he's the man behind PEEPS, we've spoken to him before, Alabaster Founder, Brian Chung, on millennial bibles, and Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano. Family Medicine Doctor, Mikhail Varshavski, Aka Dr. Mike is here. Don't miss a moment of it.We got a big show, and we want to talk about competition from Huawei this morning. Nokia is looking to expand in the United States and China by cutting deals to be a major player in both markets. The U.S. all but banning Huawei sales and that's part of Nokia's pitch. Here's what Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told me about Huawei's technology in the U.S.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Europe is pushing back on this idea that President Trump and your administration wants to ban or potentially stop -- slow down the use of Huawei Technology. Is that what -- is that what you found in Europe?MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We have been out around the world, just making sure everybody had the same information that countries understand the risk of putting this Huawei Technology into their I.T. systems. We can't forget these systems were designed by -- with the express work alongside the Chinese PLA, their military in China, they --(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: I'll tell you, joining the conversation this morning, Cheddar Founder and CEO, Jon Steinberg back with us, along with new leader senior fellow, radio host, FOX News Contributor, Richard Fowler. Great to see you both.RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good to see you, Maria.JON STEINBERG, FOUNDER & CEO, CHEDDAR: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining the conversation this morning. And we wanted to look at Huawei because this is a serious issue with the U.S. trying to ban Huawei Telecom, but it's so much cheaper than competitors, so you've got European nations, African nations, having already taken on Huawei and it's basically their infrastructure right now.STEINBERG: This equipment in the U.S. is a nonstarter. We cannot have this equipment in this country and I think the nice part about the Nokia entry is it shows how it is easy for other people to compete and supply these products when the products, which have of risk of espionage, are effectively ruled out. We've seen other companies like Blackberry migrate into self-driving auto technology. There are many companies in the U.S. and abroad that can do this equipment. It's relatively simple. And for once, other people are going to have a chance to compete in the U.S.MCDOWELL: What's interesting though is Nokia is trying to help fight the U.S. fight against Huawei, but it's also targeting China as a huge growth market when it has about 17,000 employees in the Greater China Region, including say Hong Kong and Taiwan. So this is a -- kind of a tricky tightrope act, if you will, for Nokia at this point.STEINBERG: Well, if they're selling it into China, it's fine. If the -- if the Chinese want to buy it, there's no problem, as long as we're not buying the equipment that's effectively a state-funded enterprise that's coming over here.MCDOWELL: But if China thinks that Nokia is in bed with the United States --STEINBERG: Yes.MCDOWELL: -- that that's a huge hurdle and throws up a wall, if you will, in terms of its focus on growing in China as well. It will play out in the -- literally the years to come.BARTIROMO: And that's what's happened over the years, American companies were so interested in getting a foothold in China. You know, along the way, we forgot to protect our own technology and now you've got a situation where we're recognizing that when you're a Chinese state owned company, don't press the button on any information, data is going right back to the Chinese government.FOWLER: And I think that's a very interesting thing you say that, Maria, especially as we look to the sort of China trade talks where the sticking point is intellectual property, right? And now that you have Huawei sort of trying to get into all these markets, into Europe, into Africa, and the whole idealism, we're in this place we can spy on these folks, we can take their intellectual property, and now with the Nokia in the game, there is a -- there is a competitor, and now the competition becomes about price, right? How can we compete with Huawei on price and with the United States sort of putting their thumb on the scale to saying, "We're not in Huawei, we're not into Huawei, now price is no longer -- no longer an issue.BARTIROMO: And Pompeo was very clear, those countries that continue to use the infrastructure of Huawei, which is going back to the Chinese government, will receive less information from the United States government.STEINBERG: Well -- and --BARTIROMO: That's a huge statement.STEINBERG: When I talk to people that travel to China, it's incredible, they don't bring their cell phones, they don't bring their computers.BARTIROMO: I didn't.STEINBERG: They don't -- they don't access any of their services, and when they come back, they turn off -- people tell me they turn off the equipment when they get on the plane in China and they do not turn it back when they get to the United States.BARTIROMO: That's right.MCDOWELL: But that's why I found over the years the -- what even U.S. Corporate Executives have been doing with China. It's -- it was clear to them for years, that China's spying on them, even as individuals, that China tracks every -- any business wanting to operate in China, they track literally every word --STEINBERG: That's right.MCDOWELL: -- uttered by these individuals, they know it, but they're still eager to do business there. I know it's a large market, but, again, the tradeoff is quite dangerous --BARTIROMO: No.MCDOWELL: -- in some aspects in terms of the I.P. theft and the force surrender technology?BARTIROMO: And that's what's been going in all these years. American companies saw China as this huge opportunity, 1.4 billion people to sell their products to, but all the while we were so focused on getting a foothold in China we forgot to protect our own intellectual property.MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm.BARTIROMO: And it's gotten a lot worse.MCDOWELL: Yes.BARTIROMO: This is an interesting story. And really the way that the administration is handling this, it's going to be watched closely. We'll take a short break. When we come back, extreme weather once, millions of Americans dealing with severe storms and tornadoes in parts of the United States this morning. We will take you there. Then 2020 vision, as the Democratic field expands, President Trump is handing out new nicknames to potential frontrunners. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Extreme weather warnings for millions of American this morning. Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now. Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That's right, Maria. Some 118 million people at risk today. The National Weather Service forecasting damaging winds and hail, threatening parts of Texas, and Kansas, which have already had some rough weather. In the Midwest, severe thunderstorms and isolated tornadoes. Construction of Southern Illinois and Indiana by the end of the week, storms can reach the north and the southeast as well. Well, satellite images are showing movement at North Korea's main nuclear site, the center for strategic and international studies, says images of a young bound nuclear site show five specialized railcars near the Uranium Enrichment Facility.The center adding a movement could indicated the transfer of radioactive material, which could be turned into bump fuel. Meanwhile, North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un is set to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time. South Korea's news agency says the sit-down could come as soon as next week. Well, T-Mobile is pushing back against reports their plan $26 billion merger is in jeopardy, our very own Charlie Gasparino exclusively reported that the companies have not received notice from the Justice Department and that the deal would likely be rejected by federal regulators without any major changes.Two companies say, "They are working with government officials to complete the transaction. Recent reports have suggested antitrust officials have told T-Mobile, and Sprint, their deal would likely be turned down because it would eliminate competition in a wireless market. Shares of both companies, as you could see, lower in the pre-markets, Sprint down more than five percent, T-Mobile down more than four percent, Maria.BARTIROMO: Yes.CASONE: So --BARTIROMO: Those are -- those are big moves this morning for telecom.CASONE: And a lot of back and forth. As Charlie reported yesterday, he's saying not so fast on these reports that that deal is in jeopardy, so we'll see.BARTIROMO: You're -- Thanks, Cheryl. Jon.STEINBERG: I think Charlie's right, not so fast, it was very clear what the -- what the report said which was it wouldn't be approved as it is structured now, that means that there just might be various kinds of consent decrees and merger conditions, but the market's reaction and the hysteria on Twitter that the deal is over, there was -- there was nothing in anything that suggested that and both of the CEOs came out and said, "It's an overstatement"FOWLER: I think that move by North Korea is an interesting one, right? The fact that he's meeting with Putin and the fact that he sort of revamped some of his nuclear programs, so to speak, to the fact that the two meetings with the President definitely put Kim Jong-un on the world stage in a new way.MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm.BARTIROMO: Hmm. Put Kim Jong-un on the world stage.FOWLER: In a new way.BARTIROMO: In a new way. What do you mean?FOWLER: I mean I think the fact that he met with the President of the United States gave him some legitimacy in the world to now say, "I could restart my nuclear program and I could be with world leaders." This is --BARTIROMO: So you don't think the President should have met with him then?FOWLER: I don't think the President should meet with him until there was a -- that there was actual deal on the table to get him to denuclearize and now that he has met with the President, now he has -- the world to see him as a world leader.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm. I get your point, but there haven't been any missiles tests that they will push back. There seems to be at least a conversation happening. I mean you weren't expecting Kim Jong-un to denuclearize right away.FOWLER: No. I think -- well, I mean I hear that point. I mean I think the idea that -- I mean the only thing that keeps the regime legitimate is their nuclear weapons, right? That's what -- that's been that way for decades, both his father and his grandfather, but the idea that the United States President met with him speaks to the fact that now he's a legitimate world leader.BARTIROMO: I don't know if that meeting --FOWLER: And other nations are going to take him seriously.BARTIROMO: -- shows that he's a -- well, I don't know. OK. So you see him as a -- well, he's running North Korea.FOWLER: Yes. It used to be a tin-pot regime now to a real country that people have to take seriously. Met with the leader of the free world twice.BARTIROMO: Well, he's a nuclear country. I think everybody took him seriously.FOWLER: Yes, I thought they saw him more as a tyrant, right? And more as a like, "Yes, we have to deal with him, but not seriously. We don't have to have summits with him." Now they do.BARTIROMO: All right. We will take a break. When we come back, parental comparison, Michelle Obama speaks out, likening President Trump to a divorced dad. And then spoiler alert, directors begins fans not to reveal plotlines from the new Avengers film after the clips leaked online. We'll take a look.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, good Wednesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, April 17th, your top stories right now, 6:31 a.m. on the East Coast.Investors are watching strong news out of China overnight, earnings here, at home, also setting the tone for markets. Take a look at PepsiCo, with the double-beat this morning, better-than-expected on earnings and revenue, on higher demand for snacks and beverages. Stock is up two and two-thirds percent.We are waiting on numbers from Morgan Stanley. We will have the full analysis when the numbers come out. So far, we've seen better-than- expected numbers from the banking sector. Morgan shares are up almost one percent this morning.Check broader Futures this morning, Dow Futures up 28 points, S&P Futures up 5 and a quarter points, and the NASDAQ Futures up 21-1/2, looks like we will see a firmer tone to the start of markets this morning. Yesterday's markets were slightly higher, pushed higher by financials, Dow Industrials were up 67 points, a quarter of a percent, S&P 500 was up 1-1/2, and the NASDAQ up 24 points, yesterday.European markets this morning are mixed, mostly higher, FT-100 this morning is up 4 points, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up 13, and the DAX Index in Germany up 25.Take a look at Asia overnight, we had positive news out of China. The GDP and the retail sales numbers that we were waiting on were above expectations, a lot of traders overnight, looked at those numbers as reason to buy. The Shanghai Composite was up a quarter of a percent overnight, Japan was also higher by a quarter of a percent. Those were the big moves, overnight.Michelle Obama being called insensitive this morning, the former first lady compared President Trump to a divorced dad, in America, to a broken family, the controversy about her comments, coming up.And then, Twitter changes, Jack Dorsey, suggesting a big shift is in store for Twitter, find out what it is, why users are revolting a bit on that.And then, spoiler alert, Marvel fans warn to avoid social media after scenes from the upcoming Avengers movie were leaked online, all those stories coming up this Wednesday morning, but first, our top story this half an hour.The 2020 race is on, President Trump taking to Twitter with his predictions of who will likely face him, tweeting this, I believe it will be Crazy Bernie Sanders versus Sleepy Joe Biden, as the two finalists to run against maybe the best economy in the history of our country and many other great things. I look forward to facing whoever it may be. May God rest their soul.A new national poll from Emerson College shows Bernie Sanders is the front runner in the Democratic primary race, followed by Joe Biden and Mayor Pete.Joining us right now is the GOP Strategist John Thomas, to weigh in all of this, and John, the Democratic field keeps getting bigger, do you agree that those are the front-runners, as President Trump said Biden and -- obviously, you've got Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.JOHN THOMAS, GOP STRATEGIST: Yes, actually, I think President Trump's take is the right one here, and this is what President Trump does so brilliantly. We saw it in the primary in 2016, Maria, as well as the general election, is. He defines and brands his opponents before they can define themselves in election cycle.Going, right now, looking at Bernie Sanders, because he had such an impressive fundraising haul of over $18 million in this first quarter, that makes him a viable contender, and I don't see his money shutting off.BARTIROMO: Yes.THOMAS: So what Trump just did with those two nicknames, Maria, was underscore these candidates, two fundamental flaws. One, is that Bernie Sanders is a crazy socialist who'd be bad for everyday Americans.And the other, with sleepy Joe, which really -- although, it sounds cute, it's important to note that what he's doing is he's branding Biden as out of touch with a modern America and a modern economy.BARTIROMO: Richard Fowler is here. Richard, what do you think about all of this? And let's talk policy because I still am waiting to see the policies coming out of, for example, Joe Biden, what he thinks he's going to run on, Bernie Sanders has got his Medicare-for-all, but many people poke holes in that policy, given the fact that it wipes out this private insurance industry.FOWLER: Well, I think that's a good point on the Bernie Sanders idea of, you know, wiping out insurance policies. I think, for Joe Biden, he's not in race yet, so it's hard to evaluate his candidacy until he actually announces.And I think that this race will come down to, Maria -- I think you pointed to the right issue. It will come down to healthcare, right? I think a lot of Americans are really trying to figure out what they're going to do around healthcare with the President's announcement that, you know, that his Justice Department will go after healthcare.And I think what previous conditions, sort of, being on the table for many Americans, especially in places like Michigan, in Pennsylvania, in Wisconsin, where this race will come down to, that's what this race is going to be about.And with the White House not proposing a healthcare plan, and saying they're going to wait until after the election, so I guess you have to vote for the President to find out what's in it. We'll see what happens.STEINBERG: Well, I think we know Bernie's policies. Bernie is a socialist, except when it comes to practice he's a capitalist, right? And I watched his interview on FOX News or the Town Hall, and he says that he won't apologize for making, you know, $560,000 on the book and, you know, a million dollars in prior years.But my view on it is, if he's a socialist, why doesn't he have that money go to some entity, or why doesn't he have it dispersed amongst, you know, a thousand people? So, I think he does need to actually defend that he's a capitalist in practice, but then, speaks about socialism as his theoretical world view.BARTIROMO: I didn't understand that. Capitalist in practice, and then a socialist, in terms of my views, how can you be that, Dagen?MCDOWELL: I don't -- well, I don't -- I think that their arguments for socialism fall apart if you create a system that basically inhibits wealth creation and entrepreneurship in this country. Where are you going to get the tax money from?That's what my one big issue. But I do want to point out that Bret Baier pushed Bernie Sanders on that very question during the Town Hall, which was the highest-rated Town Hall on any news network so far, so we're going to get --I'm hoping that Howard Kurtz was reporting that even like Mayor Pete Buttigieg might come -- do a Town Hall and other people who are running for the Democratic nomination.BARTIROMO: Yes, it was really good, and it was -- it was spicy. I mean, it was -- you know, they had you on edge the whole time.MCDOWELL: Well, I said this to Stuart Varney yesterday that Bernie Sanders clearly was hammering Trump immediately. And I said, be careful, do you really see yourself as the victor in the Democratic primary, and then winning the Democratic nomination. He immediately started hammering President Trump.STEINBERG: I'm so worried about this socialism thing.BARTIROMO: Yes.STEINBERG: I'm so worried about this turning away on capitalism, ultimately, whatever the least socialist, Democratic candidate is, is the one that I want to run, because capitalism is such a fundamental part of this country, it's such a fundamental part of democracy, they go hand in hand.And the fact that we have these candidates coming out, saying that we should be, you know, early Russia is just -- is just --FOWLER: I want to push --BARTIROMO: And it's mudding -- it's mudding the waters. What do you want to push back?FOWLER: I want to push back on it a little bit. I think the idea -- and I think, yes -- so, you have Bernie who is talking about, he's a socialist. I think, if you look at the rest of the field, there's a conversation about how we ensure that people have access to healthcare.There's a conversation about how we make sure that everybody has access to a good high-quality public education. Those things, in themselves, aren't socialists. The social --BARTIROMO: They all endorse the Medicare-for-all.FOWLER: Right. And Medicare-for-all, and there's different forms and facets to it, but basically what is at its root is making sure that every American has access to some form of healthcare, no matter what the cost looks like.(CROSSTALK)FOWLER: But socialism --BARTIROMO: You can't have a root with the way they do, and the way that they are proposing doing it is a big gigantic federal program, which is socialist program.FOWLER: But, let's be very -- let's be very clear, I mean, the Republicans have no solution to healthcare, right now and, I mean, the ideal of socialism (INAUDIBLE) with the government owns a means of production and no Democrat is proposing, the government (INAUDIBLE) all production, number one.And, I think, number two, more importantly, to have a conversation about Bernie's earnings without talking about the big elephant in the room that we haven't seen the President's earnings whatsoever is a little bit problematic.MCDOWELL: It is the means of production --STEINBERG: No, no, no --MCDOWELL: -- health insurance industry.BARTIROMO: Yes, go ahead. John Thomas, I want to get your take on all of this, but I also just want to say let's not underestimate all the money that Bernie has raised. This fundraising has been incredible. He's in the lead in terms of money raised $18 million so far, the New York Times, reporting some of the Democratic Party are "agonizing" over his momentum and his ability to raise money.Having said that, the Trump Administration just reported what they earned in the first quarter, and it was $30 million, so there's a lot of money on the Republican side.THOMAS: Yes, and Trump raised even more for the RNC, than just that $30 million in his campaign, so, you know, Trump is slaying it in terms of a war chest. But the money that Bernie has, makes him a viable candidate, especially in these early states.He can afford the most field organizers, the most T.V. ads. Look, Maria, if he wins Iowa, which right now, he's polling within the margin of error in the top two. If he can hold that, he will go like a rocket ship to New Hampshire where they love him. He will win New Hampshire and then he might be unstoppable.But, I want to go back to the point about, you know, you're saying -- you're talking about the elephant in the room and Trump's tax returns, here's why Bernie Sanders, being a millionaire, is such a problem for Bernie Sanders, because it undermines his fundamental brand promise, and that is, that he hates millionaires and billionaires.That millionaires and billionaires are evil capitalists and they don't belong in our society, but Bernie is a guy who has multiple homes and it turns out that he's just another rich fat capitalist, so it undermines the purity of his brand.(CROSSTALK)FOWLER: I don't think that's what he's saying, though. I think what he's saying is that everybody should pay their fair share.BARTIROMO: Who's not paying their fair share?FOWLER: We've talked about this --BARTIROMO: Just tell me who's not paying --FOWLER: No.BARTIROMO: This is really -- this is such a talking point that bothers me because the top 10 percent --FOWLER: No, Maria, we've had this conversation before.BARTIROMO: -- pay 71 percent of the tax.FOWLER: We've had this conversation before.BARTIROMO: Yes, I know, because it's a talking point.FOWLER: I know we almost agree on this point. I'm talking about folks who don't pay their fair share in capital.BARTIROMO: Like who?FOWLER: Like -- we're talking about folks who are like the capital -- people who only make their income of capital gains, who are not paying enough taxes as a secretary would --BARTIROMO: OK, all right.FOWLER: Right? And so --BARTIROMO: Like real estate investors.FOWLER: Real estate investors, hedge fund managers, where a secretary is paying 35 percent of her money in taxes, but where a hedge fund --BARTIROMO: Oh, wait a second, now you're putting apples together with oranges, because the secretary --FOWLER: No, we're talking about money going into --BARTIROMO: A secretary --FOWLER: -- money going into the general fund.BARTIROMO: -- is talking about income.FOWLER: Right.BARTIROMO: And Warren Buffett is talking about capital gains.FOWLER: But they're all --BARTIROMO: So, don't mix the two of them.FOWLER: -- income coming in, right? They're all money that could be spent.BARTIROMO: No, no, it's not. One is capital gains, one is income.FOWLER: But, isn't that money that can --STEINBERG: Capital gain is an essential part of this country and entrepreneurship.FOWLER: I agree with you, but you're saying that --BARTIROMO: Don't mix it up.STEINBERG: The idea that you own stock and you build a business, I mean, we can -- you can argue maybe it should 18 months or 2 years, but if we don't have capital gains, there's no point --FOWLER: I'm not saying you shouldn't have capital gains. I'm just saying that we should level the playing field.BARTIROMO: It is level. That's another talking point. And you're confusing it. Warren Buffett, when he talks about he has to pay less in taxes than his secretary, it's two different things.FOWLER: I agree with you.BARTIROMO: The secretary has ordinary income. Warren Buffett doesn't have an income. He's getting tax from his stock which is capital gains.FOWLER: I agree.BARTIROMO: But you just said the same point, so I have to stop you and correct you.FOWLER: No, no, no, I'm not -- what I'm saying is that Warren Buffett's capital gains should be taxed at the same rate as his secretary's income.MCDOWELL: Well, the Democrats are going one over on --FOWLER: That's all I'm saying.MCDOWELL: -- because Senator Ron Wyden has proposed taxing unrealized capital gains which is wealth confiscation. So, let's try and win the presidency on that one because Elizabeth Warren is doing the same thing with wealth --FOWLER: I mean, we could even -- we could even --MCDOWELL: -- not even a socialist, in a communist way, she wants to confiscate wealth.FOWLER: But Dagen, we could start with --we could start with making the middle class tax cut permanent, like we did the corporate tax in the Trump tax cut bill. We could start there.BARTIROMO: The reason that they have capital gains taxes lower than ordinary income taxes, is a way to encourage people to invest for the long- term, whether they --FOWLER: I agree with you.BARTIROMO: invest in a home, buy a home, invest in the stock market, buying stocks. No, but you just said you want the income --FOWLER: Maria, I agree with you.BARTIROMO: -- tax rates the same as the capital gains tax, but then you --FOWLER: What you see in the market place --BARTIROMO: OK, but you just made the statement so it forces me to stop and explain it.FOWLER: No, I agree -- what we have is this, right, is that you have corporations who have millions of dollars -- billions of dollars in profit that's not going back into market, but just sitting on their books, they are not investing, they're not hiring people, the money's just sitting there, whereas in --If that money was given to middle-class families and that money was given to working-class families, it will go right back in the economy right away.BARTIROMO: That was the point of the tax cut plan.FOWLER: The middle class tax cut wasn't permanent.MCDOWELL: You know why, because not one Democrat would step up and vote for it, that's why.FOWLER: (INAUDIBLE) Republicans going to find to pay for --MCDOWELL: No.BARTIROMO: John Thomas, thank you. We'll be right back.THOMAS: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets are higher this morning on better than expected economic growth out of China last night. We did have the retail sales numbers and the GDP number showed that it is building at a steady 6.4 percent pace in the fourth quarter. That is the first quarter GDP numbers out of China, beating expectations after factory production and retail sales also were higher than expected. Joining us right is now BMO Capital Markets Chief Investment Strategist Brian Belski. Brian, it's always great to see you.BRIAN BELSKI, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS: Nice to see you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Thanks for being here. What's your take on the China numbers and its impact?BELSKI: You know, they hit the numbers like they said they would. Shocker. Is this a negotiating plea? You know, I don't know -- ploy, I should say. You know, the old adage used to be that you take the China number and divide by two, that's the real number.BARTIROMO: You don't believe the numbers?BELSKI: No -- no, they're going to make the number that they want to make. And I think this is great news, it's reflected in the China market; the China stock market is setting new highs.BARTIROMO: Retail sales up 8.7 percent year over year, the estimate was 8.4 percent.BELSKI: Yes. I mean, the biggest thing about China that I think so many people are missing is this transition from the industrial based economy to a consumer-based economy. This is a culture that doesn't spend money. So, that's important point in terms of a near-term basis, but as they continue their growth trajectory longer term, they have to learn how to consume more on a study basis. If you've traveled to China; if you talked to Chinese investors, they are (INAUDIBLE), very aggressive, and so they will continue to mostly likely bid this market higher, but from a longer-term growth trajectory, I still question it.MCDOWELL: One concern, though, is it was in information yesterday, Federal Reserve data released that U.S. manufacturing is experiencing a slowdown. We got it for -- it was flat in March after falling the first two months of the year and manufacturing output for the whole quarter was declined at a rate, an annualized rate of 1.1 percent. And that kind of showed up in the March payrolls where you had a loss of 6,000 jobs. That's not good for -- it doesn't say that we're going into recession, but it certainly is an exclamation point on what does appear to be a slowdown in the U.S. as well.BELSKI: Well, that's a partial negative. However, you have to remember after an excessively negative four quarter, companies were very reactive. I mean, and let's face it, February in this country -- most of the country was terrible weather, and so I think that had something to do with it. We believe after this first quarter earnings period, which is going to be better than most people think, again companies are excessively reactive on a near-term basis, too, Dagen. And I think that numbers in the second quarter are going to be better again. This is a very limited data set. So, I think things are little bit better than what most people think.BARTIROMO: Does it help the U.S.?BELSKI: Yes, it does. I mean, I think because, if you take a look at equities as an asset, Maria -- equities in the U.S. have been excessively stable relative to the rest of the world -- look at Europe, right?BARTIROMO: So, you're still buying stocks?BELSKI: Yes, we're still buying stocks; and we think the (INAUDIBLE) market that we call for 2009 is very much in place. Last year was an aberration. We think earnings in the United States are not going to recess in terms of earnings recession. And we -- not is the time to continue to buy U.S. stocks.BARTIROMO: All right, we'll leave it there. Brian, it's great to see you. Thanks so much, Brian Belski.BELSKI: Thanks for having us.BARTIROMO: Coming up, Twitter's big shift; CEO Jack Dorsey suggesting a big change on the platform, users were quick to react. We've got it next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Big changes could be coming to Twitter. Users, apparently, not happy. Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.CASONE: Shockingly, right, Maria. Good morning again. CEO Jack Dorsey suggesting in a tech talk yesterday: it would be better if users followed topics and not individuals. This of course comes as Twitter is facing criticism for not doing enough to protect its users from abuse and threats -- some of those users are angry over Dorsey's proposal. One of them tweeted: "Jack Dorsey might be the most impressive CEO based solely on the fact that he has no idea what his users want." Twitter shares under pressure ahead of opening bell. Well, they were -- sorry, they just went up fractionally above the zero mark there.Well, Sequential Brands is selling the Martha Stewart Brand for 250 million. Now, Sequential bought this brand four years ago, but they paid 350 million. The buyer this time is Marquee -- they own several clothing and footwear brands. Marquee says the acquisition is going to help it move into the home and food categories.And a spoiler circulating on social media making "Avengers: Endgame" filmmakers pretty nervous -- somebody secretly recording key parts of the movie and then leaking it online. The breach has prompted directors Anthony and Joe Russo to post a letter on Twitter pleading for people to avoid ruining the ending for everybody. "Endgame" opening next week; expected to set box office records, a making run for one of the highest broken films ever, Maria. And those are your headlines.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you. We are standing by for Morgan Stanley earnings this morning. But first, we want to look at rise of the spot mini-robots. We're checking out Boston Dynamic's Dog Pound. Yes, it has a dog pound, next hour right here on "MORNINGS WITH MARIA." Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, April 17th. Your top stories just before 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast this morning. We're watching strong news out of China overnight. That set a positive tone to markets, and of course earnings, that is really the focus for Wall Street this morning -- largely better than expected. We heard from PepsiCo this morning.Load-Date: April 17, 2019End of Document

China's technology tactics irk its trading partnersAssociated Press Financial WireMay 20, 2019 Monday 7:04 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 1418 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - For four decades, Beijing has cajoled or pressured foreign companies to hand over technology. And its trading partners say if that didn't work, China stole what it wanted.Communist leaders deflected demands for change until foreign frustration erupted into a showdown with President Donald Trump. He sent shockwaves through their export industries by slapping punitive tariffs of up to 25% on Chinese goods.Europe, Japan and other trading partners object to Trump's tactics but echo American complaints. They say Beijing's tactics violate its market-opening commitments under the World Trade Organization.American prosecutors go further. They say the Communist Party is the ringleader of a global industrial spying operation.Chinese leaders have promised stronger patent protections and other legal changes. Foreign experts say that will make little difference if the party won't enforce them.The share of companies in a survey by the European Union Chamber of Commerce that said they felt compelled to hand over technology doubled from two years ago to 20 percent."It is unacceptable that this practice continues," a chamber vice president, Charlotte Roule, said Monday. "Ending its persistence needs to be a priority."Here are some tactics Beijing's trading partners complain it uses to improperly obtain foreign technology.___JOINT VENTURES: The strongest tool in Beijing's arsenal is the longstanding requirement for companies in most industries to work through state-owned local partners.The goal is for the Chinese partner to learn and eventually displace its foreign competitor.Some balked but thousands of companies cooperated as the price of admission to the most populous global market.Many companies say Chinese partners abide by promises not to abuse their access to technology. But some say partners have copied chemical formulas, industrial processes and other secrets for their own operations, sometimes with local government support.Beijing denies it forces foreign companies to hand over technology, but joint ventures won't work without foreign technology and manufacturing expertise.In the auto industry, China has promised to lift requirements for joint ventures and allow full foreign ownership by 2023. Experts say that suggests they believe Chinese automakers no longer need foreign tutors.___LEGAL PRESSURE: Pressure to hand over technology pervades Chinese law and action by regulators.Beijing promised when it joined the WTO in 2001 to treat Chinese and foreign companies equally. But 18 years later, business groups and governments say foreign companies still face special burdens, including sharing technology.The European Union filed a WTO challenge last June to Chinese laws on technology licensing it says discriminate against foreign companies. It said China's own companies are free to negotiate licensing terms, but Beijing dictates terms for foreign companies.A law approved in March bans using "administrative measures" to compel foreign companies to hand over technology. Business groups welcomed that but said Chinese officials can still use other pressure tactics.Business groups say Chinese regulators misuse a 2008 Anti-Monopoly Law to pressure foreign companies in negotiations on technology licensing.The law includes an unusual provision prohibiting "abuse of intellectual property right." Lawyers say that runs counter to the spirit of patents and copyrights, which are meant to encourage technology creation by giving the owner a temporary monopoly and the right to charge others for using it.Lawyers said Chinese regulators sometimes intervene in contract negotiations and push foreign companies to accept lower fees by threatening to launch an anti-monopoly investigation.___REGULATORY PRESSUREAuthorities also use "window guidance," or verbal orders given in secret, to compel companies to support Chinese technology development in ways the government doesn't publicly acknowledge.A decade ago, for example, global automakers agreed to help Chinese partners create new local brands.That injected foreign expertise into fledgling brands the Communist Party hoped eventually will compete in global markets in a way joint venture vehicles made under foreign brand names cannot.It made life harder for automakers by spreading their resources more thinly and adding to competition in a glutted market. Despite that, global automakers said they had commercial motivations and regulators denied they applied any pressure.The real reason? Industry researchers say regulators told automakers in private they had to cooperate if they wanted permission to expand production of their own brands.___MORE REGULATORY PRESSURERegulators also pressure foreign companies to help potential Chinese rivals develop technology.Global companies in engineering, software, pharmaceuticals and other fields have set up research centers with Chinese partners. Many say they are to take advantage of China's scientific talent pool, but such arrangements benefit potential Chinese competitors and are unusual abroad.This month, Microsoft Corp. opened an artificial intelligence research lab in Shanghai with the state-owned Zhangjiang Group.Other prominent examples include General Motors Co.'s Pan-Asia Technical Automotive Center with state-owned SAIC Motor. SAIC is the main Chinese manufacturing partner for GM and Volkswagen AG but also sells its own auto brands.___AND MORE REGULATORY PRESSURECompanies complain regulators use patent, safety and other official examinations to learn about technology, often including employees of Chinese rivals in review panels.Companies are required to provide what they say is an unusually large amount of information about products and industrial processes, including competitive secrets, to obtain patents or approval for operations.The Wall Street Journal in September cited an employee of a foreign automaker as saying there was "clear evidence of collusion" between regulators and Chinese automakers.The employee said regulators asked for blueprints of components the company was trying to prevent its Chinese partner from seeing but ignored other parts of the vehicle.___"LOCALIZING TECHNOLOGY"For decades, the ruling party has rewarded businesspeople, academics and others who "localize technology" - a euphemism for unauthorized copying of foreign know-how - with promotions, research grants, money and public praise.Security researchers say the government operates a network of research institutes and business parks to turn stolen technology into commercial products.In 2013, three Chinese scientists at New York University were charged with sending U.S. taxpayer-financed research on magnetic resonance imaging to a Chinese government-run institute.Other Chinese-born researchers in the United States have been charged with stealing chemical, seed, turbine and other technologies. Prosecutors say some had partners waiting in China to turn them into products.___OUTRIGHT THEFTAmerican prosecutors say when all else fails, top-level state companies steal foreign secrets.Pangang Group, a steelmaker owned by China's Cabinet, was indicted in 2014 on U.S. charges it paid industrial spies to steal a process from DuPont for making titanium dioxide, a white pigment widely used in toothpaste, Oreo cookies and other products.Defendants including an industry consultant and a retired DuPont employee admitted working for Pangang. But the case stalled because prosecutors had no access to Pangang Group and Chinese authorities took no action.___MILITARY SPYINGU.S. prosecutors say the Communist Party uses its military wing's cyber warfare skills to steal commercial secrets.The People's Liberation Army is regarded as, along with the U.S. and Russian militaries, a leader in research on breaking into or disabling an enemy's computer networks.Security experts say hackers believed to be Chinese soldiers or military contractors have stolen secrets including product designs, chemical processes and details of commercial negotiations.In 2014, five members of China's military cyber warfare unit were indicted on U.S. industrial spying charges.The following year, President Xi Jinping agreed with President Barack Obama to avoid using military resources to steal commercial secrets. But the U.S. National Security Agency said in November that Beijing appeared to be violating its pledge.In October, an employee of China's main spy agency was charged with trying to steal trade secrets from U.S. aviation and aerospace companies.Load-Date: May 21, 2019End of Document

Australia political leaders use Chinese app to chase votesAssociated Press InternationalApril 24, 2019 Wednesday 7:54 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 640 wordsByline: By ROD McGUIRK, Associated PressDateline: CANBERRA, Australia BodyCANBERRA, Australia (AP) - Australia's prime minister and his political rival said on Wednesday they were not tailoring their political messages to suit Chinese censors as the politicians increasingly use Chinese social media to woo Chinese-speaking voters.Prime Minister Scott Morrison and opposition leader Bill Shorten each have accounts with China's largest social media platform, WeChat, which they use to target the Chinese diaspora ahead of federal elections on May 18.Critics argue that the Australian political leaders risk being kicked off the platform if they don't comply with Chinese censorship rules.Morrison said his account has not been subjected to Chinese censorship used on social media."We haven't experienced any such censorship," Morrison told reporters.Bill Shorten, who leads the center-left Labor Party, was similarly unconcerned by the type of censorship that the Chinese Communist Party routinely exercises on Chinese social media."I'm not fussed at all," Shorten told reporters. "I do not feel censored by the Chinese government."WeChat was launched by Chinese giant Tencent in 2011 and the app, known in China as Weixin, has become essential for daily life in China.Morrison's account was registered in January under the name of a Chinese citizen in Fujian province, and Shorten's account was registered to a Chinese citizen in Shandong province, Australian Broadcasting Corp reported.Morrison said his conservative Liberal Party was trying to transfer his account to Australia."The way you set up a WeChat account, because of where it's run, is you have to work through these overseas structures and we've been in the process now over the last week or so of seeking to repatriate how that's done," Morrison said.Shorten said he left his Labor Party to set up his account. The party said it was set up in early 2017 by an Australian resident who is employed by the party. It is jointly operated by Shorten's office and the party."Labor has never experienced any censorship of our communications on any social media platforms," a party statement said. "We do not tolerate any outside interference that seeks to undermine our free and fair society."Fergus Hanson, head of the International Cyber Policy Center at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said politicians' use of Chinese social media in the Australian political debate created the possibility of censorship and self-censorship on subjects sensitive to China."It's pretty outrageous that you're in a situation where an Australian politician in a full-blown democracy is being censored in what they can say by the Chinese government trying to speak to other Australians within Australia," Hanson said. "It's absolutely preposterous."Hanson's own research estimated that there were 1.5 million active WeChat users in Australia including Chinese-speaking Australians, tourists and international students. Australia has a population of 25 million.ABC reported that in a live WeChat forum last month, Shorten was asked a series of questions relating to the Chinese tech giant Huawei that was banned from Australia's 5G network rollout, Chinese political interference, a billionaire Chinese businessman banned from Australia and perceived negative views of the Chinese Communist Party.Shorten did not answer any of the questions, the ABC reported.Fergus Ryan, a Chinese-speaking cyberpolicy analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute who has a WeChat account, suspected Shorten had self-censored."It might not be viable for them to answer every single question, but it would seem that ... he certainly side-stepped a lot of those sensitive questions," Ryan said.The Chinese Embassy in Australia did not immediately respond on Wednesday to a request for comment on the political leaders' use of WeChat and whether the same censorship rules applied.Load-Date: April 25, 2019End of Document

Former GE Engineer and Chinese Businessman Charged With Economic Espionage and Theft of GE's Trade SecretsTargeted News ServiceApril 23, 2019 Tuesday 7:34 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 956 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of New York, Grant C. Jaquith, issued the following news release:* * *- The Pair Allegedly Conspired to Steal GE's Trade Secrets for Use in Their China-Based Companies to Benefit the People's Republic of China* * *An indictment unsealed today charges Xiaoqing Zheng, age 56, of Niskayuna, New York, and Zhaoxi Zhang, age 47, of Liaoning Province, China, with economic espionage and conspiring to steal General Electric's (GE's) trade secrets surrounding turbine technologies, knowing and intending that those stolen trade secrets would be used to benefit the People's Republic of China. Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers, U.S. Attorney Grant C. Jaquith, FBI Assistant Director John Brown of the Counterintelligence Division, and Special Agent in Charge James N. Hendricks of the FBI's Albany Field Office made the announcement.According to the 14-count indictment (copy attached), Zheng, while employed at GE Power &#38; Water in Schenectady, New York, as an engineer specializing in sealing technology, exploited his access to GE's files by stealing multiple electronic files, including proprietary files involving design models, engineering drawings, configuration files, and material specifications having to do with various components and testing systems associated with GE gas and steam turbines. Zheng e-mailed and transferred many of the stolen GE files to his business partner, Chinese businessman Zhaoxi Zhang, who was located in China. Zheng and Zhang used the stolen GE trade secrets to advance their own business interests in two Chinese companies, Liaoning Tianyi Aviation Technology Co., Ltd. (LTAT) and Nanjing Tianyi Avi Tech Co. Ltd. (NTAT), companies that research, develop, and manufacture parts for turbines.The indictment also alleges that Zheng and Zhang conspired to commit economic espionage, as the thefts of GE's trade secrets surrounding various turbine technologies were done knowing and intending that the thefts would benefit the People's Republic of China and one or more foreign instrumentalities, including LTAT, NTAT, Shenyang Aerospace University, Shenyang Aeroengine Research Institute, and Huaihai Institute of Technology. The defendants, through LTAT and NTAT, received financial and other support from the Chinese government and coordinated with Chinese government officials to enter into research agreements with Chinese state-owned institutions to develop turbine technologies."The indictment alleges a textbook example of the Chinese government's strategy to rob American companies of their intellectual property and to replicate their products in Chinese factories, enabling Chinese companies to replace the American company first in the Chinese market and later worldwide," said Assistant Attorney General Demers. "We will not stand idly by while the world's second-largest economy engages in state-sponsored theft. As part of the Attorney General's China Initiative, we will partner with the private sector to hold responsible those who violate our laws, and we urge China's leaders to join responsible nations and to act with honesty and integrity when competing in the global marketplace.""As alleged, the thefts of trade secrets to benefit the People's Republic of China are serious crimes against the victimized company and our country," said United States Attorney Jaquith. "Both fair competition and incentivized innovation require that American companies be able to rely on the secrecy of technological advances forged through their talent and tenacity. When technology is taken through treachery, we will continue to work with the National Security Division and the FBI to prosecute the perpetrators.""American businesses spend many hours and large amounts of money developing unique technology. When such technology is stolen it can be devastating to U.S. businesses and can result in American workers losing jobs," said FBI Assistant Director Brown. "China continues to support behavior that violates the rule of law. This case demonstrates the FBI will continue to pursue China's efforts to steal American technology.""Economic espionage and the theft of trade secrets have a profound impact on our companies and communities," said FBI Special Agent in Charge Hendricks. "We view this as a grave threat to our economic and national security and the FBI will work tirelessly to prevent the loss of American technology and American jobs."Zheng was arraigned today in Albany before United States Magistrate Judge Christian F. Hummel, and released with conditions pending a trial before United States District Judge Mae A. D'Agostino.The economic espionage counts (Counts One, Three, Four, Seven, Eight and Eleven) carry a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison, a fine of up to $5,000,000, and a term of supervised release of up to three years. The trade secrets theft counts (Counts Two, Five, Six, Nine, Ten, Twelve and Thirteen) carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000, and a term of supervised release of up to three years. Count Fourteen of the indictment, which charges Zheng with making false statements to the FBI during a voluntary interview, carries a maximum sentence of 5 years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000, and a term of supervised release of up to three years.The charges in the indictment are merely accusations. The defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.This case is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Rick Belliss, and National Security Division Trial Attorneys Jason McCullough and Matthew Chang.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6706816 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: April 24, 2019End of Document

All Rights ReservedLength: 707 wordsByline: mhernbroth@businessinsider.com,  (Megan Hernbroth)Highlight: A senior Chinese official said that US pressure to force concessions will not be effective and that tariffs have not "made America great again."BodyOliver Contreras/Getty; Greg Baker/Getty; Shayanne Gal/Business Insider• On Sunday, a senior Chinese official made a series of statements outlining the Chinese government's terms for negotiation ahead of the international G20 summit, according to multiple reports.• The official also pushed back on the United States' strategy of using increased pressure to force concessions from China, according to reports.• The Chinese government's white paper laid out specific requirements for the trade deal: the United States remove all additional tariffs, China's purchases of US goods should be "realistic," and there should be a clearly defined "balance" in the agreement's text, according to a Bloomberg report.• This comes amid worries of a tech Cold War between the United States and China sparked by the US administration's blacklisting of Huawei.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.On Sunday, a senior Chinese official made a series of statements outlining the Chinese government's terms for negotiation and pushed back on the United States' use of pressure to force concessions, according to multiple reports.Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen, who led the working-level team in earlier negotiations, said on Sunday that the US bears responsibility for the collapse of trade talks, and noted that any deal must include "balanced" language between the two countries, according to a Bloomberg report."We're willing to adopt a cooperative approach to find a solution," Wang said, according to a Wall Street Journal report.According to an Associated Press report, Wang added: "During the consultations, China has overcome many difficulties and put forward pragmatic solutions. However, the U.S. has backtracked, and when you give them an inch, they want a yard."Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe reinforced Wang's comments during a defense forum in Singapore on Sunday, according to the AP report."If the U.S. wants to talk, we will keep the door open. If they want a fight, we will fight till the end," Wei said.Washington raised tariffs to 25% from 10% on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods on May 10, and Beijing retaliated three days later by announcing raised tariffs on $60 billion worth of American goods that went into effect Saturday. In May, the US made a list of prospective tariffs on another $300 billion worth of goods that have yet to go into effect. Read More:THE TECH COLD WAR: Everything that's happened in the new China-US tech conflict involving Google, Huawei, Apple, and TrumpAccording to a white paper released by the Chinese government alongside Wang's public comments, the trade war has not "made America great again," and has instead had negative impacts across the US economy.The white paper also outlined requirements for a trade deal between the two countries: the United States remove all additional tariffs, China's purchases of US goods should be "realistic," and there should be a clearly defined "balance" in the agreement's text.The statements come ahead of the G20 summit, where it is unclear whether negotiators will meet. According to a Wall Street Journal report, the paper and the timing of its release is a way for China to make its position clear going into the international summit.This all comes as trade tensions between the United States and China continue to escalate in what is feared to become a tech Cold War. Washington's blacklisting of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei is still a major pain point in negotiations, and has led to Chinese retaliation against US tech companies.

China is investigating FedEx after it diverted packages to the United StatesCNN WireJune 3, 2019 Monday 1:28 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 442 wordsByline: By David Goldman, CNN BusinessDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  The Chinese government is investigating FedEx after Huawei said the delivery company diverted to the United States two packages intended for the company's offices in China.Already on edge about Huawei and relations with the United States, Chinese government authorities issued a strong statement: FedEx's action has "seriously harmed the legitimate rights and interests of its client, and violated Chinese laws and regulations on the express delivery sector."The Chinese authorities said they would look into the matter. "We welcome foreign companies' lawful operations in China," said Wang Shouwen, China's vice minister of commerce and deputy trade negotiator at a press conference Sunday morning. "But if they violate Chinese laws, we need to investigate them in accordance with Chinese laws."The packages, whose contents are unknown, were supposed to be delivered from Japan to China. But they ended up in the United States. FedEx said they were misrouted in error, and the company has apologized. "Our relationship with Huawei Technologies and our relationships with all of our customers in China are important to us," the company said in a statement. "FedEx will fully cooperate with any regulatory investigation into how we serve our customers."Huawei welcomed FedEx's apology, but said it was suspicious that the diversion was purposeful."I don't think it is right for any company to intercept or detain individual documents or information," said Song Liuping, Huawei's chief legal officer, in a statement last week. "Our rights were infringed on, and we can claim and defend for ourselves if that were to be true."The incident comes at a awkward time for Huawei and US-China relations.The United States has raised tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods and escalated its campaign against Huawei, one of China's most powerful tech companies. Last month, the Trump administration added it to a list of companies it says undermine American interests.That forced crucial suppliers to cut ties with Huawei. Wireless companies around the globe followed suit by delaying the launch of Huawei smartphones, including in the United Kingdom and Japan.In response, the Chinese government imposed retaliatory tariffs on American imports. And the Chinese government is working to establish an "unreliable entity list," essentially a blacklist, which would include foreign companies, individuals and organizations, according to a statement Friday from China's Commerce Ministry.-- CNN's Sandi Sidhu and Steven Jiang contributed to this reportTM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

TAIWANESE MAN FACES THAI TRIAL FOR ALLOWING RADIO BROADCASTS INTO CHINAStates News ServiceJune 13, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 930 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A Taiwanese businessman is scheduled to face trial in Thailand's northern Chiang Mai city next week on charges that he illegally hosted a radio station that broadcast uncensored news to listeners in China, amid claims that Beijing pressured Thai authorities to shut down the station.The June 19-20 hearing at the Chiang Mai provincial court comes more than five months after Chiang Yung-hsin, 52, was indicted on charges of setting up the station without a permit for Sound of Hope (SOH), a San Francisco-based radio network that was founded by Falun Gong, a religious movement banned in China, according to court documents.Chiang, who could be jailed for up to five years if convicted, denies the charges, saying the broadcasting facility was set up by his tenants."I did not set up any radio station, but friends used the premises I rented to set up transmitters," Chiang told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service, in a brief interview in Bangkok through an assistant while denying the charges against him.Chiang's attorney was not available for comment. Prosecutors and Chiang's defense team are scheduled to present their cases over the two-day hearing.Sound of Hope Radio is a public network that broadcasts news to China through shortwave radio signals in nearby countries, spokesman Frank Lee said.Lee alleged that the Thai government pressured Chiang, who was not aided by a translator, to sign documents pleading guilty at the time of his arrest. He also alleged that Thai officials were pressured by the Chinese government."Giving in to the pressure from Beijing to suppress free press is not good for Thailand and its people," Lee told BenarNews."Mr. Chiang is a volunteer for SOH, he didn't do this for his own gain. We urge the Thai government to free Mr. Chiang so that he can return to Taiwan to his wife and two children."But Thai officials flatly rejected the claims."Thai law enforcement arrested Chiang without any pressure from the Chinese," a Thai security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told BenarNews.In August 2018, officials shut down the shortwave radio station broadcasting from property that Chiang rented in Chiang Mai, and arrested him on Nov. 22, 2018. He was released on bail three days later but ordered to remain in Thailand.Police filed the charges against Chiang alleging that he violated the Radio Communications Act and the Broadcasting and Television Business Act, both of which carry a sentence of up to five years if convicted because he did not have the necessary permission or license to operate, according to various sources."The Thai justice system is handling this case," Busadee Santipitaks, spokeswoman for the ministry of foreign affairs, told BenarNews when asked for comment.Protests against prosecutionIn January, press freedom group Reporters Without Borders (RSF) spoke out against Chiang's arrest."This totally unjustified arrest deals a new blow to the freedom to inform in Thailand and penalizes Chinese listeners who count on this radio station for information that circumvents censorship," RSF said in a news release at the time."We call on the Thai authorities to stop abetting Beijing's operations against opposition media outlets and to drop charges against Chiang."RSF said it has learned that the Chinese government pressured the Thai authorities to shut down the radio station.Paris-based RSF said Thai officials took the action after receiving a complaint from a "mysterious witness" who claimed to have seen a 30-meter (100-foot) antenna being erected at the site.SOH insisted that no antenna was constructed because it is not needed for shortwave broadcasting and denied any involvement in "illegal broadcasting," according to RSF.U.S.-based Freedom House had also spoken out against Chiang's arrest. It said the Thai government took advantage of his limited knowledge of the language and "deceived Chiang into what amounted to signing a confession.""This is not the first time Beijing has pressured Asian governments to crack down on SOH broadcasts," Freedom House had said in a recent update of press freedom news related to China published on its website. "In 2011, two men in Vietnam were jailed for broadcasting content into China, and Indonesian authorities attempted to shut down SOH affiliate Radio Era-baru, which transmitted programming to local Chinese communities in Southeast Asia."Lee said the SOH broadcasts were needed."SOH believes shortwave broadcasting to China is very critical to the people in there to learn about truthful and accurate news in China and around the world," Lee said. "The Chinese communist regime constantly censors news on its human rights violations, religious persecution and objective news from around the world."Founded in 1992 in China's northeast, the Falun Gong spiritual movement gained increasing influence as the fastest growing religion in the PRC and overseas over the next seven years. In 1999 the Chinese government at the orders of then President Jiang Zemin began a harsh and sometimes deadly crackdown on the sect, dragging practitioners from their homes and sending them to detention centers.Outside of China, the movement was considered harmless and continued to flourish. It is often cited as an example of religious persecution in China, with practitioners and allied religious freedom advocates holding protests in major cities to bring attention to the situation faced by Falun Gong believers in the PRC.Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Load-Date: June 13, 2019End of Document

These North Korean defectors were sold into China as cybersex slaves. Then they escapedCNN.comMay 19, 2019 Sunday 1:52 PM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 2689 wordsByline: By Julie Zaugg, CNNDateline: Jilin, China BodyWearing big black headphones and sitting on a blue floral bedspread, North Korean defector Lee Yumi was video chatting with yet another stranger online, dark rings shading the pale skin under her eyes.For five years, Lee -- whose name has been changed for her safety -- says she had been imprisoned with a handful of other girls in a tiny apartment in northeast China, after the broker she trusted to plan her escape from North Korea sold her to a cybersex operator. Her captor allowed her to leave the apartment once every six months. Attempts to escape had failed.Lee's story is shared by thousands of North Korean girls and women, some as young as 9 years old, who are being abducted or trafficked to work in China's multimillion-dollar sex trade, according to a report by the London-based non-profit organization Korea Future Initiative (KFI).North Korean women are often enslaved in brothels, sold into repressive marriages or made to perform graphic acts in front of webcams in satellite towns near cities close to China's border with North Korea, the KFI found. If caught by the Chinese authorities, they face repatriation to North Korea where defectors are often tortured. CNN was not able to independently verify claims made in the report.Lee, however, had just found a lifeline. The stranger the 28-year-old was talking to online was not a cybersex customer. He was a South Korean pastor -- and he had promised to save her."Don't worry, we are going to rescue you," he said.Lee smiled weakly and started to tear up, before typing back: "Thank you. I'm afraid."Escape from North KoreaThere are no official statistics showing exactly how many North Koreans have fled their country, which is home to about 25 million people. South Korea says it has welcomed more than 32,000 defectors since 1998. Last year alone, the country received 1,137 defectors -- and 85% of them were women."It is much easier for them to flee, because they are not usually enrolled in formal employment at a factory or a state firm where any absence would be immediately reported," said Yeo Sang Yoon, from the Database Center for North Korean Human Rights, an NGO in Seoul. "They are in charge of the household and can thus slip away unnoticed."Lee grew up in a family of low-level party cadres in North Korea."We had enough food," she said. "We even had rice and wheat stored in the garage." But Lee felt her parents were too strict. "I had to be home before sundown, and they didn't allow me to study medicine."One day, after getting into a fight with them, she decided to cross the border into China. Lee said she found a broker to facilitate the dangerous move who promised her a job in a restaurant.That promise turned out to be a lie.Usually, women like Lee pay brokers $500 to $1,000 to organize their safe passage to China, according to NGOs and defector accounts.To reach China, many defectors cross the Tumen River that separates North Korea from China on foot at night, sometimes in freezing weather with the water coming up to their shoulders.After Kim Jong Un came to power in 2011, border security was tightened to avoid the bad publicity associated with defections and prevent information about North Korea trickling into the country, according to Tim Peters, an American pastor who co-founded an NGO called Helping Hands that helps defectors flee. An electric fence was added, as well as cameras at the border."On the Chinese side, patrols were also increased because Beijing is afraid an influx of refugees could destabilize its own regime," he added.North Korea is visible from Yanji in China.Two huge portraits of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il hang at the entrance of a bridge linking the two countries.Once on Chinese soil, defectors must reach the city of Tumen that sits right up against the icy river, in a lunar landscape of barren hills. North Korea is visible from the town -- farmers in a village there can be seen plowing their fields with antique machinery.Lee crossed the Tumen River in a group of eight girls.When she arrived in China, Lee said she was taken to a apartment on the fourth floor of a pale yellow building in Yanji, a city in Jilin province about 50 kilometers from Tumen, where most signs are written in Korean and Chinese and scores of restaurants sell bibimbap and kimchi, due to the large population of ethnic Koreans.At the apartment, she realized there was no restaurant job.Instead, Lee said her broker had sold her for 30,000 yuan (about $4,500) to the operator of a cybersex chatroom."When I found out, I felt so humiliated," she whispered. "I started crying and asked to leave, but the boss said he had paid a lot of money for me and I now had a debt towards him."Korean NGOs estimate that 70% to 80% of North Korean women who make it to China are trafficked, for between 6,000 and 30,000 yuan ($890 to $4,500), depending on their age and beauty.Some are sold as brides to Chinese farmers; more recently, girls have increasingly been trafficked into the cybersex industry, according to the KFI.Rising wages in northern China cities have led to a greater demand for prostitutes among the male population, according to the KFI report. In southern China, trafficked women from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia has typically met that demand. But in northeastern provinces, men have turned to North Korean refugees.A spokesperson for the Chinese government said in a statement to CNN: "I want to stress that the Chinese government pays high attention to foreign citizens' legitimate rights according to law, also combat activities of human trafficking women and child."Michael Glendinning, director of the KFI, said the Chinese government was "not doing enough to protect North Korean women and girls in its territory at all.""China must work to crack down on the networks and individuals -- including Chinese public officials -- responsible for the trafficking of North Korean women and girls, he said. "But it must do so in a way that ensures that these women and girls are not repatriated to North Korea where they would face torture, imprisonment, and possibly extrajudicial killing."Two other North Korean women already lived in the two-bedroom apartment Lee was delivered to. One was 27 years old, had her own bedroom and seemed close to the chatroom boss. "I think she was supposed to spy on us," said Lee.The other girl was Kwang Ha-Yoon, whose name has been changed to protect her identity for her safety. Kwang was 19 years old and had been locked up for two years when Lee arrived."My parents split up when I was very young and I grew up with my mother and grandparents," she said. "We never had enough to eat." Kwang left North Korea to earn money to send to her family. "Both my mother and my grandmother had cancer and needed treatment," she said.But all the money Kwang earned in China went to her captor.Lee and Kwang had to share a room."The only furniture was two beds, two tables and two computers," recalled Kwang. "Every morning, I would get up around 11 a.m., have breakfast and then start working until dawn the next day." Sometimes, she would only get four hours of sleep. If they complained, they would get beaten, although both women said they did not suffer sexual abuse by their captor.Work involved logging onto an online chat platform on which South Korean men can pay to watch girls perform sexual acts.Within minutes of logging on to the site, users are barraged by women on the platform sending text messages asking for a video chat in a private room.They all claim to be from a major city in South Korea. The minimum price to chat on the site is 150 won (13 cents), but girls can set the entry price for a room, with popular accounts tending to have a more expensive entry fee. Tips start at a minimum of 300 won (25 cents), but can go far higher as customers try to persuade the girls to fulfill their requests. Lee and Kwang were tasked by their captors with keeping the men online for as long as possible. In South Korea, where prostitution is illegal, these services have become increasingly popular in recent years.CNN reached out to the platform to ask what steps it takes to protect women like Lee and Kwang on its site, but the company did not respond."Some of the men just wanted to talk, but most wanted more," said Lee, with a shudder of disgust. "They would ask me to take suggestive poses or to undress and touch myself. I had to do everything they asked.""I felt like dying 1,000 times, but I couldn't even kill myself as the boss was always watching us," she said.Her captor was a man of South Korean descent who slept in the living room to keep a close eye on the women."The front door was always locked from the outside and there was no handle on the inside," said Kwang. "Every six months, he would take us out to the park."On this small patch of green next to their apartment, retirees would meet to dance to music each afternoon."During those outings, he would always stay right next to us, so we never got to talk to anyone," said Lee. In 2015, Lee tried to escape by climbing out of a window and down a metal drain, but she fell and hurt her back and leg. She still limps slightly.When their captor wanted something from the girls, he would try to sweet talk them, promising a cut of their earnings or to let them go free to work in South Korea one day.But when Kwang asked for a piece of the 60 million won (around $51,000) she estimated she had made for him, he got angry."He started kicking, slapping and cursing me," she said.During the seven years Kwang spent locked up in his apartment, she said he never gave her a cent.A ray of lightIt was during the summer of 2018 that Lee finally saw her chance to escape."One of my customers realized I was North Korean and was being held captive," said Lee. While most men probably knew the girls weren't South Korean, because North Koreans have different accents and dialects to people in the south, they chose to look the other way.This man was different."He bought a laptop and let me take control of the screen remotely, so I could send messages without my boss noticing," Lee said.The man also gave her the phone number of a South Korean pastor named Chun Ki-Won.Chun, a mild-mannered man with high cheekbones and wavy gray hair, is one of a band of Korean pastors who specialize in helping North Korean women escape from China. Chun said his Christian aid organization, Durihana, has helped over 1,000 defectors reach Seoul since 1999. Korean media has nicknamed him the Asian Schindler, after the German industrialist and Nazi Party member who saved the lives of 1,200 Jews."In the past few years, dozens of missionaries linked to my organization have been deported from China," he said from his Seoul office that overflowed with plants, books and religious figurines. "There are only a few left, and they have to stay on the move constantly to avoid being arrested."China is a close ally of Pyongyang and doesn't consider North Korean defectors refugees, instead seeing them as illegal economic migrants. "When it catches them, it sends them back (to North Korea), where they face torture, internment in a labor camp and sometimes death," said Lee Eunkoo, the co-founder of Teach North Korean Refugees, an NGO that helps defectors learn English.In September 2018, Lee contacted Pastor Chun on KakaoTalk, a Korean messaging service."Hi, I want to go to South Korea. Can you help me?" read the first message she sent.Over the following weeks, Lee explained to Chun how she had ended up in a cybersex chatroom. He asked her about the apartment's layout and her boss' comings and goings.By mid-October a plan had been hatched: Chun would send a team to Yanji to extract Lee and Kwang.On October 26, while Yumi's boss was away for the day, Durihana's members arrived at the foot of the building. The two girls knotted their bedsheets together and dropped them out of their window. The extraction team then tied a rope to the sheets, which the girls pulled up and used to lower themselves safely to the ground.They were only able to take a small backpack with a couple of essentials -- a pack of wet wipes and a comb. They jumped into a car and sped away.The whole operation took minutes.Journey to the southKorean pastors have set up a network of routes and safe houses in China inspired by the Underground Railroad, the secret passages enslaved African-Americans used to escape to free states from the late 1700s until the US Civil War."Each individual cell knows nothing about the other ones, to avoid compromising the whole operation if one of them gets caught," said Tim Peters, the American pastor living in Seoul who is helping North Koreans flee.Before 1998, defectors would simply knock on the door of the South Korean consulate general in Shenyang, the capital of neighboring Liaoning province, around 790 kilometers (490 miles) from the border with North Korea.But during the Sunshine Policy era (1998 to 2008), which saw a rapprochement between Seoul and Pyongyang, several refugees were deported to North Korea from the Shenyang consulate, according to the book "Escape from North Korea: The Untold Story of Asia's Underground Railroad" by Melanie Kirkpatrick. Defectors then started crossing the Gobi desert into Mongolia, aiming to reach the South Korean embassy in the capital. But that route closed in 2010, when Ulaanbaatar reinstated strong diplomatic links with North Korea.The only option left was to go south through China, hoping to reach a country that wouldn't send North Korean refugees home.After escaping Yanji, Lee and Kwang said they went across China on buses and trains using fake Korean passports. Their last stop was Kunming, in China's deep southwest. From there, most defectors cross the border illegally into Laos or Myanmar and either head for the South Korean Embassy in the capital cities of those countries, or continue to Bangkok, in Thailand. CNN has not revealed which country Lee and Kwang traveled to for security reasons.Lee and Kwang met with a Chinese man who took them across the mountains into a neighboring country."We walked for five hours through the jungle, before reaching a road where a car was waiting for us," said Kwang. Chun later met them in the middle of the night on the side of a road. "I burst into tears as soon as I saw him," said Kwang, who is now 24 years old. "For the first time in a very long time, I felt safe."After two more days of traveling by car and bus, they reached the capital city. "We were stopped several times by the police for routine checks, I was terrified," said Kwang.In total, they said their journey from Kunming took 50 hours.As they rode towards the embassy in a tuk tuk, Lee stared giddily at the urban landscape unfolding before her eyes. "I'm so happy!" she said, as the embassy approached. Kwang was more nervous. "I know I should feel joy, but I just feel empty," she said. "I don't know what to expect, and I am afraid of the interrogations at the embassy."At 5.30 p.m., the two defectors and Chun walked up to the black and golden gate of Seoul's diplomatic representation. Before they had a chance to ring the bell, they said a man in a black shirt opened the door and ushered them inside with a smile.A few minutes later, Chun walked out -- alone.The embassy, which receives about 10 defectors a month, according to officials, kept the women for about 10 days for questioning. Those who satisfy the questioning process will fly to freedom in South Korea.Upon arrival in South Korea, defectors spend three months at Hanawon, a processing center where they learn how to navigate staples of modern life such as taking the subway, getting cash from an ATM or buying groceries in a supermarket. They are then provided with a South Korean passport, a subsidized apartment and the right to enroll at a university for free.Before entering the South Korean Embassy, Lee had given her new life a lot of thought."I want to study English and Chinese and maybe become a teacher," she said.Kwang, who had left school at 12, hoped to graduate."I never really had the luxury of wondering what to do with my life," she said.Load-Date: June 11, 2019End of Document

AAM President Scott Paul Testifies on Security, Competitive Risks of State-Owned EnterprisesTargeted News ServiceMay 16, 2019 Thursday 7:42 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1428 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Alliance for American Manufacturing issued the following news release:Today, Alliance for American Manufacturing President Scott Paul testified before the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to outline the security and competitive risks of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to American public transit and freight systems.Mr. Paul warns in The Washington Post that SOEs, such as the China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation (CRRC), are a threat to competition due to their unfair bidding practices, "Once CRRC achieves enough market share in the U.S. transit business, all other competitors fall by the wayside. ... That's certainly not good for taxpayers or competition, or for transit providers that are looking for legitimate, fair and broad competition for their contracts."In an October 2018 report on the threats U.S. freight rail infrastructure faces, Brig. Gen. John Adams, U.S. Army (Ret.), highlights that "[r]ail manufacturing is one of the 10 industries included in the Chinese government's 'Made in China 2025' initiative, a plan targeting global dominance in sectors that the Government of China considers most strategic to its global aims," making the inroads that Chinese SOEs, including CRRC, have accomplished in the sector alarming.TEXT OF MR. PAUL'S TESTIMONY AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY:Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Graves, and members of the Committee, on behalf of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a labor-business partnership, thank you for the opportunity to testify.I'm going to summarize my extensive written testimony and make three points. First, China's state-owned enterprises, and Beijing's economic policies that support these firms, are a threat to American jobs and security. Second, firms in the rail and bus transit space such as CRRC and BYD, that have established a foothold in the U.S., thanks in part to government contracts financed by taxpayers, are part of this web and represent the tip of the iceberg. Third, you can protect American jobs and security, and demand reciprocity, through legislation and regulation.China's model of state-led capitalism has contributed to the loss of 3.4 million U.S. jobs and the hollowing out of our industrial base as dumped and subsidized imports surged into our market since China joined the WTO in 2001. China heavily subsidizes its 51,000 state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in almost every industry imaginable. These SOEs have devastated broad swaths of American manufacturing through dumping products, building up overcapacity, and targeting American firms with cyberhacking and IP theft. The SOEs are also supported by policies including but not limited to discriminatory loan rates, tax rates, direct subsidies, protected home markets, lax labor and environmental regulation, and exchange rate misalignment. Put simply, firms in the U.S. and elsewhere are not competing with other companies, they are competing with an entire nation, which has amassed $29 trillion in value for these SOEs.And now these SOEs threaten the infrastructure arena. Two such firms - China Railroad Rolling Stock Corporation (CRRC) and Build Your Dreams (BYD) - have begun securing lucrative, U.S. taxpayer-supported contracts to supply our major cities with transit rail cars and electric buses. Their ambitions are sizeable: Establishing a substantial foothold in public procurement as a means of expanding into private sectors such as the freight rail and passenger automobile markets, as I illustrate in my written testimony.CRRC is systematically working to drive established competitors out of the market and to achieve a monopoly in transit rail car production. If successful, this would be a disaster for taxpayers and for transit providers that are looking for legitimate, fair and broad competition for their contracts. You can look at the Australian market for perspective. In just the last decade, CRRC undertook a similar campaign leading to the obliteration of that country's rail manufacturing sector.While final assembly of CRRC rail cars may be local, component and parts manufacturing include heavy Chinese content. CRRC's U.S. assembly plants are a vehicle for this content to be delivered into the U.S. market. That puts 90,000 high-wage jobs--many of them unionized--in 750 companies and 39 states, at risk of being displaced.Dominating the medium- and heavy-duty electric bus sector is also in Beijing's plans. A key feature of China's industrial policy is the support of "national champions" such as BYD. Its revenue growth has coincided closely with the trend of government support subsidies, access to below-market-rate capital and other industrial policies.It's clear BYD is also a delivery system for Chinese imports at taxpayer expense. An Inspector General (IG) report issued by the City of Albuquerque calls into question the legitimacy of BYD's compliance with federal Buy America laws.Further evidence to support these assertions includes BYD's public comments to the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) requesting Section 301 tariff relief for Made in China storage batteries, parts, and electric vehicles, specifically noting four electric bus models.Already the world's largest electric vehicle company by sales, BYD executives have been outspoken in their plans to one day sell passenger cars in the United States. BYD's chairman has boasted of plans to dominate world auto sales by 2025.BYD's economic model of assembling vehicles in the United States, but relying on imported parts and components, would threaten over 5,600 parts suppliers spread across the nation, employing 871,000 workers, the very heart of American manufacturing.My testimony today should not be read as an attack on the American workers employed by CRRC or BYD, nor on foreign investment. We must respect the dignity of work and encourage foreign investment. But this is no ordinary foreign investment. Our workers and firms in the supply chain are not competing with a company in CRRC or BYD, they are competing with an entire country.I wish to outline a series of recommendations for this committee and Congress to consider.First, we urge your support for the bipartisan Transit Infrastructure Vehicle Security Act, introduced by several distinguished committee members, including Representatives Rouda and Crawford. We agree that America's tax dollars should not be used to support Chinese SOEs seeking to undermine legitimate competition.Second, transit systems such as WMATA should not be permitted to allocate "non-federal" resources for the procurement of rail cars from CRRC when it also receives hundreds of millions annually from the federal government.Third, close loopholes and add teeth to Buy America. The U.S. Department of Transportation and Federal Transit Administration (FTA) need to promptly modernize Buy America rules as it pertains to battery-electric power propulsion systems on buses. A long-term plan, with appropriate recognition of the need for transition strategies, must be adopted.Fourth, we urge that both CRRC's and BYD's Buy America certifications be audited to ensure compliance.Fifth, even if bids by firms like CRRC and BYD were to abide by market-based pricing, it is necessary that we address security concerns.Sixth, we must protect our freight rail sector with far more transparency and limitations on Chinese state involvement.Seventh, we must insist on reciprocity in procurement. No U.S.-based firm can enter the Chinese procurement market the way in which CRRC and BYD have entered the American market. China is not a signatory to the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA). Put simply, the United States should consider banning all Chinese products and firms from our procurement market until there is demonstrable progress on reciprocity in law and in practice.Finally, we encourage you to continue the hard work of passing a substantial infrastructure investment paired with strong Buy America requirements. A lack of adequate, consistent funding puts added pressure on transit agencies to find ways to cut costs, even if that means sourcing rolling stock from companies with lingering quality issues, dubious Buy America compliance, security issues, and clear designs on leveraging state backing to grab market share from their competitors.Thank you for the opportunity to testify. We look forward to working with you to strengthen America's economy and national security through smart infrastructure and procurement policy. I look forward to your questions.[Category: Business]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6732539 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: May 17, 2019End of Document

Gridsum Reports Audited Full Year 2018 Financial ResultsPR NewswireApril 24, 2019 Wednesday 4:45 PM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3854 wordsDateline: BEIJING, April 24, 2019 BodyPR NewswireGridsum Holding Inc. ("Gridsum" or the "Company") (NASDAQ:GSUM), a leading provider of cloud-based big-data analytics and artificial intelligence ("AI") solutions in China, today reported its audited financial results for the year ended December 31, 2018.HighlightsNet revenues decreased by 8% to RMB431.2 million (US$62.7 million) from RMB469.5 million in 2017. Net loss attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders increased to RMB521.3 million (US$75.8 million) from RMB239.0 million in 2017.Full Year 2018 Financial ResultsREVENUES:Net revenues decreased by 8% to RMB431.2 million (US$62.7 million) from RMB469.5 million in 2017.Enterprise revenues increased by 3% to RMB387.6 million (US$56.4million) from RMB377.0 million in 2017, mainly due to growth in sales of Social Listening solutions recorded during the first half of 2018. However, Enterprise revenues experienced a decline in the second half of 2018, reflecting customer attrition and prolonged contract renewal processes as a result of the delayed filing of the Company's 2017 annual report on Form 20-F with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and a slowdown in the Chinese economy.E-Government and other revenues decreased by 48% to RMB53.1 million (US$7.7 million) from RMB102.2 million in 2017, reflecting the challenging business environment associated with China's government reorganization in 2018. This decrease was primarily attributable to the lengthening of the sales cycle, lower budgeted spending for E-Government solutions in 2018 and a decline in the Company's e-Government and other customer base from 58 to 43.COST OF REVENUES:Cost of revenues was RMB100.9 million (US$14.7 million), compared with RMB94.6 million in 2017. The rise was primarily due to a RMB5.8 million increase in outsourcing service fees, mainly related to the Company's search engine optimization and social media optimization businesses, as the Company re-assigned more internal resources to research and development activities.GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS MARGIN:Gross profit decreased by 12% to RMB330.4 million (US$48.1 million) from RMB374.9 million in 2017, while gross margin decreased to 76.6% from 79.8%.OPERATING EXPENSES:Total operating expenses were RMB882.1 million (US$128.3 million), compared with RMB594.1 million in 2017.Sales and marketing expenses were RMB166.2 million (US$24.2 million), compared with RMB192.4 million in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a RMB27.3 million decrease in industry reports and analysis purchase expenses and a RMB14.9 million decrease in advertising expenses, partially offset by a RMB14.9 million increase in personnel and related costs. Research and development expenses were RMB533.6 million (US$77.6 million), compared with RMB257.9 million in 2017. The increase was primarily the result of substantial foundation investments in the Company's Industrial AI capabilities, knowledge graph, data warehouse capacity, and IIoT platform and applications. The Company expects research and development expenses to decline year over year in absolute amount (and as a percentage of net revenues) in 2019 and, also decrease over the longer term as a percentage of net revenues. General and administrative expenses were RMB182.3 million (US$26.5 million), compared with RMB143.7 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to a RMB22.3 million increase in professional fees incurred for accounting and legal matters which were significantly inflated by issues related to the delayed filing of the Company's 2017 annual report on Form 20-F with the SEC and associated with the Company's internal investigation and changes of auditor, and a RMB16.9 million increase in office leasing expenses, partially offset by a RMB10.4 million decrease in allowance for doubtful accounts.LOSS FROM OPERATIONS:Loss from operations was RMB551.7 million (US$80.2 million), compared with RMB219.2 million in 2017.NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GRIDSUM'S ORDINARY SHAREHOLDERS:Net loss attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders was RMB521.3 million (US$75.8 million), compared with RMB239.0 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to the declines in net revenues and an increase in operating expenses, especially research and development expenses, as the Company aims to capture the opportunities in its Intelligent CRM, judicial, and IIoT business segments.NON-GAAP NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GRIDSUM'S ORDINARY SHAREHOLDERS:Non-GAAP net loss attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders, which is defined as net loss attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders before share-based compensation expense, was RMB482.3 million (US$70.1 million), compared with RMB216.1 million in 2017.EBITDA:Loss before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization was RMB493.1 million (US$71.7 million), compared with RMB197.9 million in 2017. The increase was mainly due to an increase in loss from operations of RMB332.5 million.ADJUSTED EBITDA:Adjusted loss before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization, which excludes share-based compensation expenses, was RMB454.1 million (US$66.0 million), compared with RMB175.0 million in 2017.NET LOSS PER ADS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GRIDSUM'S ORDINARY SHAREHOLDERS:Net loss per ADS attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders was RMB16.91 (US$2.46), compared with RMB7.90 in 2017.NON-GAAP NET LOSS PER ADS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GRIDSUM'S ORDINARY SHAREHOLDERS:Non-GAAP net loss per ADS attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders was RMB15.65 (US$2.28), compared with RMB7.14 in 2017.Each ADS represents one Class B ordinary share. For purposes of determining net loss per ADS attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders, the weighted average number of ordinary shares for the full year 2018 was 30,827,600. As of December 31, 2018, the total number of ordinary shares outstanding was 30,833,390.Balance SheetAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of RMB92.7 million (US$13.5 million), and restricted cash of RMB1.3 million (US$0.2 million).2018 Review2018 was a very challenging year for the Company. The delayed filing of its 2017 annual report on Form 20-F was accompanied by a number of events and issues that negatively impacted the Company's performance. Revenue and growth momentum were further impacted by the slowdown in the Chinese economy.As part of the Company's strategic evolution to achieve a more optimal revenue mix, revenues from Search Engine Marketing (SEM) solutions reflected a smaller percentage of total revenues compared with 2017. Additionally, the Company restructured its sales and service functions during 2018 to encourage more effective cross-sell and upsell of additional products and solutions to its client base. This restructuring is beginning to bear fruit, as evidenced by early indications of additional cross-sell and upsell of products and solutions to our clients, and is expected to be important in helping drive our financial performance in the coming months and years.The Company believes that many of the setbacks experienced during 2018 are now largely behind it, and that continued investments in research and development will be key to creating new opportunities over the medium and longer term.OutlookThe Company expects to continue to stabilize its core businesses and regain growth momentum in 2019, with higher Enterprise revenues and substantial revenue growth in the judicial and IIoT verticals. On the back of front-end investment in its IIoT and related platform and solutions in 2018, the Company is showing early signs of potentially emerging as a leader in certain verticals in this nascent but high-opportunity industry segment in China.Based on its current estimates and business trajectory, the Company expects a return to double-digit growth in net revenues in 2019.Exchange RateThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. Dollars ("US$") at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise stated, all translations from RMB to US$ were made at the rate of RMB6.8755 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate in effect on December 31, 2018 in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board. The Company makes no representation that the RMB or US$ amounts referred could be converted into US$ or RMB, as the case may be, at any particular rate or at all.Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn evaluating the Company's business, the Company considers and uses the following non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental measures to review and assess the Company's operating performance: non-GAAP net loss attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders, non-GAAP net loss per share attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders, non-GAAP net loss per ADS attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP net loss attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders is net loss attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders before share-based compensation, non-GAAP net loss per share attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders is the per share equivalent and non-GAAP net loss per ADS attributable to Gridsum's ordinary shareholders is the per ADS equivalent, EBITDA is net loss before interest income and expenses, income tax expenses and depreciation expenses, and adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA before share-based compensation.The Company presents these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by the Company's management to evaluate the Company's operating performance and formulate the Company's business plans. These non-GAAP financial measures enable the Company's management to assess the Company's operating results without considering the impact of non-cash charges, including depreciation expenses and share-based compensation, and without considering the impact of non-operating items such as interest income and expenses and income tax expenses. The Company also believes that the use of these non-GAAP measures facilitates investors' assessment of the Company's operating performance.These non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the Company's operations. Interest income and expenses, income tax expenses, depreciation expenses and share-based compensation have been and may continue to be incurred in the Company's business and are not reflected in the presentation of adjusted EBITDA. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, including Gridsum's peer companies, so their utility for comparison purposes may be limited.The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the Company's non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. Investors are encouraged to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their closest U.S. GAAP financial measures appears at the end of this release.About GridsumGridsum Holding Inc.

The tariff war of Trump and China 'turn off' the love in GrindrCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 20, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1013 wordsBody HONG KONG (CNN) - The United States does not trust a Chinese company to own the gay dating app Grindr and force it to sell by 2020, as tensions rise between Washington and Beijing over trade and national security.  Kunlun Tech in Beijing acquired a 60% stake in Grindr in 2016 - which describes itself as "the world's largest social networking application for gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people" - and the application was expected to be made public after completing the acquisition last year.  However, these plans were frustrated by the Foreign Investment Committee in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews foreign purchases of US companies "to determine the effect of such transactions on the national security of the United States." .  Recently, Kunlun said it had reached an agreement with CFIUS to sell the application before June 30, 2020. Until then, the firm says that Grindr will not transmit any confidential information to China, although it is not clear how it will be fulfilled.  All dating applications contain potentially confidential data - from messages and revealing selfies to simply the fact that users try to make an appointment - but Grindr has even more data than most. H  Security concerns have previously led the application to implement privacy protections for users in countries where being gay can put them at risk.  Personal data exposed  In the past, the United States blamed Chinese hackers for an attack on the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - which is essentially the Human Resources department of the US government - that exposed personal data from millions of current and former federal employees. Experts said the hack could have been an attempt to build a giant database of US government workers for future espionage activities.  Although the CFIUS has not revealed the logic behind Grindr's decision, there could be similar concerns at stake. Under China's cybersecurity law, companies doing business in the country must base their data there, raising concerns that the government may have access to them. Chinese companies also have a history of sharing data with their government and are often legally required to do so in cases where US officials have difficulty in forcing companies to turn over confidential information.  "Because government officials - including US military and intelligence officials - could be Grindr users, the US government is right to worry about the possibility that a foreign government has access to the most intimate aspects of its operations. lives, "Privacy International, a human rights group based in the United Kingdom, said in a statement. "However, it is equally worrisome that Grindr users of any country and background are at the mercy of a government, be it the Chinese government or the United States government."  Growing trend  Grindr is just the latest victim of growing US suspicions about China's activity in its territory, particularly in regard to technology.  Since last year, Washington has been involved in a major legal and public relations battle with the Chinese telecommunications giant, Huawei, which seeks to block it in both the US and global markets for alleged national security concerns, particularly by the expansion of networks5G  In April, six retired US military leaders urged other countries to follow Washington's leadership and said they had "serious concerns about a future in which a 5G network developed by China will be widely adopted among our allies and partners."  Grindr is not the first application to face problems of ownership over national security. Last year, Washington blocked a $ 1.2 billion acquisition of Moneygram from Ant Financial, an online payment company owned by Bill Ma, the multi-billionaire owner of Alibaba.  In a statement, Moneygram CEO Alex Holmes said the "geopolitical environment (had) changed considerably since we announced the proposed transaction with Ant Financial."  The agreement was blocked by CFIUS after Republican lawmakers Robert Pittenger and Chris Smith wrote that "if this transaction were approved, the Chinese government would obtain meaningful access and specific information about the financial markets and money flows of specific international consumers. we can not afford to ignore the well-coordinated Chinese investments that point to our critical and financial infrastructure. "  Democratic Senator Ron Wyden raised similar concerns regarding Grindr, according to a statement he gave the New York Times.  "Last year, my office met with a senior Treasury Department official to express my serious concern about the national security risks associated with a Chinese company that Grindr would buy," said Wyden. "It's time for the government and the CFIUS to consider the impact on national security of foreign companies that acquire large amounts of private data from Americans."  Many in the privacy community expect the case to generate a broader estimate regarding the amount of personal data that companies have of users, whether or not they are settled in the United States or owned by US investors.  Concerns have been accentuated in recent years due to problems with Facebook, which is still dealing with the consequences of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which it was revealed that the British political consultant had collected personal data from millions of users without their consent.  There were echoes of that scandal this month, when Facebook sued a South Korean firm for allegedly misusing data to "create and sell analysis and advertising and marketing models."  Physical fitness applications, smart TVs and playgrounds have faced security and privacy scandals in recent years as users and regulators begin to push against companies seeking to collect tons of personal data to sell Advertisers and other signatures.  In the European Union, this has led to new privacy legislation and there have been calls for US lawmakers to follow suit. Others, including Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes this week, have said that big technology companies must be divided to protect users. Load-Date: May 20, 2019End of Document

Asia Society: New Report Offers Recommendations to Improve China's Belt and Road InitiativeTargeted News ServiceJune 11, 2019 Tuesday 8:24 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 889 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyThe Asia Society issued the following news release:A new research report published today by the Asia Society Policy Institute (ASPI) examines on-the-ground problems in the implementation of China's grand Belt and Road Initiative projects and recommends practical steps that China could take to prevent these issues and help improve outcomes.This unique report, titled "Navigating the Belt and Road Initiative," is based on extensive research aided by a diverse Task Force of eminent experts to analyze a range of BRI infrastructure initiatives in four Southeast Asian countries. The ASPI-led team conducted in-depth case studies of major BRI rail, port, and energy infrastructure projects in Cambodia, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Laos."The scale and scope of BRI is so large that even modest improvements in its procedures and standards would significantly benefit host countries -- just as poor standards do tremendous damage," said Daniel Russel, Vice President of ASPI, who led the research. "Unlike most discussions about BRI that primarily focus on criticism and wishful thinking, this report pinpoints real concrete actions that should be adopted to make BRI projects more viable and sustainable."The Task Force used industry and international standards as a comparative benchmark, in addition to relevant Chinese domestic laws, regulations, and procedures. They also held in-country meetings with relevant official and non-governmental stakeholders. In April, they presented the findings and recommendations directly to a range of Chinese policy-makers, officials, scholars, and business leaders before the Second Belt and Road Forum in Beijing.The report identifies five main themes in its findings and recommendations:Open BRIChinese agencies should create a searchable, English-language online database of BRI projects that would enable local stakeholders, international companies, and prospective lenders to access information. Using an e-procurement system (as China does domestically) would help ensure contracts are awarded on the basis of best value and quality. Using international standardized engineering contracts, would align Chinese developers with international norms and reduce project risks.Clean BRIBribery is used by some project developers to their own advantage, but corruption is a leading factor in project delays, failure, inflated costs, and host problems. The Chinese government should require BRI projects to follow international anti-bribery conventions and industry best practices, and require bidders to obtain reputable anti-corruption certifications in order to qualify for BRI projects - as they already doing in their own country.Green BRIThe Chinese government could avoid environmental "time bombs" that result in protests and project failure by requiring and validating reliable Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) for all BRI projects before construction begins. Although Chinese regulations stipulate EIAs must be conducted for both domestic and overseas projects, research shows they have been falsified or bypassed in some BRI projects, especially where local enforcement of environmental standards is lax.Affordable BRIBRI projects are often larger and more expensive than the host country can afford, leading to unsustainable debt or work-arounds that foster corruption and create social problems. New governments in Malaysia and Myanmar found that planned BRI mega-projects were inflated and unaffordable. To produce realistic and sustainable projects, Chinese banks should require rigorous and transparent project preparation to assess genuine needs and financial viability should be mandatory. This is a prerequisite for attracting the private sector investment that Chinese leaders are calling for. Since commercial banks and investors apply careful standards for evaluating risk and returns, their inclusion would help ensure BRI projects are scaled to affordability and commercial viability.Collaborative BRIThe Chinese approach to BRI favors national government-to-government deals, but the lack of stakeholder engagement by developers, along with the heavy use of Chinese labor, has exacerbated tensions with local populations that has derailed projects. To build local buy-in, Chinese authorities should require that each BRI project have a thorough, publicly available plan to mitigate negative social impacts during the project's lifecycle, including for local training, procurement, and employment. Chinese Embassies, which have local language skills and experience, could do much more to advise Chinese developers and facilitate coordination with host country stakeholders.Read the full report here (https://asiasociety.org/sites/default/files/2019-06/Navigating%20the%20Belt%20and%20Road%20Initiative_0.pdf).About the Asia Society Policy InstituteWith a solution-oriented mandate, the Asia Society Policy Institute tackles major policy challenges confronting the Asia-Pacific in security, prosperity, sustainability, and the development of common norms and values for the region. The Asia Society Policy Institute is a think-and-do tank designed to bring forth policy ideas that incorporate the best thinking from top experts in Asia and to work with policymakers to integrate these ideas and put them into practice.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6756220 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: June 12, 2019End of Document

'The Shadow War': How a Chinese spy stole some of the Pentagon's most sensitive secretsCNN WireMay 14, 2019 Tuesday 11:01 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1347 wordsByline: By Jim Sciutto, CNN Anchor and Chief National Security CorrespondentDateline: NEW YORK (CNN) BodyNEW YORK (CNN) --  Adapted from "The Shadow War: Inside Russia and China's Secret Operations to Defeat America" by Jim Sciutto. Copyright © 2019. Available from Harper Collins.To his American friends and contacts, Stephen Su was an affable businessman and gregarious guy."People liked him," Bob Anderson, the FBI's former head of counterintelligence, told me. "They didn't think he was an asshole and I know that sounds stupid, but people are people and that's how it started."Stephen Su, who also went by his Chinese name Su Bin, lived in his native China but traveled frequently to the United States and Canada, to build a business in the aviation and aerospace sectors. His company, Lode-Tech, was a small player in a field of giants. However, from 2009 to 2014, Su steadily and deliberately built a network of close business contacts inside far bigger US and Canadian defense contractors who held some of most sensitive US military contracts. "So, he cultivates you over time," Anderson recalled. The information Su was most interested in related to three of the most advanced US military aircraft ever built, the Lockheed Martin F-35 and F-22 stealth fighters and the Boeing C-17 Globemaster transport aircraft. Though they were the products of two of the Pentagon's biggest military contractors, each drew on thousands of components sourced from dozens of smaller suppliers. That supply chain provided numerous ins for Su---as well as a convenient explanation for any partners who grew concerned about the kind of information he was looking for."Su would say, 'I'm not asking you to give me the F-35, but what's it matter if I get one system out of it that we could sell to a friend or a perspective client?'" said Anderson. "And then go from there, and it takes time."Unfettered access for three yearsAs it turns out, Su and his partners would have unfettered access inside Boeing's network for three years before the intrusion was first discovered. During that time, they would claim to have stolen some 630,000 digital files -- totaling a gargantuan 65 gigabytes of data -- on the C-17 alone. They stole tens of thousands more files on the F-22 and F-35. It was an extraordinary trove of information on some of America's most advanced and sensitive military projects. Su's team, while enormously successful, was just one small part of a massive army of Chinese hackers dedicated to stealing America's most sensitive government and private sector secrets. Over the last two decades, China has built an enormous infrastructure charged with cyber espionage. The Office of the US Trade Representative estimates that the United States loses up to $600 billion per year in intellectual property. Since it deems China "the world's principal IP infringer," the USTR believes China may be responsible for bulk of those losses. China's theft of US trade and government secrets is not bad behavior by rogue Chinese individuals or organizations, it is government policy -- and it is one of the issues at the root of the trade war raging between the US and China today. One senior US law enforcement official described China's espionage apparatus to me as akin to a "tapeworm," feeding off tens of thousands of US institutions and individuals, to siphon away America's most treasured asset: its ingenuity. Beijing's goal is nothing short of surpassing the United States as the world's most powerful and most technologically advanced superpower. Chinese leaders would prefer to do so peacefully, but if there is a war, they want to level the battlefield.'This is about world domination'"This is about world domination and when or if there has to be a conflict---and unfortunately there probably will be one---they want to be mano-a-mano, if not better than the US, and that's what they've set their sights on for the last thirty or forty years," Anderson explained.The exact number of spies like Stephen Su is hard to pinpoint but Anderson estimates that, at any one time, there are dozens of teams like his operating in the United States. And behind them in China, Anderson says, are far more hackers at work, some employed full-time by Chinese security services, others working on a part-time basis. "You'd go to jail here, but the Chinese have tens of thousands of young kids---like our MIT's or Stanford's best---hacking against the US," says Anderson. "They pay them to do that. That is quite routine for them."And they're very calculated in what they do, they have requirements just like the United States intelligence community has requirements," said Anderson.They are also extremely ambitious in their goals. In a 2011 email, Su's team claimed with a flourish that the information they were stealing would "allow us to rapidly catch up with US levels ... To stand easily on the giant's shoulders."The Chinese government refused to respond to repeated requests for comment on the allegations contained in the book.Su's run as one of the most damaging Chinese spies of his generation would end in the summer of 2014, when he was arrested in Canada on a US-issued warrant five years after he sent his first instructions to his co-conspirators in China detailing targets for hacking inside the United States. A Justice Department statement announcing his indictment said he had "worked with two unindicted co-conspirators based in China to infiltrate computer systems and obtain confidential information about military programs, including the C-17 transport aircraft, the F-22 fighter jet, and the F-35 fighter jet." Two years later, in February 2016, Su consented to be sent to the United States, where he pleaded guilty in California.Su's indictment in 2014 was a victory for the FBI and an example of good cyber police work. Despite Su and his team's prodigious efforts to cover their electronic tracks, FBI analysts successfully followed their electronic trail across the globe, through multiple countries and multiple "hop points," and traced it all back to one friendly and gregarious Chinese businessman. However, for every one hacker the US identifies and indicts, many more get away or are never spotted at all."There's hundreds if not thousands of these people in my opinion that are here or in our friendly partner countries because now it's a global business environment," he added.Overwhelmed and overmatched More alarmingly, Anderson warns that the FBI's cyber division is aware of, perhaps, 10 percent or less of all cyber intrusions like the one carried out by Su and his partners. They are simply overwhelmed and often overmatched.For the US military, the extent of the damage from the hacking by Su and his partners is not entirely clear. China has since deployed similar aircraft with similar capabilities. However, US military officials have told me, often with some derision, that China's J-31 fighter and Y-20 transport are, at best, cheap facsimiles.Bob Anderson is less sanguine. He is not a military commander. He has spent his entire professional life in law enforcement. However, he has seen the intelligence. And when I asked him how much sensitive data Su and his team had stolen relating to some of America's most advanced military aircraft, his answers were disturbing.For the C-17 he said, simply, "A lot, a lot." For the F-35, he went a little further: "A lot, enough to where I think it's a huge problem."China, in the span of five years and with just three operatives, had at least narrowed the gap with the United States on three of its most advanced military aircraft---aircraft that had taken more than a decade for the United States to develop and tens of billions of dollars to design and manufacture. Anderson and other intelligence and law enforcement officials I've interviewed speak of China with a spy's grudging respect for their adversary."We are looked at as the most significant adversary they've got and they're gonna lie, cheat, and steal ... to figure out how they're gonna get ahead of us," Anderson told me. "I don't think people look at it that way."TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.Load-Date: May 15, 2019End of Document

Chairman Grassley Issues Statement at Hearing on Foreign Threats to Taxpayer-Funded ResearchTargeted News ServiceJune 5, 2019 Wednesday 8:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1587 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Finance Committee issued the following statement by Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, at a hearing entitled "Foreign Threats to Taxpayer-Funded Research: Oversight Opportunities and Policy Solutions":"I'd like to welcome everyone to the Finance Committee's hearing on foreign threats to taxpayer-funded research."Taxpayer-funded research has been integral in keeping American medical, defense, information technology, and many other products at the forefront of the world's market."Simply said, the United States is the best of the best when it comes to conducting cutting edge medical research."Our scientists push the envelope to make crucial discoveries and better products, whether it be vaccines, or other medical treatments and intellectual property."These projects can produce important breakthroughs for patients and industry - for the United States and the world."We didn't develop this reputation overnight."We earned it, through the persistent hard work and dedication of researchers across the country."I'd like to call that a good old fashioned American work ethic."I thank them for their service to our country and want them to know that this Committee's oversight isn't designed to interfere with the pursuit of knowledge and the free exchange of information in the research field."Rather, this Committee's oversight is intended to strengthen the integrity of taxpayer-funded research and to preserve our valuable work product."Truly free collaboration and exchange of information is only possible when data and sources are credible, and the research process can be trusted."That trust is destroyed when foreign governments and other entities interfere in our research for their gain and to our detriment."Accordingly, Congress, the Executive Branch, and research institutions, must work together to properly balance the robust development and exchange of ideas in the research field with reasonable and proportionate common-sense efforts to protect the integrity of the research."That's why I've engaged in oversight efforts in this field."Beginning in October of last year, I wrote to the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Health and Human Services Inspector General about threats to taxpayer-funded research. Since then, I've also written to the National Science Foundation and the Department of Defense."Today, we will focus on foreign threats to research funded by the National Institutes of Health, its granting process, and downstream grantees."Those threats include spying, theft of intellectual property, disclosure of confidential information, and other related efforts that undermine the integrity of research."The NIH spends $39 billion of taxpayer money each year on medical research."The American people worked hard for that money."And the people deserve to know how the government is working to protect that research and the resulting intellectual property from foreign threats."We know that China is by far the most prolific offender; however they aren't the only country acting against our interests."In October 2018, while Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I held a hearing on China's non-traditional espionage against the United States."During that hearing, I broached the issue of China's focus on our research institutions and taxpayer-funded research."Today, we can get into more detail regarding those threats."It's without dispute that China has focused its energy on leveraging our hard work for their benefit--and to our detriment."One example hits home for me."In 2011, Chinese nationals tried to steal genetically modified corn seeds from Iowa. They tried to ship them back to China."Those seeds were the product of years of research and development."The Chinese Government says they're "picking flowers in foreign lands to make honey in China.""I believe them."Whether we're talking about Confucius Institutes spreading propaganda on college campuses, China's "Talent Programs" that have been called "brain gain" programs, or China planting spies in our industry, the government of China is a serious problem."In 2013, Chinese nationals were charged with conspiring to steal research funded by a multi-million dollar NIH grant for the benefit of a Chinese governmental entity and a direct competitor of the American university where the research was conducted."In an August 20, 2018, letter to NIH grantee institutions, NIH called attention to a series of threats posed by foreign entities to the integrity of U.S. biomedical research."In that letter, NIH warned that foreign actors have "mounted systematic programs to influence NIH researchers and peer reviewers," may have worked to divert intellectual property produced by NIH-supported research to other countries, and may have contributed resources to NIH-funded researchers in ways which could impact the integrity of the research."In January of this year, the HHS Inspector General notified me that NIH recently made 12 referrals in this area to the Inspector General."Those referrals primarily involved Principal Investigators--essentially the primary researchers--on NIH grants conducting medical research at U.S. universities."Those researchers allegedly failed to meet NIH requirements to disclose foreign affiliations on their grant applications."That's a serious problem."Researchers who are secretly supported by a foreign government while working on U.S. research projects can be more susceptible to the influence and control of the foreign parent.

GRASSLEY STATEMENT ON FOREIGN THREATS TO TAXPAYER-FUNDED RESEARCHStates News ServiceJune 5, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1565 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance, Majority Office:Prepared Opening Statement by U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley of IowaChairman, Senate Finance CommitteeHearing on Foreign Threats to Taxpayer-Funded Research:Oversight Opportunities and Policy SolutionsVIDEOI'd like to welcome everyone to the Finance Committee's hearing on foreign threats to taxpayer-funded research.Taxpayer-funded research has been integral in keeping American medical, defense, information technology, and many other products at the forefront of the world's market.Simply said, the United States is the best of the best when it comes to conducting cutting edge medical research.Our scientists push the envelope to make crucial discoveries and better products, whether it be vaccines, or other medical treatments and intellectual property.These projects can produce important breakthroughs for patients and industry for the United States and the world.We didn't develop this reputation overnight.We earned it, through the persistent hard work and dedication of researchers across the country.I'd like to call that a good old fashioned American work ethic.I thank them for their service to our country and want them to know that this Committee's oversight isn't designed to interfere with the pursuit of knowledge and the free exchange of information in the research field.Rather, this Committee's oversight is intended to strengthen the integrity of taxpayer-funded research and to preserve our valuable work product.Truly free collaboration and exchange of information is only possible when data and sources are credible, and the research process can be trusted.That trust is destroyed when foreign governments and other entities interfere in our research for their gain and to our detriment.Accordingly, Congress, the Executive Branch, and research institutions, must work together to properly balance the robust development and exchange of ideas in the research field with reasonable and proportionate common-sense efforts to protect the integrity of the research.That's why I've engaged in oversight efforts in this field.Beginning in October of last year, I wrote to the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Health and Human Services Inspector General about threats to taxpayer-funded research. Since then, I've also written to the National Science Foundation and the Department of Defense.Today, we will focus on foreign threats to research funded by the National Institutes of Health, its granting process and downstream grantees.Those threats include spying, theft of intellectual property, disclosure of confidential information and other related efforts that undermine the integrity of research.The NIH spends $39 billion of taxpayer money each year on medical research.The American people worked hard for that money.And the people deserve to know how the government is working to protect that research and the resulting intellectual property from foreign threats.We know that China is by far the most prolific offender; however they aren't the only country acting against our interests.In October 2018, while Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I held a hearing on China's non-traditional espionage against the United States.During that hearing, I broached the issue of China's focus on our research institutions and taxpayer-funded research.Today, we can get into more detail regarding those threats.It's without dispute that China has focused its energy on leveraging our hard work for their benefit and to our detriment.One example hits home for me.In 2011, Chinese nationals tried to steal genetically modified corn seeds from Iowa. They tried to ship them back to China.Those seeds were the product of years of research and development.The Chinese Government says they're "picking flowers in foreign lands to make honey in China."I believe them.Whether we're talking about Confucius Institutes spreading propaganda on college campuses, China's "Talent Programs" that have been called "brain gain" programs, or China planting spies in our industry, the government of China is a serious problem.In 2013, Chinese nationals were charged with conspiring to steal research funded by a multi-million dollar NIH grant for the benefit of a Chinese governmental entity and a direct competitor of the American university where the research was conducted.In an August 20, 2018, letter to NIH grantee institutions, NIH called attention to a series of threats posed by foreign entities to the integrity of U.S. biomedical research.In that letter, NIH warned that foreign actors have "mounted systematic programs to influence NIH researchers and peer reviewers," may have worked to divert intellectual property produced by NIH-supported research to other countries, and may have contributed resources to NIH-funded researchers in ways which could impact the integrity of the research.In January of this year, the HHS Inspector General notified me that NIH recently made 12 referrals in this area to the Inspector General.Those referrals primarily involved Principal Investigators essentially the primary researchers on NIH grants conducting medical research at U.S. universities.Those researchers allegedly failed to meet NIH requirements to disclose foreign affiliations on their grant applications.That's a serious problem.Researchers who are secretly supported by a foreign government while working on U.S. research projects can be more susceptible to the influence and control of the foreign parent. We must know who is financially supporting researchers to better understand whether they might be more dedicated to securing the interests of an adversary than to rigorous scientific and medical advancement.Our witnesses can speak to those specific threats and the government's capabilities to detect and deter them.Today, we have witnesses from the National Institutes of Health, the Health and Human Services Office of National Security, the Health and Human Services Inspector General and the Department of Homeland Security.The FBI was invited by the Committee given that they are a critical aspect to counter-intelligence efforts in this field.The Committee invited them on April 30.

(AP) - A former General Electric engineer and his business partner in China were indicted Tuesday on charges they stole the company's trade secrets from a New York plant for the Chinese government in what federal prosecutors called "a textbook example" of industrial espionage.The Department of Justice announced that Xiaoqing Zheng, 56, of Niskayuna, New York, and Zhaoxi Zhang, 47, of Liaoning Province, China, were charged with economic espionage and conspiracy for stealing GE's turbine technologies for China.Zheng was working for Boston-based GE's power division in Schenectady when he was arrested at his home last summer. FBI agents raided his suburban home and removed computers, cash and other items. Zhang, the business partner, wasn't charged at the time.Prosecutors allege that Zheng stole computer files dealing with GE's gas and steam turbines and sent them to Zhang, who's in China.The thefts are "a textbook example of the Chinese government's strategy to rob American companies of their intellectual property and to replicate their products in Chinese factories," said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers.GE said at the time of Zheng's arrest that it was cooperating with the investigation.Zheng was arraigned in federal court in Albany on Tuesday and allowed to remain free on the $200,000 bond he posted after his arrest on Aug. 1, 2018. His lawyer, Kevin Luibrand, said he wasn't commenting on the charges.According to the 14-count indictment, Zheng specialized in sealing technology at GE and used his access to company files to grab proprietary information and email it to Zhang, who is Zheng's nephew. The two men received financial support from the Chinese government and coordinated with government officials to enter into research agreements with Chinese state-owned institutions to develop turbine technologies, prosecutors said."When such technology is stolen it can be devastating to U.S. businesses and can result in American workers losing jobs," said FBI Assistant Director John Brown. "China continues to support behavior that violates the rule of law."An email seeking comment on the indictment was sent to the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C.President Donald Trump has accused China of using predatory tactics to try to overtake U.S. technological dominance in various industries. Chinese officials have rejected the allegations while complaining that Washington's aim is to cripple a rising economic competitor.In October, the Justice Department charged an operative of China's Ministry of State Security with attempting to steal trade secrets from GE Aviation and other aerospace companies. At the time the charges were made in Cincinnati, Ohio, Demers said the case was a "significant economic espionage matter" and the latest proof China is trying to steal information from American companies.Load-Date: April 24, 2019End of Document

US accuses pair of stealing GE secrets and passing them to ChinaCNN WireApril 24, 2019 Wednesday 4:52 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 426 wordsByline: By Daniel Shane, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  The US government has alleged that a GE engineer and Chinese businessman stole tech secrets with the intention of passing them onto Beijing.The Justice Department in a release Tuesday night said it had charged former GE employee Zheng Xiaoqing and Chinese businessman Zhang Zhaoxi with economic espionage. The department said the pair had conspired to steal GE trade secrets related to turbine technologies for the benefit of the Chinese government. The indictment claims Zheng, while employed at the conglomerate's New York office, used his access to GE's computer system to download tech designs and other files between 2016 and 2018. Zheng --- a US citizen --- subsequently emailed the files to China-based businessman Zhang. The Justice Department alleges that GE's technology was used to benefit Chinese companies in which the pair had business interests. The indictments also alleged Zheng and Zhang stole the GE designs with the knowledge that the theft would benefit Chinese government-sponsored research institutes with which they have ties. The indictments further allege the two have received financial support from Chinese authorities via these research institutes.The US government is seeking lengthy prison sentences and financial penalties for Zheng and Zhang. Chinese efforts to get hold of American companies' tech secrets are a sensitive issue. It's one of the main reasons cited by the Trump administration for launching a trade war with China last year."The indictment alleges a textbook example of the Chinese government's strategy to rob American companies of their intellectual property and to replicate their products in Chinese factories, enabling Chinese companies to replace the American company first in the Chinese market, and later worldwide," said assistant attorney general for national security, John Demers, in a statement."We will not stand idly by while the world's second-largest economy engages in state-sponsored theft," Demers added. Zheng and Zhang could not immediately be reached for comment. A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A statement from GE said: "We have been in close cooperation with the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office for some time on this matter."At GE, we aggressively protect and defend our Intellectual Property and have strict processes in place for identifying these issues and partnering with law enforcement."TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Chinese spies stole NSA hacking tools, report findsCNN WireMay 7, 2019 Tuesday 6:02 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 516 wordsByline: By Kevin Collier, CNNDateline: NEW YORK (CNN) BodyNEW YORK (CNN) --  Chinese hackers acquired and used National Security Agency hacking tools in 2016 and used them to carry out cyberattacks, a new report has found.In the report, the cybersecurity company Symantec claims that a Chinese hacker group associated with Chinese government intelligence conducted a hacking campaign using a tool that at the time was only known to be the property of the NSA.Though Symantec doesn't name particular agencies in its report, the Chinese group in question was an arm of China's Ministry of State Security in Guangzhou, which went dark after the US Department of Justice indicted three of its members in November 2017.While Chinese government hackers are prolific spies around the world, they apparently only used their NSA tool sparingly."When they were in action, they were pretty noisy, they hit a lot of targets," Eric Chien, a fellow at Symantec, told CNN."But the number of targets that we've been able to recover so far that used this exploit was very few. They saw it was high value and didn't want to use it everywhere," he said.The New York Times was first to report the story.The findings muddy the timeline of an already strange episode in the NSA's recent history. In 2016, a group calling itself Shadow Brokers appeared online in 2016 and began leaking the agency's tools.In April 2017 --- after the last known incident in which the Chinese hackers used the NSA tool, but before the US indictment prompted that operation to go dark --- Shadow Brokers released their most damaging set of NSA tools.

Chinese spies stole NSA hacking tools, report findsCNN.comMay 7, 2019 Tuesday 6:28 PM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 489 wordsByline: By Kevin Collier, CNNDateline: New York BodyChinese hackers acquired and used National Security Agency hacking tools in 2016 and used them to carry out cyberattacks, a new report has found.In the report, the cybersecurity company Symantec claims that a Chinese hacker group associated with Chinese government intelligence conducted a hacking campaign using a tool that at the time was only known to be the property of the NSA.Though Symantec doesn't name particular agencies in its report, the Chinese group in question was an arm of China's Ministry of State Security in Guangzhou, which went dark after the US Department of Justice indicted three of its members in November 2017.While Chinese government hackers are prolific spies around the world, they apparently only used their NSA tool sparingly."When they were in action, they were pretty noisy, they hit a lot of targets," Eric Chien, a fellow at Symantec, told CNN."But the number of targets that we've been able to recover so far that used this exploit was very few. They saw it was high value and didn't want to use it everywhere," he said.The New York Times was first to report the story.The findings muddy the timeline of an already strange episode in the NSA's recent history. In 2016, a group calling itself Shadow Brokers appeared online in 2016 and began leaking the agency's tools.In April 2017 ? after the last known incident in which the Chinese hackers used the NSA tool, but before the US indictment prompted that operation to go dark ? Shadow Brokers released their most damaging set of NSA tools. That included one Windows exploit that both North Korea and Russian intelligence services used to create the two most damaging ransomware strains in history, prompting international condemnation.But those were different variants of the NSA tools than the ones Symantec found that China was using.It's unclear how the tool got into Chinese hands. The NSA didn't respond to request for comment."We're in a very murky place," John Hulquist, director of intelligence at FireEye, a company that extensively tracks Chinese hacking, told CNN."This report raises a lot of questions that are still unanswered."In response to the claims, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs echoed China's common refrain when it is accused of hacking US targets.

CHINA: TIANANMEN INJUSTICE FUELS REPRESSION 30 YEARS ON STILL NO JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS, BUT ACTIVISTS PERSISTStates News ServiceMay 30, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1597 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:The Chinese government should take responsibility for the massacre of an untold number of pro-democracy demonstrators in June 1989, Human Rights Watch said today. Authorities should cease all harassment of activists and families of victims for commemorating the occasion.Human Rights Activism in Post-Tiananmen ChinaA Tale of Brutal Repression and Extraordinary ResilienceOn the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Massacre, Human Rights Watch is publishing profiles of those who have advocated for greater freedom and justice, despite extraordinary oppression over the years."Thirty years after the Tiananmen Massacre, Chinese authorities have not acknowledged the atrocity or provided justice for the victims and their families," said Yaqiu Wang, China researcher at Human Rights Watch. "The whitewash of Tiananmen and heightened repression across China have fueled activists' determination to fight for human rights."In the run up to the anniversary, authorities have been on high alert across the country to preempt commemorations of the event:Since late May, authorities have forced activists across the country to leave their hometowns for guarded "vacations." In Beijing, on May 28, activist Hu Jia was taken to Qinhuangdao, a port city nearly 200 miles from his home in Beijing.Since late May, authorities have put under house arrest or restricted the movement and communication of several members of Tiananmen Mothers, a nongovernmental group of relatives of Tiananmen Massacre victims, including Zhang Xianling, 81, and Ding Zilin, 82, whose sons were killed in the crackdown.On May 17, Sichuan police detained Deng Chuanbin, an independent filmmaker, for tweeting a photo alluding to the massacre.On May 16, Anhui police detained dissident and Tiananmen protester Shen Liangqing, accusing him of "picking quarrels and provoking trouble."In April, a Sichuan court handed down a three-and-a-half-year prison sentence to activist Chen Bing. Chen, alongside Fu Hailu, Luo Fuyu, and Zhang Jinyong, were detained in May 2016, for producing and selling a liquor named "Eight Liquor Six Four" a homophone for "89.6.4," the numerical date of the massacre. The other three were given suspended sentences. However, upon release, police required the trio to wear electronic wrist monitors at all times.The Tiananmen Massacre remains one of the most censored topics on the Chinese internet. A 2019 University of Toronto and University of Hong Kong study found that at least 3,237 key words referencing the massacre are censored. In April, authorities issued a censorship directive requiring websites to remove a promotional video of the camera company Leica, which featured the famous "Tank Man" image. In the same month, a 1990 Cantopop song, "Human's Path," was scrubbed from Chinese online music stores, including Apple Music, even though the lyrics only reference Tiananmen indirectly.While Miao Deshun, the last person known to have been imprisoned for his involvement in the 1989 pro-democracy protests, was released in 2016, many other participants have been re-incarcerated for their continuing pro-democracy work. They include:Liu Xianbin: Liu was a student at Renmin University in Beijing when he participated in the Tiananmen Square protests. In March 2011, a Sichuan court sentenced him to 10 years in prison for "inciting subversion" for publishing articles critical of the government and organizing events discussing political issues. In 1991, Liu had been given a 30-month sentence on "counterrevolutionary" charges for protesting the crackdown. From 1999 to 2008, Liu was imprisoned for "inciting subversion" after he tried to organize the China Democracy Party.Chen Wei: Chen took part in the Tiananmen protests when he was a student at Beijing Institute of Technology, for which he was imprisoned until December 1990. In 2011, a Sichuan court sentenced him to nine years in prison on charges of "inciting subversion" for his articles critical of Chinese authorities. From 1992 to 1997, Chen had served five years in prison for trying to establish the China Freedom and Democracy Party.Chen Bing: Chen Bing, the twin brother of Chen Wei, was a student at Southwest Petroleum University in Sichuan province and organized protests there in solidarity with students in Beijing. In April 2019, he was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison for making a liquor to commemorate Tiananmen.Chen Xi: Chen was an administrative worker at Jinzhu University in Guiyang, Guizhou province in 1989. In support of the nationwide democracy movement, he established the Patriotic and Democratic Union in Guiyang, for which he was imprisoned for three years. In 2011, a Guizhou court sentenced him to 10 years in prison for "inciting subversion" for his peaceful criticism of the Chinese Communist Party. Previously, from 1995 to 2005, Chen served 10 years in prison for organizing the China Democracy Party.Huang Qi: During Tiananmen, Huang, then a businessman in Chengdu, participated in local protests and provided financial support to student demonstrators. Huang later founded the human rights website 64 Tianwang. He has been detained since November 2016 for "illegally leaking state secrets abroad." Huang had been imprisoned from 2000-2005 on subversion charges and from 2008-2011 for "illegally holding state secrets." Huang suffers from several health conditions for which he has not been given adequate treatment.Li Bifeng: Li was a poet in Chengdu in 1989. He organized protests in the city in support of students in Beijing. He was subsequently given a five-year prison term on "counterrevolutionary" charges. In 2013, a Sichuan court sentenced him to 10 years in prison on dubious "contract fraud" charges. From 1998 to 2005, Li had served seven years in prison on fraud charges. Human rights organizations believe he was actually prosecuted for informing international human rights groups about the violent dispersal by police of massive worker protests across Sichuan province.Zhou Yongjun: In 1989, Zhou, a student at the China University of Political Science and Law, was a leader of the Tiananmen protests. He was one of the three students photographed kneeling on the steps of the Great Hall of the People pleading to Party leaders to initiate political reforms. Zhou was subsequently imprisoned for two years. In August 2018, Guangxi police detained Zhou and charged him with "inciting subversion." Previously, he served three years in a Reeducation-Through-Labor camp from 1998 to 2001, and five years in a Sichuan prison from 2010 to 2015 on fraud charges.Chen Shuqing: In 1989, Chen, then a graduate student at Hangzhou University in Zhejiang province, took part in the protests in the city. Since September 2014, Chen has been serving a 10-and-a-half-year sentence after being convicted of "subversion." From 2006 to 2010, he had served four years for "inciting subversion." Both convictions concern online articles he published criticizing the Chinese Communist Party.The Tiananmen Massacre was precipitated by the peaceful gatherings of students, workers, and others in Beijing's Tiananmen Square and other Chinese cities in April 1989, calling for freedom of expression, accountability, and an end to corruption. The government responded to the intensifying protests in late May 1989 by declaring martial law.On June 3 and 4, the military opened fire and killed untold numbers of peaceful protesters and bystanders. In Beijing, some citizens attacked army convoys and burned vehicles in response to the military's violence. Following the killings, the government implemented a national crackdown and arrested thousands for "counter-revolution" and other criminal charges, including disrupting social order and arson.The government has never accepted responsibility for the massacre or held any officials legally accountable for the killings. It has been unwilling to conduct an investigation into the events or release data on those who were killed, injured, forcibly disappeared, or imprisoned. The nongovernmental organization Tiananmen Mothers, consisting mostly of family members of those killed, has established the details of 202 people who were killed during the suppression of the movement in Beijing and other cities.Human Rights Watch urges the government of President Xi Jinping to mark the 30th anniversary of June 4, 1989 by addressing the human rights violations pertaining to the event. Specifically, the government should:Respect the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly, and cease the harassment and arbitrary detention of individuals who challenge the official account of June 4;Meet with and apologize to members of the Tiananmen Mothers, publish the names of all who died, and appropriately compensate the families of the victims;Permit an independent public inquiry into June 4, and promptly release its findings and conclusions to the public;Allow the unimpeded return of Chinese citizens, exiled due to their connections to the events of 1989; andInvestigate all government and military officials who planned or ordered the unlawful use of lethal force against peaceful demonstrators, and appropriately prosecute them."The spirit of the Tiananmen movement continues to burn in the hearts of veterans of 1989 and younger generations of activists who fight for a more just China," Wang said. "President Xi Jinping should acknowledge, even in the face of extraordinary persecution, that demands for accountability and human rights remain strong."Load-Date: May 31, 2019End of Document

3 times political conflict reshaped American mathematicsThe Conversation - United StatesApril 2, 2019 Tuesday 10:41 AM ESTCopyright 2019 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights ReservedLength: 1072 wordsByline: Della Dumbaugh, Professor of Mathematics, University of RichmondHighlight: When is math not just math? Political conflicts have led to new study-abroad initiatives, the creation of a world-class university, the migration of mathematicians and serious educational reforms.BodyWars. Politics. Dynasties. Nationalism. Although mathematics isn't typically associated with these ideas, they have combined to yield a tremendous impact on its development in the U.S. Political conflicts have led to new study abroad initiatives, the creation or downfall of world-class universities, the migration of mathematicians and the stimulus for educational reforms.In February, my University of Richmond students and I launched americanmathematics.org, a new website on the history of American mathematics. It showcases the people who create, the institutions that support and the cultures that influence mathematics. This rich history shows that mathematics is much more than equations or multiplication facts. It's a living, breathing discipline shaped, in part, by the political forces around it. Boxer ScholarsIn the late 19th century, a growing anti-foreign sentiment in China led to the Boxer uprising, acquiring its name from the rebels, known as "Boxers," who practiced physical movements that they believed made them immune to bullets. A coalition army of soldiers from eight western countries suppressed the rebellion in August 1900. In 1901, China was forced to pay war reparations valued at about US$333 million to the eight foreign governments over the course of 39 years. The U.S. received about $24 million to $25 million. Many American government officials found this amount excessive, particularly since it exceeded the actual expenses for losses incurred. Edmund James, then president of the University of Illinois, helped persuade President Theodore Roosevelt to return some of these funds and create educational opportunities for Chinese students to study in the U.S. These Boxer Indemnity Scholarships brought more than 900 Chinese students to America from 1911 to 1929. Wang Renfu was the first Boxer Scholar to study mathematics in America. After earning his degree from Harvard in 1913, he returned to China and joined the Department of Mathematics at Beijing University. He later served on the Board of the Chinese Mathematical Society. To prepare students for study in the U.S., the Chinese government also used the Boxer Indemnity Funds to create a college preparatory school in 1911. This preparatory school, known as Tsinghua School, ultimately grew into Tsinghua University.The four faculty members of the initial Department of Mathematics at Tsinghua University included three Boxer Scholars, including Ko-Chuen Yang, whose number theory dissertation improved existing bounds for certain cases of what is known as Waring's Problem. Waring's Problem considers the possibility of writing every number as a sum of squares, cubes and higher powers. The school continues to enjoy a strong reputation today.That rebellion created the opportunity for Chinese students to study in the U.S. and return home to establish strong mathematics programs in China. Later, Chinese mathematicians would receive their training in China and make contributions to American mathematics. Jewish refugeesWorld War II and the events leading up to it influenced mathematics in an entirely different way. In April 1933, Hitler introduced the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, which excluded Jews and others from employment, including involvement in organizations and professorships. Many Jewish scholars or scholars with Jewish families began to seek refuge in the U.S.  Hermann           Weyl and his family, for example, had moved from Zürich to            Göttingen, Germany, for him to assume the chair of mathematics in 1930. By 1933, however, with his wife and children identified as Jewish, Weyl accepted one of the first faculty positions at the newly founded Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.Once there, Weyl worked with colleagues to help other mathematicians find a home in America. This influx of talented European mathematicians included Richard Courant,            Emil Artin and            Emmy Noether. Their arrival catapulted American mathematics to a new level of international acclaim. This advancement of American mathematics came at the expense of German mathematics. In 1934, the Nazi minister of culture asked the great Göttingen Professor of Mathematics David Hilbert whether the mathematics institute at Göttingen had suffered since the removal of the Jews. "Suffered?" Hilbert responded. "It hasn't suffered, Herr Minister. It just doesn't exist anymore." New MathThe launch of Sputnik, the Soviet Union's first satellite, in October 1957 led to another shift in American mathematics, this time at the K-12 level. During World War II, the U.S. government realized that many Americans were deficient in arithmetic, geometry and trigonometry. A            national shortage of mathematics teachers didn't help matters. Still, very little reform took place immediately after the war. Sputnik changed all of that. The U.S. now considered how to build a strong sense of scientific prowess and national security within the American populace. The School Mathematics Study Group, the National Science Foundation-funded group that included research mathematicians and schoolteachers, aimed to produce textbooks for every grade of K-12 that explained the "why" of mathematics along with the "how." Their approach became infamously known as            New Math.  The School Mathematics Study Group worked within an American culture that began to rethink its view of mathematics. Suddenly, mathematics was linked with national security. Politicians endorsed this new approach to math. Parents attended classes to learn how to help their children with the New Math. Teachers attended training sessions. In the end, however, the introduction of the program occurred so swiftly that educators could not keep up with the materials, when they simply did not understand. Meanwhile, the approach proved uneven for students. For example, students might understand the commutative law that allows multiplication of integers in any order, but not the multiplication table it relies on for the computation. Nationalism and political agendas were not enough to make the program successful. Taken together, these three historical events show how political conflict can help or harm the advancement of mathematics.Della Dumbaugh does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.Load-Date: April 2, 2019End of Document

Taiwan furious after China attempts to take credit for LGBT marriage winCNN WireMay 20, 2019 Monday 6:27 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 698 wordsByline: By Steven Jiang, CNNDateline: BEIJING (CNN) BodyBEIJING (CNN) --  Taiwan has lashed out at China's state media for attempting to take credit for the island's historic decision to legalize same-sex marriage.On Friday, Taiwan's legislators passed a bill making same-sex marriage a reality, the first place in Asia to give LGBT couples many of the same rights as their heterosexual peers.LGBT activists were overjoyed at the news, but some of the most unlikely praise came from the Chinese Communist Party's mouthpiece."Local lawmakers in Taiwan, China, have legalized same-sex marriage in a first for Asia," tweeted the People's Daily newspaper on Friday, along with a rainbow color-infused animated image that says "love is love" underneath."Wrong!" Joseph Wu, Taiwan's foreign minister, shot back on his department's official Twitter account Sunday. "The bill was passed by our national parliament and will be signed by the president soon. Democratic Taiwan is a country in itself and has nothing to do with authoritarian China.""(People's Daily) is a commie brainwasher and it sucks."Taiwan and China are separated by fewer than 130 kilometers (81 miles) at their closest point. For seven decades, the two have maintained an uneasy truce following their split at the end of a bloody civil war in 1949.Unification is a long-term aim for China's ruling Communist Party, which regards self-governed Taiwan -- an island of 23 million people -- as a renegade province.The historic vote in Taiwan came almost two years after the island's Constitutional Court ruled existing laws -- which defined marriage as between a man and a woman -- to be unconstitutional.Despite sharply divided public opinions, Taiwan's legislators passed the law only a week before a court-set deadline to enact marriage equality laws. It will go into effect on May 24.As thousands of people in Taipei took to the streets to celebrate the outcome, Beijing's propaganda authorities appeared to see an opportunity to stake a claim on China's sovereignty over Taiwan and to highlight China's supposed LGBT-friendliness.The news from Taiwan was among trending topics Friday on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. It has remained a widely discussed story, generating largely positive comments, despite the Chinese government's growing censorship on all LGBT-related subjects on social media.Global Times, a state-run tabloid known for its nationalistic rhetoric, posted a video Saturday showcasing gay social life in Beijing. The three-minute clip features interviews with local advocates as well as foreigners praising the Chinese capital's inclusive culture, complete with footage of drag queen performances.Homosexuality is not illegal in China and the authorities in 2001 removed it from the official list of mental disorders. But activists and experts agree that prejudices and discrimination persist, as well as periodic government crackdowns.Since he came to power in late 2012, Chinese President Xi Jinping has increasingly stressed the Communist Party's absolute control over all aspects of society, resulting in a push for more rigid moral codes and even less room for LGBT visibility and advocacy.In March, nearly all LGBT content was scrubbed from "Bohemian Rhapsody," the award-winning biopic of British rock band Queen, for the Chinese audience. Deleted scenes range from two men kissing to the word "gay."Last November, an author of same-sex erotic fiction was sent to jail for ten years. In 2016, Chinese censors banned the portrayal of "abnormal sexual behavior" in TV and online shows, including gay and lesbian relationships.Still, some Chinese activists want to focus on the positive impact of Taiwan's legalization of same-sex marriage may have on the mainland. "It offers us a lot of hope," Xiaogang Wei, a leading LGBT rights activist who heads the Beijing Gender Health Education Institute, told CNN on Friday."The Chinese government has pointed to cultural tradition as a reason for same-sex marriage being unsuitable in China. But the decision in Taiwan, which shares a cultural tradition with us, proves that Chinese culture can be open, diverse and progressive."TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The commercial conflict between China and the US is aggravated around HuaweiCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 24, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 558 wordsBody The trade war between the United States and China became technological and is now dialectic, with both countries accusing each other of lying about the Huawei case, the Chinese telephony giant.  If only two weeks ago the negotiators of the two countries were still trying to resolve their differences in the US capital, the tone has been raised by Huawei, which the US government accuses of acting as a Trojan horse of the Chinese government.  "To say that they do not work with the Chinese government is a false statement," US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview with CNBC. "The executive director of Huawei (Ren Zhengfei) does not tell the truth to the American people or the world," he added.  In response, China denounced on Friday, May 24, the "lies" of the United States about Huawei.  "For some time now, some political leaders in the United States have spread repeated rumors about Huawei, without ever showing evidence," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang, when questioned about Pompeo's words.  While in the United States the commercial and technological war against China of the Trump government raises more and more doubts, said Lu, "these political leaders continue to spread lies of all colors to deceive the Americans".  The Chinese spokesman also defended Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, a former military engineer, who insists that his group does not spy on Beijing.  According to Lu, the interview granted by Ren on Tuesday in which he defended his company was widely applauded both in China and in the rest of the world. "Only certain politicians question his word," the spokesman added.  Ren's own daughter, Huawei's financial director, is on probation in Canada, where she was arrested in December at the request of the United States, which accuses her of violating sanctions against Iran.  "Deep solidarity"  The second world smartphone brand will not be able to be supplied in the US market in three months, and it depends on US technology for the electronic chips used in its devices.  The survival of the Chinese group could be at stake, according to experts.  Relevant technology companies, such as Google, Qualcomm, Panasonic or Vodafone, announced that they will have to suspend some aspects of their collaboration with China.  But while the US administration was trying to separate the commercial war from the Huawei case so far, Donald Trump clearly mixed both things on Thursday.  "Huawei is a very dangerous thing," Trump told reporters about the company that operates in 170 countries. "But it is possible that Huawei is included in a commercial agreement, if we reach a commercial agreement, I imagine Huawei included in it in one way or another."  China did not fail to point out that the Trump administration had decided to grant another $ 16 billion in emergency aid to farmers affected by reprisals from China and the European Union, which Lu interpreted as a result of pressures from the sector to Washington.  "The sectoral organizations of agriculture and livestock clearly ask the government of the United States to correct their errors," said the spokesman.  "His Chinese colleagues are deeply sympathetic to the problems faced by farmers and ranchers in the United States," the Foreign Ministry spokesman added.  Copyright Grupo de Diarios America - GDA / La Nacion / Costa Rica Load-Date: May 24, 2019End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 26 of 381GRASSLEY OP-ED: FOREIGN THIEVES THREATEN AMERICA'S PROSPERITY  Page 28 of 381Sen.
