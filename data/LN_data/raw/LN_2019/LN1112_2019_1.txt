CHINA HAS A LAWLESS GOVERNMENTStates News ServiceNovember 13, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 485 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. BodyThe following information was released by the Acton Institute:by Samuel GreggThere's rarely a day when China isn't featured prominently in the news. Once upon a time, most of that coverage was about China's rise out of poverty. Now, however, greater attention is being given to some decidedly negative developments. These include the country's growing economic problems, its systematic violations of religious liberty, or the efforts to suppress protestors in Hong Kong.In one sense, the theme linking all these problems is that of authoritarianism, verging on totalitarianism. That in turn points to another, perhaps deeper challenge facing China which as recently highlighted by the law professor Adam J. Macleod in a Public Discourse essay entitled "Piracy, Protests, and the Problem of China." Putting it bluntly, Macleod argues that "The Chinese government is lawless."By that, Macleod doesn't mean that there are no laws in China. "The Chinese ruling party's lawlessness," he writes, "is not for a lack of posited laws." But, Macleod states, "Law does not come only from governments. Contra positivists and legal pragmatists, to adhere to one's own regulations and to obtain the sanction of courts of last resort does not make a nation's actions lawful."Macleod's point is that "the problem of China is a problem of tyranny: the ruling Communist Party views itself as above the law." China's government does not, for instance, consider itself bound by the treaties into which it freely enters, let alone what's called "the law of nations:" that is, "the universal law of civilized people by ancient custom and by necessity," "determinations of natural law," and "fundamental, fully-specified universal duties not to commit intrinsic wrongs."China's lawlessness is especially manifest in the way the Chinese government approaches economic life. According to Macleod,China's most egregious economic adventures are also violations of basic law. Chinese companies that are probably controlled by the Communist Party steal trade secrets worth billions of dollars, which can be used to control international communications and Internet connectivity for years to come. By one estimate, twenty percent of American companies have suffered intellectual property theft by hands in China. Intellectual property is property. Developed nations and nations that want to develop economically recognize the importance of protecting the fundamental rights of innovators. China's seizure of intellectual property should be understood as trespass and theft. The Chinese government takes what by right belongs to others, without whose creative and risk-laden labors the innovations and technologies that make economic growth possible would not exist.Read the whole article. For my money, Macleod's piece is one of those rare analysis that gets to the root of how and why the Chinese regime behaves the way that it does today.Load-Date: November 14, 2019End of Document

China reportedly bans foreign technology in its government and public officesCNN WireDecember 9, 2019 Monday 10:53 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 581 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  China is reportedly planning to ban all government offices and public institutions from using foreign software and computers in a move that could dent sales by US tech companies and increase tensions at a crucial moment in the trade war. Beijing had ordered that all hardware and software be removed within three years, according to a report by the Financial Times. It cited brokerage firm China Securities as estimating that as many 30 million pieces of hardware would need to be replaced as a result.China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the State Council Information Office did not respond to requests for comment. News of the order comes during a tense time for the larger US-China relationship. The two economic superpowers have been engaged in a trade war for nearly two years, locking horns over what observers say is a larger battle over who will control the technologies of the future. The next wave of US tariffs on Chinese goods is due to go into effect on Sunday unless officials can broker a preliminary trade deal this week. The United States has this year dealt heavy blows to Chinese tech champions such as Huawei, cutting off their access to vital American suppliers. Washington cites national security concerns, allegations which Huawei and the other Chinese companies deny. China has laid out broad ambitions to become a global tech champion in just a few years, a policy known as "Made in China 2025." The clash with the United States may have accelerated Beijing's timetable to wean the country off US technology, and become more self-reliant. "My feeling is that China's government entities are well on the way to being exclusively 'national' team anyway, and that most of the American stuff is in the private sector, unaffected by the ruling," said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at Oanda. Still, a blanket ban on doing business with the Chinese government could hurt companies such as HP, Dell and Microsoft. The China Securities analysis cited by the FT said that the order had come from the Communist Party's Central Office earlier this year, and that the hardware replacement would take place at a pace of 30% in 2020, 50% in 2021, and 20% in 2022, earning the policy a nickname --- "3-5-2."Substituting hardware would be difficult enough, but replacing Microsoft or Apple software at such a scale could be an even bigger challenge given China's software industry is relatively undeveloped. Huawei is finding out how hard life can be without access to Google services for smartphones. Some Chinese social media users said Chinese hardware maker Lenovo, already a major supplier to the government, could benefit from the reported initiative. But others were deeply skeptical. "Has the policymaker of this directive been kicked in the head by a donkey?" one user who went by the handle Xiao Bai Ba wrote on Weibo. "We are absolutely becoming North Korea," the user added, referring to the isolationist policies of that country. Still others complained about Chinese hardware and software falling short of their US alternatives. "My friend's workplace has already switched to a Chinese-made database. The supplier said their product is a little bit slower than Oracle's, about 20% slower. ... But it's so damned slow!" wrote a user who went by the handle Hengha Erjiang Zhou. --- Lily Lee and Laura He contributed to this report. TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

MENENDEZ, RISCH, GARDNER, COONS MARK ANNIVERSARY OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT'S UNLAWFUL DETENTION OF CANADIAN CITIZENS, CALL FOR THEIR IMMEDIATE RELEASEStates News ServiceDecember 10, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 559 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Minority Office:U.S. Senators Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and Jim Risch (R-Idaho ), Ranking Member and Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, along with Senator Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) , chairman of the Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy, and Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.) today recognized the anniversary of the Chinese government's detention of Canadian citizens Michal Kovrig and Michael Spavor in retaliation for Huawei Technologies Co, Ltd. Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou's arrest by Canadian authorities. Kovrig and Spavor were detained on December 10, 2018, just nine days after Meng's arrest in Canada on December 1, 2018.Earlier this year, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution, S.Res.96, led by Risch and Menendez and cosponsored by Gardner and Coons, commending Canada for upholding the rule of law and expressing deep concern over the Chinese government's retaliation against Canada for responding to the United States' request that Canada extradite Meng."China's continued incarceration of Michael Korvig and Michael Spavor tells us everything we need to know about the lack of respect for the rule of law in Xi Jinping's China," said Menendez . "While Ms. Meng luxuriates under 'house arrest' in her multi-million dollar mansion, Mr. Spavor and Mr. Korvig, who have done nothing wrong, are subject to inhumane conditions and even denied a single visit by their family. China's behavior in taking these two men hostage is not that of a culture of 5000 years of civilization, but cruel, capricious, and barbaric. The world must unite in condemning the practice of political hostage-taking. That is why I have authored the Robert Levinson Hostage Recovery and Hostage-taking Accountability Act, a bipartisan bill to provide more tools for the United States government to rescue hostages and punish their captors.""The Chinese government's ongoing arbitrary detention and mistreatment of Canadian nationals is unacceptable," said Risch . "It has been a full year since the unlawful detainment of Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor in China. Today we reaffirm our unwavering support for Canada's decision to uphold the rule of law with respect to Ms. Meng's arrest, and reiterate that the Chinese government should immediately release Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor.""The Chinese Communist Party has unlawfully detained Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor for a year now, robbing them of time with their families and fundamental human rights," said Gardner . "We stand shoulder-to-shoulder in support of Canada upholding the rule of law, and we call on the CCP to end this unjust and unlawful detainment.""I support Chairman Risch and Ranking Member Menendez's efforts to continue to draw attention to the unjust detention of two Canadian nationals in China," said Coons . "China's actions are politically motivated and deprive Canadian citizens of the due process they deserve. Canada, by contrast, continues to uphold the rule of law with respect to Ms. Meng's case, and I encourage Beijing to do the same."Additional cosponsors of S.Res.96 include Senators Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.).Load-Date: December 11, 2019End of Document

INDONESIAN MUSLIM GROUPS URGE CHINA TO STOP VIOLATING UYGHUR RIGHTSStates News ServiceDecember 16, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1352 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Indonesia's two largest Muslim organizations called on China on Monday to end human rights violations against the Uyghur minority, in a departure from their previous muted stance.The call by Muhammadiyah and Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) came almost two months after the U.S. ambassador to Indonesia met with leaders of the two powerful groups and urged them to speak out about the mass incarceration of Uyghur Muslims at internment camps in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region."The government of China should stop all violations of human rights, especially against the Uyghur community, under whatever pretext," Muhammadiyah, which claims some 30 million members, said in a statement.China is believed to have locked up an estimated 1.8 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in internment camps since April 2017 amid a government crackdown on Islamic extremism in Xinjiang.Beijing denies any allegations of mistreatment of Uyghurs and says the camps provide vocational training. It has refused to allow international observers into the camps."We urge the government of China to be more open in providing information and access to the international community about its policy on the Uyghur community in Xinjiang," Muhammadiyah said in the statement.The group's comments followed a U.S. newspaper report last week that Beijing had launched a "concerted campaign" to convince Indonesia's religious authorities and journalists that the internment camps in Xinjiang were a "well-meaning effort" to provide job training and combat extremism.Views in Indonesia about the camps had changed after more than a dozen top Indonesian religious leaders visited the so-called re-education facilities, according to the Wall Street Journal report. Donations and other financial support from Beijing had also helped blunt criticism of its treatment of Uyghurs, the report said.The article linked the silence of Muslim groups on the Uyghur issue to China's charm offensive, in which Beijing allegedly courted clerics, politicians and journalists to support its policies in Xinjiang by offering Chinese government-sponsored trips to the region.Muhammadiyah, however, questioned the accuracy of the news report without being specific.NU deputy chairman Robikin Emhas, who was among a group of Indonesian Muslim leaders who visited Xinjiang at the invitation of the Chinese government in February, said "there were problems" in Beijing's treatment of the Uyghurs."Religious people can only practice their religion privately. In public they cannot practice their religion," Robikin told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.He also said that Muslims consumed non-halal food and could not pray in camps where the Chinese government said they received vocational training to lure them away from extremism."We appeal for the provision of halal food to be guaranteed," he said. "We also [urge Beijing] that [the Uyghurs] be allowed to practice their religion."Muhammadiyah, in its statement, also urged Indonesia the world's most-populous Muslim-majority country to take a stronger stance on abuses against the Uyghurs."The government of Indonesia should be more active in its role as a member of the OIC (Organization of Islamic Conference) and a non-permanent member of the U.N. Security Council to muster diplomacy toward ending human rights violations in Xinjiang and several other countries," it said.On Friday, NU deputy secretary general Masduki Baidlawi also clarified that his group's stance on the Uyghurs was not linked to any financial incentives.A change in stanceThe criticism of Beijing by Muhammadiyah and NU marked a turnaround from their earlier stance on the Uyghur internment camps.After separate meetings in October with Joseph Donovan, the U.S. envoy, Muhammadiyah and NU leaders said they were still analyzing China's treatment of Uyghurs to verify whether rights abuses were taking place in Xinjiang."If there are human rights violations, we will make our voice heard, but if it's a political issue and they want to be independent, it's an internal affair [of China]," NU chairman Said Aqil Siradj said at the time."We are still collecting information. Our team and the government will analyze the information," he added.In July, the NU chairman said he had visited Xinjiang in 2016 but did not notice Muslims being persecuted."Islam is growing well in China. The government there is paying attention to Muslims by renovating mosques and hundreds of halal restaurants have been opened," CNN Indonesia quoted Said as saying.Four months earlier, Muhammadiyah secretary Agung Danarto had also denied the existence of internment camps in Xinjiang."Places, camps, dorms and classrooms were very comfortable and decent, and look nothing like prisons," Agung said in a statement posted on the organization's website in March.Foreign ministry criticizedThis week, Muhyiddin Junaidi, the head of international cooperation at the Indonesian Council of Ulema, a semi-official body of theologians, criticized the Foreign Ministry for its perceived silence on China's treatment of the Uyghurs."It seems that we are too mindful of China's feelings because they are one of the biggest foreign investors. Maybe the government is worried that investors will leave if we speak out," Muhyiddin told BenarNews.Muhyiddin, who led a delegation that visited Xinjiang in February, said his group was not allowed to talk freely to locals during the tour of what he described as a vocational training center."The Chinese government insists the Uyghurs are terrorists, radicals and separatists, but we should not make sweeping generalizations like that," he said."They have different definitions. If you wear a headscarf in public, you are radical. It's a violation of human rights but according to China it's not because it's in their constitution," he said.Muhyiddin said the group did not witness a detention camp during the visit."But looking at the activities and policies, I can see that there's a lot of persecution carried out by China against the Uyghur people," he said.No 'megaphone diplomacy,' foreign ministry spokesman saysTeuku Faizasyah, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Indonesia did not engage in "megaphone diplomacy" with China over the Uyghur issue but had made its stance known by summoning the Chinese ambassador in Jakarta for clarification earlier this year."We do things behind the scenes, engage in constructive discussions with friend countries, with nothing in mind but trying to find common views. If we talk too much publicly there will be a deficit of trust, so it's more harmful," he told BenarNews last week.A report in June by the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC) had said Indonesia was reluctant to speak out on the Uyghur issue because the nation rejected interfering in China's affairs."The Indonesian government by and large sees the Uyghur crackdown as a legitimate response to separatism, and it will no more interfere in China's 'domestic affairs' than it would accept Chinese suggestions for how it should deal with Papua," IPAC said, referring to a long-running conflict in far eastern Indonesia, for which Jakarta has been repeatedly accused of committing rights abuses.The fact that China is Indonesia's largest trading partner and second largest investor adds to its reluctance to speak out, IPAC said.Though Beijing initially denied the existence of internment camps, China has tried to change the discussion, describing the facilities as "boarding schools" that provide vocational training for Uyghurs, discourage radicalization and help protect the country from terrorism.Reporting by RFA's Uyghur Service and other media organizations, however, has shown that those in the camps are detained against their will. They are also subjected to political indoctrination, routinely face rough treatment at the hands of their overseers, and endure poor diets and unhygienic conditions in the often overcrowded facilities.Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Load-Date: December 17, 2019End of Document

We hope BSN would be the first thing that people would think whenever they want to develop their own blockchain technologies. Huobi China has been trying to steer away from crypto trading in the country and establish itself as a blockchain services provider since the 2017 crackdown on crypto exchanges.In the same year, the company kicked off its global expansion and transferred its trading businesses to Singapore, Japan and South Korea with local operations in each country, according to a timeline provided on its website.Headquartered in Hainan province, one of the southernmost parts of China, Huobi China firmed up its relationship with the Chinese government by establishing a Communist Party of China branch in its local blockchain subsidiary Beijing Lianhuo Information Services LLC.Tags: See Campaign:https://www.huobi.comContact Information:           https://www.huobi.comTags:,           Wire,           Cryptocurrency Newswire,           United States,           EnglishLoad-Date: January 2, 2020End of Document

The news agency said it confirmed the new directive with employees of a private cyber-security firm, who were also aware of the new policy after interacting with their respective government clients.The policy - which reportedly affects both hardware and software - could strike a big blow to American tech companies such as Microsoft, HP and Dell.China internally refers to the policy as "3-5-2" which is indicative of the pace at which replacements will be carried out.Cambridge North Dumfries has health team in new provincial modelPrevention and health promotion: keeping patients as healthy as possible in their communities and out of hospitals. By receiving the required care the idea is that a patient would not end up returning to the emergency department.Defining "domestically made" is also challenging.The Chinese government services have been ordered to replace 30 per cent of their devices in 2020, 50 per cent in 2021, and 20 per cent in 2022.According to the publication, the directive came directly from the Chinese Communist Party's Central Office earlier this year and will result in an estimated 20 to 30 million pieces of hardware that will need to be replaced over the course of three years. Most software developers make products compatible with US -made operating systems, for example Apple's macOS and Microsoft's Windows, Financial Times suggested.For now private Chinese companies, which form the bulk of Microsoft's Chinese revenue, are not affected, but this could easily change. ARM, whose chips are used by Lenovo and Intel among many other hardware brands was not immediately contactable.Still, Beijing's push has proven hard because its domestic industry hasn't yet shown itself capable of matching foreign technologies in certain sectors.Load-Date: December 10, 2019End of Document

Washington justified the significant move amid the ongoing trade war between the countries, by calling Chinese hardware a national security risk. Government offices already tend to use Lenovo's desktop computers, following the company's acquisition of United States giant IBM's personal computer division.However, analysts believe that this would be an uphill task since most products developed by software vendors in China are meant for popular US-designed operating systems like Windows and macOS.

The company saved another $25 billion in taxes between 2008 and 2018 due to state incentives to promote the technology sector.

Commentary: China's Corporate Credit System Raises Questions About Data UsageUSNEWS.comNovember 6, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: CIVIC; Best Countries; Vol.; No.Length: 914 wordsByline: Kislaya PrasadHighlight: International standards are needed to establish what personal data can be used by firms and governments.BodyChina has embarked on a data-gathering endeavor on the scale of the Great Wall. The plan is to collect extensive information on its population and domestic and foreign companies so as to give them a reputation score that measures trustworthiness in social and economic interactions. Companies will be obliged to assist by turning over a large volume of information to the government. People and businesses have responded with alarm at the imminent arrival of a dystopian future of mass surveillance and rewards and punishments designed to manipulate behavior. But is the credit system, planned to be unveiled sometime in 2020, truly something that we should be concerned about? In a way, this "score" is not so different from your credit score, though of course it's based on more than just financial history. It is worth noting that even in the United States, lenders have started reaching beyond financial history data as a basis for making lending decisions. Research published in 2017 by the Yale Journal of law and Technology referred to an "explosion of startups" that mine online and offline data. [MORE:Top 10 Countries for Technological Expertise, Ranked by Perception]There is already a trend toward the principle that "all data is credit data." For example, insurance companies might use social media posts indicative of risky behaviors to quote rates or deny coverage. This is a worrisome trend, in my view, but there is nothing uniquely Chinese about it. Another commonly expressed concern by U.S.-based companies is that the social-credit-score system, which will apply to all companies operating in China, will be used to force U.S. companies to respect the sensitivities of the Chinese government even when doing so conflicts with American values. But such things already happen: After the general manager of the Houston Rockets expressed support for the protesters in Hong Kong, the NBA faced severe repercussions, and was forced to appease the Chinese government and Chinese business partners. While those events may have happened without the arrival of the social credit rating system, the credit system underscores how international companies must align with Beijing's values; in less than a week the NBA lost most of its Chinese partners in the league's most important market outside of the U.S. The potential backlash international companies may face for not following China's requirements on sensitive topics was exposed in August, when China demanded that Cathay Pacific suspend employees involved in this year's protests in Hong Kong. Cathay's CEO was replaced, two pilots were fired and other workers resigned, citing a climate of fear within the airline. Still, countries with large markets have often used market access for leverage, and companies routinely make the trade-off between principle and profit (almost always in favor of the latter, even as they pay lip service to the former). It is worth noting that the U.S. government used similar leverage (access to U.S. markets) to prevent European companies from doing business with Iran, which was not under sanctions from their own governments. Of course, the difference is in the scale at which the Chinese engage in the practice of surveilling and regulating behavior. New big data and artificial intelligence technologies have magnified the feasible scale and efficiency with which these activities can be carried out. [MORE:China, Russia Spreading Surveillance Methods Around the World]Another worry is that the social credit score will eventually form the basis of a public blacklist. Again, this is not intrinsically bad. It may be useful to know if a firm you are planning to do business with has a history of defaulting on contractual commitments, or of violating environmental regulations. And this really has been the claim of Chinese authorities -- that the system creates greater transparency in the market and makes for a better business environment. Some skepticism may be warranted, but I see no reason to dismiss this claim entirely out of hand. The anxiety about the system stems from the fact that the authorities have not yet spelled out its details, allowing everyone to imagine the worst. In the worst-case scenario, new technologies such as facial recognition, AI, etc., are being martialed in aid of a mass surveillance effort where the government will selectively apply the rules in an arbitrary and capricious fashion to bend foreign companies to their will (just as they have done with domestic companies). However, as I mentioned earlier, they already have the ability to do this, and have done so effectively. So, what is the most worrisome aspect of the system? In my view, it is the fact that technologies for surveillance, harvesting data, machine learning, etc. are changing the way that firms will be (and are being) regulated. At the same time, however, these technologies are changing how the trustworthiness of individuals is being assessed by companies all over the world. What is needed is a clear set of accepted standards delineating what data is permissible as a basis for decision-making by firms and regulation or behavior manipulation by governments. We have accepted mechanisms for negotiating and enforcing standards and norms as part of a rules-based international order. We should use it. Dr. Kislaya Prasad is a research professor and academic director of the Center for Global Business at the University of Maryland Robert H.

SENS. CARPER, PORTMAN BIPARTISAN REPORT REVEALS LACK OF FEDERAL RESPONSE TO CHINA'S TALENT RECRUITMENT PLANSUS Fed NewsNovember 19, 2019 Tuesday 10:08 PM  ESTCopyright 2019 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 2061 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, Nov. 19 -- The office of Sen. Tom Carper issued the following press release:Today, U.S. Senators Tom Carper (D-Del.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio), the Ranking Member and Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), unveiled a new bipartisan report titled Threats to the U.S. Research Enterprise: China's Talent Recruitment Plans. The report documents how American taxpayers have been unwittingly funding the rise of China's economy and military over the last two decades while federal agencies have done little to stop it. The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations will hold a hearing on the report tomorrow, November 19, 2019, at 10:00 am. A livestream of the hearing will be available here.Starting in the late 1990s through its "talent recruitment plans," China began recruiting U.S.-based scientists and researchers and incentivizing them to transfer U.S. taxpayer-funded intellectual property to China for China's own economic and military gain. China pledged to spend 15 percent of its GDP, more than $2 trillion, on improving human resources from 2008 to 2020. The Subcommittee investigated China's most prominent talent recruitment plan: The Thousand Talents Plan (TTP). Launched in 2008, TTP incentivizes individuals engaged in research and development to transmit the knowledge and research they gain in the United States to China in exchange for salaries, research funding, lab space, and other incentives.Over the course of an eight-month investigation, the Subcommittee examined seven federal agencies' efforts to combat the theft of American taxpayer-funded research and technology through Chinese talent recruitment programs. While China has a strategic plan to acquire knowledge and intellectual property from researchers, scientists, and the U.S. private sector, the U.S. government does not have a comprehensive strategy to combat this threat. The seven federal agencies reviewed by PSI include the Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, Department of Energy, State Department, Department of Commerce, and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy."My bipartisan report with Senator Portman shows the sophisticated ways in which the Chinese government continues to exploit our federal grant programs to recruit U.S. researchers and scientists and, ultimately, transfer research that is funded by American taxpayers back to China. Not only does this squander taxpayer dollars, but it contributes to China's economic and military rise," said Senator Carper. "As a former governor, I know that it's our job as elected officials to create a nurturing environment for job creation and job preservation. And I strongly believe that, in order to preserve our economic competitiveness and protect our national security, we must continue to support international partnerships - particularly those in the fields of science and technology research - that help to foster that nurturing environment. But today's report makes clear that there are serious consequences that come from giving a foreign government so much control over the vital research we rely on to drive our country's economic competitiveness and bolster our national defense. I am interested in hearing from experts about smart ways we can strengthen our nation's response to the threats posed by China's talent recruitment efforts and better secure our vital federal research programs. I also look forward to continue working with Senator Portman on bipartisan legislation to mitigate the economic and military gains our competitors and adversaries might obtain due to our inaction.""This report reveals that American taxpayers have been unwittingly funding the rise of China's economy and military over the last two decades by detailing not only the lengths and expense China has gone to in order to steal American intellectual property, but also the shocking fact that our own federal agencies have done little to stop their actions despite being aware of China's talent plans," said Senator Portman. "These talent plans are a win-win for China. China wins twice. First, the American taxpayer funds China's research and development. Second, China uses that research to improve its economic and military status. This is unacceptable and I look forward to working with Senator Carper on bipartisan legislation to end this abuse of American research, intellectual property, and taxpayer money."The report's key findings include:* China seeks to become a science and technology ("S&#38;T") world leader by 2050. The Chinese government elevated the importance of S&#38;T as a key national strategic goal in 2006. China seeks to become an "innovative country" by 2020 and an S&#38;T world leader by 2050. To accomplish its goals, China systematically targets critical technologies and advanced S&#38;T capabilities as a way to enhance national strength and achieve Chairman Xi Jinping's goal of "national rejuvenation."* China aggressively recruits overseas researchers and scientists. China has a coordinated global campaign to recruit overseas S&#38;T experts as part of its S&#38;T strategy. These experts provide access to know-how, expertise, and foreign technology-all necessary for China's economic development and military modernization. Chinese recruitment efforts also have begun to reverse China's brain drain, as more Chinese students than before are returning to China after studying abroad.* The Thousand Talents Plan ("TTP") is China's most prominent talent recruitment plan. Launched in 2008 and controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, the TTP recruits thousands of high-quality overseas talents. As of 2017, China reportedly has recruited 7,000 researchers and scientists. The TTP targets U.S.-based researchers and scientists, regardless of ethnicity or citizenship, who focus on or have access to cutting-edge research and technology. The TTP is just one of over 200 Chinese talent recruitment plans over which the Chinese Communist Party is able to "exert exceptional" levels of control. In response to U.S. government scrutiny, China has attempted to delete online references to its talent recruitment plans and reportedly instructed Chinese institutions on how to avoid additional U.S. scrutiny.* TTP employment contracts violate U.S. research values. TTP members sign legally binding contracts with Chinese institutions that contain provisions that violate U.S. research values, including non-disclosure provisions related to their research and employment with Chinese institutions. The contracts require TTP members to undermine fundamental U.S. scientific norms of transparency, reciprocity, merit-based competition, and integrity. Fundamentally, these contracts incentivize TTP members to put China's interests ahead of U.S. institutions.* Federal agencies are not prepared to prevent China from transferring taxpayer-funded research and stealing intellectual property. The U.S. government was slow to address the threat of China's talent recruitment plans, leading to U.S. government grant dollars and private-sector technologies being repurposed to support China's economic and military goals. Though some federal agencies have begun to take action, the federal government lacks an effective interagency strategy and continues to have shortfalls in its processes to mitigate the threat that Chinese talent recruitment plans pose.* The FBI recognized that it and other federal agencies were "slow to recognize the threat of the Chinese talent [recruitment] plans" until recently. Despite the Chinese government publicly announcing in 2008 its intent to recruit overseas researchers with access to advanced research and technology, FBI's headquarters in Washington D.C. did not take control of the response to the threat until mid-2018. The FBI took nearly two years to coordinate the dissemination of information identifying potential talent recruitment plan participants to federal grant-making agencies. The FBI has yet to develop an effective, nationwide strategy to warn universities, government laboratories, and the broader public of the risks of foreign talent recruitment plans.* Federal grant-making agencies lack standards and coordination. U.S. grant-making agencies, such as the National Science Foundation ("NSF") and the National Institutes of Health ("NIH"), each require grant applicants to use different forms and processes to apply for federally funded research grants. This increases administrative burdens on researchers applying for grants from multiple federal agencies. It also complicates effective grant oversight of the more than $150 billion in U.S. funding awarded annually for research and development.The report makes the following recommendations:* Federal agencies must develop a comprehensive strategy to combat both illegal and extralegal transfers of U.S. intellectual capital. China uses illegal and extralegal mechanisms to acquire U.S. intellectual property, research, and sensitive technologies. Federal agencies should work with the U.S. research community to balance the need for international collaboration while securing U.S.-government funded research.* Federal agencies should declassify and disseminate more information on foreign talent recruitment plans. Additional information from the U.S. intelligence community, federal law enforcement, and federal grant-making agencies will help define the scope and scale of the problem so that U.S. research institutions can effectively mitigate risks associated with foreign talent recruitment plans.* While taking steps to better protect research and intellectual property, Congress and the Executive Branch should reaffirm the critical importance of foreign students and researchers in the United States and the importance of international research collaboration. Congress should provide stable and sustained funding for scientific research sponsored by federal agencies and support programs aimed at keeping scientists and their work in the United States.* Federal law enforcement agencies and members of the intelligence community must better tailor engagement with the U.S. research community to ensure that threat information is accessible and actionable. The FBI should develop a cohesive strategy to ensure outreach by its headquarters and 56 field offices is effective, consistent, and timely.* The U.S. research community should establish a "Know Your Collaborator" culture. U.S. research institutions should establish best practices in monitoring scientific and research collaboration with foreign nationals and determining whether such collaboration adheres to U.S. scientific research values, especially in the area of research integrity. U.S. research institutions also should investigate and adjudicate allegations of failures to disclose conflicts of interest, commitment, or other outside support.* The administration should consider updating NSDD-189 and implement additional, limited restrictions on U.S. government-funded fundamental research. NSDD-189 was issued in 1985 and established the national policy that products of fundamental research are to remain unrestricted to the maximum extent possible. Federal agencies must not only combat illegal transfers of controlled or classified research, but assess whether openly sharing some types of fundamental research is in the nation's interest.* Federal law enforcement and other relevant agencies should identify U.S.-based entities that serve as recruitment networks, platforms, or foreign government proxies that facilitate or broker in state-sponsored talent recruitment. Additional investigations and publications are needed to fully understand the impact of foreign talent recruitment efforts in the United States. Federal law enforcement and other relevant agencies should examine the extent of foreign talent recruitment activity in the private sector for foreign talent recruitment-related programs, including venture capital contests and entrepreneurial programs.* Grant-making agencies should not award U.S. funding to participants of foreign talent recruitment programs absent full disclosure of the terms and conditions of membership in any talent recruitment program.

I lead technology policy at The Heritage Foundation where I am also the Senior Research Fellow for Technology, National Security, and Science Policy. The views I express in this testimony are my own and should not be construed as representing any official position of The Heritage Foundation."Thank you, Chairman Joshua Hawley (R-MO) and Ranking Member Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) for the opportunity to testify before the subcommittee on this important topic. It is critical that our nation consider the opportunities and the challenges that are created in this emerging environment of ubiquitous data generation and growing data insecurity."As a former intelligence officer within the United States' Intelligence Community, our mission was to collect, to understand, to predict, and to shape human behavior and events. Those in government call this "intelligence.""Technology companies call this "market research," "data analysis," "audience segmentation," or "service provisioning." But in reality, in the age of the so-called "knowledge economy," we are all in the business of intelligence."The proliferation of sensors, the deluge of digitized data, and the exponential growth in computational capacity are combining to produced previously unimagined possibilities for human thriving and happiness. But these positive outcomes are not all that is being created. In the background of these real and laudable achievements is an undeniable and a potentially existential challenge: we are innovating faster than we can secure."General cybersecurity risks are combining with increasingly aggressive, hostile foreign actors to create an environment that few understand and that even fewer are prepared for. Specifically, there are three trends that must be turned around if the U.S. is going to thrive going forward.1. Cybercrime"First, cybercrime is exploding. By 2021, according to Cybersecurity Ventures, cybercriminals are projected to cost the global economy more than $6 trillion annually, up from $3 trillion in 2015.1 Perhaps nowhere is this trend more clear than in the business sector."More than 43 percent of global businesses were the victim of a cybersecurity breach in the past 12 months, according to the 2018 Cyber Security Breaches Survey, and 83 percent of finance companies are hit by at least 50 cyberattacks every month.2 Even more, once bad guys gain access to these networks, they remain undetected, on average, between six and 12 months--stealing intellectual property, siphoning critical data, and generally causing havoc.3"With the average cost of a corporate cybersecurity breach now running between $1.25 million and $8.19 million,4 the professional cybersecurity industry is booming. But even this is a sign of difficult days ahead."Total spending on cybersecurity is projected to reach more than $120 billion by the end of 2019,5 an increase of nearly 13 percent over last year--with companies like Microsoft, Google, and Facebook each spending around $1 billion a year on securing their products and offerings. But here is the rub: Few companies have the resources or the technical talent of these tech titans, and yet, smaller companies face many of the same threats that are trying to take down the Silicon Valley giants-- including increasingly aggressive state actors.2. Cyber-Enabled Economic Warfare"Cyber-enabled economic warfare is the second trend that must be engaged. For decades, countries like China and Russia have pursued a deliberate strategy of using their foreign policy and intelligence communities to copy and to steal American technologies. These strategies are starting to produce meaningful results with several foreign tech companies now legitimately rivaling U.S. tech leaders in both innovation and market capitalization."If left unaddressed, this could pose a challenge, not only to our economic security, but also our greater national security. In January 2020, for example, a new Chinese cybersecurity law will go into effect and companies operating in the country will have no place left to hide. The new law is part of Beijing's years-long effort to expand its domestic surveillance programs and is rooted in a massive cybersecurity law adopted in 2016."Next year, all companies--including foreign-owned companies--must arrange and manage their computer networks so that the Chinese government has access to every bit and byte of data that is stored on, transits over, or in any other way touches Chinese information infrastructure. Put simply: the Chinese government will have lawful and technical access to all digital data within its borders and perhaps to large volumes of data beyond its borders."Companies have long known that their intellectual property (IP), trade secrets, and even their communications are highly sought by market competitors and by the Chinese government. Many of these risks are accepted as the price of doing business in Asia and, those risks that are deemed unacceptable, are mitigated by security technologies and networking strategies that attempt to hide critical information from prying eyes."All of these technologies and strategies, under the new law, will be illegal. For example, it is currently commonplace for companies operating in China to set up virtual private networks (VPNs) on which their data and communication is stored and sent within an encrypted "pipe" that outsiders cannot crack or intercept."These VPNs and the underlying encryption - to the degree that they prevet access by the Chinese government - will no longer be allowed. There will be no private or encrypted messages in China."No confidential data. No trade secrets. No exemptions. If a company operates in China, it will be required to operate in such a way as to provide the country's intelligence and law enforcement authorities unfettered digital access."The days of paying the "IP tax" for access to the world's fastest growing market are over. This access will now cost you everything. And this is precisely the Chinese plan."In a recent report,6 former Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert O. Work captures the challenge well when he says, "Chinese technological capabilities are growing as rapidly as its economic power...."Indeed, China is keenly focused on blunting the U.S. military's technological superiority, even as it strives to achieve technological parity, and eventually technological dominance.""Put simply: our long-term economic and national security must account for--and roll back--a sustained campaign of cyber-enabled economic warfare the likes of which will take a giant leap forward in January 2020."But we need to protect against data theft and loss at home too. This is why the United States must treat China as a national security threat to our domestic critical networks as well. As an adversarial power, China cannot be allowed to use its government-controlled companies to gain a significant foothold in any of the United States' critical government or domestic networks. Such a presence would be a clear national security threat that could decisively compromise American telecommunications and data infrastructure--including the communications integrity of the U.S. military and intelligence community."China's intentions are clear: Beijing will, if not prevented, use the deployment of equipment, software, and services from Chinese state-controlled companies to compromise U.S. information networks--networks that carry significant volumes of military and intelligence data."To that end, the Chinese government is implementing a concerted strategy of civil-military fusion through the sale and deployment of technologies and systems that enable Chinese companies with state support to siphon, store, and exploit data transmitted on these systems, and leverages these same companies as extensions of the government's intelligence and national security apparatus."This threat demands a response. China has:* Expedited the two-decades-old effort to meld its private and defense communities, with Chinese President Xi Jingping explaining in early 2018 that "[i]mplementing the strategy of military-civilian integration is a prerequisite for building integrated national strategies and strategic capabilities and for realizing the Party's goal of building a strong military in the new era."7* Used Chinese telecommunications companies, such as Huawei, as the prototype of this civilmilitary fusion, where the company is not only heavily subsidized by the Chinese government, but it is also broadly accused of espionage by national security leaders in the United States, Australia, Japan, and New Zealand.8 The United Kingdom and Germany also express grave doubts about the company's trustworthiness.9* Employed aggressive national security laws. All Chinese companies are legally required to "support, assist, and cooperate with national intelligence efforts,"10 and government intelligence agencies are legally allowed to forcibly gain access to any server or data stored within the nation's borders.11 This means that, regardless of a company's active complicity in spying, the only safe assumption is that any information collected by Chinese companies and held on Chinese servers will be exploited by the Chinese government."Industry remains best suited to develop and deploy the nation's information infrastructure. That does not absolve the federal government of its constitutional responsibility to provide for the common defense, protecting the people and the interests of the United States. The nation must forge a path so that these goals can be accomplished in a complementary fashion. There are some actions that the U.S. government can undertake now to start moving in the right direction and send Beijing a strong message. Specifically, the Administration should:* Share threat information with industry. U.S. government concerns about Chinese technologies and related services cannot be expressed exclusively in classified or other constrained environments. If the U.S. government wants industry to operate in ways that do not provoke national security concerns or make them worse, the government must share its telecommunications security concerns in a detailed and broadly sharable manner.* Determine disqualifying factors. The U.S. government should clearly communicate with industry and with America's foreign partners and allies, as well as the Chinese, which legal frameworks, activities, and business practices will result in exclusion from U.S. 5G infrastructure, services, and other emerging-technology integrations. Further, the U.S. should encourage other nations to adopt these standards as a way of maintaining pressure on countries and companies working against U.S. and allied interests.* Block vulnerabilities. The U.S. should block any foreign technology from U.S. markets that creates vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure or that provides hostile foreign actors with "backdoors" to U.S. data. Doing this will impose significant pressure on China and others to improve poor security practices and it will spur domestic security research in the U.S. that will incrementally improve the safety of the hardware and software supply chains into the United States. The U.S. should encourage the remaining four Five Eyes countries--Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom--to implement similar exclusionary measures.* Block untrusted companies. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States should block foreign companies from U.S. investments if they have a history of producing hardware or software with known vulnerabilities. This would be especially helpful in mitigating the challenge of Chinese investment in, and purchase of, American start-ups that might embrace poor security practices in return for rapid access to capital.* Prepare for "zero-trust" networks. Currently, Huawei controls approximately 30 percent of the global mobile communications market and could win as much as 50 percent of the global 5G market. Even if the U.S. is able to secure its own wireless networks from foreign spying and interference, the vast majority of networks around the world will be developed and managed by the Chinese. This requires the U.S. defense and intelligence communities to begin mitigating this threat and developing new networking strategies that will allow the U.S. to operate and thrive in a "zero-trust" environment--meaning operating on networks that are owned and managed by China or other hostile actors. While it is too soon to cede 5G to U.S. challengers, it is prudent to begin preparing for worst-case scenarios."Finally, it is not just companies who are being attacked and it is not just IP that is being stolen.3. Ransomware Attacks Against Companies and Governments"The third and final cybersecurity trend that must be turned around is the growing use of ransomware against enterprises and governments."Ransomware is any malicious software that limits or prevents someone from using their computer or accessing their files and, in 2017, this threat went to a whole new level. In the wake of a 4.3 percent growth in ransomware variations--including the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks that went global at least 15 percent of business in the top 10 industry sectors were infected and nearly a third of those affected were locked out of their systems for five or more days."When it was all said and done, global ransomware attacks cost individuals and business $5 billion in 2017, a 400 percent increase from the year before. But now these attacks are taking an unexpected turn towards governments."In 2019, there have been more than 70 ransomware attacks on state, local, and county governments--including Florida, Georgia, Maryland, and a coordinated attack on 22 Texas cities and towns. Several of these attacks have led to catastrophic loss of data and equipment and all of them have temporarily crippled the provision of critical services. These attacks on governments now constitute more than 60 percent of all U.S. ransomware attacks this year.12"These three trends cannot be ignored. Even more, they must be rolled back if the United States wants to thrive in the future."I thank the committee for the opportunity to testify and I look forward to your questions."* * *Footnotes:1 Steve Morgan, "2019 Annual Cybercrime Report," Cybersecurity Ventures, December 2018, https://www.herjavecgroup.com/the- 2019-official-annual-cybercrime-report/ (accessed November 1, 2019).2 Government of the United Kingdom, "Cybersecurity Breaches Survey," Department of Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport, April 2018, https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/702074/Cyber_Security_Breaches_ Survey_2018_-_Main_Report.pdf (accessed November 1, 2019).3 Jack Foster, "21 Terrifying Cybercrime Statistics," VPN Geeks, 2019, https://dataconnectors.com/technews/21-terrifying-cybercrime- statistics/ (accessed November 1, 2019).4 Chris Brooks, "What's the Cost of a Data Breach in 2019?"

Interview with U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross; U.S.-China Trade Deal; Crackdown on Huawei and ZTE; USMCA PushMORNINGS WITH MARIA MORNINGS WITH MARIA 7:00 AM ESTNovember 15, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; DomesticLength: 7937 wordsByline: Maria Bartiromo, Cheryl Casone, Susan LiGuests: Kevin Kelly, Veronica Dagher, Wilbur Ross, Kelly Grier, Danielle Hughes, Andy PurdyBodyMARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: A breakthrough in USMCA apparently. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi signaling progress in talks with the Trump administration. She says she wants it passed by the end of this year.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will weigh in coming up, live, exclusive straight ahead.Futures this morning are higher. Take a look at indications that we will see a gain at the start of trading this morning. Dow Industrials up 70 points right now. S&P is up 7. And the Nasdaq futures higher by 28.This is the high of the morning on top of another record high for the Standard and Poor's yesterday. The S&P 500 finishing at 3096 with a fractional gain, unchartered territory. The Dow and the Nasdaq were down fractionally.European indices this morning a mix. Take a look. The FT 100 in London is down 47 points. The CAC 40 in Paris is up 16 points and the DAX index in Germany is higher by 11.In Asia overnight markets finished mostly higher with the best performer in Korea. The Kospi index up better than 1 percent.The U.S. versus Huawei -- the Chinese technology giant facing an FCC vote that would ban carriers from using it. The United States is not backing down on its criticism of Huawei. Why Attorney General William Barr says it cannot be trusted. I will get reaction from Huawei Technologies chief security officer this morning coming up later this hour.And Avenatti who? The question that stumped all three "Jeopardy" contestants later this hour. We will bring it to you coming up.All those stories coming up this Friday morning. And joining me to break it all down -- Divine Asset Management CEO Danielle Hughes is here; Benchmark managing partner Kevin Kelly; and the "Wall Street Journal's" wealth management reporter, the host of the podcast "Secrets of Wealthy Women", Veronica Dagher. Great to see everybody this morning.VERONICA DAGHER, "WALL STREET JOURNAL": Great to be here.KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK: Great to be here. And it's good to see the futures are up, especially off optimism on a trade deal but also earnings have done very well this season.And so Nvidia, which is a semiconductor company, they reported last night. They actually did well but they have tempered expectations into 2020 off of what's happening in China.BARTIROMO: All right. So the earnings story is a great backdrop.KELLY: Yes.BARTIROMO: The economy is showing real strength, certainly the consumer. We're waiting on retail sales this morning.KELLY: Yes.BARTIROMO: We'll get that in about an hour and a half.But our top story this hour is the U.S. versus China on the trade deal.White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said that the first phase of a trade agreement with China is actually in the final stages. But President Trump is not ready to sign it just yet.The President weighing in at a rally in Louisiana last night. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You know, we're making a great deal with China. Or we're taking in billions in tariffs. I can live either way. They want to make the deal much more than I do.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Mr. Secretary -- it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.WILBUR ROSS, U.S. COMMERCE SECRETARY: Good to see you -- Maria.BARTIROMO: So what can you tell us. Where are we in terms of doing a deal with the Chinese? I mean obviously, this week we've been all over the map. First they wanted all the tariffs off. The President put water on that. But the President was not going to take any tariffs off. And we're still expecting a tariff increase in December.Then yesterday we heard that the Chinese are balking at buying the amount of agriculture that the President has signaled. Where are we on the trade deal?ROSS: Well, you don't really have the deal on anything until you have the deal on everything. So it's not surprising that at the very last minute pieces are bouncing around.But I think the main thing is what the President said at the rally last night. China wants to make a deal. We think we would like to make a deal if it's the right deal. This will get made in all likelihood.BARTIROMO: In all likelihood. But will the Chinese agree to an enforcement mechanism where there are consequences if we find out that they continue to steal intellectual property?ROSS: Well, as you know, this phase one is relatively limited in its scope. And what's really being debated is how much limitation will there be on the scope of phase one relative to phase two or maybe phase three.So let's see what comes out. The devil is always in the details. And we're down to the last details now.BARTIROMO: The last details are probably the most important, right? Will they stop stealing intellectual property and will the President remove the tariffs?ROSS: Well, the President hasn't agreed to remove the tariffs. I think he made that pretty clear the other day. But let's just see what comes. I think the important thing is, it looks as though there will be this first giant step toward peace and quiet with the Chinese. That's the important thing to focus on.We'll see the details as they come through. And they're going to be good details or else the President will not go along with it.BARTIROMO: So the most important, this big phase one is about market access, Secretary? Is it just about giving financial services companies the ability to own their companies out and out in China, where right now you have to own 49 percent of a joint venture with the Chinese company having the majority?ROSS: Right. Well, it's about a lot of things. But the major focus is the focus on current trade. That's where the President was talking about the $40 billion to $50 billion in agriculture.So one of the questions is how firm is that commitment going to be and what happens if they don't live up to it. That kind of issue is really important to getting this put together.BARTIROMO: Do you see that the Chinese are balking at the amount of agriculture that the President said that they would buy? I mean do you have an agreement that the Chinese are actually going to buy the agriculture that the President said that they would?ROSS: Well, they can certainly afford to buy $40 billion to $50 billion. In fact, they really need that but phased in over a couple of years' time period. The question is are they willing to commit to it and if they are willing to commit to it are there any escape patches to the commitment?BARTIROMO: And that's really the important detail. Is there an escape patch? Just like are there open doors to Huawei technology.I want to ask you about Huawei because Attorney General William Barr says the Chinese telecom giant Huawei and ZTE are threats to national security and they cannot be trusted. Secretary -- what do you say about that?ROSS: Well, as you know, we have put them in the penalty box. They've been put on the entity list. And it's over that kind of issue that we have done that. It's also over that kind of issue that FCC is in the process of taking some definitive action.These are dangerous situations. 5G is going to be running everything. It's the Internet of things. If somebody can do evil in the context of 5G, they can do real evil to the whole country.We can't afford to let that happen. We in this country have made the decision Huawei is not an appropriate player to have control of our 5G market and a number of other countries are also following us.Attorney General Barr heads up the department that has brought the indictments against Huawei up in -- that are in court right now. And Huawei has let their chief financial officer, who is also the daughter of the main shareholder, have let her stay under house arrest in Canada for a year now, rather than let her testify.If they have nothing to worry about, why are they letting her be stuck in house arrest for a year rather than have her come down and defend herself?BARTIROMO: Right. I mean if Huawei is such a question, such a risk, why would we have these waivers in place? The deadline in terms of waivers for American companies to work with Huawei is coming up. Is there any reason to believe that these waivers are going to be lifted?ROSS: Well, let's focus on what we really mean by waivers. What we've given is a temporary general license, mainly so that the rural telecom companies in the U.S. can continue to function. They unfortunately are very dependent on Huawei for 3G and 4G.There are enough problems with telephone service in the rural communities. We don't want to knock them out. So one of the main purposes of the temporary general licenses is to let those rural guys continue to operate. That doesn't have anything to do with Huawei's efforts in 5G.What the Attorney General was talking about and what we're really focusing on is the 5G. Can you trust Huawei to be the 5G supplier for your country? Our conclusion thus far is no.BARTIROMO: What is it going to take for Europe to better understand this - - Secretary? Because it feels like the Europeans have their Huawei infrastructure in place and it's expensive to dismantle it and change it. Do you see any change in terms of the Europeans? Because Secretary Pompeo told me that if the Europeans continue to use Huawei, we're going to share less information with them.ROSS: Well, remember, Europe is not one monolith. Some of the countries there have indicated that they might use Huawei for 5G; some have indicated they have not. Boris Johnson, for example, has said that that matter is under review in the U.K.So I don't think it's quite accurate to say that all of Europe is going to use Huawei. Problem is some people are tempted by low price and that's a real dangerous trap. Are you willing to settle for a huge risk to your national security, just to save a few bucks on the installation of your 5G system? United States feels we're not.BARTIROMO: Yes. It's a really important point that you just made. Secretary -- real quick on this deal that the U.S. is negotiating. Want to get to USMCA. But as my final question on this, do you expect we'll get to a phase one deal with the Chinese?ROSS: I think there's a very high probability of it. At the last minute, we were disappointed in May. Maybe we get disappointed again now. And if we do, the President has made quite clear he's happy to live with this situation where we impose tariffs.So we're really in a win-win position. Either the tariffs will continue or we'll have an acceptable deal with China. So the important thing is to make sure that the deal is what we think it is, make sure that it is consistent with the promises that they've made to us. If it is what it seems to be, and if it's consistent, then we'll have a deal.BARTIROMO: It feels like we're in the same place that we were last week. Is there any reason to be optimistic that we're any closer this morning?ROSS: Oh, yes. We're much farther along in terms of detail. There are calls all the time, another call today. There's a lot of work being put in on this. This is not a thing where people are just sitting around star- gazing. People are working quite actively on a real-time basis to try to put this together.What's a little unfortunate --BARTIROMO: Yes.ROSS: -- is that when the Chilean conference where it was to be announced got put off, it eliminated a very important deadline. It's great to have a deadline when you're having negotiations. Now that that deadline got removed, through no fault of the Chinese and through no fault of ours, it takes off a little bit of the time pressure. I think that's really what we're dealing with.BARTIROMO: I see. So the work that's happening now is trying to get the Chinese to understand that we need an enforcement mechanism in there? Is that one of the main issues?ROSS: What's happening now is to make sure we are precise in what the parties have agreed to and what are the consequences if they don't live up to the agreement.BARTIROMO: I see. And is the December 15th deadline for the tariffs -- is that a date you're going to uphold whereas the tariffs will go -- an increase in tariffs go into effect December 15?ROSS: Well, the President hasn't indicated any change thus far. And there's plenty of time between now and the 15th. So let's see what happens in the real world, rather than just speculate as to what might be.BARTIROMO: All right. So you want to try to get a deal done before the December 15th tariff increase goes into effect?ROSS: Well, I'm pretty sure the Chinese would like to have it done too --BARTIROMO: Sure. Yes.ROSS: -- because if there's no deal, there's not very much probability of any relief on the tariffs.BARTIROMO: The USMCA story feels better this morning, Secretary. Let me ask you about that because House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that a trade pact breakthrough with the Trump administration could be near. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: We are moving positively in terms of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement. I do believe that if we can get this to the place it needs to be, which is imminent, that this can be a template for future trade agreements.I'd like to sees us get it done this year. That would be my goal. I don't imagine that it would take much more in the Senate to pass.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Secretary, I think there are about, what -- 14 days left for the rest of the year where Congress is in session.ROSS: Right.BARTIROMO: Do you expect a deal?ROSS: Congress doesn't work every day. So you're right, it's probably about 14 days left. But as to what Speaker Pelosi was saying -- this deal already is a very good template for future deals. It's much stronger on the issues the Democrats claim to be concerned about than the old U.S. NAFTA deal. And it's much better on the issues of labor, environment, and especially economics and protections than any trade deal in the history of the U.S. has ever been.So there is no substance to their continued delay. They've cost the economy billions of dollars already by delaying as long as they have. It's time to get serious. It's time to pay attention to something that really helps everyday Americans instead of having these silly hearings.BARTIROMO: Yes. Do you believe that she could continue with her public hearings to try to impeach this president while also trying to get USMCA over the finish line? Do you think this deal happens? Will it pass by year-end?ROSS: I think there's no question that if she puts it on the floor, it will be overwhelmingly voted. So the real question is when or if she's willing to put it on the floor.BARTIROMO: Yes. So we don't know. Do you think she will?ROSS: I hope so. For the good of the country -- that would be the singular accomplishment of this Congress would be finally going along.BARTIROMO: Right.ROSS: Remember, they've been fooling around with this for a year.BARTIROMO: Yes. I know that.ROSS: A year.BARTIROMO: Mr. Secretary -- it's great to have you this morning. Thank you.ROSS: Thank you -- Maria.BARTIROMO: Wilbur Ross. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Israel launching a series of raids on targets linked to Islamic jihadists in Gaza.Cheryl Casone with headlines right now -- Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes -- Maria.The Israeli military says the strikes were in response to rockets launched from Gaza after a ceasefire was declared. But apparently it's nothing.Israel released video showing those rockets being intercepted. These new strikes again creating uncertainty over whether the cease fire brokered earlier in the week it' going to stick. More than 30 people have been killed in this conflict so far.Well, we're going to learn more about Twitter ban on political ads today when the company releases full details of the new policy.Twitter announced the ban last month, just weeks after Facebook ran into trouble for saying it would accept political advertisements even if they contain misinformation. The ban takes effect next Friday. Not expected to have a major impact on Twitter's bottom line.There's Twitter in the premarket bell -- up half a percent right now.And who is Michael Avenatti? Turns out no one knew that answer on last night's episode of "Jeopardy". The audience met with silence when all three contestants in the tournament of champions were left stumped.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This lawyer's star rose while repping Stormy Daniels but fell after he was accused of trying to extort millions from Nike in 2019. His name, you've quickly forgotten obviously -- Michael Avenatti.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Quickly forgotten indeed. Avenatti recently pleaded not guilty to charges he tried to extort Nike on the $20 million. The federal conspiracy charges dropped -- Maria on Wednesday. Gosh -- who is Michael Avenatti?BARTIROMO: Yes.CASONE: Do you his name? You know that question -- I'll answer it for you.BARTIROMO: Oh, it's funny. Thanks -- Cheryl.CASONE: You bet.BARTIROMO: Coming up trade uncertainty. Washington and Beijing still have not signed an agreement. How this is weighing on business coming up.And then Nutella fans rejoicing. The company opening its pop-up hotel. When and where this is happening. We will tell you when we come back. stay with us.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROSS: So we're really in a win-win position. Either the tariffs will continue or we'll have an acceptable deal with China. So the important thing is to make sure that the deal is what we think it is, make sure that it is consistent with the promises that they've made to us.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: That was Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on the state of the U.S.-China trade negotiations. Phase one still hangs in the balance.White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said yesterday that negotiations for an initial deal are in the final stages but President Trump is not ready to sign anything yet.Joining us right now is EY chairman and managing partner, Kelly Grier. Kelly -- it's great to see you again. Thanks so much for being here.KELLY GRIER, CHAIRMAN AND MANAGING PARTNER, EY: Thank you -- Maria. It's great to be with you.BARTIROMO: Well, you've got customers across the business world, large companies, mid-size companies come to EY for consulting advice. Tell us what they're saying about the importance of a deal with China. Is it all just about those companies getting market access or are they worried about national security issues as others are?GRIER: I think that companies are worried really about the total Chinese trade relations agenda including security and certainly access to the marketplace there on an equal footing.So it really is I think a holistic view of what constructive discourse and ultimately relations with China means for business that's top of the agenda for our clients. That having been said, I think there is a lot of optimism with the negotiations, with the discussions and the prospect of a phase one deal being struck and I think that that discourse and that confidence is actually making its way into some of the calculus around business making decisions right now.KELLY: Kelly -- it's Kevin Kelly. And one of my questions I have for you is in regards to global growth, right. If we think about where CEOs are putting their money, there's been hesitancy to deploy capital just given the fact that the overall global economy is slowing. If you see Germany just, you know, skirted a recession. So what is the sentiment amongst clients and how are they going to be deploying their capital?GRIER: Yes, it's a great he question. And you're absolutely right. We're seeing more measured capital investments. That having been said, I think there is a great deal of optimism, particularly in the U.S. and in certain parts of the world.I think some of the uncertainties that have curbed investment are starting to abate. I think that the likelihood of a Brexit that is manageable with Johnson being able to stand and execute on his plan, while there will be ramifications of course associated with Brexit.There's at least clarity on the path forward. I think that's extremely constructive. The optimism around the prospects of actually getting the USMCA deal done before the end of the year is also another element of clarity that is important in terms of eliminating uncertainty.And the North American trade activity associated with that is obviously an important factor in determining where and what sorts of capital investment will be made across cross-border within the North American region. And then of course, as we just discussed, the situation with China.So while it is choppy I do think that -- I think some of the measure capital investment has been a function of some of these geopolitical issues outside of the U.S. as well as with the U.S. and other parts of the world.And I think greater clarity is going to clear some of the path forward for increased capital expenditure going forward.DANIELLE HUGHES, DIVINE CAPITAL: Kelly, it's Danny from divine capital. I'm curious to know your take on how companies are looking at going to different opportunities cross-border. Like Vietnam for example, their exports have grown astronomically in this time that it was gone away from China. Where are you seeing hot spots across the world for your clients?GRIER: That's a great point. We're seeing companies restructure their supply chain, certainly diversify their supply chain really around the world to given alternate paths to continue to deliver their goods and services on a timely basis and with an ability to manage the implications of potential tariffs and the costs associated with tariffs ultimately in pricing. We are seeing some of that.The hot spots are really as you mentioned areas with proximity to China that allows the least disruption to existing supply chains, but the greatest optionality in the execution of existing provision and ultimately manufacture and distribution of products.BARTIROMO: And Kelly -- real quick -- you've got this strategic growth forum happening this week, bringing together top executives and entrepreneurs. Where is the growth that you're seeing today?GRIER: Yes, it's a great question -- Maria. In fact, we wish that you were here. We know that you've been here in the past and it's such a great program. It's a really exciting three days. We bring 2,000 executives from really around the country who represent entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, private equity firms. We've got fortune 500 companies that like to tap into the energy of the entrepreneurial spirit.And this year we've got a group that represents literally 140 U.S. finalists for the entrepreneur of the year award program which culminates on Saturday evening, is comprised of a group of outstanding companies, entrepreneurial companies that represent 146,000 people by employment and they have actually grown their workforce by 28 percent. So generating significant job growth for the economy.They collectively have $42 billion in revenue and their annual growth this year was a whopping 46 percent. So really a very vibrant representation of the U.S. entrepreneurial market. And that is a group that is here and the sentiment is very positive, just really across the board.And we're seeing largely consistent buoyancy in this population of growth across all sectors. This is a group that really embraces change and diversity and is seizing the opportunities associated with some of the complexity that we talked about earlier.BARTIROMO: So it's really all sectors that you're finding growth. It's a terrific conference, I know. And we will be back. We loved being there.Kelly good to have you. Thanks so much.GRIER: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank you for inviting us. Kelly Grier joining us there from EY.Coming up, spy warning, Huawei's chief security officer next on accusations the company is a threat to national security of the United States.Then, Tesla back on track, the company's Model 3 gaining new ground with consumers. Who's recommending drivers buy? Coming up. a Don't forget to ask Maria, send me your questions on Instagram and on Twitter. I'll be answering them today at the end of the show and every Friday. We're back in two minutes' time. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Breaking news, J. C. Penney releasing third quarter earnings. Let's get to Susan Li, she's got the numbers, Susan.SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes, so smaller loss than anticipated here, Maria. We're looking at losses of $0.30 a share. Analysts were looking for something closer to just around $0.55 or so. Revenue though a bit light here, $2.38 billion for the quarter. A little bit less than what analysts had penciled in for the three months and they were looking for something around $2.5 billion. But a lot of positives here because they have now raised their full year guidance when it comes to earnings and that's EBITDA, it's a technical term which means outside of depreciation and taxes and that's a positive sign.Also we have inventory declining nine percent in the quarter. And that means they're moving more goods than anticipated, especially in lights of heading into the all-important holiday shopping period. So J. C. Penney here, there's a lot of -- I would say there's a lot of positives.Also we have store rationalization and merchandise movement and I think that all in all for a stock that's come a long way down and has seen over a decade of falling sales, this is a pretty good quarter for them. Back to you.BARTIROMO: Wow, that stock is all the way down to $1.17, Susan. I didn't realize it had gotten that low. This morning as you -- as you know, the good news has it up six percent. Susan Li with the latest there.Our top story this half an hour meanwhile, China trade and national security. Attorney General William Barr says that Huawei and ZTE cannot be trusted, this ahead of an FCC vote.I just spoke with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross about Huawei. Here's what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WILBUR ROSS, U.S. SECRETARY OF COMMERCE: We have put them in the penalty box. They've been put on the entity list. And it's over that kind of issue that we have done that. It's also over that kind of issue that FCC is in the process of taking some definitive action. These are dangerous situations. 5G is going to be running everything. It's the internet of things.If somebody can do evil in the context of 5G, they can do real evil to the whole country. Can you trust Huawei to be the 5G supplier for your country? Our conclusion thus far is no.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Huawei Technologies USA Chief Security Officer, Andy Purdy. And Andy, it's good to see you again. Thanks very much for joining me once again.ANDY PURDY, USA CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER, HUAWEI TECHNOLOGIES: Thank you.BARTIROMO: You just heard Wilbur Ross and of course you know what William Barr said, that Huawei cannot be trusted. What's your reaction?PURDY: Well, Attorney General Barr is a great attorney, and he's performing a very sensitive role as Attorney General as he should. I'm a little surprised that he commented publicly about Huawei in the context of two pending cases but he didn't really add anything, any new facts to the dialogue.In terms of the risks of 5G, there is very, very important that we recognize that you shouldn't trust anybody. That there need be mechanisms in place and that's what Europe is doing.Europe is putting in particular measures based on standards and best practices and that's not just about the equipment vendors, it's about the telecom operators. There are measures and procedures that are necessary so you don't need to trust the company. You shouldn't trust anybody.We can put measures in place so the operators and the equipment is not subject to foreign influence. And we can do that in a transparent way and Europe's going to do it.BARTIROMO: Well, you say you shouldn't trust anybody. Well, certainly not a company that has backdoors that all your data goes back to the Chinese government. I mean, I don't think you could -- you could compare any company to Huawei, given your relationship to the Chinese Communist Party, right?PURDY: Well, the fact is, none of that stuff is proven, Maria and we've discussed that --BARTIROMO: Well, the founder of Huawei Ren Zhengfei is a communist, right? And a he's on the board as well. He's the chairman.PURDY: In fact, you look at what Theresa May and Angela Merkel said, that the U.S. government had no evidence. They even didn't make allegations against Huawei.BARTIROMO: Well, no evidence of what? Wait, no evidence of what?PURDY: They're afraid of what the China government -- they're afraid the China government will force Huawei to do things. But the measures that are in place that allow Nokia and Ericsson to do business in the United States despite their deep ties in China, those are the kind of measures that will provide guarantees and also the conduct of the telecom and mobile operators, that there will not be a risk from having Huawei be one of the providers in the U.S. telecom network.But more importantly, we've got thousands of American jobs on the line with the entity list. And we've got rural America as Secretary Ross said that are under-served and Huawei serving them just in 3G, 4G, we can help maintain that service and we can help retain those jobs.BARTIROMO: Why don't -- why don't you just change the backdoors? Why don't you just change the infrastructure at Huawei so that you don't have backdoors going to the Chinese Communist Party?I mean, we know that there have been a number of situations where backdoors were found even when Huawei said there weren't. I mean, I point to Vodafone Italy discovering the hidden backdoors in Huawei equipment. That would have allowed the Chinese company to access users home networks as well as Vodafone's Italian fixed line network because of the backdoors that they discovered inadvertently, Andy.PURDY: So Maria, why is it that the European Union, Germany and U.K. are OK with allowing Huawei to be part of those networks?BARTIROMO: Maybe because it's cheap.PURDY: Why are they putting in the kind of measures we recommend which are comprehensive measures that address the risk from all providers? That's what necessary to make us all safer.BARTIROMO: Well, how come you sell -- how come Huawei sells its equipment below cost? I mean, it's cheap obviously and it's a money -- it's a money issue, that's what they say. That it's cheaper than other equipment so they're going to buy it. Why not just sell it at market rates? Why do you have to undercut competitors and sell it so cheaply so that others will buy it?PURDY: Maria, that is false. That is not what happens. In fact, I just heard that the U.S. government person talked to one of our customers and he was shocked. He thought that Huawei was giving away our equipment to rural America. We lose contracts every day around the world. We are at market price. We have the best equipment. And we can provide the technological innovation to help companies compete throughout the world.BARTIROMO: Best equipment, that goes back to the Chinese communist government -- equipment that goes back to the Chinese communist government.You can understand what the U.S. is concerned about, right, that there are national security issues around the fact that there are all these backdoors in Huawei equipment which ultimately send the data back to the communist government who obviously wants to be the number one economic power in the world.PURDY: So if that's true and I know you've said that repeatedly.BARTIROMO: What do you mean if?PURDY: If that's true, why does the -- why does the U.K. government and Germany, why do they say there's been no evidence given by --BARTIROMO: I'm not talking about the U.K. government. I don't know what their reasons are. I'm talking about America, Andy.PURDY: There's been no evidence --BARTIROMO: I'm not talking about the U.K., I want to talk about America right now.PURDY: America went to the U.K. government. They went to the German government, the Polish government, other governments. But they had no evidence of what you're talking about. So I understand you believe it firmly but there's no evidence of that, Maria.BARTIROMO: Look, the CFO of Huawei is still detained in Canada. I want to -- I want to get your reaction to something Wilbur Ross said in the last hour. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROSS: Attorney General Barr heads up the department that has brought the indictments against Huawei up in -- that are being in court right now. And Huawei has let their chief financial officer, who's also the daughter of the main shareholder. They've let her stay under house arrest in Canada for a year now, rather than let her testify.If they have nothing to worry about, why are they letting her be stuck in house arrest for a year rather than have her come down and defend herself?(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Why not let her testify, Andy?PURDY: You know, this sounds like the argument of the Democrats and impeachment. They're so convinced that President Trump is guilty, they're going to throw away all proper procedure and process in the proceedings that they've -- they're doing in the House of Representatives. These are legal rights that she has -- these are legal rights --BARTIROMO: No one's throwing away any process -- no one's throwing away any process, Andy. That's not true. We've got evidence. I just read you -- I just read you Vodafone Italy, there are others cases where we know that Huawei has backdoors and data goes back to the Chinese communist government. We know that there's been intellectual property theft up and down the street by Huawei because you settled all of these lawsuits with companies like Cisco, like Motorola, like Microsoft. There's been intellectual property theft. That's why you settled. There's no -- we're not making assumptions. These are facts.PURDY: Get Cisco to agree with us to unleash the information about that settlement. You know, I'd be happy to have you see what that is.BARTIROMO: They can't, it's under -- you know that when you settle you also agree to not discuss it. Come on. And my audience is not that stupid.PURDY: I understand. Fine. So get Cisco to agree with us that we'll open up that information. But you asked me a question about Ms. Meng. The fact is, she has criminal process rights for extradition in Canada and process rights in the United States. Those proceedings -- she has every right to allow those proceedings to proceed, consistent with the law of the two countries.BARTIROMO: Yes. You know, I wonder, Andy, it's -- I give you a lot of credit for doing what you're doing. You're the spokesperson for this Chinese company. You were a member of the White House staff team that helped to draft the U.S. National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace in 2003.Then you went to the Department of Homeland Security to help foreman launch the National Cyber Security Division and the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team. You later served as acting director as the then lead cyber official at the Department of Homeland Security. Were you surprised when Huawei offered you a job?PURDY: The message that was communicated to me by the former CIO of the U.K. government that I would be able to promote what is necessary to make America safer, to promote a safer and more stable cyberspace around the world, that's what I'm doing. I'm not defending Huawei or China. I am saying as --BARTIROMO: You certainly are. You're defending them right now. You certainly are.PURDY: -- public safety in the federal communications. He said given the global supply chain, given the activities of Nokia and the Ericsson in China, there need to be measures in place and the measures need to apply to everybody so we can make sure the bad guys can't implant stuff in the products. That's what I'm recommending, that's what necessary to make America safer.BARTIROMO: But the measures need to start at Huawei. That's what we're talking about. Huawei having open doors to the Chinese communist government.Look, I want to switch gears. We -- look, we all know what's happening here. But Huawei also released its first smartphone without any Google apps as a result of this ban. Tell me what has happened at Huawei as a result of being on the entity list, as a result of this pushback on your telecom. What kind of business decline have you seen?PURDY: Well, our third quarter year over year results of profit was up 24.4 percent. What we're going to be struggling -- but you look at the fact that 260 American companies want to sell to the Huawei. 260 American companies representing over 40,000 American jobs.We're now shipping our 5G technology with (AUDIO GAP) we want to come back and (AUDIO GAP) buy those products. And nobody really believes that those things pose a national security threat for them to be able to sell to Huawei.BARTIROMO: Oh, they certainly do. They certainly do believe it. You've heard it from the attorney general himself and you've heard it from the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. They certainly do believe that there is national security risks, Andy. That's absolutely not true.Let me ask you this, I know that the founder of Huawei is a -- is a communist Ren Zhengfei, how loyal is he to the communist government and what is expected of you as a Huawei employee?PURDY: I have never been asked to do anything improper. I don't know of anything improper. I've never been asked to say anything that I didn't believe in or not say something I believe in.The fact is, this company has committed, it's private. The company with over 190,000 employees would be devastated if ever evidence came out of the kind that would convince the United Kingdom or Germany or Europe or whatever that Huawei was doing significant cyber security wrong doing. It would be devastating to the company.BARTIROMO: Andy, let me ask you -- final question here Andy. Tell me about Huawei's role in China's surveillance of its citizens, the surveillance state (INAUDIBLE) what are you doing in terms of working on surveillance? Is that all Huawei equipment the way that the citizenry is tracked?PURDY: I don't have information as we talked about one of the previous --BARTIROMO: You're the security -- you're the chief security officer of Huawei. You don't have information on that?PURDY: What Huawei sells in terms of commerce, there's some major stuff going on in Capitol Hill now, the issue of how technology can be used for tyranny. I think the idea of trying to come up with some standards of what kind of products and what kind of recipients of products are appropriate to sell around the world, but that stuff doesn't exist. I'd be happy to participate in those kinds of conversations.BARTIROMO: Andy, it's good to have you this morning. Thanks very much. We will be watching this developing story. We appreciate your time this morning, Andy.PURDY: You're welcome.BARTIROMO: Andy Purdy joining us there. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Venice is knee-deep in water right now. Cheryl Casone with the details. Cheryl, what pictures.CASONE: The pictures are incredible. If you've ever been to Venice, this makes you so sad. They remain under a state of emergency as high tides again flooded the historic city. Volunteers arriving in the city center to help businesses mop up. Schools are still closed there. Just days ago the city experienced its worst flooding in 50 years. The mayor is blaming climate change.Two Tesla cars are back in favorite consumer reports. The magazine put the Model 3 and the S (INAUDIBLE) on its recommended list after they won high scores for reliability. The Model 3 also taking the fifth spot on consumer reports' most reliable list on a 12 luxury compact cars. Consumer reports still not recommending Tesla's SUV, the Model X. The stock up half a percent in the premarket.And then there is this, forget the Taco Bell Hotel. Get ready for the Nutella Hotel because it's coming to California. The exclusive experience can offer fans a Nutella breakfast, a soul food brunch, pancake art, larger than life jars of Nutella and it will include round trip air fare by the way. The booking will only be granted to three contest winners. And their guest to enter, submit a video that exhibits, quote, how Nutella makes your morning special. They'll be judge on creativity. The commitment to breakfast and passion for whatever else is connected to Nutella.BARTIROMO: I love it. I want to go there.CASONE: Yes, it would be fun.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Cheryl.All right, Andy Purdy from Huawei, we tried to get it out there. I think that it was pretty obvious in terms of what we're dealing with in Huawei. Your reaction to the interview?HUGHES: It was -- it was unbelievable. You were unbelievably -- because you were pressing him and he was not answering your questions. He was really being evasive. He absolutely knows that there's evidence that they're collecting all of this data, that they're spying. And he wants to create this kind of facade that everything is fine and good and you know, just give us your business because all these American businesses want to give us their business --BARTIROMO: I'm struck by his resume. I really am. He worked at the White House. He was the White House staff team, helped draft U.S. National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace.KELLY: Well, and he's only -- he's only working for Huawei over here, right and representing the U.S.BARTIROMO: Right.KELLY: And so I think Huawei's sort of conceded the U.S. market. Their main thing is to go and dump into markets, make it there -- and so I don't know what he's talking about. He says they're at market rates. Maybe they're at market rates in the United States but they're not at market rates in India, they're not at market rates in the U.K.BARTIROMO: Well, that's how they got Europe --KELLY: Right, exactly. But he was also wrong because Germany's looking to ban Huawei products. He was like, oh, look at Germany, Germany loves us. Why are they allowing us? Well, they're actually not. Actually, Merkel's -- that's one of the biggest criticisms from her own party, so you know, it's just --BARTIROMO: I mean, the bigger issue is can we have a partnership with a country that we know tracks its citizens, that we know wants to beat us in all of that stuff?KELLY: Social credit scores.HUGHES: And he couldn't answer your questions about America.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's fascinating story. We'll see if we do get a -- we get a trade deal. I mean, it looks like from an economic standpoints both sides want it. But these are very different values and cultures and we've been talking about it all week. In fact we had a really busy week this week on MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Here's a look at some of the top moments from the program this week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R-TN): What they are trying to do is undo the 2016 election and say, we are so good, we didn't lose this. We had people that took it away from us. And the American people are saying get to the bottom of this, find out who did this. If they can do this to Donald Trump, they can do it to you.REP. BRAD WENSTRUP (R-OH): The bottom line is what if anything did the president do. And I do not fault any president who wants to investigate corruption and they involve U.S. citizens, regardless of whether they're a political candidate or not.I didn't realize that you may be able to go out and be corrupt and then decide you're going to run for president and suddenly that makes you immune.SARAH SANDERS, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY, WHITE HOUSE: I think the impeachment inquiry and the hearings today are a complete waste of time. It is the Adam Schiff show and I think that what he is doing is a complete and total disgrace; it's all huge waste of time.BARTIROMO: What do you think about the impeachment situation so far?MARK CUBAN, OWNER, DALLAS MAVERICKS: I mean, it's the first inning of a long game. So you really can't tell. I don't know if anybody scored any runs but everybody showed us what the pitching is going to be like. And so, we'll wait it out and see what happens. I don't think you can jump to any conclusion.ROSE TANG, TIANANMEN SQUARE SURVIVOR: I'm really, really am concerned about the kids. There are kids, there are teenagers. Once they are in these detention centers and the parents usually that they have to fight for months to get access to them, to send a lawyer to gain access to them. This is absolutely brutal.BARTIROMO: Do you see this as the beginning of another Tiananmen Square?TANG: It has already started.HANK GREENBERG, FORMER CHAIRMAN AND CEO, AIG: I think China is very important to the United States and vice versa. Our world is very safe if we have China and U.S. as allies. It's different if we're not.MARC SHORT, CHIEF OF STAFF TO VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: Congress continues to pursue sham investigations. What it means is they've not done the things they promised voters they would do. In 2018 they promised they'd work with this administration on lowering drug prices, they promised they'd work with us on infrastructure and they also promised they'd work with us on trade deals. And we remain anxious to complete some of those trade deals to keep this economy going.ROBERT WILKIE, U.S. SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS: Veterans Day has to be every day because these are the people who have volunteered and they're all volunteers now, to carry our freedoms on their shoulders.

Chinese-owned social site TikTok tangles with CongressCNN WireNovember 4, 2019 Monday 10:01 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1156 wordsByline: By Brian Fung, CNNDateline: (CNN) Body (CNN) --  Chinese-owned social video app TikTok followed the lead of other, bigger social media companies Monday and turned down an invitation to testify in Congress, drawing scathing criticism from Republicans. Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley called TikTok's decision a "mistake," tweeting an invitation to the company to "come and testify tomorrow about your ties to Communist Chinese Party. I'll save a place for you."The company, which has sparked a craze among American social media users, is growing to rival Instagram and Snapchat -- earning it increasing scrutiny by US officials who have raised privacy and security concerns about the app and its Beijing-based owner, ByteDance.As policymakers grapple with the implications of TikTok's explosive rise, the company now finds itself caught in the middle of tensions between the United States and China.That skepticism could have far-reaching consequences for TikTok, one of the few companies in recent years to challenge the dominance of tech giants including Facebook and Google. And it underscores how businesses with ties to China are increasingly facing disruption at a time of uneasy diplomacy between Washington and Beijing. On Monday, TikTok said it wouldn't appear at a Tuesday hearing examining the tech industry's relationship to China after being called by the Senate Judiciary Committee's crime and terrorism panel. "Unfortunately, on short notice we were unable to provide a witness who would be able to contribute to a substantive discussion," TikTok said in a statement. "We remain committed to working productively with Congress as it looks at how to secure the data of American users, protect their privacy, promote free expression, ensure competition and choice among internet platforms, and preserve US national security interests."The hearing is being led by Hawley, a major tech critic who has fretted over what he has said is a willingness by tech companies to cooperate "with foreign adversaries ... leaving our data vulnerable to malevolent actors." Hawley's office said it will leave chairs open for TikTok and for Apple, which also declined to testify. The only company to testify at the hearing will be Microsoft, according to a list of witnesses released Monday by Hawley's staff.Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas responded similarly. His office said in a statement: "TikTok's unwillingness to testify before Congress only underscores Senator Cotton's concerns that the company is beholden to the Chinese Communist Party and will not secure the rights and privacy of its American users."The rising interest in TikTok's affairs reflect the platform's tremendous growth. The two-year-old app has been downloaded over 750 million times in the past year, according to the New York Times, citing figures from the app analytics firm Sensor Tower. That's tens of millions more downloads than for Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Snapchat over the same period. And it reflects a 33% jump in downloads of TikTok compared to the year prior, Sensor Tower told CNN on Monday.CFIUS's involvement follows requests by a number of US lawmakers for an investigation of TikTok in the wake of widespread democratic protests in Hong Kong. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio and Cotton have all questioned whether TikTok may have censored Hong Kong-related content on its platform --- an allegation TikTok denies. "TikTok, which has millions of active users across the U.S., is now ranked among the world's most downloaded apps," Rubio wrote last month to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. "There continues to be ample and growing evidence that TikTok's platform for Western markets, including those in the US, is censoring content that is not in line with the Chinese Government and Communist Party directives."Last month, Schumer and Cotton wrote to Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, asking the intelligence community to probe whether TikTok represents a risk to US security. In that respect, TikTok finds itself in much the same position as another company with ties to China and that has become a political football: Huawei. Concerns about the security of Huawei's wireless equipment have led to numerous moves by US lawmakers and regulators to restrict the company's access to American markets. One major concern --- which Huawei rejects --- is the possibility that through its products, Americans' sensitive data could find its way into the hands of the Chinese government.Schumer and Cotton made the connection explicit in their letter, saying that putting Huawei on a Commerce Department blacklist was an appropriate first step. "However," they wrote, "further action is needed, particularly as China continues to shut out U.S.-based technology firms while promoting and expanding the global reach of its own companies. With over 110 million downloads in the U.S. alone, TikTok is a potential counterintelligence threat we cannot ignore."TikTok has said it does not operate in China. Instead, TikTok's parent, ByteDance, offers a TikTok clone named Douyin for mainland Chinese users. TikTok's data on US users is stored in the United States, it claims, and that as a result, the data is not subject to Chinese law. In a recent blog post, the company also pushed back against the censorship allegations. "TikTok does not remove content based on sensitivities related to China," the company said. "We have never been asked by the Chinese government to remove any content and we would not do so if asked. Period."National security experts offered mixed assessments on whether TikTok poses a true risk to US security. Jason Healey, a former White House cybersecurity official under President George W. Bush, said lawmakers' attempt to invoke national security with regard to TikTok relies "on a stretched definition of national security and counterintelligence.""Sure, TikTok can collect data and maybe send it to the PRC government, but mostly on teens," he said. "Yes, China will use it as propaganda and censor videos, but that's more about human rights than national security. Terrorists may use it for disseminating propaganda and to recruit, but is being threatening to China the right way to stop that?"Peter W. Singer, a strategist at the New America Foundation and author of numerous books on technology in warfare, said TikTok's claims not to be influenced by any government, including the Chinese government, are unrealistic. "For any company to say no government has influence over it is poppycock," he said. "To claim that of China is pure poppycock. Companies and their employees exist in a world where states have massive influence over their business and lives --- through both formal mechanisms like laws and taxes, to informal ones, especially in authoritarian regimes, like threats of jail and worse."TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Upon closing of the transaction, expected in the first quarter of 2020, Newmont will receive $375 mln in cash and contingent payments of up to an additional $100 mln tied to new resource discoveries.Evolution will pay Newmont $20 mln for each one million ounces of new gold resources added to the existing Red Lake resource base over a fifteen year period. The contingent payment is applicable to the first five million ounces of new resources.Newmont intends to use proceeds from the transaction to support the company's capital allocation priorities of returning cash to shareholders, maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet, and investing in a world-class portfolio.16:38ARWR Arrowhead FY19 EPS $0.69 vs $0.73 S&P Capital IQ Consensus Estimate; revs +946% to $168.8 mln vs $166.91 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus (56.99 +7.79)16:34GBDC Golub Capital beats by $0.03, net investment income increased 38% (18.18 )Reports Q4 (Sep) earnings of $0.35 per share, $0.03 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.32.Net investment income increased 38% yr/yr to $26.8 mln.Net asset value per share increased from $15.95 per as of June 30, 2019 to $16.76 as of September 30, 2019, primarily due to the GCIC acquisition.16:32FULT Fulton Fincl authorizes special cash dividend of $0.04/share (17.31 +0.22)The special dividend is payable on December 16, 2019, to shareholders of record as of December 4.16:31AMED Amedisys to acquire Asana Hospice; terms not disclosed (163.29 +4.57)Asana provides hospice care to approximately 540 patients daily in eight locations in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Missouri, Kansas and Texas.

The company's loss estimate is consistent with industry insured losses of approx. $11 bln and its expected market share of less than 1% for this catastrophe event.Due to the nature of this event, including the complexity of loss assessment and factors contributing to the losses, and the preliminary nature of the information available to prepare this estimate, the actual net ultimate loss for this event may differ materially from this current estimate. The additional complexity caused by the multiple catastrophic events that have occurred in Japan in recent months, together with the expectation of a relatively high proportion of flood related losses attributable to Typhoon Hagibis, are also likely to lead to increased uncertainty surrounding the estimated net ultimate loss for this event.16:28BDX Becton Dickinson increases quarterly cash dividend to $0.79/share from $0.77/share (253.86 +3.97)16:25PANW Palo Alto Networks beats by $0.02, reports revs in-line with billings above guidance; guides Q2 revs in-line; reaffirms FY20 revs guidance; increases billings slightly, guides down EPS, impacted by announced acquisition of Aporeto for $150 mln (250.28 +3.41)Reports Q1 (Oct) earnings of $1.05 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.03; revenues rose 17.7% year/year to $772 mln vs the $769.34 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Billings increase 18% $897.4 mln vs. $870-890 mln guidanceCo issues guidance for Q2, sees EPS of $1.11-1.13, including Aporeto acquisition cost, may not be comparable to $1.30 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q2 revs of $838-848 mln vs. $844.65 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; billings $985-1.0 bln.Co issues guidance for FY20, lowers EPS to $4.90-5.00 from $5.00-5.10, including Aporeto, may not be comparable to $5.07 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; reaffirms FY20 revs of $3.44-3.48 bln vs. $3.47 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; raises billings to $4.105-4.165 bln from $4.095-4.155 blnCo is acquiring Aporeto Inc., a machine identity-based microsegmentation company for $150 million in cash Aporeto identifies workloads and applies microsegmentation across all infrastructures, helping customers secure their applications at scale.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal. It should be noted that a separate report from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal before the 2020 election is unlikely to be reached did not have a noticeable effect on the market.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.4%), which typically outperforms when the prevailing view on trade is positive, led all sectors in gains amid strength in the semiconductor stocks. NVIDIA (NVDA 221.21, +10.32, +4.9%) was a notable gainer after the stock was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.4%.The health care (+1.1%) and consumer discretionary (+0.9%) sectors also rose more than the S&P 500, while the utilities sector (-0.4%) was today's lone sector to finish in negative territory.Two of today's M&A deals were ones that were already on the market's radar: Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.31, +1.11, +2.3%) agreed to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.78, +3.65, +7.6%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction, and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreed to acquire Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.25, +7.74, +6.2%) for $16.2 billion in cash.New deals included Novartis (NVS 91.30, +0.82, +0.9%) agreeing to acquire The Medicines Co.

The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.32. WTI crude increased 0.2%, or $0.10, to $57.98/bbl.Investors did not receive any notable economic data on Monday.

R&D, a Danish company founded in 2005, is a recognized leader in the design and manufacture of test systems that accurately simulate the extreme operating environments often encountered by large, rotating structures, such as wind turbines, and aircraft engine propulsion systems. R&D significantly expands MTS Test & Simulation's technology base and market presence for wind energy and aerospace markets globally; it provides compelling financial profile to enhance MTS revenue growth, margins, earnings, and free cash generation. The acquisition is expected to close by December 31, 2019.R&D is expected to contribute over $40 mln in incremental revenues in fiscal 2020 and to be accretive to Adjusted EBITDA margins for the Test & Simulation segment. R&D is further expected to be neutral to earnings in year one, exclusive of transaction costs. The acquisition is structured with an upfront payment of approx. $55 mln, which will be funded primarily through MTS' existing revolving credit facility, with expected earnout payments of up to an additional $25 mln based on financial performance through June 2021. Given the strong backlog position of MTS at the end of fiscal 2019, the solid backlog position of R&D, and the expected incremental Adjusted EBITDA generation, MTS expects rapid strengthening of its balance sheet following the closing of this acquisition, with a forecasted year-over-year net reduction in leverage by the end of fiscal 2020.16:14MTSC MTS Systems misses by $0.02, beats on revs; guides FY20 EPS below two analyst estimate, revs above two analyst estimate (60.56 +2.39)Reports Q4 (Sep) earnings of $0.37 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 worse than the two analyst estimate of $0.39; revenues rose 13.2% year/year to $224.08 mln vs the $218.07 mln two analyst estimate."As we enter our new fiscal year, we are excited about the resilience of our markets, our record year-end backlog, which topped $420 million, and the customer reception to our new product offerings.

Remission was defined as a BVAS score of zero and being off glucocorticoid treatment for ANCA vasculitis for at least the preceding four weeks. The pre-specified primary endpoints were remission of acute vasculitis activity at week 26 and sustained remission at week 52, where avacopan therapy was at least statistically non-inferior to the currently used glucocorticoid-containing standard of care (glucocorticoid SOC). The two primary endpoints were tested sequentially using a gatekeeping procedure to preserve the Type I error.BVAS remission at week 26 was achieved in 72.3% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 70.1% of subjects in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (p<0.0001 for non-inferiority). Sustained remission at 52 weeks was observed in 65.7% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 54.9% in the glucocorticoid SOC control group, achieving both non-inferiority and superiority to glucocorticoid standard of care (p=0.0066 for superiority of avacopan). Importantly, subjects who received avacopan experienced additional benefits compared to those in the glucocorticoid SOC control group.The topline safety results revealed an acceptable safety profile in this serious and life-threatening disease, with fewer subjects having serious adverse events (SAEs) in the avacopan group than in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (42% vs. 45%, respectively). Most reported SAEs were related to underlying ANCA vasculitis disease and commensurate with rates in previously published ANCA vasculitis trials. There were fewer subjects with serious infections in the avacopan group than the glucocorticoid SOC control group. A full analysis of the data is underway and expanded results are expected to be announced in the coming weeks.16:08HPE Hewlett Packard Enterprise beats by $0.03, misses on revs; guides Q1 EPS in-line; reaffirms FY20 guidance (17.45 +0.33)Reports Q4 (Oct) earnings of $0.49 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.46; revenues fell 9.2% year/year to $7.21 bln vs the $7.41 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.GAAP gross margins of 33.2%, up 250 basis points from the prior-year period and Non-GAAP of 33.3%, up 260 basis points from the prior-year period.

ADVANCE evaluated the efficacy and safety of adjunctive pimavanserin treatment in patients with predominantly negative symptoms of schizophrenia who have achieved adequate control of positive symptoms with their existing antipsychotic treatment. No drug is approved by the FDA for the treatment of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.Pimavanserin demonstrated a statistically significant improvement on the study's primary endpoint, the change from baseline to week 26 on the Negative Symptom Assessment-16 (NSA-16) total score, compared to placebo (-10.4 vs. -8.5; p=0.043; effect size = 0.21).

In this study, pimavanserin did not separate from placebo on the key secondary endpoint, the Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale.ACADIA plans to commence a second pivotal study with the 34 mg dose of pimavanserin in the first half of 2020.

That would be the information technology sector (+1.3%), which is the market's most heavily-weighted sector and the only sector up at least 1.0% in a session that has been governed with a risk-on bias.The catalysts for today's outperformance include:An encouraging press report that indicates China is going to increase penalties on intellectual property theft as a step toward trying to reach a Phase One trade agreement. The information technology sector often does well on days when trade optimism prevails given the sector's exposure to China and supply chains there.Strength in the semiconductor stocks, which have drafted off the trade news and a Morgan Stanley upgrade of NVIDIA (NVDA 220.44, +9.55, +4.5%).Performance chasing and an expectation that speculative trading action during this holiday-shortened week, which is often accompanied by low volume, will be concentrated in this hot sector.Notable movers:NVIDIA (NVDA 220.44, +9.55, +4.5%): upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley, which boosted its price target to $259 from $217.Intel (INTC 58.72, +1.11, +1.9%): benefiting from semi industry updraft, as well as news that a company Director bought 86,500 shares, worth ~$5 million, at prices ranging from $58.18-58.28.HP, Inc.

Treasury futures faced some overnight selling pressure while most global equity markets began the week on an upbeat note. The positive start was assisted by a Bloomberg report, which noted that the Chinese government will increase penalties for intellectual property infringement. That was viewed as a positive step toward reaching a partial trade deal with China, but the overall excitement was contained due to a Reuters report, which suggested that officials from China and the U.S. see a low likelihood of a "phase two" deal being negotiated in the near future. Treasuries followed their lower start with a swift rebound that lifted longer tenors into the green during the first hour of action. The market continued climbing into mid-morning trade with the long bond inching above its high from Friday. Today's $40 bln 2-yr Treasury note auction was met with solid demand, as the high yield stopped through the when-issued yield by 0.4 bps.

There is conference call scheduled for 9:00 ET. Q3 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $1.13 (-4% yr/yr) on revenue of $5.74 bln (+3.6% yr/yr). The Street is expecting Q3 comps of +2.6% vs 1.0% last year. The current consensus is within the company's guidance range of $1.07-1.16 for EPS, $5.66-5.77 bln for revenues, and comp increase of low single digits. The company is expected to guide for Q4 where Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.03 (+5% yr/yr) on revenue of $5.74 bln (-3.6% yr/yr). The Street is expecting Q4 comps of 1.8% vs 2.4% last year.Looking back, the company missed on EPS and revenues one time in the last four quarters. Last quarter, shares of DLTR fell 1% after it reported a miss on the bottom line and lowers its FY20 EPS guidance. The company cited increased costs as the guidance included the first three China tariff tranches, but the fourth 15% tranche was not included. The company reported same store sales for Dollar Tree and Family Dollar of +2.4%. As a percentage of sales, gross margin was 28.7% of sales compared to 30.1% of sales in the prior year.DLTR has a $26.6 bln valuation and trades at 19x 2021 EPS vs DG which trades at 21x EPS.Based on the DLTR Weekly Nov29 $112 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~4% in either direction by weekly expiration (Friday).On a positive report, look for resistance near the $116-117 area, while support sits near the $108-109 vicinity.13:43COMDX Metals Settlement PricesDec gold settled today's session down $6.60 (0.45%) at $1457/oz Dec silver settled today's session $0.11 lower (0.68%) at $16.885/oz Dec copper settled $0.00 lower (0.11%) at $2.645/lb13:39BBY Best Buy will report third quarter results tomorrow morning (74.37 +1.73)Best Buy (BBY) will report third quarter (October) results tomorrow morning and management will host a conference call at 8:00 a.m. ET.The nation's largest electronics retailer guided for third quarter non-GAAP EPS up 7-13% to $1.00-1.05 on revenue of $9.65-9.75 bln (consensus +1.2% to $9.7 bln) and comparable store sales up 0.5-1.5%. Target reported a decline in third quarter electronics sales last week. Upside for Best Buy could come from a stronger than expected iPhone cycle. The gaming cycle is expected to improve next year.Best Buy has reported positive comp sales for ten consecutive quarters, but comp sales missed estimates last quarter for the first time in two years. Second quarter comps sales grew 1.6%, toward the low end of its +1.5-2.5% guidance range, on top of 6.2% growth last year. Domestic comp sales grew 1.9%, as strength in appliances and headphones was partially offset by declines in gaming and home theater. Earnings beat estimates on cost reductions.Best Buy raised earnings guidance for the year but tweaked its sales outlook lower. The company raises fiscal 2020 (January) EPS to $5.60-5.75 from $5.45-5.65, but narrowed revenue to $43.1-43.6 bln from $42.9-43.9 bln and comp sales to +0.7-1.7% from +0.5-2.5%.A sales miss was not the way new Chief Executive and former Chief Financial/Strategic Transformation Officer Corie Barry wanted to start her tenure. Tariff uncertainty was a primary concern for investors. Some 60% of the company's cost of goods sold are exposed to China, but that number is expected to fall to 40% next year as vendors move production out of the country. Best Buy acknowledged the uncertainty regarding tariffs but said it is working on risk mitigation with partners and remained confident in the company's ability to continue executing its plan.In September, the company gave financial targets for fiscal 2025: Enterprise revenue of $50 billion and non-GAAP operating income margins of 5.0% vs. 4.6% or slightly higher this year with $1 bln of additional cost reductions and efficiencies.Best Buy remains one of the few 'winners' in the retail sector. Management continues to execute well in a difficult retail environment, but the stock has been consolidating in a wide range since breaking out to new highs in 2017. The stock trades at ~12.5x forward EPS estimates and just under 8x EV/EBITDA, a modest discount to a broad group of retailers despite a 2.8% dividend yield.13:16OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:AUPH Dec 9 calls (volume: 5270, open int: 80, implied vol: ~317%, prev day implied vol: 278%).

The Russell 2000 (+1.9%) outperforms, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) trails the pack.The Chinese government released a document stating intentions to better deter IP theft by increasing the penalties on violations, according to Bloomberg. The news is taking precedent over a Reuters report that suggested a Phase Two deal is unlikely to be completed before the presidential election next year.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.1%), which tends to outperform when trade sentiment is positive, is the lone sector up more than 1.0% today. Leading the group higher are the semiconductor stocks, especially NVIDIA (NVDA 219.64, +8.75, +4.2%) after it was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.1%.Following suit are the health care (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.8%), and industrials (+0.6%) sectors. The utilities (-0.2%), energy (-0.1%), and consumer staples (unch) sectors are the lone holdouts.As for M&A activity, some of today's announcements have already been on the market's radar like Charles Schwab (SCHW 48.76, +0.56, +1.2%) agreeing to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.19, +3.06, +6.3%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreeing to acquire Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.07, +7.56, +6.0%) for $16.2 billion in cash.The confirmed deals have still been supportive for risk sentiment, though, and the market has been treated with new deals in Novartis (NVS 91.23, +0.73, +0.8%) agreeing to acquire The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.86, +15.31, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash and eBay (EBAY 35.55, +0.42, +1.2%) reportedly being close to selling StubHub to Viagogo for $4 billion.U.S. Treasuries are little changed despite the solid gains being registered in the stock market.

The company guided for Q4 EPS between $1.15 and $1.29 and revenue between $1.44 bln and $1.46 bln when it reported its Q3 results on August 21. ADI's Q4 guidance was conservative relative to market expectations due to continued uncertainty related to restrictions on shipments of components to Huawei. This headwind is likely to persist since the U.S.-China trade dispute remains unresolved. Investors will be curious to hear what the company's management says about the ongoing 5G roll-out in China and the preparations for a broader build-out of the technology in the U.S. Comments about the state of the automotive market will also be of note. The stock was upgraded at Barclays, KeyBanc Capital Markets, and Raymond James since the release of Q3 results.Analog Devices trades at 20.8x forward earnings expectations, which represents a discount to Maxim Integrated (MXIM 56.28, +0.99, +1.8%) and Texas Instruments (TXN 118.98, +1.97, +1.7%), but a premium to NXP Semiconductors (NXPI 116.98, +1.76, +1.5%) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS 71.60, +2.03, +2.9%).12:13SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (101) outpacing new lows (11) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ACAD, ALLE, AMED, AMGN, AMP, AMWD, ANSS, AON, APPF, ARE, ARVN, ARWR, ATKR, ATRS, AXSM, BIO, BKE, BLD, BMI, BOH, BRMK, BURL, CACI, CATM, CG, CHH, CMTL, CNMD, CNNE, COLL, CPRT, CTXS, CVNA, D, DAR, DEA, DOCU, DOV, DRNA, DXCM, EPAM, EQH, ESE, EVER, FIVN, GAIN, GL, GMRE, GWRE, HALO, HLT, HNGR, HZNP, INCY, INFO, INSW, KNL, KRNY, KRYS, LBRDK, LITE, LULU, LXP, MDCO, MGLN, MMC, MSCI, NDSN, NMRK, NVRO, PAYC, PCAR, PCTY, PH, PLUG, PSN, QGEN, RE, RH, SAFE, SEM, SF, SKY, SNX, SO, SPLK, SPXC, SRCL, TDY, TECH, TGI, TIF, TNK, TYL, UI, USB, VCTR, VRTX, XPEL, ZBRA, ZYMEStocks that traded to 52 week lows: BXC, CBAY, CVTI, GMLP, GSM, GTT, LJPC, MUX, SMLP, ULTA, XOGThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: CABO, CRMT, FCNCA, MGIC, NWPX, POWL, WTBAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: ITRNETFs that traded to 52 week highs: BJK, EIS, FAN, IAI, IBB, IWF, IWM, IYF, IYG, IYH, KCE, MDY, OEF, PBD, QQQ, SPY, UYG, VTI, XLF, XLVETFs that traded to 52 week lows: VXX11:59SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- CymaBay Therapeutics (CBAY) sinks on halt of seladelpar development -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersCLVS (9.83 +13.51%): Advances to its highest levels since July on above average volume, now up circa +210% month-to-date.

Increased quarterly dividend to $0.12 from $0.1125/share (from October 23 Securities Analyst Meeting). On September 25 HPE completed its $1.4 billion acquisition of supercomputing company Cray.Over the next three years, the high performance computing (HPC) segment of the market and associated storage and services is expected to grow from approximately $28 billion in 2018 to approximately $35 billion in 2021.The acquisition is expected to be accretive to HPE non-GAAP operating profit and earnings in HPE's fiscal year 2020.HPE is arguably behind enterprise-level server peers Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), a point the company attempted to address with the acquisition of Cray. HPE also highlighted its as-a-service offerings at the October 23 Securities Analyst Meeting; as previously disclosed, HPE plans to offer its entire portfolio, including HPE Aruba Central, HPE BlueData, HPE Cloud Volumes, HPE InfoSight, and HPE OneView, as a service by 2022, a move the company anticipates will help drive sustainable profitable growth.HPE steps into the print with a roughly $23 billion market capitalization with a valuation of about 9.5x forward earnings estimates.11:30BONDX New SupplyTreasury Auction Preview$40 bln 2-year Treasury note auction (results at 13:00 ET) Prior auction results: High yield: 1.594% Bid-to-cover: 2.70 Indirect bid: 54.8% Direct bid: 14.0% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.128% Bid-to-cover: 2.58 Indirect bid: 48.6% Direct bid: 18.7%11:19NTR Nutrien to curtail production at Rocanville potash mine due to CN rail strike (47.10 +0.53)Nutrien announced that it will be forced to shut down production at its largest potash mine, Rocanville, due to the CN strike. Employee notices were sent out today indicating the mine will be shut down for 2 weeks starting on December 2."It is extremely disappointing that in a year when the agricultural sector has been severely impacted by poor weather and trade disputes, the CN strike will add further hardship to the Canadian agriculture industry," said Chuck Magro, Nutrien's President and CEO. "Any further disruption will be harmful to our business, the Canadian economy, and Canada's competitive position and reputation as a reliable supplier of fertilizer and food. However, most concerning is the impact on our hundreds of employees for whom this creates great uncertainty and hardship leading up to the holiday season."11:10SMH Industry Briefing: Chipmakers (133.43 +2.51)The PHLX Semiconductor Index (+2.1%) has gotten off to a strong start after underperforming last week. The high-beta group is now up 4.5% for the month versus a 3.0% month-to-date gain in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to the outperformance:Leadership from NVIDIA (NVDA 220.55, +9.66, +4.6%) after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to Overweight from Equal Weight and raised its price target to $259 from $217. Optimism about the viability of a partial trade deal with China after Chinese officials indicated that rules governing intellectual property rights will be strengthened.Notable movers:NVIDIA (NVDA 220.55, +9.66, +4.6%): rising to its highest level in more than a year after receiving an upgrade from Morgan Stanley. Applied Materials (AMAT 57.91, +1.97, +3.5%): showing relative strength after backing down from a fresh record high last week.

This news is overshadowing a separate Reuters report discussing why a Phase Two deal is unlikely to get done before the election.In any event, the Bloomberg report has helped catalyze a risk-on bias along with the news that Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.03, +0.83, +1.7%) is buying TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.45, +3.32, +6.9%) in a $26 billion stock deal, LVMH is acquiring Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.35, +7.84, +6.3%) in a $16.2 billion cash deal, and Novartis (NVS 90.94, +0.46, +0.5%) is acquiring The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.83, +15.28, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash.These deals have helped give an added lift to the financial (+0.6%), consumer discretionary (+0.9%), and healthcare (+0.7%) sectors, which are among today's leaders.The biggest gainer, however, is the information technology sector (1.2%). Such outperformance typically follows when the market is feeling good about trade developments, yet it is being bolstered further by a hot semiconductor group, which is drafting off a Morgan Stanley upgrade of NVIDIA (NVDA 220.40, +9.51, +4.5%) to Overweight from Equal Weight. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.2%.Strikingly, longer-dated Treasury securities are also up today, which means their yields are lower, indicating that not everyone is sharing the same risk-on, growth-oriented mindset as the stock market. The 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.76%.The Russell 2000 is up 1.7%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 1.2%; the S&P 500 is up 0.6%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.5%.10:17OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:CPRI Weekly Nov29 36;5 calls are seeing interest with 3660 contracts trading vs. open int of 20, pushing implied vol up around 9 points to ~37%.

Study LJ401-BT01 is a pivotal, multinational, multicenter, randomized, controlled study with a target enrollment of approximately 100 patients that is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LJPC-401 as a treatment for iron overload in beta thalassemia (BT) patients who, despite chelation therapy, have cardiac iron levels above normal. The primary endpoint of this study is the change in cardiac iron levels, as measured by cardiac T2* magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), from baseline to 6 months following treatment. The Company recently conducted an interim analysis that included approximately one-half of the target-enrolled patients. There were no significant differences in the primary endpoint or key secondary endpoints between patients on the treatment arm and patients on the control arm.Topline results of Study LJ401-HH01 are also now available. Topline results from this study are consistent with the interim results reported in June 2019. The change in TSAT from baseline to the end of treatment (16 weeks), the primary efficacy endpoint of the study, was statistically significant: LJPC-401-treated patients had a mean reduction in TSAT of 33% compared to placebo-treated patients who had a mean reduction of 3% (p<0.0001). The requirement for and frequency of phlebotomy procedures, a key secondary endpoint of the study, was statistically significant: LJPC-401-treated patients had 0.10 phlebotomies per month compared to placebo-treated patients who had 0.50 phlebotomies per month (p<0.0001). LJPC-401 was well tolerated. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were injection site reactions (ISRs), which occurred in 79% of LJPC-401-treated patients compared to 6% of placebo-treated patients. The ISRs were all mild or moderate in severity, and no ISRs resulted in treatment discontinuation.The company expects to re-evaluate its current operating plan in light of the mixed results of these studies and to make adjustments as appropriate to manage the company's available cash resources.08:31LJPC La Jolla Pharm President/CEO George Tidmarsh, M.D., Ph.D., leaves the company to pursue other interests (5.58 )A search for a new Chief Executive Officer has been initiated.

In particular, there continues to be uncertainty regarding Xerox's ability to raise the cash portion of the proposed consideration and concerns regarding the prudence of the resulting outsized debt burden on the value of the combined company's stock even if the financing were obtained. Consequently, your proposal does not constitute a basis for due diligence or negotiation.We believe it is important to emphasize that we are not dependent on a Xerox combination. We have great confidence in our strategy and the numerous opportunities available to HP to drive sustainable long-term value, including the deployment of our strong balance sheet for increased share repurchases of our significantly undervalued stock and for value-creating M&A. The HP Board of Directors is committed to serving the best interests of HP shareholders, not Xerox and its shareholders.

Economic data was light, but Germany's IFO survey showed a rise in Business Climate to 95.0, up from last month's reading of 94.6, and in-line with consensus.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: +10.010 yr Note: 1.78%USD/JPY: 108.85 +0.22EUR/USD: 1.1015 -0.0003Europe: FTSE +0.6% DAX +0.4% CAC +0.5%Asia: Hang Seng +1.5% Shanghai +0.7% Nikkei +0.8%Gold (1459.410 -4.50) Silver (16.87 -0.14) Crude (57.73 -0.04)16:21WRAPX This week's biggest % gainers/losersThe following are this week's top percentage gainers and losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).This week's top % gainers Healthcare: CLVS (8.66 +141.56%), COLL (19.35 +50.58%), SGRY (12.88 +48.39%), ATRS (4.89 +43.82%), DXCM (221.85 +41.04%), ATNX (16.08 +38.86%), EPZM (16.42 +38.57%), QGEN (41.6 +35.99%), EVH (10.5 +34.62%), MDCO (68.55 +32.28%), MRNA (20.69 +32.12%), TCMD (60.87 +31.3%), DRNA (22.5 +30.51%)Industrials: BE (6.25 +87.13%), AAXN (72.09 +37.26%)Information Technology: LASR (19.49 +38.23%)Financials: TRUP (33.79 +42.27%), LTS (3.47 +32.44%)This week's top % losers Healthcare: ANAB (12.02 -68.91%)Industrials: NVEE (47.62 -35.35%)Consumer Discretionary: MOD (7.41 -36.07%), FOSL (7.18 -34.9%)Information Technology: PLT (24.9 -38.64%), RBBN (2.81 -37.49%)Financials: QD (4.54 -36.24%)Energy: GLOG (9.34 -33.71%)16:17AEL American Equity Investment Life increases annual cash dividend to $0.30/share from $0.28/share (29.07 +0.12)16:17WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryThe stock market closed slightly higher on Friday in an uninspiring session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) edged above the S&P 500 (+0.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%), and Russell 2000 (+0.3%).The market heard from both President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, President Xi, on Friday. Mr. Xi called for mutual respect and equality in talks, but reiterated Beijing is willing to fight back if necessary. Mr. Trump said talks are moving along nicely and closing in on a deal, but the president suggested a deal should not be equal and should favor the U.S. instead.The takeaway was that the market still doesn't know for certain if a Phase One trade agreement will be signed this year, but talks are ongoing and appear to not be escalating. Separately, an upwardly revised reading in the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November was supportive for equities today.Leading the market in gains were the S&P 500 financials (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.7%), and industrials (+0.5%) sectors. The real estate (-0.5%) and energy (-0.4%) sectors were today's laggards.Nordstrom (JWN 37.95, +3.63, +10.6%) and Gap (GPS 16.94, +0.72, +4.4%) were among the biggest earnings-driven gainers in the consumer discretionary space, while an earnings-driven decline in Intuit (INTU 259.81, -11.34, -4.2%) put some pressure on the information technology sector (-0.1%).Elsewhere, the futuristic design of Tesla's (TSLA 333.04, -21.79, -6.1%) Cybertruck pickup was met with some confusion and mixed reviews. Ultimately, it appeared to be a sell-the-news case after the stock climbed about 40% in the past month.U.S. Treasuries ended the week on a flat note. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield was unchanged at 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.26. WTI crude declined 1.2%, or $0.70, to $57.88/bbl.Friday's economic data was limited to the revised reading for the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November:The final November reading for the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index checked in at 96.8 (Briefing.com consensus 94.9), which exceeded the preliminary estimate of 95.7 and the final October reading of 95.5. The November reading is in close proximity to the average level (97.0) since the start of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is the acknowledgment that consumers aren't anticipating sizable increases in inflation, unemployment, and interest rates, which suggests consumer spending activity should remain supportive for the U.S. economy.Investors will not receive any economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +28.4% YTDS&P 500 +24.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.5% YTDRussell 2000 +17.8% YTD16:12AGIO Agios Pharma presents new phamacodynamic and response data from both cohorts of perioperative study of vorasidenib and TIBSOVO (37.33 -0.85)Agios Pharma presented updated data from the ongoing perioperative study, confirming brain penetrance and robust biomarker suppression with treatment of single agent vorasidenib or TIBSOVO (ivosidenib) in low-grade glioma with an IDH1 mutation.As of the July 26, 2019 data cutoff, 49 patients were randomized before surgery, and 39 remain on treatment. The median (range) postoperative treatment duration for all doses was 5.42 (0.9-13.5) months for vorasidenib and 6.93 (1.0-13.2) months for TIBSOVO. Baseline characteristics were similar across the control and treated groups. Overall, 88% of patients had World Health Organization classified Grade 2 tumors. Less than a third of patients had prior radiation therapy and approximately half had prior systemic therapy.The safety analysis conducted for all 49 patients as of the data cut-off demonstrated that vorasidenib and TIBSOVO continue to have favorable safety profiles consistent with the Phase 1 data. 8.3% of patients in the vorasidenib group developed transaminase elevations, including one Grade 3 transaminase elevation at 50 mg daily which resolved with dose interruption. Grade 3 or higher events occurred in six (25.0%) vorasidenib patients and four (16.0%) TIBSOVO patients, with the majority related to postoperative complications. No patient discontinued treatment due to an AE.Data from the 42 efficacy evaluable patients (21 in the vorasidenib arm; 21 in the TIBSOVO arm) as of the data cut-off showed: among patients treated post-operatively with 50 mg vorasidenib, four patients (31%) achieved objective tumor responses (two achieved a partial response, defined as tumor shrinkage based on T2/FLAIR signal of at least 50%, and two achieved a minor response, defined as tumor shrinkage based on T2/FLAIR signal of at least 25% but less than 50%) according to the investigator by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology for low-grade glioma.Vorasidenib and TIBSOVO demonstrated brain penetrance, with mean brain:plasma ratios of 3.16 (vorasidenib 10 mg), 1.74 (vorasidenib 50 mg), 0.13 (TIBSOVO 250 mg), and 0.10 (TIBSOVO 500 mg). Mean percent reduction in 2-HG (95% CI) were 92.6% (76.1, 97.6) and 91.1% (72.0, 97.0), for vorasidenib 50 mg and TIBSOVO 500 mg, respectively, relative to untreated samples.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: November 25, 2019End of Document

In return, Kyowa Kirin will pay Ardelyx $10 mln ($5 mln a year for two years) to support the ongoing research. Following the end of the research period, Kyowa Kirin will have the option to license any candidates nominated by the companies for further development and commercialization in certain specified territories, with additional commitments payable to Ardelyx of up to $10.5 mln in upfronts and up to $500 mln in development and sales milestones. The research collaboration will be governed by a joint research committee. Additional terms were not disclosed.Under the second agreement, Kyowa Kirin has made a $20 mln equity investment in Ardelyx at $6.96 for 2,873,563 shares.Ardelyx and Kyowa Kirin initially established a collaboration partnership in November 2017 through a license agreement that provided Kyowa Kirin with exclusive rights to develop and commercialize Ardelyx's lead investigational product, tenapanor, for the treatment of cardiorenal diseases, including hyperphosphatemia, in Japan.18:08CCXI ChemoCentryx shares surge 300% to all-time highs on positive Phase 3 readout (8.06 +0.12)As covered earlier, the company and Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma announced positive topline data from the pivotal Phase III ADVOCATE trial of avacopan, an orally-administered selective complement 5a receptor inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (ANCA-associated vasculitis or ANCA vasculitis). This global study, in which a total of 331 patients with acute ANCA vasculitis were enrolled, met both of its primary endpoints, disease remission at 26 weeks and sustained remission at 52 weeks, as assessed by the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score, or BVAS.A full analysis of the data is underway and expanded results are expected to be announced in the coming weeks. The company said that it plans to make regulatory submissions for full marketing approval to both the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2020.In its 10-K issued earlier this year, the company cautioned that if approved for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic auto-antibody associated vasculi, Avacopan might compete with current treatments, such as steroids, CYC, RTX, azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate mofetil.Shares were most recently trading at $32 in extended trading, after earlier finishing the session at $8.06.C5a/vasculitis peer InflaRx (IFRX) +25% in after-hours in sympathy.17:04HRL Hormel Foods increases annual dividend 11% to $0.93/share (42.76 +0.45)Prama Bhatt, senior vice president, digital and eCommerce for Ulta Beauty, has been elected to the Hormel Foods Board of Directors, effective Nov. 25,17:01AIG American Intl to sell majority interest in Fortitude Re to Carlyle Group (CG) and T&D Holdings for approx. $1.8 bln (53.31 +0.01)American International, Carlyle Group, and T&D Holdings announced today that a newly created Carlyle-managed fund together with T&D have partnered to acquire from AIG a 76.6% ownership interest in Fortitude Group Holdings, whose group companies operate as Fortitude Re, for approx. $1.8 bln.

AIG will receive a $500 mln non-pro-rata distribution, which if not paid by the later of May 13, 2020 or transaction close will result in an additional payment from the new Carlyle-managed fund and T&D based on their Fortitude Re ownership interest.This transaction furthers AIG's and Carlyle's efforts to stand up Fortitude Re as an independent company and position it as a premier provider of retroactive reinsurance and legacy run-off management solutions for long-dated, complex risks to the global insurance industry. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2020.16:50HBI Hanesbrands announces process to appoint new CFO in connection with the departure of CFO Barry A.

The company's loss estimate is consistent with industry insured losses of approx. $11 bln and its expected market share of less than 1% for this catastrophe event.Due to the nature of this event, including the complexity of loss assessment and factors contributing to the losses, and the preliminary nature of the information available to prepare this estimate, the actual net ultimate loss for this event may differ materially from this current estimate. The additional complexity caused by the multiple catastrophic events that have occurred in Japan in recent months, together with the expectation of a relatively high proportion of flood related losses attributable to Typhoon Hagibis, are also likely to lead to increased uncertainty surrounding the estimated net ultimate loss for this event.16:28BDX Becton Dickinson increases quarterly cash dividend to $0.79/share from $0.77/share (253.86 +3.97)16:25PANW Palo Alto Networks beats by $0.02, reports revs in-line with billings above guidance; guides Q2 revs in-line; reaffirms FY20 revs guidance; increases billings slightly, guides down EPS, impacted by announced acquisition of Aporeto for $150 mln (250.28 +3.41)Reports Q1 (Oct) earnings of $1.05 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.03; revenues rose 17.7% year/year to $772 mln vs the $769.34 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Billings increase 18% $897.4 mln vs. $870-890 mln guidanceCo issues guidance for Q2, sees EPS of $1.11-1.13, including Aporeto acquisition cost, may not be comparable to $1.30 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q2 revs of $838-848 mln vs. $844.65 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; billings $985-1.0 bln.Co issues guidance for FY20, lowers EPS to $4.90-5.00 from $5.00-5.10, including Aporeto, may not be comparable to $5.07 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; reaffirms FY20 revs of $3.44-3.48 bln vs. $3.47 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; raises billings to $4.105-4.165 bln from $4.095-4.155 blnCo is acquiring Aporeto Inc., a machine identity-based microsegmentation company for $150 million in cash Aporeto identifies workloads and applies microsegmentation across all infrastructures, helping customers secure their applications at scale.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal. It should be noted that a separate report from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal before the 2020 election is unlikely to be reached did not have a noticeable effect on the market.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.4%), which typically outperforms when the prevailing view on trade is positive, led all sectors in gains amid strength in the semiconductor stocks. NVIDIA (NVDA 221.21, +10.32, +4.9%) was a notable gainer after the stock was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.4%.The health care (+1.1%) and consumer discretionary (+0.9%) sectors also rose more than the S&P 500, while the utilities sector (-0.4%) was today's lone sector to finish in negative territory.Two of today's M&A deals were ones that were already on the market's radar: Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.31, +1.11, +2.3%) agreed to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.78, +3.65, +7.6%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction, and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreed to acquire Tiffany & Co.

The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.32.

R&D, a Danish company founded in 2005, is a recognized leader in the design and manufacture of test systems that accurately simulate the extreme operating environments often encountered by large, rotating structures, such as wind turbines, and aircraft engine propulsion systems. R&D significantly expands MTS Test & Simulation's technology base and market presence for wind energy and aerospace markets globally; it provides compelling financial profile to enhance MTS revenue growth, margins, earnings, and free cash generation. The acquisition is expected to close by December 31, 2019.R&D is expected to contribute over $40 mln in incremental revenues in fiscal 2020 and to be accretive to Adjusted EBITDA margins for the Test & Simulation segment. R&D is further expected to be neutral to earnings in year one, exclusive of transaction costs. The acquisition is structured with an upfront payment of approx. $55 mln, which will be funded primarily through MTS' existing revolving credit facility, with expected earnout payments of up to an additional $25 mln based on financial performance through June 2021. Given the strong backlog position of MTS at the end of fiscal 2019, the solid backlog position of R&D, and the expected incremental Adjusted EBITDA generation, MTS expects rapid strengthening of its balance sheet following the closing of this acquisition, with a forecasted year-over-year net reduction in leverage by the end of fiscal 2020.16:14MTSC MTS Systems misses by $0.02, beats on revs; guides FY20 EPS below two analyst estimate, revs above two analyst estimate (60.56 +2.39)Reports Q4 (Sep) earnings of $0.37 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 worse than the two analyst estimate of $0.39; revenues rose 13.2% year/year to $224.08 mln vs the $218.07 mln two analyst estimate."As we enter our new fiscal year, we are excited about the resilience of our markets, our record year-end backlog, which topped $420 million, and the customer reception to our new product offerings.

Our family of computer vision products all contributed to the early revenue ramp and we shipped pre-production parts and development systems to more than 50 customers in the quarter."16:09CCXI ChemoCentryx and Vifor Fresenius Medical announce 'positive' topline data from pivotal Phase III ADVOCATE trial of avacopan (8.06 +0.12)This global study, in which a total of 331 patients with acute ANCA vasculitis were enrolled, met both of its primary endpoints, disease remission at 26 weeks and sustained remission at 52 weeks, as assessed by the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score, or BVAS. Remission was defined as a BVAS score of zero and being off glucocorticoid treatment for ANCA vasculitis for at least the preceding four weeks. The pre-specified primary endpoints were remission of acute vasculitis activity at week 26 and sustained remission at week 52, where avacopan therapy was at least statistically non-inferior to the currently used glucocorticoid-containing standard of care (glucocorticoid SOC). The two primary endpoints were tested sequentially using a gatekeeping procedure to preserve the Type I error.BVAS remission at week 26 was achieved in 72.3% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 70.1% of subjects in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (p<0.0001 for non-inferiority). Sustained remission at 52 weeks was observed in 65.7% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 54.9% in the glucocorticoid SOC control group, achieving both non-inferiority and superiority to glucocorticoid standard of care (p=0.0066 for superiority of avacopan). Importantly, subjects who received avacopan experienced additional benefits compared to those in the glucocorticoid SOC control group.The topline safety results revealed an acceptable safety profile in this serious and life-threatening disease, with fewer subjects having serious adverse events (SAEs) in the avacopan group than in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (42% vs. 45%, respectively). Most reported SAEs were related to underlying ANCA vasculitis disease and commensurate with rates in previously published ANCA vasculitis trials. There were fewer subjects with serious infections in the avacopan group than the glucocorticoid SOC control group. A full analysis of the data is underway and expanded results are expected to be announced in the coming weeks.16:08HPE Hewlett Packard Enterprise beats by $0.03, misses on revs; guides Q1 EPS in-line; reaffirms FY20 guidance (17.45 +0.33)Reports Q4 (Oct) earnings of $0.49 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.46; revenues fell 9.2% year/year to $7.21 bln vs the $7.41 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.GAAP gross margins of 33.2%, up 250 basis points from the prior-year period and Non-GAAP of 33.3%, up 260 basis points from the prior-year period.

ADVANCE evaluated the efficacy and safety of adjunctive pimavanserin treatment in patients with predominantly negative symptoms of schizophrenia who have achieved adequate control of positive symptoms with their existing antipsychotic treatment. No drug is approved by the FDA for the treatment of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.Pimavanserin demonstrated a statistically significant improvement on the study's primary endpoint, the change from baseline to week 26 on the Negative Symptom Assessment-16 (NSA-16) total score, compared to placebo (-10.4 vs. -8.5; p=0.043; effect size = 0.21). A greater improvement in the NSA-16 total score compared to placebo was observed in the 53.8% of patients (n=107) who received the highest pimavanserin dose of 34 mg (-11.6 vs. -8.5; unadjusted p=0.0065, effect size = 0.34). In this study, pimavanserin did not separate from placebo on the key secondary endpoint, the Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale.ACADIA plans to commence a second pivotal study with the 34 mg dose of pimavanserin in the first half of 2020. Additional results from the ADVANCE study will be presented at future scientific meetings.16:03GBT Global Blood Therapeutics confirms FDA accelerated approval for Oxbryta tablets for the treatment of sickle cell disease; expected to be available through GBT's specialty pharmacy partner network within two weeks (59.95 +3.81)As a condition of accelerated approval, GBT will continue to study Oxbryta in the HOPE-KIDS 2 Study, a post-approval confirmatory study using transcranial doppler (TCD) flow velocity to demonstrate a decrease in stroke risk in children 2 to 15 years of age.

That would be the information technology sector (+1.3%), which is the market's most heavily-weighted sector and the only sector up at least 1.0% in a session that has been governed with a risk-on bias.The catalysts for today's outperformance include:An encouraging press report that indicates China is going to increase penalties on intellectual property theft as a step toward trying to reach a Phase One trade agreement. The information technology sector often does well on days when trade optimism prevails given the sector's exposure to China and supply chains there.Strength in the semiconductor stocks, which have drafted off the trade news and a Morgan Stanley upgrade of NVIDIA (NVDA 220.44, +9.55, +4.5%).Performance chasing and an expectation that speculative trading action during this holiday-shortened week, which is often accompanied by low volume, will be concentrated in this hot sector.Notable movers:NVIDIA (NVDA 220.44, +9.55, +4.5%): upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley, which boosted its price target to $259 from $217.Intel (INTC 58.72, +1.11, +1.9%): benefiting from semi industry updraft, as well as news that a company Director bought 86,500 shares, worth ~$5 million, at prices ranging from $58.18-58.28.HP, Inc.

Treasury futures faced some overnight selling pressure while most global equity markets began the week on an upbeat note. The positive start was assisted by a Bloomberg report, which noted that the Chinese government will increase penalties for intellectual property infringement. That was viewed as a positive step toward reaching a partial trade deal with China, but the overall excitement was contained due to a Reuters report, which suggested that officials from China and the U.S. see a low likelihood of a "phase two" deal being negotiated in the near future. Treasuries followed their lower start with a swift rebound that lifted longer tenors into the green during the first hour of action. The market continued climbing into mid-morning trade with the long bond inching above its high from Friday. Today's $40 bln 2-yr Treasury note auction was met with solid demand, as the high yield stopped through the when-issued yield by 0.4 bps.

There is conference call scheduled for 9:00 ET. Q3 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $1.13 (-4% yr/yr) on revenue of $5.74 bln (+3.6% yr/yr). The Street is expecting Q3 comps of +2.6% vs 1.0% last year. The current consensus is within the company's guidance range of $1.07-1.16 for EPS, $5.66-5.77 bln for revenues, and comp increase of low single digits. The company is expected to guide for Q4 where Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.03 (+5% yr/yr) on revenue of $5.74 bln (-3.6% yr/yr). The Street is expecting Q4 comps of 1.8% vs 2.4% last year.Looking back, the company missed on EPS and revenues one time in the last four quarters. Last quarter, shares of DLTR fell 1% after it reported a miss on the bottom line and lowers its FY20 EPS guidance. The company cited increased costs as the guidance included the first three China tariff tranches, but the fourth 15% tranche was not included. The company reported same store sales for Dollar Tree and Family Dollar of +2.4%. As a percentage of sales, gross margin was 28.7% of sales compared to 30.1% of sales in the prior year.DLTR has a $26.6 bln valuation and trades at 19x 2021 EPS vs DG which trades at 21x EPS.Based on the DLTR Weekly Nov29 $112 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~4% in either direction by weekly expiration (Friday).On a positive report, look for resistance near the $116-117 area, while support sits near the $108-109 vicinity.13:43COMDX Metals Settlement PricesDec gold settled today's session down $6.60 (0.45%) at $1457/oz Dec silver settled today's session $0.11 lower (0.68%) at $16.885/oz Dec copper settled $0.00 lower (0.11%) at $2.645/lb13:39BBY Best Buy will report third quarter results tomorrow morning (74.37 +1.73)Best Buy (BBY) will report third quarter (October) results tomorrow morning and management will host a conference call at 8:00 a.m. ET.The nation's largest electronics retailer guided for third quarter non-GAAP EPS up 7-13% to $1.00-1.05 on revenue of $9.65-9.75 bln (consensus +1.2% to $9.7 bln) and comparable store sales up 0.5-1.5%. Target reported a decline in third quarter electronics sales last week. Upside for Best Buy could come from a stronger than expected iPhone cycle. The gaming cycle is expected to improve next year.Best Buy has reported positive comp sales for ten consecutive quarters, but comp sales missed estimates last quarter for the first time in two years. Second quarter comps sales grew 1.6%, toward the low end of its +1.5-2.5% guidance range, on top of 6.2% growth last year. Domestic comp sales grew 1.9%, as strength in appliances and headphones was partially offset by declines in gaming and home theater. Earnings beat estimates on cost reductions.Best Buy raised earnings guidance for the year but tweaked its sales outlook lower. The company raises fiscal 2020 (January) EPS to $5.60-5.75 from $5.45-5.65, but narrowed revenue to $43.1-43.6 bln from $42.9-43.9 bln and comp sales to +0.7-1.7% from +0.5-2.5%.A sales miss was not the way new Chief Executive and former Chief Financial/Strategic Transformation Officer Corie Barry wanted to start her tenure. Tariff uncertainty was a primary concern for investors. Some 60% of the company's cost of goods sold are exposed to China, but that number is expected to fall to 40% next year as vendors move production out of the country. Best Buy acknowledged the uncertainty regarding tariffs but said it is working on risk mitigation with partners and remained confident in the company's ability to continue executing its plan.In September, the company gave financial targets for fiscal 2025: Enterprise revenue of $50 billion and non-GAAP operating income margins of 5.0% vs. 4.6% or slightly higher this year with $1 bln of additional cost reductions and efficiencies.Best Buy remains one of the few 'winners' in the retail sector. Management continues to execute well in a difficult retail environment, but the stock has been consolidating in a wide range since breaking out to new highs in 2017. The stock trades at ~12.5x forward EPS estimates and just under 8x EV/EBITDA, a modest discount to a broad group of retailers despite a 2.8% dividend yield.13:16OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:AUPH Dec 9 calls (volume: 5270, open int: 80, implied vol: ~317%, prev day implied vol: 278%).

The Russell 2000 (+1.9%) outperforms, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) trails the pack.The Chinese government released a document stating intentions to better deter IP theft by increasing the penalties on violations, according to Bloomberg. The news is taking precedent over a Reuters report that suggested a Phase Two deal is unlikely to be completed before the presidential election next year.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.1%), which tends to outperform when trade sentiment is positive, is the lone sector up more than 1.0% today. Leading the group higher are the semiconductor stocks, especially NVIDIA (NVDA 219.64, +8.75, +4.2%) after it was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.1%.Following suit are the health care (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.8%), and industrials (+0.6%) sectors. The utilities (-0.2%), energy (-0.1%), and consumer staples (unch) sectors are the lone holdouts.As for M&A activity, some of today's announcements have already been on the market's radar like Charles Schwab (SCHW 48.76, +0.56, +1.2%) agreeing to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.19, +3.06, +6.3%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreeing to acquire Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.07, +7.56, +6.0%) for $16.2 billion in cash.The confirmed deals have still been supportive for risk sentiment, though, and the market has been treated with new deals in Novartis (NVS 91.23, +0.73, +0.8%) agreeing to acquire The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.86, +15.31, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash and eBay (EBAY 35.55, +0.42, +1.2%) reportedly being close to selling StubHub to Viagogo for $4 billion.U.S. Treasuries are little changed despite the solid gains being registered in the stock market.

The company guided for Q4 EPS between $1.15 and $1.29 and revenue between $1.44 bln and $1.46 bln when it reported its Q3 results on August 21. ADI's Q4 guidance was conservative relative to market expectations due to continued uncertainty related to restrictions on shipments of components to Huawei. This headwind is likely to persist since the U.S.-China trade dispute remains unresolved. Investors will be curious to hear what the company's management says about the ongoing 5G roll-out in China and the preparations for a broader build-out of the technology in the U.S. Comments about the state of the automotive market will also be of note. The stock was upgraded at Barclays, KeyBanc Capital Markets, and Raymond James since the release of Q3 results.Analog Devices trades at 20.8x forward earnings expectations, which represents a discount to Maxim Integrated (MXIM 56.28, +0.99, +1.8%) and Texas Instruments (TXN 118.98, +1.97, +1.7%), but a premium to NXP Semiconductors (NXPI 116.98, +1.76, +1.5%) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS 71.60, +2.03, +2.9%).12:13SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (101) outpacing new lows (11) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ACAD, ALLE, AMED, AMGN, AMP, AMWD, ANSS, AON, APPF, ARE, ARVN, ARWR, ATKR, ATRS, AXSM, BIO, BKE, BLD, BMI, BOH, BRMK, BURL, CACI, CATM, CG, CHH, CMTL, CNMD, CNNE, COLL, CPRT, CTXS, CVNA, D, DAR, DEA, DOCU, DOV, DRNA, DXCM, EPAM, EQH, ESE, EVER, FIVN, GAIN, GL, GMRE, GWRE, HALO, HLT, HNGR, HZNP, INCY, INFO, INSW, KNL, KRNY, KRYS, LBRDK, LITE, LULU, LXP, MDCO, MGLN, MMC, MSCI, NDSN, NMRK, NVRO, PAYC, PCAR, PCTY, PH, PLUG, PSN, QGEN, RE, RH, SAFE, SEM, SF, SKY, SNX, SO, SPLK, SPXC, SRCL, TDY, TECH, TGI, TIF, TNK, TYL, UI, USB, VCTR, VRTX, XPEL, ZBRA, ZYMEStocks that traded to 52 week lows: BXC, CBAY, CVTI, GMLP, GSM, GTT, LJPC, MUX, SMLP, ULTA, XOGThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: CABO, CRMT, FCNCA, MGIC, NWPX, POWL, WTBAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: ITRNETFs that traded to 52 week highs: BJK, EIS, FAN, IAI, IBB, IWF, IWM, IYF, IYG, IYH, KCE, MDY, OEF, PBD, QQQ, SPY, UYG, VTI, XLF, XLVETFs that traded to 52 week lows: VXX11:59SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- CymaBay Therapeutics (CBAY) sinks on halt of seladelpar development -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersCLVS (9.83 +13.51%): Advances to its highest levels since July on above average volume, now up circa +210% month-to-date.

Increased quarterly dividend to $0.12 from $0.1125/share (from October 23 Securities Analyst Meeting). On September 25 HPE completed its $1.4 billion acquisition of supercomputing company Cray.Over the next three years, the high performance computing (HPC) segment of the market and associated storage and services is expected to grow from approximately $28 billion in 2018 to approximately $35 billion in 2021.The acquisition is expected to be accretive to HPE non-GAAP operating profit and earnings in HPE's fiscal year 2020.HPE is arguably behind enterprise-level server peers Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), a point the company attempted to address with the acquisition of Cray. HPE also highlighted its as-a-service offerings at the October 23 Securities Analyst Meeting; as previously disclosed, HPE plans to offer its entire portfolio, including HPE Aruba Central, HPE BlueData, HPE Cloud Volumes, HPE InfoSight, and HPE OneView, as a service by 2022, a move the company anticipates will help drive sustainable profitable growth.HPE steps into the print with a roughly $23 billion market capitalization with a valuation of about 9.5x forward earnings estimates.11:30BONDX New SupplyTreasury Auction Preview$40 bln 2-year Treasury note auction (results at 13:00 ET) Prior auction results: High yield: 1.594% Bid-to-cover: 2.70 Indirect bid: 54.8% Direct bid: 14.0% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.128% Bid-to-cover: 2.58 Indirect bid: 48.6% Direct bid: 18.7%11:19NTR Nutrien to curtail production at Rocanville potash mine due to CN rail strike (47.10 +0.53)Nutrien announced that it will be forced to shut down production at its largest potash mine, Rocanville, due to the CN strike. Employee notices were sent out today indicating the mine will be shut down for 2 weeks starting on December 2."It is extremely disappointing that in a year when the agricultural sector has been severely impacted by poor weather and trade disputes, the CN strike will add further hardship to the Canadian agriculture industry," said Chuck Magro, Nutrien's President and CEO. "Any further disruption will be harmful to our business, the Canadian economy, and Canada's competitive position and reputation as a reliable supplier of fertilizer and food. However, most concerning is the impact on our hundreds of employees for whom this creates great uncertainty and hardship leading up to the holiday season."11:10SMH Industry Briefing: Chipmakers (133.43 +2.51)The PHLX Semiconductor Index (+2.1%) has gotten off to a strong start after underperforming last week. The high-beta group is now up 4.5% for the month versus a 3.0% month-to-date gain in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to the outperformance:Leadership from NVIDIA (NVDA 220.55, +9.66, +4.6%) after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to Overweight from Equal Weight and raised its price target to $259 from $217. Optimism about the viability of a partial trade deal with China after Chinese officials indicated that rules governing intellectual property rights will be strengthened.Notable movers:NVIDIA (NVDA 220.55, +9.66, +4.6%): rising to its highest level in more than a year after receiving an upgrade from Morgan Stanley. Applied Materials (AMAT 57.91, +1.97, +3.5%): showing relative strength after backing down from a fresh record high last week.

This news is overshadowing a separate Reuters report discussing why a Phase Two deal is unlikely to get done before the election.In any event, the Bloomberg report has helped catalyze a risk-on bias along with the news that Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.03, +0.83, +1.7%) is buying TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.45, +3.32, +6.9%) in a $26 billion stock deal, LVMH is acquiring Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.35, +7.84, +6.3%) in a $16.2 billion cash deal, and Novartis (NVS 90.94, +0.46, +0.5%) is acquiring The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.83, +15.28, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash.These deals have helped give an added lift to the financial (+0.6%), consumer discretionary (+0.9%), and healthcare (+0.7%) sectors, which are among today's leaders.The biggest gainer, however, is the information technology sector (1.2%). Such outperformance typically follows when the market is feeling good about trade developments, yet it is being bolstered further by a hot semiconductor group, which is drafting off a Morgan Stanley upgrade of NVIDIA (NVDA 220.40, +9.51, +4.5%) to Overweight from Equal Weight. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.2%.Strikingly, longer-dated Treasury securities are also up today, which means their yields are lower, indicating that not everyone is sharing the same risk-on, growth-oriented mindset as the stock market. The 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.76%.The Russell 2000 is up 1.7%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 1.2%; the S&P 500 is up 0.6%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.5%.10:17OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:CPRI Weekly Nov29 36;5 calls are seeing interest with 3660 contracts trading vs. open int of 20, pushing implied vol up around 9 points to ~37%.

Study LJ401-BT01 is a pivotal, multinational, multicenter, randomized, controlled study with a target enrollment of approximately 100 patients that is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LJPC-401 as a treatment for iron overload in beta thalassemia (BT) patients who, despite chelation therapy, have cardiac iron levels above normal. The primary endpoint of this study is the change in cardiac iron levels, as measured by cardiac T2* magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), from baseline to 6 months following treatment. The Company recently conducted an interim analysis that included approximately one-half of the target-enrolled patients. There were no significant differences in the primary endpoint or key secondary endpoints between patients on the treatment arm and patients on the control arm.Topline results of Study LJ401-HH01 are also now available. Topline results from this study are consistent with the interim results reported in June 2019. The change in TSAT from baseline to the end of treatment (16 weeks), the primary efficacy endpoint of the study, was statistically significant: LJPC-401-treated patients had a mean reduction in TSAT of 33% compared to placebo-treated patients who had a mean reduction of 3% (p<0.0001). The requirement for and frequency of phlebotomy procedures, a key secondary endpoint of the study, was statistically significant: LJPC-401-treated patients had 0.10 phlebotomies per month compared to placebo-treated patients who had 0.50 phlebotomies per month (p<0.0001). LJPC-401 was well tolerated. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were injection site reactions (ISRs), which occurred in 79% of LJPC-401-treated patients compared to 6% of placebo-treated patients. The ISRs were all mild or moderate in severity, and no ISRs resulted in treatment discontinuation.The company expects to re-evaluate its current operating plan in light of the mixed results of these studies and to make adjustments as appropriate to manage the company's available cash resources.08:31LJPC La Jolla Pharm President/CEO George Tidmarsh, M.D., Ph.D., leaves the company to pursue other interests (5.58 )A search for a new Chief Executive Officer has been initiated.

In particular, there continues to be uncertainty regarding Xerox's ability to raise the cash portion of the proposed consideration and concerns regarding the prudence of the resulting outsized debt burden on the value of the combined company's stock even if the financing were obtained. Consequently, your proposal does not constitute a basis for due diligence or negotiation.We believe it is important to emphasize that we are not dependent on a Xerox combination. We have great confidence in our strategy and the numerous opportunities available to HP to drive sustainable long-term value, including the deployment of our strong balance sheet for increased share repurchases of our significantly undervalued stock and for value-creating M&A. The HP Board of Directors is committed to serving the best interests of HP shareholders, not Xerox and its shareholders.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) edged above the S&P 500 (+0.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%), and Russell 2000 (+0.3%).The market heard from both President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, President Xi, on Friday. Mr. Xi called for mutual respect and equality in talks, but reiterated Beijing is willing to fight back if necessary. Mr. Trump said talks are moving along nicely and closing in on a deal, but the president suggested a deal should not be equal and should favor the U.S. instead.The takeaway was that the market still doesn't know for certain if a Phase One trade agreement will be signed this year, but talks are ongoing and appear to not be escalating. Separately, an upwardly revised reading in the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November was supportive for equities today.Leading the market in gains were the S&P 500 financials (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.7%), and industrials (+0.5%) sectors. The real estate (-0.5%) and energy (-0.4%) sectors were today's laggards.Nordstrom (JWN 37.95, +3.63, +10.6%) and Gap (GPS 16.94, +0.72, +4.4%) were among the biggest earnings-driven gainers in the consumer discretionary space, while an earnings-driven decline in Intuit (INTU 259.81, -11.34, -4.2%) put some pressure on the information technology sector (-0.1%).Elsewhere, the futuristic design of Tesla's (TSLA 333.04, -21.79, -6.1%) Cybertruck pickup was met with some confusion and mixed reviews. Ultimately, it appeared to be a sell-the-news case after the stock climbed about 40% in the past month.U.S. Treasuries ended the week on a flat note. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield was unchanged at 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.26. WTI crude declined 1.2%, or $0.70, to $57.88/bbl.Friday's economic data was limited to the revised reading for the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November:The final November reading for the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index checked in at 96.8 (Briefing.com consensus 94.9), which exceeded the preliminary estimate of 95.7 and the final October reading of 95.5. The November reading is in close proximity to the average level (97.0) since the start of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is the acknowledgment that consumers aren't anticipating sizable increases in inflation, unemployment, and interest rates, which suggests consumer spending activity should remain supportive for the U.S. economy.Investors will not receive any economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +28.4% YTDS&P 500 +24.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.5% YTDRussell 2000 +17.8% YTD16:12AGIO Agios Pharma presents new phamacodynamic and response data from both cohorts of perioperative study of vorasidenib and TIBSOVO (37.33 -0.85)Agios Pharma presented updated data from the ongoing perioperative study, confirming brain penetrance and robust biomarker suppression with treatment of single agent vorasidenib or TIBSOVO (ivosidenib) in low-grade glioma with an IDH1 mutation.As of the July 26, 2019 data cutoff, 49 patients were randomized before surgery, and 39 remain on treatment. The median (range) postoperative treatment duration for all doses was 5.42 (0.9-13.5) months for vorasidenib and 6.93 (1.0-13.2) months for TIBSOVO. Baseline characteristics were similar across the control and treated groups. Overall, 88% of patients had World Health Organization classified Grade 2 tumors. Less than a third of patients had prior radiation therapy and approximately half had prior systemic therapy.The safety analysis conducted for all 49 patients as of the data cut-off demonstrated that vorasidenib and TIBSOVO continue to have favorable safety profiles consistent with the Phase 1 data. 8.3% of patients in the vorasidenib group developed transaminase elevations, including one Grade 3 transaminase elevation at 50 mg daily which resolved with dose interruption. Grade 3 or higher events occurred in six (25.0%) vorasidenib patients and four (16.0%) TIBSOVO patients, with the majority related to postoperative complications. No patient discontinued treatment due to an AE.Data from the 42 efficacy evaluable patients (21 in the vorasidenib arm; 21 in the TIBSOVO arm) as of the data cut-off showed: among patients treated post-operatively with 50 mg vorasidenib, four patients (31%) achieved objective tumor responses (two achieved a partial response, defined as tumor shrinkage based on T2/FLAIR signal of at least 50%, and two achieved a minor response, defined as tumor shrinkage based on T2/FLAIR signal of at least 25% but less than 50%) according to the investigator by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology for low-grade glioma.Vorasidenib and TIBSOVO demonstrated brain penetrance, with mean brain:plasma ratios of 3.16 (vorasidenib 10 mg), 1.74 (vorasidenib 50 mg), 0.13 (TIBSOVO 250 mg), and 0.10 (TIBSOVO 500 mg). Mean percent reduction in 2-HG (95% CI) were 92.6% (76.1, 97.6) and 91.1% (72.0, 97.0), for vorasidenib 50 mg and TIBSOVO 500 mg, respectively, relative to untreated samples.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: November 26, 2019End of Document

Chairman Portman Issues Statement at Hearing on Securing U.S. Research Enterprise From China's Talent Recruitment PlansTargeted News ServiceNovember 21, 2019 Thursday 8:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1604 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee issued the following statement by Chairman Rob Portman, R-Ohio, at a hearing entitled "Securing the U.S. Research Enterprise from China's Talent Recruitment Plans":"Last night, Senator Carper and I released an investigative report detailing the threat of China's talent recruitment programs and what it poses to U.S.-funded research. This is, as some of you know, the Subcommittee's third investigation focusing on China issues. We exposed China's role in fueling the opioid crisis by shipping the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl into the United States using the U.S. Postal Service. Earlier this year, we detailed China's propaganda efforts through the Confucius Institutes on U.S. college campuses and high schools. Both of these investigations, by the way, have resulted in constructive, bipartisan legislative efforts to address the serious problems we identified. And we expect the same will happen with regard to the issue we're talking about today."This report follows an eight-month investigation into how the American taxpayer has, in effect, unwittingly funded research that has contributed to China's global rise over the past 20 years. Through talent recruitment programs, China has strategically and systematically acquired knowledge and intellectual property from researchers and scientists in both the public and private sector. Think artificial intelligence of 5G. America built the world's most successful research enterprise based on certain values, including collaboration, integrity, peer review, transparency, and improving the public good. The open and collaborative nature of research in America is one of the reasons we attract the best and brightest in the world. Some countries, however, have exploited America's openness to advance their own national interests. The most aggressive is China. For China, international scientific collaboration is not solely about advancing science for the global good, it is, by their own admission, about advancing China's national security and economic interests."They have been clear about it; China's stated goal is to be the world's leader in science and technology by 2050. To achieve its science and technology goals, China has implemented a whole-of-government campaign to recruit talent and foreign experts from around the world. China uses more than 200 talent recruitment programs to lure foreign-trained scientists, researchers, and entrepreneurs into providing China with technical know-how, expertise, and foreign technology."Our investigation focused on China's most prominent program called the Thousand Talents Plan. Launched in 2008, China designed the Thousand Talents Plan to recruit 2,000 high-quality overseas experts. By 2017, China dramatically exceeds its recruitment goal, recruiting more than 7,000 'high-end professionals.' Our report also details how the Chinese Communist Party controls and administers these talent recruitment programs. Thousand Talents Plan members typically receive a salary and funding for their research from Chinese institutions, such as Chinese universities or research institutions. In exchange for the salary and research funding, which sometimes include what's called a shadow lab in China, members sign legally binding contracts with the Chinese institutions that typically contain provisions that prevent the members from disclosing their participation in the program. This requirement, of course, runs counter to U.S. regulations that require grant recipients to disclose foreign funding sources. In effect, it incentivizes program members to lie on grant applications to U.S. grant-making agencies and to avoid disclosing their funding from Chinese institutions. China now wants to keep this quiet."Following increased public scrutiny, a year ago in October 2018, 10 years into the program, China scrubbed online references to the Thousand Talents Plan and deleted the names of the participating scientists and researchers. The names of participating scientists and researchers are no longer publicly available, and we do not reveal the names of individual members in this report, but in the interest of transparency, our report does includes examples of Chinese Thousand Talent Plan contracts and case examples of members engaging in illegal and unethical behavior. We thought it was important to publish this information so that the U.S. higher education community and federal government agencies see firsthand that these contracts and case examples contradict our own research values."These talent recruitment programs are a win-win for China; China wins twice. First, U.S. taxpayers are funding this research, not China. They don't have to pay for it. And second, China then uses that research it wouldn't otherwise have to advance its own economic and military interest. The Subcommittee reviewed the federal government's efforts to mitigate the threat posed by Chinese talent recruitment programs to the U.S. research enterprise. We found that the U.S. government was slow to recognize the threat and even today lacks a coordinated interagency strategy to secure U.S. research."First and foremost, federal law enforcement must recognize these threats and must inform the public. Despite China publicly announcing the Thousand Talents Plan in 2008, it was not until mid-2018, last year, that FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C. took control of the response to the threat posed by the Thousand Talents Plan. I do appreciate the FBI's candor in Mr. Brown's prepared statement for today's hearing where he says he wishes the FBI had 'taken more rapid and comprehensive action in the past.' And I told Mr. Brown that this morning. While I fully understand why there have been complexities in this case, I want you to know that we stand ready to work with the FBI to protect U.S. taxpayer-funded research."Second, despite spending more than $150 billion of taxpayer money per year funding research and development, our federal grant-making agencies - like the Department of Energy, NIH, National Science Foundation that we'll hear from today - lack a uniform and coordinated process to award, track, and monitor federal grant funds. That leaves our research dollars vulnerable. As an example, the Department of Energy's prominent role in advanced research and development make it particularly attractive to the Chinese government. The Department of Energy is the largest federal sponsor of research in the physical sciences. Most of this research occurs in our nation's National Labs. Through our investigation, we learned that Thousand Talents Plan members worked at National Labs on sensitive research and maintained security clearances. One Thousand Talents Plan member used intellectual property created during work in a National Lab and filed for a U.S. patent under the name of a Chinese company, effectively stealing the U.S. government-funded research and claiming it for the Chinese company. Another member downloaded more than 30,000 files from a National Lab without authorization right before this individual returned to China."Just last year, NIH, the National Institutes of Health, started reviewing its grants for connections to the Thousand Talents Plan. The NIH found instances of grant fraud by failing to disclose foreign funding and associations; theft of intellectual capital and property; and violations of the peer review process by sharing confidential grant applications, which is against NIH rules. The National Science Foundation has taken several, but yet insufficient, steps in its attempt to mitigate the risk of Chinese talent recruitment programs. In July 2019, just a few months ago, the NSF prohibited its employees from joining talent recruitment programs; but the policy does not apply to the more than 40,000 NSF-funded researchers who actually conduct the research and are the most likely to be members and targets of a talent recruitment program. And NSF doesn't any employees dedicated to grant oversight."Third, the State Department is on the front lines here due to its responsibilities to vet visa applications for visiting students and scholars. The State Department has a process to review visa applicants it believes may attempt to steal sensitive technologies or intellectual property, but it rarely denies visas under that process."Finally, U.S. universities and U.S.-based researchers must take responsibility in addressing this threat. If universities can vet employees for scientific rigor or allegations of plagiarism they also can vet for financial conflicts of interests and foreign sources of funding. These are complicated risks that the U.S. research community and the federal government must better understand. The threat to fundamental research is not always black and white--it's not always about legal or illegal."On a more positive note, starting earlier this year, the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy has hosted productive seminars and listening sessions with federal agencies and U.S. research institutions on how to respond to these threats. We look forward to working with the White House and the agencies to assist with appropriate legislation."I will be the first to acknowledge that our relationship with China is complicated. However, one thing is very simple: It is not in our national security interest to fund China's economic and military development with U.S. taxpayer dollars. I look forward to the hearing today and with that, I turn to Ranking Member Carper for his opening statement."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6935103 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 21, 2019End of Document

TikTok bans viral 'makeup tutorial' video about China's MuslimsStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeNovember 28, 2019 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 598 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyAziz has since been blocked from posting content on TikTok, though a spokesperson from the company told BBC News that it "does not moderate content due to political sensitivities".As NBC News reports, the Uyghur Muslim people, a local ethnic group, have been forced to endure surveilance and scrutiny by the Chinese government for years.TikTok subsequently blocked her phone from the social media platform but has now rescinded the ban, calling it a "confusion".On November 15, Ms Azis posted the video which triggered the ban of her previous TikTok account. But before she put the curlers down she spoke about the abuses being faced by Muslims in Chinese concentration camps.In another video in the series, she said: "Hey guys, you wanted a second video on how to get longer lashes, so here it is. I then realized that I should use this idea of disguising my video because it will reach out to more people without TikTok [finding] out that I am talking about China's corrupt government", she said. TikTok executives have denied the claims, but extensive research has shown that the Chinese censors don't necessarily always remove problematic content."I've been told to go marry a terrorist, go marry bin Laden, so I thought: 'Let me make a joke about this". She told Buzzfeed that it was an obvious instance of "dark humor".In October, a number of teenagers went viral for videos in which they danced along to their exes' abusive voicemails, exposing a particular kind of domestic emotional violence that affects approximately one third of teenagers in relationships.The clip by USA teen Feroza Aziz, who describes herself as "17 Just a Muslim", had millions of views across several social media platforms by Wednesday.Great Black Friday Gifts Under $500You can expect the deals to keep rolling on, but here are our top picks that cost between $100 and $250 and are available now. Black Friday is expected to rake in $7.5B and Cyber Monday is anticipated to bring in a record-setting $9.4 billion in sales.Feroza's video, which she posted to her TikTok account @getmefamouspartthree, has received hundreds of thousands of likes since she first posted it; when she woke up on Sunday, she realized it had started to spread to other platforms as well.By Wednesday evening, TikTok had reversed course: The company said it restored her ability to access her account on her personal device. "There's no outside mechanism of enforcement". In one video, she addressed a slur that she said she and other Muslims heard regularly: that they would marry bin Laden. The video ends with a visual punchline of Bin Laden's picture.TikTok's practices and its Chinese origins have raised alarms in Washington, where lawmakers and regulators fear Beijing's heavy digital hand might affect Americans' speech online and leave their personal data at risk. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, sought to grill top TikTok executives at a congressional hearing earlier this month, though the social-media app declined to appear, further stoking lawmakers' ire.TikTok's parent company ByteDance is headquartered in China.The Chinese-owned social media app earlier this month refused to send a representative to testify at a United States congressional hearing tasked with examining the tech industry's ties to the Chinese government.Aziz said she used the makeup routine as a way to get the attention of viewers who might otherwise ignore the news.Aziz, however, said late on Wednesday she isn't convinced."I think that TikTok should not ban content that doesn't harm anyone or shows anyone being harmed", Aziz said.Load-Date: November 28, 2019End of Document

SECURING THE U.S. RESEARCH ENTERPRISE FROM CHINA'S TALENT RECRUITMENT PLANSStates News ServiceNovember 19, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1409 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the FBI:Chairman Portman, Ranking Member Carper, members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today, and thank you for highlighting the national security and economic threat from Chinese talent plans.Time and time again, the Communist government of China has proven that it will use any means necessary to advance its interests at the expense of others, including the United States, and pursue its long-term goal of being the world's superpower by 2049.The Chinese government knows that economic strength and scientific innovation are the keys to global influence and military power, so Beijing aims to acquire our technologyoften in the early stages of developmentas well as our expertise, to erode our competitive advantage and supplant the United States as a global superpower. As part of this effort, China has been making extensive use of nontraditional collectors. These individuals are not spies in the traditional sense of intelligence officers, but they are nonetheless collecting information sought by the Chinese government.Among its many ways of collecting information, prioritized in national strategies such as the Five-Year Plan, the Chinese government oversees expert recruitment programs known as talent plans. Through these programs, the Chinese government offers lucrative financial and research benefits to recruit individuals working and studying outside of China who possess access to, or expertise in, high-priority research fields. These talent recruitment programs include not only the well-known Thousand Talents Plan but also more than 200 similar programs, all of which are overseen by the Chinese government and designed to support its goals, sometimes at U.S. taxpayers' expense.While mere participation in a talent plan is not illegal, investigations by the FBI and our partner agencies have revealed that participants are often incentivized to transfer to China the research they conduct in the United States, as well as other proprietary information to which they can gain access, and remain a significant threat to the United States. In some cases, this has resulted in violations of U.S. laws, including economic espionage, theft of trade secrets, and grant fraud.Talent plan participation can also violate conflict-of-interest policies put in place by American research institutions or federal grant agenciesparticularly if talent plan participants fail to disclose their sources of funding.In addition, many talent plan participants sign contracts outlining work that mirrors the research they perform at American institutions. These contracts subject participants to the broad laws of the Chinese government andironicallystrictly protect China's right to the patents and other intellectual property developed during work within the talent plan.It is also important to mention that last year, after we began some high-visibility arrests and prosecutions of talent plan members, the Chinese government responded by abruptly removing their public information about these programs and their participants. If these plans are as innocuous as they try to imply, why the shift to secrecy? By contrast, anyone can go online and search every grant awarded by the National Science Foundation, for example; the U.S. Government does not conceal our research funding because we have nothing to hide. The Chinese government's abrupt concealment is not just an admission of the ulterior motives of their talent plans; viewed more broadly, it is yet another illustration of China's lack of openness, fairness, and reciprocity, as contrasted with the behavior of free nations like the United States and our allies.I would also like to note that people of any ethnicity may be recruited to join talent plans, so I cannot overstate that ethnicity plays no role in our investigations. Instead, we follow facts and evidence wherever they lead. We have never asked any university, company, or other entity to profile people based on ethnicity, and we would be appalled if they did. As is true for all FBI programs, we investigate specific individuals when we have specific evidence that they are engaged in unlawful activity or pose a threat to national security.Nor do we have any intention of chilling academic freedom or curtailing international exchangequite the reverse. International collaboration plays a crucial role in the development of scientific breakthroughs throughout U.S. research institutions. The open and collaborative nature of the American academic environment produces advanced research and cutting-edge technology, but it also puts our universities at risk for exploitation by foreign adversaries looking to advance their own scientific, economic, and military development goals. Our goal is to preserve academic freedom and free enterprise by maintaining a fair, open environment and protecting campuses and companies from malign foreign actors.It is essential for the FBI to continue protecting American research from unfair exploitation while ensuring that our academic and business environments remains free and open. To advance that mission, we have developed strong partnerships with other federal agencies, some of whom sit beside me today, and we will continue working together to safeguard American research, technology, and ingenuity.As a sign of the importance we place on partnerships, since my arrival each of our 56 field offices has established a counterintelligence task force, which brings together the capabilities of participating agencies in that field office's area of responsibility. We support this through a centralized National Counterintelligence Task Force, which assists with matters such as budget and memoranda of understanding, as well as serving a coordination function in its own right.Engagement outside of government is another essential part of our work. Each of our 56 field offices has frequent, substantive engagement with universities and businesses in its area of responsibility, thereby allowing a customized exchange of information about cases, threats, and trends. This engagement by counterintelligence personnel is done in tandem with private sector coordinators, field office personnel whose full-time job is to develop and coordinate private-sector relationships across all programs.We also direct national-level engagement from FBI Headquarters; this takes many forms, so I will provide just a few examples. Since June 2018, the Counterintelligence Division has been partnering with the three largest university associations: the American Council on Education, the Association of American Universities, and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities. We have been doing this through a series of meetings and events coordinated by the FBI's Office of the Private Sector (OPS), which facilitates the FBI's private-sector engagement work across all programs. Since my arrival, within the Counterintelligence Division we have also created an Engagement Office, which works with OPS, field offices, and other components to strengthen engagement and promote messaging on key threats, including threats to U.S. innovation.The FBI previously also conducted university engagement through the National Security Higher Education Advisory Board (NSHEAB), a small subset of university presidents who periodically met at FBI Headquarters. Today, the FBI's Office of Private Sector continues to hold events for university presidents, including an annual academic summit that includes approximately three times as many universities as NSHEAB did. However, as I mentioned before, our greatest asset in this area is field offices' ongoing engagement with university officials at all levelspresidents, vice presidents for research, campus police, chief information officers, and otherssurpassing what could be done through NSHEAB in scope, specificity, and timeliness.That having been said, we always seek new ways to improve our effectiveness. With our present-day knowledge of the threat from Chinese talent plans, we wish we had taken more rapid and comprehensive action in the past, and the time to make up for that is now. We appreciate the conclusions in the report released yesterday by the subcommittee, including areas for improvement, so we will take action accordingly.Thank you for taking time to highlight the critical issue of Chinese talent plans, and I look forward to our discussion.Load-Date: November 19, 2019End of Document

THOUSANDS RALLY IN INDONESIA, MALAYSIA TO PROTEST CHINA'S TREATMENT OF UYGHURSStates News ServiceDecember 27, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1286 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Thousands of people took to the streets in Indonesia and Malaysia on Friday to protest against China's internment of nearly 2 million ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslims in camps in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), amid growing calls for action over their plight.The demonstrations took place as Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad vowed not to extradite Uyghurs who seek refuge in his country."The issues of oppression against Islam worldwide, including the Uyghurs, exist and must be acknowledged by all parties," Mahathir said, reiterating that his government would not interfere in China's internal affairs.He was replying to a parliamentary question on whether Malaysia would take in Uyghur refugees or send them to a third country."If Uyghurs are fleeing to Malaysia to seek asylum, Malaysia will not extradite them even if there is an application from China," he said, adding that his government would not interfere in China's internal affairs. "They are allowed to go to the third country because they have valid fears over their safety."After Friday prayers about 1,000 mostly Muslim protesters gathered in heavy rain outside the Chinese embassy in Jakarta, in the largest demonstration to date in the Southeast Asian country against Beijing's crackdown on Muslim minorities. Many of the protesters wore white Islamic garb and skull caps.They waved banners that read: "China, stop genocide of ethnic Uyghurs," "Shame on you China for depriving Uyghurs of their freedom," and "Over one million Uyghurs arbitrarily detained in China, Indonesia must speak out."Slamet Maarif led the large protest in the Indonesian capital."Under the pretext of fighting radicalism, Uyghur Muslims are denied the freedom of worship, economic, social and political rights as well as their culture and humanity," he told the crowd of demonstrators.Slamet urged the Chinese government to end human rights violations against the Uyghurs and open access to independent international investigators, while calling on Indonesians to show solidarity by boycotting Chinese-made goods."We call on the people of Indonesia, especially Muslims, to boycott Chinese products, withdraw all deposits from Chinese banks, and stop all forms of cooperation with China," he said, reading out the protesters' demands.Hundreds of demonstrators also gathered on Friday outside China's consulate-general in Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city."As fellow Muslims, we also feel sick here when our brothers are oppressed in Xinjiang," Djoko Satria, one of the protesters in Jakarta, told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Another demonstrator, Teti Irawati, urged the Indonesian government not to turn a blind eye to the plight of the Muslims in China.'The Indonesian government must not remain silent about the suffering there, because according to our constitution, occupation and oppression must be abolished," the 48-year-old woman told BenarNews.Smaller protests against China also occurred in Jakarta and Banda Aceh last week.The demonstrations came amid renewed attention to the issue in Indonesia after a U.S. newspaper reported about a "concerted campaign" by Beijing to convince Indonesian religious authorities and journalists that the Xinjiang camps were a "well-meaning effort" to provide job training and combat extremism.Views in Indonesia about the camps had changed after more than a dozen top Indonesian religious leaders visited the so-called re-education facilities, according to the report by the Wall Street Journal. Donations and other financial support from Beijing had also helped blunt criticism of its treatment of Uyghurs, the report said.Members of Hizbut Tahrir Malaysia rally outside China's embassy in Kuala Lumpur to condemn the detention of Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region, Dec. 27, 2019. BenarNewsHundreds rally in KLIn neighboring Malaysia, about 700 of members of various groups gathered in front of the Chinese embassy in Kuala Lumpur.In a joint memorandum, the groups, including Angkatan Belia Islam Malaysia (ABIM) and Hizbut Tahrir, urged Beijing to respect the rights of the Uyghurs."We demand the Chinese government to stop the extreme discrimination and ask them to close the camps in Xinjiang that are housing hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs that are oppressed by Beijing," ABIM's leader, Muhammad Faisal Abdul Aziz, told reporters.Embassy officials refused to meet protest representatives, who said they were hoping to hand over the document with their statements."We left the memorandum in the mailbox in front of the Chinese embassy for their further action. This is the second time our memorandum is left undelivered to any representative of the embassy," he said.The protesters also criticized the Malaysian government, with Hizbut Tahrir demanding stronger action against Beijing, including severing diplomatic ties.In September, Prime Minister Mahathir told BenarNews in an interview that China's economic and military strength may have prevented Muslim nations from criticizing Beijing's repression of the Uyghurs."[C]hina is a very powerful nation," he said at the time. "You don't just try and do something which would anyway fail, so it is better to find some other less violent ways not to antagonize China too much, because China is beneficial for us."On Dec. 24, however, the youth wing of Mahathir's Bersatu party urged his government "to take the initiative to mediate a solution to the ongoing religious suppression in China," as it called on Beijing to immediately cease "all oppressive actions upon the Uyghurs."Indonesia takes non-interference stanceMeanwhile on Dec. 23, President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo's chief of staff, former Gen. Moeldoko, said Indonesia would not interfere in China's internal affairs regarding the detention of Uyghurs."Each country has its own sovereignty to regulate its citizens," Moeldoko told reporters when asked why Indonesia was not more vocal about the Uyghur issue. "The Indonesian government won't interfere in the domestic affairs of China."He made the remarks days after meeting with Beijing's ambassador to Jakarta, Xiao Qian, who said afterward that allegations of rights abuses in Xinjiang were false. The Chinese envoy invited Indonesians to visit the province to see for themselves the situation in the autonomous region.China began locking up an estimated 1.8 million Uyghurs and other minority Muslims in a vast network of internment camps in April 2017 over accusations that members of these groups harbored "strong religious views" and "politically incorrect" ideas.Last week, Indonesia's two largest Muslim organizations Nahdlatul Ulama and Muhammadiyah also called on China to end human rights violations against the Uyghurs, in a departure from their previous muted stance.Human rights groups have accused Beijing of trying to erase the Uyghur culture, language and religious traditions. But Chinese officials have repeatedly denied those allegations, saying the "boarding schools" in Xinjiang provide vocational training for the Muslim minority.On Thursday, a leader of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), Indonesia's biggest Muslim group, compared the situation in Xinjiang to that in the easternmost province of Papua, where security forces fighting separatist insurgents have also faced accusations of human rights abuses."If we allow the conflict to drag on, not only China will suffer, but the entire region will be destabilized," NU leader Yahya Staquf was quoted by CNN Indonesia as telling a discussion in Jakarta."The same goes with Papua, a separation would be hugely destabilizing," he said.Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Load-Date: December 28, 2019End of Document

That would be the information technology sector (+1.3%), which is the market's most heavily-weighted sector and the only sector up at least 1.0% in a session that has been governed with a risk-on bias.The catalysts for today's outperformance include:An encouraging press report that indicates China is going to increase penalties on intellectual property theft as a step toward trying to reach a Phase One trade agreement. The information technology sector often does well on days when trade optimism prevails given the sector's exposure to China and supply chains there.Strength in the semiconductor stocks, which have drafted off the trade news and a Morgan Stanley upgrade of NVIDIA (NVDA 220.44, +9.55, +4.5%).Performance chasing and an expectation that speculative trading action during this holiday-shortened week, which is often accompanied by low volume, will be concentrated in this hot sector.Notable movers:NVIDIA (NVDA 220.44, +9.55, +4.5%): upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley, which boosted its price target to $259 from $217.Intel (INTC 58.72, +1.11, +1.9%): benefiting from semi industry updraft, as well as news that a company Director bought 86,500 shares, worth ~$5 million, at prices ranging from $58.18-58.28.HP, Inc.

Treasury futures faced some overnight selling pressure while most global equity markets began the week on an upbeat note. The positive start was assisted by a Bloomberg report, which noted that the Chinese government will increase penalties for intellectual property infringement. That was viewed as a positive step toward reaching a partial trade deal with China, but the overall excitement was contained due to a Reuters report, which suggested that officials from China and the U.S. see a low likelihood of a "phase two" deal being negotiated in the near future. Treasuries followed their lower start with a swift rebound that lifted longer tenors into the green during the first hour of action. The market continued climbing into mid-morning trade with the long bond inching above its high from Friday. Today's $40 bln 2-yr Treasury note auction was met with solid demand, as the high yield stopped through the when-issued yield by 0.4 bps. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.1% to 98.33, remaining above its 50-day moving average (98.22). Yield Check: 2-yr: -2 bps to 1.61% 3-yr: -2 bps to 1.60% 5-yr: -1 bp to 1.62% 10-yr: -1 bp to 1.76% 30-yr: -2 bps to 2.21%News: Japan's Ministry of Finance may reportedly increase its issuance of 40-yr JGBs while reducing the supply of 5-yr and 10-yr JGBs. The People's Bank of China released its financial stability report, noting that the country's economy is facing bigger downward pressures and is unable to eliminate potential risks in the near term. Japan's September Leading Index remained at 91.9 (expected 92.2). European Central Bank chief economist, Philip Lane, said that current ECB policy is positioned for an improvement in overall conditions over the next year or two, but cautioned that additional rate cuts shouldn't be ruled out. Fitch affirmed Portugal's BBB rating and Austria's AA+ rating. Germany's November ifo Business Climate Index rose to 95.0 from 94.7, as expected. November Current Assessment ticked up to 97.9 from 97.8, as expected while Business Expectations rose to 92.1 from 91.6 (expected 92.5). $40 bln 2-year Treasury note auction results (prior 12-auction average): High yield: 1.601% (2.128%) Bid-to-cover: 2.63 (2.58) Indirect bid: 47.8% (48.6%) Direct bid: 29.1% (18.7%) Commodities: WTI crude: +0.2% to $57.98/bbl Gold: -0.5% to $1457.00/ozt Copper: UNCH at $2.649/lb Currencies: EUR/USD: -0.1% to 1.1010 GBP/USD: +0.6% to 1.2901 USD/CNH: -0.1% to 7.0311 USD/JPY: +0.3% to 108.96 The Day Ahead: 8:30 ET: Advance October goods trade balance (prior -$70.40 bln), Advance October Retail Inventories (prior 0.3%), and Advance October Wholesale Inventories (prior -0.3%) 9:00 ET: September FHFA Housing Price Index (prior 0.2%) and September S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%; prior 2.0%) 10:00 ET: October New Home Sales (Briefing.com consensus 710,000; prior 701,000) and November Consumer Confidence (Briefing.com consensus 126.9; prior 125.9) Treasury Auctions: 13:00 ET: $41 bln 5-yr Treasury note auction results15:06PANW Palo Alto Networks will report first quarter results this afternoon (250.49 +3.62)Palo Alto Networks (PANW) will report fiscal 2020 first quarter (October) results this afternoon and host a call at 4:30 pm ET.

There is conference call scheduled for 9:00 ET. Q3 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $1.13 (-4% yr/yr) on revenue of $5.74 bln (+3.6% yr/yr). The Street is expecting Q3 comps of +2.6% vs 1.0% last year. The current consensus is within the company's guidance range of $1.07-1.16 for EPS, $5.66-5.77 bln for revenues, and comp increase of low single digits. The company is expected to guide for Q4 where Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.03 (+5% yr/yr) on revenue of $5.74 bln (-3.6% yr/yr). The Street is expecting Q4 comps of 1.8% vs 2.4% last year.Looking back, the company missed on EPS and revenues one time in the last four quarters. Last quarter, shares of DLTR fell 1% after it reported a miss on the bottom line and lowers its FY20 EPS guidance. The company cited increased costs as the guidance included the first three China tariff tranches, but the fourth 15% tranche was not included. The company reported same store sales for Dollar Tree and Family Dollar of +2.4%. As a percentage of sales, gross margin was 28.7% of sales compared to 30.1% of sales in the prior year.DLTR has a $26.6 bln valuation and trades at 19x 2021 EPS vs DG which trades at 21x EPS.Based on the DLTR Weekly Nov29 $112 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~4% in either direction by weekly expiration (Friday).On a positive report, look for resistance near the $116-117 area, while support sits near the $108-109 vicinity.13:43COMDX Metals Settlement PricesDec gold settled today's session down $6.60 (0.45%) at $1457/oz Dec silver settled today's session $0.11 lower (0.68%) at $16.885/oz Dec copper settled $0.00 lower (0.11%) at $2.645/lb13:39BBY Best Buy will report third quarter results tomorrow morning (74.37 +1.73)Best Buy (BBY) will report third quarter (October) results tomorrow morning and management will host a conference call at 8:00 a.m. ET.The nation's largest electronics retailer guided for third quarter non-GAAP EPS up 7-13% to $1.00-1.05 on revenue of $9.65-9.75 bln (consensus +1.2% to $9.7 bln) and comparable store sales up 0.5-1.5%. Target reported a decline in third quarter electronics sales last week. Upside for Best Buy could come from a stronger than expected iPhone cycle. The gaming cycle is expected to improve next year.Best Buy has reported positive comp sales for ten consecutive quarters, but comp sales missed estimates last quarter for the first time in two years. Second quarter comps sales grew 1.6%, toward the low end of its +1.5-2.5% guidance range, on top of 6.2% growth last year. Domestic comp sales grew 1.9%, as strength in appliances and headphones was partially offset by declines in gaming and home theater. Earnings beat estimates on cost reductions.Best Buy raised earnings guidance for the year but tweaked its sales outlook lower. The company raises fiscal 2020 (January) EPS to $5.60-5.75 from $5.45-5.65, but narrowed revenue to $43.1-43.6 bln from $42.9-43.9 bln and comp sales to +0.7-1.7% from +0.5-2.5%.A sales miss was not the way new Chief Executive and former Chief Financial/Strategic Transformation Officer Corie Barry wanted to start her tenure. Tariff uncertainty was a primary concern for investors. Some 60% of the company's cost of goods sold are exposed to China, but that number is expected to fall to 40% next year as vendors move production out of the country. Best Buy acknowledged the uncertainty regarding tariffs but said it is working on risk mitigation with partners and remained confident in the company's ability to continue executing its plan.In September, the company gave financial targets for fiscal 2025: Enterprise revenue of $50 billion and non-GAAP operating income margins of 5.0% vs. 4.6% or slightly higher this year with $1 bln of additional cost reductions and efficiencies.Best Buy remains one of the few 'winners' in the retail sector. Management continues to execute well in a difficult retail environment, but the stock has been consolidating in a wide range since breaking out to new highs in 2017. The stock trades at ~12.5x forward EPS estimates and just under 8x EV/EBITDA, a modest discount to a broad group of retailers despite a 2.8% dividend yield.13:16OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:AUPH Dec 9 calls (volume: 5270, open int: 80, implied vol: ~317%, prev day implied vol: 278%).

The Russell 2000 (+1.9%) outperforms, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) trails the pack.The Chinese government released a document stating intentions to better deter IP theft by increasing the penalties on violations, according to Bloomberg. The news is taking precedent over a Reuters report that suggested a Phase Two deal is unlikely to be completed before the presidential election next year.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.1%), which tends to outperform when trade sentiment is positive, is the lone sector up more than 1.0% today. Leading the group higher are the semiconductor stocks, especially NVIDIA (NVDA 219.64, +8.75, +4.2%) after it was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.1%.Following suit are the health care (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.8%), and industrials (+0.6%) sectors. The utilities (-0.2%), energy (-0.1%), and consumer staples (unch) sectors are the lone holdouts.As for M&A activity, some of today's announcements have already been on the market's radar like Charles Schwab (SCHW 48.76, +0.56, +1.2%) agreeing to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.19, +3.06, +6.3%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreeing to acquire Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.07, +7.56, +6.0%) for $16.2 billion in cash.The confirmed deals have still been supportive for risk sentiment, though, and the market has been treated with new deals in Novartis (NVS 91.23, +0.73, +0.8%) agreeing to acquire The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.86, +15.31, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash and eBay (EBAY 35.55, +0.42, +1.2%) reportedly being close to selling StubHub to Viagogo for $4 billion.U.S. Treasuries are little changed despite the solid gains being registered in the stock market.

The company guided for Q4 EPS between $1.15 and $1.29 and revenue between $1.44 bln and $1.46 bln when it reported its Q3 results on August 21. ADI's Q4 guidance was conservative relative to market expectations due to continued uncertainty related to restrictions on shipments of components to Huawei. This headwind is likely to persist since the U.S.-China trade dispute remains unresolved. Investors will be curious to hear what the company's management says about the ongoing 5G roll-out in China and the preparations for a broader build-out of the technology in the U.S. Comments about the state of the automotive market will also be of note. The stock was upgraded at Barclays, KeyBanc Capital Markets, and Raymond James since the release of Q3 results.Analog Devices trades at 20.8x forward earnings expectations, which represents a discount to Maxim Integrated (MXIM 56.28, +0.99, +1.8%) and Texas Instruments (TXN 118.98, +1.97, +1.7%), but a premium to NXP Semiconductors (NXPI 116.98, +1.76, +1.5%) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS 71.60, +2.03, +2.9%).12:13SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (101) outpacing new lows (11) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ACAD, ALLE, AMED, AMGN, AMP, AMWD, ANSS, AON, APPF, ARE, ARVN, ARWR, ATKR, ATRS, AXSM, BIO, BKE, BLD, BMI, BOH, BRMK, BURL, CACI, CATM, CG, CHH, CMTL, CNMD, CNNE, COLL, CPRT, CTXS, CVNA, D, DAR, DEA, DOCU, DOV, DRNA, DXCM, EPAM, EQH, ESE, EVER, FIVN, GAIN, GL, GMRE, GWRE, HALO, HLT, HNGR, HZNP, INCY, INFO, INSW, KNL, KRNY, KRYS, LBRDK, LITE, LULU, LXP, MDCO, MGLN, MMC, MSCI, NDSN, NMRK, NVRO, PAYC, PCAR, PCTY, PH, PLUG, PSN, QGEN, RE, RH, SAFE, SEM, SF, SKY, SNX, SO, SPLK, SPXC, SRCL, TDY, TECH, TGI, TIF, TNK, TYL, UI, USB, VCTR, VRTX, XPEL, ZBRA, ZYMEStocks that traded to 52 week lows: BXC, CBAY, CVTI, GMLP, GSM, GTT, LJPC, MUX, SMLP, ULTA, XOGThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: CABO, CRMT, FCNCA, MGIC, NWPX, POWL, WTBAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: ITRNETFs that traded to 52 week highs: BJK, EIS, FAN, IAI, IBB, IWF, IWM, IYF, IYG, IYH, KCE, MDY, OEF, PBD, QQQ, SPY, UYG, VTI, XLF, XLVETFs that traded to 52 week lows: VXX11:59SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- CymaBay Therapeutics (CBAY) sinks on halt of seladelpar development -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersCLVS (9.83 +13.51%): Advances to its highest levels since July on above average volume, now up circa +210% month-to-date.

Increased quarterly dividend to $0.12 from $0.1125/share (from October 23 Securities Analyst Meeting). On September 25 HPE completed its $1.4 billion acquisition of supercomputing company Cray.Over the next three years, the high performance computing (HPC) segment of the market and associated storage and services is expected to grow from approximately $28 billion in 2018 to approximately $35 billion in 2021.The acquisition is expected to be accretive to HPE non-GAAP operating profit and earnings in HPE's fiscal year 2020.HPE is arguably behind enterprise-level server peers Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), a point the company attempted to address with the acquisition of Cray. HPE also highlighted its as-a-service offerings at the October 23 Securities Analyst Meeting; as previously disclosed, HPE plans to offer its entire portfolio, including HPE Aruba Central, HPE BlueData, HPE Cloud Volumes, HPE InfoSight, and HPE OneView, as a service by 2022, a move the company anticipates will help drive sustainable profitable growth.HPE steps into the print with a roughly $23 billion market capitalization with a valuation of about 9.5x forward earnings estimates.11:30BONDX New SupplyTreasury Auction Preview$40 bln 2-year Treasury note auction (results at 13:00 ET) Prior auction results: High yield: 1.594% Bid-to-cover: 2.70 Indirect bid: 54.8% Direct bid: 14.0% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.128% Bid-to-cover: 2.58 Indirect bid: 48.6% Direct bid: 18.7%11:19NTR Nutrien to curtail production at Rocanville potash mine due to CN rail strike (47.10 +0.53)Nutrien announced that it will be forced to shut down production at its largest potash mine, Rocanville, due to the CN strike. Employee notices were sent out today indicating the mine will be shut down for 2 weeks starting on December 2."It is extremely disappointing that in a year when the agricultural sector has been severely impacted by poor weather and trade disputes, the CN strike will add further hardship to the Canadian agriculture industry," said Chuck Magro, Nutrien's President and CEO. "Any further disruption will be harmful to our business, the Canadian economy, and Canada's competitive position and reputation as a reliable supplier of fertilizer and food. However, most concerning is the impact on our hundreds of employees for whom this creates great uncertainty and hardship leading up to the holiday season."11:10SMH Industry Briefing: Chipmakers (133.43 +2.51)The PHLX Semiconductor Index (+2.1%) has gotten off to a strong start after underperforming last week. The high-beta group is now up 4.5% for the month versus a 3.0% month-to-date gain in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to the outperformance:Leadership from NVIDIA (NVDA 220.55, +9.66, +4.6%) after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to Overweight from Equal Weight and raised its price target to $259 from $217. Optimism about the viability of a partial trade deal with China after Chinese officials indicated that rules governing intellectual property rights will be strengthened.Notable movers:NVIDIA (NVDA 220.55, +9.66, +4.6%): rising to its highest level in more than a year after receiving an upgrade from Morgan Stanley. Applied Materials (AMAT 57.91, +1.97, +3.5%): showing relative strength after backing down from a fresh record high last week.

This news is overshadowing a separate Reuters report discussing why a Phase Two deal is unlikely to get done before the election.In any event, the Bloomberg report has helped catalyze a risk-on bias along with the news that Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.03, +0.83, +1.7%) is buying TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.45, +3.32, +6.9%) in a $26 billion stock deal, LVMH is acquiring Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.35, +7.84, +6.3%) in a $16.2 billion cash deal, and Novartis (NVS 90.94, +0.46, +0.5%) is acquiring The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.83, +15.28, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash.These deals have helped give an added lift to the financial (+0.6%), consumer discretionary (+0.9%), and healthcare (+0.7%) sectors, which are among today's leaders.The biggest gainer, however, is the information technology sector (1.2%). Such outperformance typically follows when the market is feeling good about trade developments, yet it is being bolstered further by a hot semiconductor group, which is drafting off a Morgan Stanley upgrade of NVIDIA (NVDA 220.40, +9.51, +4.5%) to Overweight from Equal Weight. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.2%.Strikingly, longer-dated Treasury securities are also up today, which means their yields are lower, indicating that not everyone is sharing the same risk-on, growth-oriented mindset as the stock market. The 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.76%.The Russell 2000 is up 1.7%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 1.2%; the S&P 500 is up 0.6%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.5%.10:17OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:CPRI Weekly Nov29 36;5 calls are seeing interest with 3660 contracts trading vs. open int of 20, pushing implied vol up around 9 points to ~37%.

Study LJ401-BT01 is a pivotal, multinational, multicenter, randomized, controlled study with a target enrollment of approximately 100 patients that is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LJPC-401 as a treatment for iron overload in beta thalassemia (BT) patients who, despite chelation therapy, have cardiac iron levels above normal. The primary endpoint of this study is the change in cardiac iron levels, as measured by cardiac T2* magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), from baseline to 6 months following treatment. The Company recently conducted an interim analysis that included approximately one-half of the target-enrolled patients. There were no significant differences in the primary endpoint or key secondary endpoints between patients on the treatment arm and patients on the control arm.Topline results of Study LJ401-HH01 are also now available. Topline results from this study are consistent with the interim results reported in June 2019. The change in TSAT from baseline to the end of treatment (16 weeks), the primary efficacy endpoint of the study, was statistically significant: LJPC-401-treated patients had a mean reduction in TSAT of 33% compared to placebo-treated patients who had a mean reduction of 3% (p<0.0001). The requirement for and frequency of phlebotomy procedures, a key secondary endpoint of the study, was statistically significant: LJPC-401-treated patients had 0.10 phlebotomies per month compared to placebo-treated patients who had 0.50 phlebotomies per month (p<0.0001). LJPC-401 was well tolerated. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were injection site reactions (ISRs), which occurred in 79% of LJPC-401-treated patients compared to 6% of placebo-treated patients. The ISRs were all mild or moderate in severity, and no ISRs resulted in treatment discontinuation.The company expects to re-evaluate its current operating plan in light of the mixed results of these studies and to make adjustments as appropriate to manage the company's available cash resources.08:31LJPC La Jolla Pharm President/CEO George Tidmarsh, M.D., Ph.D., leaves the company to pursue other interests (5.58 )A search for a new Chief Executive Officer has been initiated.

In particular, there continues to be uncertainty regarding Xerox's ability to raise the cash portion of the proposed consideration and concerns regarding the prudence of the resulting outsized debt burden on the value of the combined company's stock even if the financing were obtained. Consequently, your proposal does not constitute a basis for due diligence or negotiation.We believe it is important to emphasize that we are not dependent on a Xerox combination. We have great confidence in our strategy and the numerous opportunities available to HP to drive sustainable long-term value, including the deployment of our strong balance sheet for increased share repurchases of our significantly undervalued stock and for value-creating M&A. The HP Board of Directors is committed to serving the best interests of HP shareholders, not Xerox and its shareholders.

Economic data was light, but Germany's IFO survey showed a rise in Business Climate to 95.0, up from last month's reading of 94.6, and in-line with consensus.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: +10.010 yr Note: 1.78%USD/JPY: 108.85 +0.22EUR/USD: 1.1015 -0.0003Europe: FTSE +0.6% DAX +0.4% CAC +0.5%Asia: Hang Seng +1.5% Shanghai +0.7% Nikkei +0.8%Gold (1459.410 -4.50) Silver (16.87 -0.14) Crude (57.73 -0.04)16:21WRAPX This week's biggest % gainers/losersThe following are this week's top percentage gainers and losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).This week's top % gainers Healthcare: CLVS (8.66 +141.56%), COLL (19.35 +50.58%), SGRY (12.88 +48.39%), ATRS (4.89 +43.82%), DXCM (221.85 +41.04%), ATNX (16.08 +38.86%), EPZM (16.42 +38.57%), QGEN (41.6 +35.99%), EVH (10.5 +34.62%), MDCO (68.55 +32.28%), MRNA (20.69 +32.12%), TCMD (60.87 +31.3%), DRNA (22.5 +30.51%)Industrials: BE (6.25 +87.13%), AAXN (72.09 +37.26%)Information Technology: LASR (19.49 +38.23%)Financials: TRUP (33.79 +42.27%), LTS (3.47 +32.44%)This week's top % losers Healthcare: ANAB (12.02 -68.91%)Industrials: NVEE (47.62 -35.35%)Consumer Discretionary: MOD (7.41 -36.07%), FOSL (7.18 -34.9%)Information Technology: PLT (24.9 -38.64%), RBBN (2.81 -37.49%)Financials: QD (4.54 -36.24%)Energy: GLOG (9.34 -33.71%)16:17AEL American Equity Investment Life increases annual cash dividend to $0.30/share from $0.28/share (29.07 +0.12)16:17WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryThe stock market closed slightly higher on Friday in an uninspiring session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) edged above the S&P 500 (+0.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%), and Russell 2000 (+0.3%).The market heard from both President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, President Xi, on Friday. Mr. Xi called for mutual respect and equality in talks, but reiterated Beijing is willing to fight back if necessary. Mr. Trump said talks are moving along nicely and closing in on a deal, but the president suggested a deal should not be equal and should favor the U.S. instead.The takeaway was that the market still doesn't know for certain if a Phase One trade agreement will be signed this year, but talks are ongoing and appear to not be escalating. Separately, an upwardly revised reading in the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November was supportive for equities today.Leading the market in gains were the S&P 500 financials (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.7%), and industrials (+0.5%) sectors. The real estate (-0.5%) and energy (-0.4%) sectors were today's laggards.Nordstrom (JWN 37.95, +3.63, +10.6%) and Gap (GPS 16.94, +0.72, +4.4%) were among the biggest earnings-driven gainers in the consumer discretionary space, while an earnings-driven decline in Intuit (INTU 259.81, -11.34, -4.2%) put some pressure on the information technology sector (-0.1%).Elsewhere, the futuristic design of Tesla's (TSLA 333.04, -21.79, -6.1%) Cybertruck pickup was met with some confusion and mixed reviews. Ultimately, it appeared to be a sell-the-news case after the stock climbed about 40% in the past month.U.S. Treasuries ended the week on a flat note. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield was unchanged at 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.26. WTI crude declined 1.2%, or $0.70, to $57.88/bbl.Friday's economic data was limited to the revised reading for the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November:The final November reading for the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index checked in at 96.8 (Briefing.com consensus 94.9), which exceeded the preliminary estimate of 95.7 and the final October reading of 95.5. The November reading is in close proximity to the average level (97.0) since the start of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is the acknowledgment that consumers aren't anticipating sizable increases in inflation, unemployment, and interest rates, which suggests consumer spending activity should remain supportive for the U.S. economy.Investors will not receive any economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +28.4% YTDS&P 500 +24.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.5% YTDRussell 2000 +17.8% YTD16:12AGIO Agios Pharma presents new phamacodynamic and response data from both cohorts of perioperative study of vorasidenib and TIBSOVO (37.33 -0.85)Agios Pharma presented updated data from the ongoing perioperative study, confirming brain penetrance and robust biomarker suppression with treatment of single agent vorasidenib or TIBSOVO (ivosidenib) in low-grade glioma with an IDH1 mutation.As of the July 26, 2019 data cutoff, 49 patients were randomized before surgery, and 39 remain on treatment. The median (range) postoperative treatment duration for all doses was 5.42 (0.9-13.5) months for vorasidenib and 6.93 (1.0-13.2) months for TIBSOVO. Baseline characteristics were similar across the control and treated groups. Overall, 88% of patients had World Health Organization classified Grade 2 tumors. Less than a third of patients had prior radiation therapy and approximately half had prior systemic therapy.The safety analysis conducted for all 49 patients as of the data cut-off demonstrated that vorasidenib and TIBSOVO continue to have favorable safety profiles consistent with the Phase 1 data. 8.3% of patients in the vorasidenib group developed transaminase elevations, including one Grade 3 transaminase elevation at 50 mg daily which resolved with dose interruption. Grade 3 or higher events occurred in six (25.0%) vorasidenib patients and four (16.0%) TIBSOVO patients, with the majority related to postoperative complications. No patient discontinued treatment due to an AE.Data from the 42 efficacy evaluable patients (21 in the vorasidenib arm; 21 in the TIBSOVO arm) as of the data cut-off showed: among patients treated post-operatively with 50 mg vorasidenib, four patients (31%) achieved objective tumor responses (two achieved a partial response, defined as tumor shrinkage based on T2/FLAIR signal of at least 50%, and two achieved a minor response, defined as tumor shrinkage based on T2/FLAIR signal of at least 25% but less than 50%) according to the investigator by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology for low-grade glioma.Vorasidenib and TIBSOVO demonstrated brain penetrance, with mean brain:plasma ratios of 3.16 (vorasidenib 10 mg), 1.74 (vorasidenib 50 mg), 0.13 (TIBSOVO 250 mg), and 0.10 (TIBSOVO 500 mg). Mean percent reduction in 2-HG (95% CI) were 92.6% (76.1, 97.6) and 91.1% (72.0, 97.0), for vorasidenib 50 mg and TIBSOVO 500 mg, respectively, relative to untreated samples.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: November 25, 2019End of Document

STATEMENT BY CONSUL GENERAL DONG ZHIHUA AT THE 2019 AUSTRALIA-NEW ZEALAND AND CHINA INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS FORUM AND GALA DINNERStates News ServiceDecember 3, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1149 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:From Chinese Consulate General in Perth2019/12/03(1 December 2019, Perth Crown Towers)Hon Dean Nalder MLA, Shadow Treasurer; Shadow Minister for Finance; Energy,Mr. Sun Bo, Chairman of Shenzhen Yantian Port Group,Mr. WU Yue, President of the WA Shenzhen Association,Distinguished guests,Ladies and Gentlemen,First of all I would like to congratulate the organizers for the opening of the 2019 Australia-New Zealand and China International Business Forum, which brings together business people and representatives of the Chinese community not only from WA, but also across Australia and New Zealand. I would like to extend my warm welcome to those who have come afar especially delegations from China to beautiful Perth to attend this Forum.This Forum is initiated by the Australian and New Zealand Chinese community from Shenzhen, and will benefit from the presence of business delegations from China, including a delegation of Shenzhen Yatian Port Group. I assume that a high percentage of participants would either have business connections in Shenzhen or have visited Shenzhen before.Shenzhen is a pioneer and symbol of China's reform and opening up, an important stop of former leader Deng Xiaoping's famous South China tour in 1992 when he made important remarks that later became the guiding principle of China's reform and opening up. A former fishing village four decades ago when China started opening up, Shenzhen surpassed Hong Kong in terms of GDP in 2018 to become the largest economy among cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. Today Shenzhen is renowned for its strong innovation capabilities, home to more than 14,000 high-tech enterprises and technology giants, including Huawei and Tencent.In August this year, the Chinese government issued an official document entitled "Guidelines on supporting Shenzhen in building a pilot demonstration area of socialism with Chinese characteristics", which enhanced the role of Shenzhen as a "core engine" for the economic growth of the Greater Bay Area. With a population of 71.16 million people, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area had a total GDP of $1.6 trillion USD in 2018, the third-highest after the Tokyo bay area and New York metropolitan area.Under the guidelines, the central government will support Shenzhen in introducing a more open and convenient system for the attraction of overseas talent and allow foreigners who have obtained permanent residency in China to launch science and technology enterprises in Shenzhen.Meanwhile, Shenzhen will comprehensively improve its democracy and rule of law and expand people's participation in politics in an orderly manner under leadership of the Communist Party of China.Shenzhen can adopt a flexible interpretation of laws and regulations to serve its reform and innovation practices, for example, by establishing pilot programs to promote RMB's internationalization and innovation for financial regulation.Shenzhen will also vigorously develop new industries including the intelligent economy and the health care industry, and support the research on digital currency and the application of innovations such as mobile payment.Shenzhen will also continue to open up to Hong Kong and Macao, and explore the model of collaborative development to facilitate the efficient flow of personnel, capital, technology and information.Overall, the guidelines will help better develop the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and enrich the practice of the "one country, two systems" principle. It is also conducive to the implementation of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area plan and the fulfillment of the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation.By 2025, Shenzhen will become one of the leading cities in the world in terms of economic strength and quality of development. Its research and development input, industrial innovation capacity, and the quality of public services and ecological environment will be first-rate in the world.By 2035, Shenzhen will become a national model of high-quality development and a globally recognized center of innovation and entrepreneurship. It will become an example for China to build itself into a powerful modern socialist country.By mid-21st century, Shenzhen will become a global benchmark city in competitiveness, innovation and outstanding influence.I therefore hope that the Forum will promote Australia and New Zealand's trade and investment with the Greater Bay Area with Shenzhen at the core, building networks for small and medium sized enterprises to benefit from the new favorable policies towards Shenzhen and maximize the opportunity provided by China's latest measures of reform and opening up.Distinguished guests, ladies and Gentlemen,Last month, the 4th session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) made a historical decision on major issues related to upholding and improving the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics and advancing the modernization of China's system and capacity for governance. It summarized the notable strengths of China's state and governance systems in 13 aspects and called for efforts to better turn institutional strength into effective governance.The two miracles, namely rapid economic development and long-term social stability in the past 70 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, could not have been possible without the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics.We are confident that this system will push for the continuous progress towards the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and by next year we will reach the first centenary goal, namely building a moderately well-off society is all aspects by 2020, when the Chinese Communist Party celebrates its one hundredth anniversary since establishment.I hope you will all visit China more often and see with your own eyes and make a fair judgment on China's social system as well as path of development. And Shenzhen is the best place to go. Shenzhen is a showcase of China's economic and social miracle during the past 40 years' of reform and opening up. And Shenzhen represents the future of modern socialist China, as it continues to stand at the forefront of China's reform and opening up.In China, Shenzhen embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, with the courage to be the first to eat the crab in the unprecedented course of China's reform. I am sure that during the discussions of this Forum, many of you will have stories to tell about Shenzhen and the tremendous opportunities it offers. I wish the Australia-New Zealand and China International Business Forum a great success. I wish you all enjoy the summer of Perth and make new friends, explore new opportunities and launch new projects.I thank you all.Load-Date: December 8, 2019End of Document

Girls' Clothing Market Trends In China: China's Demand For Girls' Clothing will Continue to Grow at 8% by 2028 - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireDecember 10, 2019 Tuesday 10:20 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 615 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Girls' Clothing Market Trends in China" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.This study focuses on China's Girls' Clothing market trends. In the two past decades, the market has been growing at a fast pace. The dramatic expansions of the manufacturing capabilities and rising consumer consumptions in China have transformed China's society and economy. China is one of the world's major producers for industrial and consumer products. Far outpacing other economies in the world, China is the world's fastest growing market for the consumptions of goods and services. The Chinese economy maintains a high speed growth which has been stimulated by the consecutive increases of industrial output, imports & exports, consumer consumption and capital investment for over two decades. Rapid consolidation between medium and large players is anticipated since the Chinese government has been encouraging industry consolidation with an effort to regulate the industry and to improve competitiveness in the world market.Although China has enjoyed the benefits of an expanding market for production and distribution, the industry is suffering from minimal innovation and investment in R&D and new product development. The sector's economies of scale have yet to be achieved. Most domestic manufacturers lack the autonomic intellectual property and financial resources to develop their own brand name products.This new study focuses on market trends and forecasts with historical data (2008, 2013 and 2018) and long-term forecasts through 2023 and 2028 are presented.The primary and secondary research is done in China in order to access up-to-date government regulations, market information and industry data. Data were collected from the Chinese government publications, Chinese language newspapers and magazines, industry associations, local governments' industry bureaus, industry publications, and in-house databases.The author is one of the leading sources for up-to-date market information and research on the fastest-growing Chinese markets. They have published over 2,000 reports focusing on the Chinese markets, industry forecasts and company profiles. The report provides hard-to-find market data and analyses.

Briefing.com: Hourly In Play (R) - 13:00 ETBriefing.comNovember 25, 2019 Monday 1:05 PM ESTCopyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc. All rights reserved.This content is provided to LexisNexis by Comtex News Network, Inc.Length: 15098 wordsBodyHourly In Play (R)Updated: 25-Nov-19 13:00 ET12:58WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Trade progress, M&A activity help S&P 500, Nasdaq hit new highsThe S&P 500 (+0.6%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.2%) have set new all-time highs today following reported progress in a Phase One trade deal and a healthy dose of M&A activity. The Russell 2000 (+1.9%) outperforms, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) trails the pack.The Chinese government released a document stating intentions to better deter IP theft by increasing the penalties on violations, according to Bloomberg. The news is taking precedent over a Reuters report that suggested a Phase Two deal is unlikely to be completed before the presidential election next year.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.1%), which tends to outperform when trade sentiment is positive, is the lone sector up more than 1.0% today. Leading the group higher are the semiconductor stocks, especially NVIDIA (NVDA 219.64, +8.75, +4.2%) after it was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.1%.Following suit are the health care (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.8%), and industrials (+0.6%) sectors. The utilities (-0.2%), energy (-0.1%), and consumer staples (unch) sectors are the lone holdouts.As for M&A activity, some of today's announcements have already been on the market's radar like Charles Schwab (SCHW 48.76, +0.56, +1.2%) agreeing to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.19, +3.06, +6.3%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreeing to acquire Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.07, +7.56, +6.0%) for $16.2 billion in cash.The confirmed deals have still been supportive for risk sentiment, though, and the market has been treated with new deals in Novartis (NVS 91.23, +0.73, +0.8%) agreeing to acquire The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.86, +15.31, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash and eBay (EBAY 35.55, +0.42, +1.2%) reportedly being close to selling StubHub to Viagogo for $4 billion.U.S. Treasuries are little changed despite the solid gains being registered in the stock market. The benchmark 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.34.Investors did not receive any notable economic data today.12:20ADI Analog Devices to report tomorrow (112.67 +2.02)Analog Devices (ADI 112.67, +2.02, +1.8%) will report its Q4 results ahead of tomorrow's opening bell, followed by management's conference call at 10:00 ET.The Capital IQ consensus expects the manufacturer of signal converters, processors, and power management products to report a 21.3% yr/yr decrease in EPS to $1.22 on a 9.0% yr/yr drop in revenue to $1.45 bln. The company guided for Q4 EPS between $1.15 and $1.29 and revenue between $1.44 bln and $1.46 bln when it reported its Q3 results on August 21. ADI's Q4 guidance was conservative relative to market expectations due to continued uncertainty related to restrictions on shipments of components to Huawei. This headwind is likely to persist since the U.S.-China trade dispute remains unresolved. Investors will be curious to hear what the company's management says about the ongoing 5G roll-out in China and the preparations for a broader build-out of the technology in the U.S. Comments about the state of the automotive market will also be of note. The stock was upgraded at Barclays, KeyBanc Capital Markets, and Raymond James since the release of Q3 results.Analog Devices trades at 20.8x forward earnings expectations, which represents a discount to Maxim Integrated (MXIM 56.28, +0.99, +1.8%) and Texas Instruments (TXN 118.98, +1.97, +1.7%), but a premium to NXP Semiconductors (NXPI 116.98, +1.76, +1.5%) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS 71.60, +2.03, +2.9%).12:13SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (101) outpacing new lows (11) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ACAD, ALLE, AMED, AMGN, AMP, AMWD, ANSS, AON, APPF, ARE, ARVN, ARWR, ATKR, ATRS, AXSM, BIO, BKE, BLD, BMI, BOH, BRMK, BURL, CACI, CATM, CG, CHH, CMTL, CNMD, CNNE, COLL, CPRT, CTXS, CVNA, D, DAR, DEA, DOCU, DOV, DRNA, DXCM, EPAM, EQH, ESE, EVER, FIVN, GAIN, GL, GMRE, GWRE, HALO, HLT, HNGR, HZNP, INCY, INFO, INSW, KNL, KRNY, KRYS, LBRDK, LITE, LULU, LXP, MDCO, MGLN, MMC, MSCI, NDSN, NMRK, NVRO, PAYC, PCAR, PCTY, PH, PLUG, PSN, QGEN, RE, RH, SAFE, SEM, SF, SKY, SNX, SO, SPLK, SPXC, SRCL, TDY, TECH, TGI, TIF, TNK, TYL, UI, USB, VCTR, VRTX, XPEL, ZBRA, ZYMEStocks that traded to 52 week lows: BXC, CBAY, CVTI, GMLP, GSM, GTT, LJPC, MUX, SMLP, ULTA, XOGThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: CABO, CRMT, FCNCA, MGIC, NWPX, POWL, WTBAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: ITRNETFs that traded to 52 week highs: BJK, EIS, FAN, IAI, IBB, IWF, IWM, IYF, IYG, IYH, KCE, MDY, OEF, PBD, QQQ, SPY, UYG, VTI, XLF, XLVETFs that traded to 52 week lows: VXX11:59SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- CymaBay Therapeutics (CBAY) sinks on halt of seladelpar development -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersCLVS (9.83 +13.51%): Advances to its highest levels since July on above average volume, now up circa +210% month-to-date. The stock moved higher on merger and acquisition speculation toward the end of last week.INMD (47.02 +13.16%): Sees continued volatility; the stock set new all-time highs last Monday and subsequently netted a drop of circa 29% vs those highs during the rest of the week.BCRX (2.53 +12.44%): The stock continues to improve after touching down to new six-year lows in mid-November, a move that followed co's announcement of a common stock offering; the stock has since gained circa +83% relative to those lows.Small Cap LosersCBAY (1.32 -76.31%): Announced that it is terminating its Phase 2b study of seladelpar in NASH subjects as well as its recently initiated Phase 2 study of seladelpar in subjects with primary sclerosing cholangitis and that it is putting all studies of seladelpar in subjects with primary biliary cholangitis on hold, based on initial histological findings observed in the Phase 2b NASH study. Assessments of the first tranche of liver biopsies revealed atypical histological findings, including histology characterized as an interface hepatitis presentation, with or without biliary injury. Co is "very disappointed" in these developmental halts but notes that "patient safety and care is paramount." Downgraded at Stifel, SunTrust, and Evercore ISI. At three-year lows.I (6.6 -7.17%): Continued volatility in the wake of recent modifications to prospective C-band auction conditions. Barron's issued a cautious view on co over the weekend.FNKO (13.94 -6.51%): Price target lowered to $24 from $30 at Piper Jaffray. BMO Capital Markets also commented in a note today that it has observed a slow start to Q4 retail toy industry sales, and it thus sees increased risk to the downside for co and various peers.11:45NOK Nokia announces discontinuation of COO role; current COO Joerg Erlemeier will leave the company, effective January 1 (3.46 +0.03)Nokia announced today that it would discontinue the Chief Operating Officer role and distribute its various functions to other Nokia leaders. As a result, the current COO, Joerg Erlemeier, has decided to step down from the company's Group Leadership Team and leave the company as of January 1, 2020, after 25 years at Nokia.11:35HPE Hewlett Packard Enterprise Q4 Earnings Preview (17.30 +0.18)Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) will report fourth quarter results tonight after the bell with a conference call which will begin at 5 p.m. ET.As it stands, the current Capital IQ Consensus Estimate calls for Q4 EPS of $0.46 (vs $0.45 a year ago) on sales declines of 6.7% to $7.41 billion.Guidance (FY20 outlook from October 23 Securities Analyst Meeting):Sees Q4 EPS of $0.43-0.47.Sees FY20 EPS $1.78-$1.94, up 7% year-over-year at the mid-point (from October 23 Securities Analyst Meeting).Expects FY20 FCF of $1.9-2.1 billion (from October 23 Securities Analyst Meeting).HPE also provided its long-term financial model for FY19-FY22 at the October 23 Securities Analyst Meeting. The company expects compounded annual revenue growth rate of 1-3% adjusted for currency driven by Edge, Storage, High Performance Compute & Mission Critical Systems and related services. Increased quarterly dividend to $0.12 from $0.1125/share (from October 23 Securities Analyst Meeting). On September 25 HPE completed its $1.4 billion acquisition of supercomputing company Cray.Over the next three years, the high performance computing (HPC) segment of the market and associated storage and services is expected to grow from approximately $28 billion in 2018 to approximately $35 billion in 2021.The acquisition is expected to be accretive to HPE non-GAAP operating profit and earnings in HPE's fiscal year 2020.HPE is arguably behind enterprise-level server peers Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), a point the company attempted to address with the acquisition of Cray. HPE also highlighted its as-a-service offerings at the October 23 Securities Analyst Meeting; as previously disclosed, HPE plans to offer its entire portfolio, including HPE Aruba Central, HPE BlueData, HPE Cloud Volumes, HPE InfoSight, and HPE OneView, as a service by 2022, a move the company anticipates will help drive sustainable profitable growth.HPE steps into the print with a roughly $23 billion market capitalization with a valuation of about 9.5x forward earnings estimates.11:30BONDX New SupplyTreasury Auction Preview$40 bln 2-year Treasury note auction (results at 13:00 ET) Prior auction results: High yield: 1.594% Bid-to-cover: 2.70 Indirect bid: 54.8% Direct bid: 14.0% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.128% Bid-to-cover: 2.58 Indirect bid: 48.6% Direct bid: 18.7%11:19NTR Nutrien to curtail production at Rocanville potash mine due to CN rail strike (47.10 +0.53)Nutrien announced that it will be forced to shut down production at its largest potash mine, Rocanville, due to the CN strike. Employee notices were sent out today indicating the mine will be shut down for 2 weeks starting on December 2."It is extremely disappointing that in a year when the agricultural sector has been severely impacted by poor weather and trade disputes, the CN strike will add further hardship to the Canadian agriculture industry," said Chuck Magro, Nutrien's President and CEO. "Any further disruption will be harmful to our business, the Canadian economy, and Canada's competitive position and reputation as a reliable supplier of fertilizer and food. However, most concerning is the impact on our hundreds of employees for whom this creates great uncertainty and hardship leading up to the holiday season."11:10SMH Industry Briefing: Chipmakers (133.43 +2.51)The PHLX Semiconductor Index (+2.1%) has gotten off to a strong start after underperforming last week.

This news is overshadowing a separate Reuters report discussing why a Phase Two deal is unlikely to get done before the election.In any event, the Bloomberg report has helped catalyze a risk-on bias along with the news that Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.03, +0.83, +1.7%) is buying TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.45, +3.32, +6.9%) in a $26 billion stock deal, LVMH is acquiring Tiffany & Co.

Such outperformance typically follows when the market is feeling good about trade developments, yet it is being bolstered further by a hot semiconductor group, which is drafting off a Morgan Stanley upgrade of NVIDIA (NVDA 220.40, +9.51, +4.5%) to Overweight from Equal Weight. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.2%.Strikingly, longer-dated Treasury securities are also up today, which means their yields are lower, indicating that not everyone is sharing the same risk-on, growth-oriented mindset as the stock market. The 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.76%.The Russell 2000 is up 1.7%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 1.2%; the S&P 500 is up 0.6%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.5%.10:17OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:CPRI Weekly Nov29 36;5 calls are seeing interest with 3660 contracts trading vs. open int of 20, pushing implied vol up around 9 points to ~37%.

Study LJ401-BT01 is a pivotal, multinational, multicenter, randomized, controlled study with a target enrollment of approximately 100 patients that is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LJPC-401 as a treatment for iron overload in beta thalassemia (BT) patients who, despite chelation therapy, have cardiac iron levels above normal. The primary endpoint of this study is the change in cardiac iron levels, as measured by cardiac T2* magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), from baseline to 6 months following treatment. The Company recently conducted an interim analysis that included approximately one-half of the target-enrolled patients. There were no significant differences in the primary endpoint or key secondary endpoints between patients on the treatment arm and patients on the control arm.Topline results of Study LJ401-HH01 are also now available. Topline results from this study are consistent with the interim results reported in June 2019. The change in TSAT from baseline to the end of treatment (16 weeks), the primary efficacy endpoint of the study, was statistically significant: LJPC-401-treated patients had a mean reduction in TSAT of 33% compared to placebo-treated patients who had a mean reduction of 3% (p<0.0001). The requirement for and frequency of phlebotomy procedures, a key secondary endpoint of the study, was statistically significant: LJPC-401-treated patients had 0.10 phlebotomies per month compared to placebo-treated patients who had 0.50 phlebotomies per month (p<0.0001). LJPC-401 was well tolerated. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were injection site reactions (ISRs), which occurred in 79% of LJPC-401-treated patients compared to 6% of placebo-treated patients. The ISRs were all mild or moderate in severity, and no ISRs resulted in treatment discontinuation.The company expects to re-evaluate its current operating plan in light of the mixed results of these studies and to make adjustments as appropriate to manage the company's available cash resources.08:31LJPC La Jolla Pharm President/CEO George Tidmarsh, M.D., Ph.D., leaves the company to pursue other interests (5.58 )A search for a new Chief Executive Officer has been initiated.

Results included:As of data cutoff, seven patients (46.7%) with G/GEJ adenocarcinoma achieved a confirmed partial response (PR), and the objective response rate (ORR) (consisting of the aggregate of complete responses and PRs) in this cohort was 46.7%. In the cohort of patients with ESCC, seven patients (46.7%) achieved a confirmed PR, and the ORR in this cohort was 46.7%.Median duration of response (DoR) was not mature in the G/GEJ adenocarcinoma cohort; median DoR was estimated as 12.8 months in the ESCC cohort.Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.1 months and 10.4 months in the G/GEJ adenocarcinoma and ESCC cohorts, respectively.Despite the long median follow up in both the G/GEJ adenocarcinoma cohort (15.4 months) and ESCC cohort (13.0 months), median overall survival (OS) had not been reached; in the G/GEJ adenocarcinoma cohort, the OS rate was 85% at six months and 62% at 12 months; in the ESCC cohort, the OS rate was 71% at six months and 50% at 12 months.Treatment with tislelizumab in combination with the standard first-line chemotherapy was generally well tolerated in patients with G/GEJ adenocarcinoma and ESCC.Adverse events (AEs) reported were consistent with the known tolerability profile of PD-1 inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy.06:17PTCT PTC Therapeutics announces that the FDA has granted priority review for the New Drug Application for risdiplam for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (43.62 )The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date for a decision by the FDA is May 24, 2020.

Results show after more than two years of follow-up, ALUNBRIG reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 76% (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.12--0.45) as assessed by investigators in newly diagnosed patients whose disease had spread to the brain at time of enrollment. ALUNBRIG also demonstrated a 57% (HR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.31--0.61) reduction in risk of disease progression or death in all patients. Results from the ALTA-1L trial were evaluated by two separate review bodies -- study investigators and a blinded independent review committee (BIRC) -- and results from both assessments were reported. At the data cutoff for the second interim analysis (June 28, 2019), the BIRC-assessed HR of progression-free survival (PFS), which is the primary endpoint, was 0.49 (95% CI: 0.35--0.68, log-rank P<0.0001), demonstrating a reduced risk of disease progression or death by 51%.06:12CB Chubb to purchase additional 15.3% of Huatai Insurance Group Company Limited (151.13 )Upon completion of the share purchases, Chubb is expected to own 46.2% of Huatai Insurance Group.

The ZEN Study was an open-label, single-center, randomized, 2-way crossover study to evaluate the relative bioavailability of varenicline administered as a preservative-free nasal spray (OC-01 nasal spray) as compared to varenicline administered orally as a single oral dose of Chanti.Top-line results indicate that the relative bioavailability (systemic exposure as defined by adjusted geometric mean AUC0-inf) was 13 times lower for a single dose of the highest strength of OC-01 nasal spray as compared to a single dose of the highest strength Chantix tablet (7.46 vs 99.67 h*ng/ml). Maximal concentration (as defined by adjusted geometric mean Cmax) was 14 times lower for a single dose of the highest strength of OC-01 nasal spray as compared to a single dose of the highest strength Chantix tablet (0.32 vs 4.55 ng/ml). The study demonstrated that OC-01 nasal spray was safe and well-tolerated at the doses tested. The number of subjects reporting any treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was 13 out of 21 (61.9%) after nasal spray administration and 9 out of 22 (22.9%) after oral tablet administration but there were no reports of serious TEAE noted with either oral or nasal administration. The most common adverse events in the nasal spray group were sneeze in 7 volunteers (33.3%) and cough in 6 volunteers (28.6%). All events were mild.06:10KL Kirkland Lake Gold to acquire Detour Gold in C$4.9 bln deal (47.62 )Under the terms of the Transaction, all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Detour Gold will be exchanged at a ratio of 0.4343 of a Kirkland Lake Gold common share for each Detour Gold common share.

Focusing on expenses, current estimates are for approximately $1.8 to $2 billion run-rate expense synergies, which represents approximately 18-20% of the combined cost base. Some of the expense synergies the combined firm expects to realize will come from elimination of overlapping and duplicative roles. Additional synergies are expected to be achieved through real estate, administrative and other savings. Details on these synergies will be shared at a later date, once the integration process is underway.06:02FTS Fortis announced the appointment of David Hutchens as Chief Operating Officer, Fortis, effective January 1, 2020 (39.94 )In this newly created role, David's responsibilities will broaden to include operational oversight of the Corporation's ten utilities across Canada, the United States and the Caribbean.

Overall sentiment seems to be boosted by the prospect that China will aim to increase penalties for intellectual property theft, according to reports over the weekend. National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien also inferred that the two sides were very close to a deal. This has been taken as a positive sign for trade talks and markets are responding in kind. Although the S&P Futures are up over eight points and trading around the 3119 area, the overall range was less than five handles. The overnight high currently resides at 3121.25, while the low sits at 3116.50.In Asia, both China and Japan closed higher on the day. The reports that China would crack down on IP theft has resonated across the equity complex. This helped the Shanghai rise 0.7%. The Nikkei also caught a bid and had its largest gain in two weeks with its rise of 0.8%.European markets are trading with the same tone as the US and Asia. Economic data was light, but Germany's IFO survey showed a rise in Business Climate to 95.0, up from last month's reading of 94.6, and in-line with consensus.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: +10.010 yr Note: 1.78%USD/JPY: 108.85 +0.22EUR/USD: 1.1015 -0.0003Europe: FTSE +0.6% DAX +0.4% CAC +0.5%Asia: Hang Seng +1.5% Shanghai +0.7% Nikkei +0.8%Gold (1459.410 -4.50) Silver (16.87 -0.14) Crude (57.73 -0.04)16:21WRAPX This week's biggest % gainers/losersThe following are this week's top percentage gainers and losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).This week's top % gainers Healthcare: CLVS (8.66 +141.56%), COLL (19.35 +50.58%), SGRY (12.88 +48.39%), ATRS (4.89 +43.82%), DXCM (221.85 +41.04%), ATNX (16.08 +38.86%), EPZM (16.42 +38.57%), QGEN (41.6 +35.99%), EVH (10.5 +34.62%), MDCO (68.55 +32.28%), MRNA (20.69 +32.12%), TCMD (60.87 +31.3%), DRNA (22.5 +30.51%)Industrials: BE (6.25 +87.13%), AAXN (72.09 +37.26%)Information Technology: LASR (19.49 +38.23%)Financials: TRUP (33.79 +42.27%), LTS (3.47 +32.44%)This week's top % losers Healthcare: ANAB (12.02 -68.91%)Industrials: NVEE (47.62 -35.35%)Consumer Discretionary: MOD (7.41 -36.07%), FOSL (7.18 -34.9%)Information Technology: PLT (24.9 -38.64%), RBBN (2.81 -37.49%)Financials: QD (4.54 -36.24%)Energy: GLOG (9.34 -33.71%)16:17AEL American Equity Investment Life increases annual cash dividend to $0.30/share from $0.28/share (29.07 +0.12)16:17WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryThe stock market closed slightly higher on Friday in an uninspiring session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) edged above the S&P 500 (+0.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%), and Russell 2000 (+0.3%).The market heard from both President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, President Xi, on Friday. Mr. Xi called for mutual respect and equality in talks, but reiterated Beijing is willing to fight back if necessary. Mr. Trump said talks are moving along nicely and closing in on a deal, but the president suggested a deal should not be equal and should favor the U.S. instead.The takeaway was that the market still doesn't know for certain if a Phase One trade agreement will be signed this year, but talks are ongoing and appear to not be escalating. Separately, an upwardly revised reading in the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November was supportive for equities today.Leading the market in gains were the S&P 500 financials (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.7%), and industrials (+0.5%) sectors. The real estate (-0.5%) and energy (-0.4%) sectors were today's laggards.Nordstrom (JWN 37.95, +3.63, +10.6%) and Gap (GPS 16.94, +0.72, +4.4%) were among the biggest earnings-driven gainers in the consumer discretionary space, while an earnings-driven decline in Intuit (INTU 259.81, -11.34, -4.2%) put some pressure on the information technology sector (-0.1%).Elsewhere, the futuristic design of Tesla's (TSLA 333.04, -21.79, -6.1%) Cybertruck pickup was met with some confusion and mixed reviews. Ultimately, it appeared to be a sell-the-news case after the stock climbed about 40% in the past month.U.S. Treasuries ended the week on a flat note. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield was unchanged at 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.26. WTI crude declined 1.2%, or $0.70, to $57.88/bbl.Friday's economic data was limited to the revised reading for the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November:The final November reading for the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index checked in at 96.8 (Briefing.com consensus 94.9), which exceeded the preliminary estimate of 95.7 and the final October reading of 95.5. The November reading is in close proximity to the average level (97.0) since the start of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is the acknowledgment that consumers aren't anticipating sizable increases in inflation, unemployment, and interest rates, which suggests consumer spending activity should remain supportive for the U.S. economy.Investors will not receive any economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +28.4% YTDS&P 500 +24.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.5% YTDRussell 2000 +17.8% YTD16:12AGIO Agios Pharma presents new phamacodynamic and response data from both cohorts of perioperative study of vorasidenib and TIBSOVO (37.33 -0.85)Agios Pharma presented updated data from the ongoing perioperative study, confirming brain penetrance and robust biomarker suppression with treatment of single agent vorasidenib or TIBSOVO (ivosidenib) in low-grade glioma with an IDH1 mutation.As of the July 26, 2019 data cutoff, 49 patients were randomized before surgery, and 39 remain on treatment. The median (range) postoperative treatment duration for all doses was 5.42 (0.9-13.5) months for vorasidenib and 6.93 (1.0-13.2) months for TIBSOVO. Baseline characteristics were similar across the control and treated groups. Overall, 88% of patients had World Health Organization classified Grade 2 tumors. Less than a third of patients had prior radiation therapy and approximately half had prior systemic therapy.The safety analysis conducted for all 49 patients as of the data cut-off demonstrated that vorasidenib and TIBSOVO continue to have favorable safety profiles consistent with the Phase 1 data. 8.3% of patients in the vorasidenib group developed transaminase elevations, including one Grade 3 transaminase elevation at 50 mg daily which resolved with dose interruption. Grade 3 or higher events occurred in six (25.0%) vorasidenib patients and four (16.0%) TIBSOVO patients, with the majority related to postoperative complications. No patient discontinued treatment due to an AE.Data from the 42 efficacy evaluable patients (21 in the vorasidenib arm; 21 in the TIBSOVO arm) as of the data cut-off showed: among patients treated post-operatively with 50 mg vorasidenib, four patients (31%) achieved objective tumor responses (two achieved a partial response, defined as tumor shrinkage based on T2/FLAIR signal of at least 50%, and two achieved a minor response, defined as tumor shrinkage based on T2/FLAIR signal of at least 25% but less than 50%) according to the investigator by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology for low-grade glioma.Vorasidenib and TIBSOVO demonstrated brain penetrance, with mean brain:plasma ratios of 3.16 (vorasidenib 10 mg), 1.74 (vorasidenib 50 mg), 0.13 (TIBSOVO 250 mg), and 0.10 (TIBSOVO 500 mg). Mean percent reduction in 2-HG (95% CI) were 92.6% (76.1, 97.6) and 91.1% (72.0, 97.0), for vorasidenib 50 mg and TIBSOVO 500 mg, respectively, relative to untreated samples.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: November 25, 2019End of Document

There is conference call scheduled for 9:00 ET. Q3 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $1.13 (-4% yr/yr) on revenue of $5.74 bln (+3.6% yr/yr). The Street is expecting Q3 comps of +2.6% vs 1.0% last year. The current consensus is within the company's guidance range of $1.07-1.16 for EPS, $5.66-5.77 bln for revenues, and comp increase of low single digits. The company is expected to guide for Q4 where Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.03 (+5% yr/yr) on revenue of $5.74 bln (-3.6% yr/yr). The Street is expecting Q4 comps of 1.8% vs 2.4% last year.Looking back, the company missed on EPS and revenues one time in the last four quarters. Last quarter, shares of DLTR fell 1% after it reported a miss on the bottom line and lowers its FY20 EPS guidance. The company cited increased costs as the guidance included the first three China tariff tranches, but the fourth 15% tranche was not included. The company reported same store sales for Dollar Tree and Family Dollar of +2.4%. As a percentage of sales, gross margin was 28.7% of sales compared to 30.1% of sales in the prior year.DLTR has a $26.6 bln valuation and trades at 19x 2021 EPS vs DG which trades at 21x EPS.Based on the DLTR Weekly Nov29 $112 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~4% in either direction by weekly expiration (Friday).On a positive report, look for resistance near the $116-117 area, while support sits near the $108-109 vicinity.13:43COMDX Metals Settlement PricesDec gold settled today's session down $6.60 (0.45%) at $1457/oz Dec silver settled today's session $0.11 lower (0.68%) at $16.885/oz Dec copper settled $0.00 lower (0.11%) at $2.645/lb13:39BBY Best Buy will report third quarter results tomorrow morning (74.37 +1.73)Best Buy (BBY) will report third quarter (October) results tomorrow morning and management will host a conference call at 8:00 a.m. ET.The nation's largest electronics retailer guided for third quarter non-GAAP EPS up 7-13% to $1.00-1.05 on revenue of $9.65-9.75 bln (consensus +1.2% to $9.7 bln) and comparable store sales up 0.5-1.5%. Target reported a decline in third quarter electronics sales last week. Upside for Best Buy could come from a stronger than expected iPhone cycle. The gaming cycle is expected to improve next year.Best Buy has reported positive comp sales for ten consecutive quarters, but comp sales missed estimates last quarter for the first time in two years. Second quarter comps sales grew 1.6%, toward the low end of its +1.5-2.5% guidance range, on top of 6.2% growth last year. Domestic comp sales grew 1.9%, as strength in appliances and headphones was partially offset by declines in gaming and home theater. Earnings beat estimates on cost reductions.Best Buy raised earnings guidance for the year but tweaked its sales outlook lower. The company raises fiscal 2020 (January) EPS to $5.60-5.75 from $5.45-5.65, but narrowed revenue to $43.1-43.6 bln from $42.9-43.9 bln and comp sales to +0.7-1.7% from +0.5-2.5%.A sales miss was not the way new Chief Executive and former Chief Financial/Strategic Transformation Officer Corie Barry wanted to start her tenure. Tariff uncertainty was a primary concern for investors. Some 60% of the company's cost of goods sold are exposed to China, but that number is expected to fall to 40% next year as vendors move production out of the country. Best Buy acknowledged the uncertainty regarding tariffs but said it is working on risk mitigation with partners and remained confident in the company's ability to continue executing its plan.In September, the company gave financial targets for fiscal 2025: Enterprise revenue of $50 billion and non-GAAP operating income margins of 5.0% vs. 4.6% or slightly higher this year with $1 bln of additional cost reductions and efficiencies.Best Buy remains one of the few 'winners' in the retail sector. Management continues to execute well in a difficult retail environment, but the stock has been consolidating in a wide range since breaking out to new highs in 2017. The stock trades at ~12.5x forward EPS estimates and just under 8x EV/EBITDA, a modest discount to a broad group of retailers despite a 2.8% dividend yield.13:16OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:AUPH Dec 9 calls (volume: 5270, open int: 80, implied vol: ~317%, prev day implied vol: 278%).

The Russell 2000 (+1.9%) outperforms, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) trails the pack.The Chinese government released a document stating intentions to better deter IP theft by increasing the penalties on violations, according to Bloomberg. The news is taking precedent over a Reuters report that suggested a Phase Two deal is unlikely to be completed before the presidential election next year.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.1%), which tends to outperform when trade sentiment is positive, is the lone sector up more than 1.0% today. Leading the group higher are the semiconductor stocks, especially NVIDIA (NVDA 219.64, +8.75, +4.2%) after it was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.1%.Following suit are the health care (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.8%), and industrials (+0.6%) sectors. The utilities (-0.2%), energy (-0.1%), and consumer staples (unch) sectors are the lone holdouts.As for M&A activity, some of today's announcements have already been on the market's radar like Charles Schwab (SCHW 48.76, +0.56, +1.2%) agreeing to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.19, +3.06, +6.3%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreeing to acquire Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.07, +7.56, +6.0%) for $16.2 billion in cash.The confirmed deals have still been supportive for risk sentiment, though, and the market has been treated with new deals in Novartis (NVS 91.23, +0.73, +0.8%) agreeing to acquire The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.86, +15.31, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash and eBay (EBAY 35.55, +0.42, +1.2%) reportedly being close to selling StubHub to Viagogo for $4 billion.U.S. Treasuries are little changed despite the solid gains being registered in the stock market.

The company guided for Q4 EPS between $1.15 and $1.29 and revenue between $1.44 bln and $1.46 bln when it reported its Q3 results on August 21. ADI's Q4 guidance was conservative relative to market expectations due to continued uncertainty related to restrictions on shipments of components to Huawei. This headwind is likely to persist since the U.S.-China trade dispute remains unresolved. Investors will be curious to hear what the company's management says about the ongoing 5G roll-out in China and the preparations for a broader build-out of the technology in the U.S. Comments about the state of the automotive market will also be of note. The stock was upgraded at Barclays, KeyBanc Capital Markets, and Raymond James since the release of Q3 results.Analog Devices trades at 20.8x forward earnings expectations, which represents a discount to Maxim Integrated (MXIM 56.28, +0.99, +1.8%) and Texas Instruments (TXN 118.98, +1.97, +1.7%), but a premium to NXP Semiconductors (NXPI 116.98, +1.76, +1.5%) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS 71.60, +2.03, +2.9%).12:13SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (101) outpacing new lows (11) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ACAD, ALLE, AMED, AMGN, AMP, AMWD, ANSS, AON, APPF, ARE, ARVN, ARWR, ATKR, ATRS, AXSM, BIO, BKE, BLD, BMI, BOH, BRMK, BURL, CACI, CATM, CG, CHH, CMTL, CNMD, CNNE, COLL, CPRT, CTXS, CVNA, D, DAR, DEA, DOCU, DOV, DRNA, DXCM, EPAM, EQH, ESE, EVER, FIVN, GAIN, GL, GMRE, GWRE, HALO, HLT, HNGR, HZNP, INCY, INFO, INSW, KNL, KRNY, KRYS, LBRDK, LITE, LULU, LXP, MDCO, MGLN, MMC, MSCI, NDSN, NMRK, NVRO, PAYC, PCAR, PCTY, PH, PLUG, PSN, QGEN, RE, RH, SAFE, SEM, SF, SKY, SNX, SO, SPLK, SPXC, SRCL, TDY, TECH, TGI, TIF, TNK, TYL, UI, USB, VCTR, VRTX, XPEL, ZBRA, ZYMEStocks that traded to 52 week lows: BXC, CBAY, CVTI, GMLP, GSM, GTT, LJPC, MUX, SMLP, ULTA, XOGThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: CABO, CRMT, FCNCA, MGIC, NWPX, POWL, WTBAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: ITRNETFs that traded to 52 week highs: BJK, EIS, FAN, IAI, IBB, IWF, IWM, IYF, IYG, IYH, KCE, MDY, OEF, PBD, QQQ, SPY, UYG, VTI, XLF, XLVETFs that traded to 52 week lows: VXX11:59SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- CymaBay Therapeutics (CBAY) sinks on halt of seladelpar development -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersCLVS (9.83 +13.51%): Advances to its highest levels since July on above average volume, now up circa +210% month-to-date.

Increased quarterly dividend to $0.12 from $0.1125/share (from October 23 Securities Analyst Meeting). On September 25 HPE completed its $1.4 billion acquisition of supercomputing company Cray.Over the next three years, the high performance computing (HPC) segment of the market and associated storage and services is expected to grow from approximately $28 billion in 2018 to approximately $35 billion in 2021.The acquisition is expected to be accretive to HPE non-GAAP operating profit and earnings in HPE's fiscal year 2020.HPE is arguably behind enterprise-level server peers Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), a point the company attempted to address with the acquisition of Cray. HPE also highlighted its as-a-service offerings at the October 23 Securities Analyst Meeting; as previously disclosed, HPE plans to offer its entire portfolio, including HPE Aruba Central, HPE BlueData, HPE Cloud Volumes, HPE InfoSight, and HPE OneView, as a service by 2022, a move the company anticipates will help drive sustainable profitable growth.HPE steps into the print with a roughly $23 billion market capitalization with a valuation of about 9.5x forward earnings estimates.11:30BONDX New SupplyTreasury Auction Preview$40 bln 2-year Treasury note auction (results at 13:00 ET) Prior auction results: High yield: 1.594% Bid-to-cover: 2.70 Indirect bid: 54.8% Direct bid: 14.0% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.128% Bid-to-cover: 2.58 Indirect bid: 48.6% Direct bid: 18.7%11:19NTR Nutrien to curtail production at Rocanville potash mine due to CN rail strike (47.10 +0.53)Nutrien announced that it will be forced to shut down production at its largest potash mine, Rocanville, due to the CN strike. Employee notices were sent out today indicating the mine will be shut down for 2 weeks starting on December 2."It is extremely disappointing that in a year when the agricultural sector has been severely impacted by poor weather and trade disputes, the CN strike will add further hardship to the Canadian agriculture industry," said Chuck Magro, Nutrien's President and CEO. "Any further disruption will be harmful to our business, the Canadian economy, and Canada's competitive position and reputation as a reliable supplier of fertilizer and food. However, most concerning is the impact on our hundreds of employees for whom this creates great uncertainty and hardship leading up to the holiday season."11:10SMH Industry Briefing: Chipmakers (133.43 +2.51)The PHLX Semiconductor Index (+2.1%) has gotten off to a strong start after underperforming last week. The high-beta group is now up 4.5% for the month versus a 3.0% month-to-date gain in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to the outperformance:Leadership from NVIDIA (NVDA 220.55, +9.66, +4.6%) after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to Overweight from Equal Weight and raised its price target to $259 from $217. Optimism about the viability of a partial trade deal with China after Chinese officials indicated that rules governing intellectual property rights will be strengthened.Notable movers:NVIDIA (NVDA 220.55, +9.66, +4.6%): rising to its highest level in more than a year after receiving an upgrade from Morgan Stanley. Applied Materials (AMAT 57.91, +1.97, +3.5%): showing relative strength after backing down from a fresh record high last week.

This news is overshadowing a separate Reuters report discussing why a Phase Two deal is unlikely to get done before the election.In any event, the Bloomberg report has helped catalyze a risk-on bias along with the news that Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.03, +0.83, +1.7%) is buying TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.45, +3.32, +6.9%) in a $26 billion stock deal, LVMH is acquiring Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.35, +7.84, +6.3%) in a $16.2 billion cash deal, and Novartis (NVS 90.94, +0.46, +0.5%) is acquiring The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.83, +15.28, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash.These deals have helped give an added lift to the financial (+0.6%), consumer discretionary (+0.9%), and healthcare (+0.7%) sectors, which are among today's leaders.The biggest gainer, however, is the information technology sector (1.2%). Such outperformance typically follows when the market is feeling good about trade developments, yet it is being bolstered further by a hot semiconductor group, which is drafting off a Morgan Stanley upgrade of NVIDIA (NVDA 220.40, +9.51, +4.5%) to Overweight from Equal Weight. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.2%.Strikingly, longer-dated Treasury securities are also up today, which means their yields are lower, indicating that not everyone is sharing the same risk-on, growth-oriented mindset as the stock market. The 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.76%.The Russell 2000 is up 1.7%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 1.2%; the S&P 500 is up 0.6%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.5%.10:17OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:CPRI Weekly Nov29 36;5 calls are seeing interest with 3660 contracts trading vs. open int of 20, pushing implied vol up around 9 points to ~37%.

Study LJ401-BT01 is a pivotal, multinational, multicenter, randomized, controlled study with a target enrollment of approximately 100 patients that is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LJPC-401 as a treatment for iron overload in beta thalassemia (BT) patients who, despite chelation therapy, have cardiac iron levels above normal. The primary endpoint of this study is the change in cardiac iron levels, as measured by cardiac T2* magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), from baseline to 6 months following treatment. The Company recently conducted an interim analysis that included approximately one-half of the target-enrolled patients. There were no significant differences in the primary endpoint or key secondary endpoints between patients on the treatment arm and patients on the control arm.Topline results of Study LJ401-HH01 are also now available. Topline results from this study are consistent with the interim results reported in June 2019. The change in TSAT from baseline to the end of treatment (16 weeks), the primary efficacy endpoint of the study, was statistically significant: LJPC-401-treated patients had a mean reduction in TSAT of 33% compared to placebo-treated patients who had a mean reduction of 3% (p<0.0001). The requirement for and frequency of phlebotomy procedures, a key secondary endpoint of the study, was statistically significant: LJPC-401-treated patients had 0.10 phlebotomies per month compared to placebo-treated patients who had 0.50 phlebotomies per month (p<0.0001). LJPC-401 was well tolerated. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were injection site reactions (ISRs), which occurred in 79% of LJPC-401-treated patients compared to 6% of placebo-treated patients. The ISRs were all mild or moderate in severity, and no ISRs resulted in treatment discontinuation.The company expects to re-evaluate its current operating plan in light of the mixed results of these studies and to make adjustments as appropriate to manage the company's available cash resources.08:31LJPC La Jolla Pharm President/CEO George Tidmarsh, M.D., Ph.D., leaves the company to pursue other interests (5.58 )A search for a new Chief Executive Officer has been initiated.

In particular, there continues to be uncertainty regarding Xerox's ability to raise the cash portion of the proposed consideration and concerns regarding the prudence of the resulting outsized debt burden on the value of the combined company's stock even if the financing were obtained. Consequently, your proposal does not constitute a basis for due diligence or negotiation.We believe it is important to emphasize that we are not dependent on a Xerox combination. We have great confidence in our strategy and the numerous opportunities available to HP to drive sustainable long-term value, including the deployment of our strong balance sheet for increased share repurchases of our significantly undervalued stock and for value-creating M&A. The HP Board of Directors is committed to serving the best interests of HP shareholders, not Xerox and its shareholders.

Economic data was light, but Germany's IFO survey showed a rise in Business Climate to 95.0, up from last month's reading of 94.6, and in-line with consensus.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: +10.010 yr Note: 1.78%USD/JPY: 108.85 +0.22EUR/USD: 1.1015 -0.0003Europe: FTSE +0.6% DAX +0.4% CAC +0.5%Asia: Hang Seng +1.5% Shanghai +0.7% Nikkei +0.8%Gold (1459.410 -4.50) Silver (16.87 -0.14) Crude (57.73 -0.04)16:21WRAPX This week's biggest % gainers/losersThe following are this week's top percentage gainers and losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).This week's top % gainers Healthcare: CLVS (8.66 +141.56%), COLL (19.35 +50.58%), SGRY (12.88 +48.39%), ATRS (4.89 +43.82%), DXCM (221.85 +41.04%), ATNX (16.08 +38.86%), EPZM (16.42 +38.57%), QGEN (41.6 +35.99%), EVH (10.5 +34.62%), MDCO (68.55 +32.28%), MRNA (20.69 +32.12%), TCMD (60.87 +31.3%), DRNA (22.5 +30.51%)Industrials: BE (6.25 +87.13%), AAXN (72.09 +37.26%)Information Technology: LASR (19.49 +38.23%)Financials: TRUP (33.79 +42.27%), LTS (3.47 +32.44%)This week's top % losers Healthcare: ANAB (12.02 -68.91%)Industrials: NVEE (47.62 -35.35%)Consumer Discretionary: MOD (7.41 -36.07%), FOSL (7.18 -34.9%)Information Technology: PLT (24.9 -38.64%), RBBN (2.81 -37.49%)Financials: QD (4.54 -36.24%)Energy: GLOG (9.34 -33.71%)16:17AEL American Equity Investment Life increases annual cash dividend to $0.30/share from $0.28/share (29.07 +0.12)16:17WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryThe stock market closed slightly higher on Friday in an uninspiring session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) edged above the S&P 500 (+0.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%), and Russell 2000 (+0.3%).The market heard from both President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, President Xi, on Friday. Mr. Xi called for mutual respect and equality in talks, but reiterated Beijing is willing to fight back if necessary. Mr. Trump said talks are moving along nicely and closing in on a deal, but the president suggested a deal should not be equal and should favor the U.S. instead.The takeaway was that the market still doesn't know for certain if a Phase One trade agreement will be signed this year, but talks are ongoing and appear to not be escalating. Separately, an upwardly revised reading in the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November was supportive for equities today.Leading the market in gains were the S&P 500 financials (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.7%), and industrials (+0.5%) sectors. The real estate (-0.5%) and energy (-0.4%) sectors were today's laggards.Nordstrom (JWN 37.95, +3.63, +10.6%) and Gap (GPS 16.94, +0.72, +4.4%) were among the biggest earnings-driven gainers in the consumer discretionary space, while an earnings-driven decline in Intuit (INTU 259.81, -11.34, -4.2%) put some pressure on the information technology sector (-0.1%).Elsewhere, the futuristic design of Tesla's (TSLA 333.04, -21.79, -6.1%) Cybertruck pickup was met with some confusion and mixed reviews. Ultimately, it appeared to be a sell-the-news case after the stock climbed about 40% in the past month.U.S. Treasuries ended the week on a flat note. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield was unchanged at 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.26. WTI crude declined 1.2%, or $0.70, to $57.88/bbl.Friday's economic data was limited to the revised reading for the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November:The final November reading for the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index checked in at 96.8 (Briefing.com consensus 94.9), which exceeded the preliminary estimate of 95.7 and the final October reading of 95.5. The November reading is in close proximity to the average level (97.0) since the start of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is the acknowledgment that consumers aren't anticipating sizable increases in inflation, unemployment, and interest rates, which suggests consumer spending activity should remain supportive for the U.S. economy.Investors will not receive any economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +28.4% YTDS&P 500 +24.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.5% YTDRussell 2000 +17.8% YTD16:12AGIO Agios Pharma presents new phamacodynamic and response data from both cohorts of perioperative study of vorasidenib and TIBSOVO (37.33 -0.85)Agios Pharma presented updated data from the ongoing perioperative study, confirming brain penetrance and robust biomarker suppression with treatment of single agent vorasidenib or TIBSOVO (ivosidenib) in low-grade glioma with an IDH1 mutation.As of the July 26, 2019 data cutoff, 49 patients were randomized before surgery, and 39 remain on treatment. The median (range) postoperative treatment duration for all doses was 5.42 (0.9-13.5) months for vorasidenib and 6.93 (1.0-13.2) months for TIBSOVO. Baseline characteristics were similar across the control and treated groups. Overall, 88% of patients had World Health Organization classified Grade 2 tumors. Less than a third of patients had prior radiation therapy and approximately half had prior systemic therapy.The safety analysis conducted for all 49 patients as of the data cut-off demonstrated that vorasidenib and TIBSOVO continue to have favorable safety profiles consistent with the Phase 1 data. 8.3% of patients in the vorasidenib group developed transaminase elevations, including one Grade 3 transaminase elevation at 50 mg daily which resolved with dose interruption. Grade 3 or higher events occurred in six (25.0%) vorasidenib patients and four (16.0%) TIBSOVO patients, with the majority related to postoperative complications. No patient discontinued treatment due to an AE.Data from the 42 efficacy evaluable patients (21 in the vorasidenib arm; 21 in the TIBSOVO arm) as of the data cut-off showed: among patients treated post-operatively with 50 mg vorasidenib, four patients (31%) achieved objective tumor responses (two achieved a partial response, defined as tumor shrinkage based on T2/FLAIR signal of at least 50%, and two achieved a minor response, defined as tumor shrinkage based on T2/FLAIR signal of at least 25% but less than 50%) according to the investigator by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology for low-grade glioma.Vorasidenib and TIBSOVO demonstrated brain penetrance, with mean brain:plasma ratios of 3.16 (vorasidenib 10 mg), 1.74 (vorasidenib 50 mg), 0.13 (TIBSOVO 250 mg), and 0.10 (TIBSOVO 500 mg). Mean percent reduction in 2-HG (95% CI) were 92.6% (76.1, 97.6) and 91.1% (72.0, 97.0), for vorasidenib 50 mg and TIBSOVO 500 mg, respectively, relative to untreated samples.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: November 25, 2019End of Document

The transaction is expected to be completed in Q1 of 2020. At new all-time highs. ARWR (57.57 +17.01%): Upgraded to Outperform from Neutral and assigned a $70 price target at Robert W. Baird. Various biotech companies with pipelines that feature RNAi therapeutic candidates see strength following the premium buyout of The Medicines Co (MDCO) by Novartis AG (NVS).

There is conference call scheduled for 9:00 ET. Q3 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $1.13 (-4% yr/yr) on revenue of $5.74 bln (+3.6% yr/yr). The Street is expecting Q3 comps of +2.6% vs 1.0% last year. The current consensus is within the company's guidance range of $1.07-1.16 for EPS, $5.66-5.77 bln for revenues, and comp increase of low single digits. The company is expected to guide for Q4 where Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.03 (+5% yr/yr) on revenue of $5.74 bln (-3.6% yr/yr). The Street is expecting Q4 comps of 1.8% vs 2.4% last year.Looking back, the company missed on EPS and revenues one time in the last four quarters. Last quarter, shares of DLTR fell 1% after it reported a miss on the bottom line and lowers its FY20 EPS guidance. The company cited increased costs as the guidance included the first three China tariff tranches, but the fourth 15% tranche was not included. The company reported same store sales for Dollar Tree and Family Dollar of +2.4%. As a percentage of sales, gross margin was 28.7% of sales compared to 30.1% of sales in the prior year.DLTR has a $26.6 bln valuation and trades at 19x 2021 EPS vs DG which trades at 21x EPS.Based on the DLTR Weekly Nov29 $112 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~4% in either direction by weekly expiration (Friday).On a positive report, look for resistance near the $116-117 area, while support sits near the $108-109 vicinity.13:43COMDX Metals Settlement PricesDec gold settled today's session down $6.60 (0.45%) at $1457/oz Dec silver settled today's session $0.11 lower (0.68%) at $16.885/oz Dec copper settled $0.00 lower (0.11%) at $2.645/lb13:39BBY Best Buy will report third quarter results tomorrow morning (74.37 +1.73)Best Buy (BBY) will report third quarter (October) results tomorrow morning and management will host a conference call at 8:00 a.m. ET.The nation's largest electronics retailer guided for third quarter non-GAAP EPS up 7-13% to $1.00-1.05 on revenue of $9.65-9.75 bln (consensus +1.2% to $9.7 bln) and comparable store sales up 0.5-1.5%. Target reported a decline in third quarter electronics sales last week. Upside for Best Buy could come from a stronger than expected iPhone cycle. The gaming cycle is expected to improve next year.Best Buy has reported positive comp sales for ten consecutive quarters, but comp sales missed estimates last quarter for the first time in two years. Second quarter comps sales grew 1.6%, toward the low end of its +1.5-2.5% guidance range, on top of 6.2% growth last year. Domestic comp sales grew 1.9%, as strength in appliances and headphones was partially offset by declines in gaming and home theater. Earnings beat estimates on cost reductions.Best Buy raised earnings guidance for the year but tweaked its sales outlook lower. The company raises fiscal 2020 (January) EPS to $5.60-5.75 from $5.45-5.65, but narrowed revenue to $43.1-43.6 bln from $42.9-43.9 bln and comp sales to +0.7-1.7% from +0.5-2.5%.A sales miss was not the way new Chief Executive and former Chief Financial/Strategic Transformation Officer Corie Barry wanted to start her tenure. Tariff uncertainty was a primary concern for investors. Some 60% of the company's cost of goods sold are exposed to China, but that number is expected to fall to 40% next year as vendors move production out of the country. Best Buy acknowledged the uncertainty regarding tariffs but said it is working on risk mitigation with partners and remained confident in the company's ability to continue executing its plan.In September, the company gave financial targets for fiscal 2025: Enterprise revenue of $50 billion and non-GAAP operating income margins of 5.0% vs. 4.6% or slightly higher this year with $1 bln of additional cost reductions and efficiencies.Best Buy remains one of the few 'winners' in the retail sector. Management continues to execute well in a difficult retail environment, but the stock has been consolidating in a wide range since breaking out to new highs in 2017. The stock trades at ~12.5x forward EPS estimates and just under 8x EV/EBITDA, a modest discount to a broad group of retailers despite a 2.8% dividend yield.13:16OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:AUPH Dec 9 calls (volume: 5270, open int: 80, implied vol: ~317%, prev day implied vol: 278%).

The Russell 2000 (+1.9%) outperforms, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) trails the pack.The Chinese government released a document stating intentions to better deter IP theft by increasing the penalties on violations, according to Bloomberg. The news is taking precedent over a Reuters report that suggested a Phase Two deal is unlikely to be completed before the presidential election next year.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.1%), which tends to outperform when trade sentiment is positive, is the lone sector up more than 1.0% today. Leading the group higher are the semiconductor stocks, especially NVIDIA (NVDA 219.64, +8.75, +4.2%) after it was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.1%.Following suit are the health care (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.8%), and industrials (+0.6%) sectors. The utilities (-0.2%), energy (-0.1%), and consumer staples (unch) sectors are the lone holdouts.As for M&A activity, some of today's announcements have already been on the market's radar like Charles Schwab (SCHW 48.76, +0.56, +1.2%) agreeing to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.19, +3.06, +6.3%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreeing to acquire Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.07, +7.56, +6.0%) for $16.2 billion in cash.The confirmed deals have still been supportive for risk sentiment, though, and the market has been treated with new deals in Novartis (NVS 91.23, +0.73, +0.8%) agreeing to acquire The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.86, +15.31, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash and eBay (EBAY 35.55, +0.42, +1.2%) reportedly being close to selling StubHub to Viagogo for $4 billion.U.S. Treasuries are little changed despite the solid gains being registered in the stock market. The benchmark 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.34.Investors did not receive any notable economic data today.12:20ADI Analog Devices to report tomorrow (112.67 +2.02)Analog Devices (ADI 112.67, +2.02, +1.8%) will report its Q4 results ahead of tomorrow's opening bell, followed by management's conference call at 10:00 ET.The Capital IQ consensus expects the manufacturer of signal converters, processors, and power management products to report a 21.3% yr/yr decrease in EPS to $1.22 on a 9.0% yr/yr drop in revenue to $1.45 bln. The company guided for Q4 EPS between $1.15 and $1.29 and revenue between $1.44 bln and $1.46 bln when it reported its Q3 results on August 21. ADI's Q4 guidance was conservative relative to market expectations due to continued uncertainty related to restrictions on shipments of components to Huawei. This headwind is likely to persist since the U.S.-China trade dispute remains unresolved.

This news is overshadowing a separate Reuters report discussing why a Phase Two deal is unlikely to get done before the election.In any event, the Bloomberg report has helped catalyze a risk-on bias along with the news that Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.03, +0.83, +1.7%) is buying TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.45, +3.32, +6.9%) in a $26 billion stock deal, LVMH is acquiring Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.35, +7.84, +6.3%) in a $16.2 billion cash deal, and Novartis (NVS 90.94, +0.46, +0.5%) is acquiring The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.83, +15.28, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash.These deals have helped give an added lift to the financial (+0.6%), consumer discretionary (+0.9%), and healthcare (+0.7%) sectors, which are among today's leaders.The biggest gainer, however, is the information technology sector (1.2%). Such outperformance typically follows when the market is feeling good about trade developments, yet it is being bolstered further by a hot semiconductor group, which is drafting off a Morgan Stanley upgrade of NVIDIA (NVDA 220.40, +9.51, +4.5%) to Overweight from Equal Weight. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.2%.Strikingly, longer-dated Treasury securities are also up today, which means their yields are lower, indicating that not everyone is sharing the same risk-on, growth-oriented mindset as the stock market. The 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.76%.The Russell 2000 is up 1.7%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 1.2%; the S&P 500 is up 0.6%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.5%.10:17OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:CPRI Weekly Nov29 36;5 calls are seeing interest with 3660 contracts trading vs. open int of 20, pushing implied vol up around 9 points to ~37%.

Study LJ401-BT01 is a pivotal, multinational, multicenter, randomized, controlled study with a target enrollment of approximately 100 patients that is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LJPC-401 as a treatment for iron overload in beta thalassemia (BT) patients who, despite chelation therapy, have cardiac iron levels above normal. The primary endpoint of this study is the change in cardiac iron levels, as measured by cardiac T2* magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), from baseline to 6 months following treatment. The Company recently conducted an interim analysis that included approximately one-half of the target-enrolled patients. There were no significant differences in the primary endpoint or key secondary endpoints between patients on the treatment arm and patients on the control arm.Topline results of Study LJ401-HH01 are also now available. Topline results from this study are consistent with the interim results reported in June 2019. The change in TSAT from baseline to the end of treatment (16 weeks), the primary efficacy endpoint of the study, was statistically significant: LJPC-401-treated patients had a mean reduction in TSAT of 33% compared to placebo-treated patients who had a mean reduction of 3% (p<0.0001). The requirement for and frequency of phlebotomy procedures, a key secondary endpoint of the study, was statistically significant: LJPC-401-treated patients had 0.10 phlebotomies per month compared to placebo-treated patients who had 0.50 phlebotomies per month (p<0.0001). LJPC-401 was well tolerated. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were injection site reactions (ISRs), which occurred in 79% of LJPC-401-treated patients compared to 6% of placebo-treated patients. The ISRs were all mild or moderate in severity, and no ISRs resulted in treatment discontinuation.The company expects to re-evaluate its current operating plan in light of the mixed results of these studies and to make adjustments as appropriate to manage the company's available cash resources.08:31LJPC La Jolla Pharm President/CEO George Tidmarsh, M.D., Ph.D., leaves the company to pursue other interests (5.58 )A search for a new Chief Executive Officer has been initiated.

We reiterate that we reject Xerox's proposal as it significantly undervalues HP. Additionally, it is highly conditional and uncertain. In particular, there continues to be uncertainty regarding Xerox's ability to raise the cash portion of the proposed consideration and concerns regarding the prudence of the resulting outsized debt burden on the value of the combined company's stock even if the financing were obtained. Consequently, your proposal does not constitute a basis for due diligence or negotiation.We believe it is important to emphasize that we are not dependent on a Xerox combination. We have great confidence in our strategy and the numerous opportunities available to HP to drive sustainable long-term value, including the deployment of our strong balance sheet for increased share repurchases of our significantly undervalued stock and for value-creating M&A. The HP Board of Directors is committed to serving the best interests of HP shareholders, not Xerox and its shareholders. HP has numerous opportunities to create value for HP shareholders on a standalone basis. We will not let aggressive tactics or hostile gestures distract us from our responsibility to pursue the most value-creating path.06:22ZIOP ZIOPHARM presents clinical data for controlled IL-12; reinforced favorable safety profile and initial data (4.72 )Co announced the presentation of new interim analyses of clinical data from two ongoing substudies in its Controlled IL-12 platform, or Ad-RTS-hIL-12 plus veledimex (Ad+V), both as monotherapy and in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor, for the treatment of recurrent or progressive glioblastoma multiforme (rGBM) in adults.Interim Update ReportedDecrease in tumor from baseline (time of Ad+V administration) resulting in a patient's lesion being too small to measure, assessed as a partial response (per iRANO), with follow up ongoing Subjects were comparable to the Main study except a higher percentage in the Expansion substudy had multifocal disease vs. unifocal disease and fewer recurrences Based on study design there was, as expected, a higher percentage of subjects in the Expansion substudy as compared with Main study (75% vs 40%) who received low-dose concurrent steroids Local, regulated IL-12 production using Ad+V in subjects with rGBM rapidly and safely activates the immune system06:21JEC Jacobs beats by $0.17, beats on revs; initiates $250 mln accelerated share repurchase program, offers FY20 Adj-EBITDA guidance (93.38 )Reports Q4 (Sep) earnings of $1.48 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.17 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.31; revenues rose 13.4% year/year to $3.39 bln vs the $3.29 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus."It's clear the strategic actions we have taken are resulting in a high-performance culture with strong execution discipline.

The ZEN Study was an open-label, single-center, randomized, 2-way crossover study to evaluate the relative bioavailability of varenicline administered as a preservative-free nasal spray (OC-01 nasal spray) as compared to varenicline administered orally as a single oral dose of Chanti.Top-line results indicate that the relative bioavailability (systemic exposure as defined by adjusted geometric mean AUC0-inf) was 13 times lower for a single dose of the highest strength of OC-01 nasal spray as compared to a single dose of the highest strength Chantix tablet (7.46 vs 99.67 h*ng/ml). Maximal concentration (as defined by adjusted geometric mean Cmax) was 14 times lower for a single dose of the highest strength of OC-01 nasal spray as compared to a single dose of the highest strength Chantix tablet (0.32 vs 4.55 ng/ml). The study demonstrated that OC-01 nasal spray was safe and well-tolerated at the doses tested. The number of subjects reporting any treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was 13 out of 21 (61.9%) after nasal spray administration and 9 out of 22 (22.9%) after oral tablet administration but there were no reports of serious TEAE noted with either oral or nasal administration.

National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien also inferred that the two sides were very close to a deal. This has been taken as a positive sign for trade talks and markets are responding in kind. Although the S&P Futures are up over eight points and trading around the 3119 area, the overall range was less than five handles. The overnight high currently resides at 3121.25, while the low sits at 3116.50.In Asia, both China and Japan closed higher on the day. The reports that China would crack down on IP theft has resonated across the equity complex. This helped the Shanghai rise 0.7%. The Nikkei also caught a bid and had its largest gain in two weeks with its rise of 0.8%.European markets are trading with the same tone as the US and Asia.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) edged above the S&P 500 (+0.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%), and Russell 2000 (+0.3%).The market heard from both President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, President Xi, on Friday. Mr. Xi called for mutual respect and equality in talks, but reiterated Beijing is willing to fight back if necessary. Mr. Trump said talks are moving along nicely and closing in on a deal, but the president suggested a deal should not be equal and should favor the U.S. instead.The takeaway was that the market still doesn't know for certain if a Phase One trade agreement will be signed this year, but talks are ongoing and appear to not be escalating. Separately, an upwardly revised reading in the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November was supportive for equities today.Leading the market in gains were the S&P 500 financials (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.7%), and industrials (+0.5%) sectors. The real estate (-0.5%) and energy (-0.4%) sectors were today's laggards.Nordstrom (JWN 37.95, +3.63, +10.6%) and Gap (GPS 16.94, +0.72, +4.4%) were among the biggest earnings-driven gainers in the consumer discretionary space, while an earnings-driven decline in Intuit (INTU 259.81, -11.34, -4.2%) put some pressure on the information technology sector (-0.1%).Elsewhere, the futuristic design of Tesla's (TSLA 333.04, -21.79, -6.1%) Cybertruck pickup was met with some confusion and mixed reviews. Ultimately, it appeared to be a sell-the-news case after the stock climbed about 40% in the past month.U.S. Treasuries ended the week on a flat note. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield was unchanged at 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.26. WTI crude declined 1.2%, or $0.70, to $57.88/bbl.Friday's economic data was limited to the revised reading for the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November:The final November reading for the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index checked in at 96.8 (Briefing.com consensus 94.9), which exceeded the preliminary estimate of 95.7 and the final October reading of 95.5. The November reading is in close proximity to the average level (97.0) since the start of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is the acknowledgment that consumers aren't anticipating sizable increases in inflation, unemployment, and interest rates, which suggests consumer spending activity should remain supportive for the U.S. economy.Investors will not receive any economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +28.4% YTDS&P 500 +24.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.5% YTDRussell 2000 +17.8% YTD16:12AGIO Agios Pharma presents new phamacodynamic and response data from both cohorts of perioperative study of vorasidenib and TIBSOVO (37.33 -0.85)Agios Pharma presented updated data from the ongoing perioperative study, confirming brain penetrance and robust biomarker suppression with treatment of single agent vorasidenib or TIBSOVO (ivosidenib) in low-grade glioma with an IDH1 mutation.As of the July 26, 2019 data cutoff, 49 patients were randomized before surgery, and 39 remain on treatment. The median (range) postoperative treatment duration for all doses was 5.42 (0.9-13.5) months for vorasidenib and 6.93 (1.0-13.2) months for TIBSOVO. Baseline characteristics were similar across the control and treated groups. Overall, 88% of patients had World Health Organization classified Grade 2 tumors. Less than a third of patients had prior radiation therapy and approximately half had prior systemic therapy.The safety analysis conducted for all 49 patients as of the data cut-off demonstrated that vorasidenib and TIBSOVO continue to have favorable safety profiles consistent with the Phase 1 data. 8.3% of patients in the vorasidenib group developed transaminase elevations, including one Grade 3 transaminase elevation at 50 mg daily which resolved with dose interruption. Grade 3 or higher events occurred in six (25.0%) vorasidenib patients and four (16.0%) TIBSOVO patients, with the majority related to postoperative complications. No patient discontinued treatment due to an AE.Data from the 42 efficacy evaluable patients (21 in the vorasidenib arm; 21 in the TIBSOVO arm) as of the data cut-off showed: among patients treated post-operatively with 50 mg vorasidenib, four patients (31%) achieved objective tumor responses (two achieved a partial response, defined as tumor shrinkage based on T2/FLAIR signal of at least 50%, and two achieved a minor response, defined as tumor shrinkage based on T2/FLAIR signal of at least 25% but less than 50%) according to the investigator by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology for low-grade glioma.Vorasidenib and TIBSOVO demonstrated brain penetrance, with mean brain:plasma ratios of 3.16 (vorasidenib 10 mg), 1.74 (vorasidenib 50 mg), 0.13 (TIBSOVO 250 mg), and 0.10 (TIBSOVO 500 mg). Mean percent reduction in 2-HG (95% CI) were 92.6% (76.1, 97.6) and 91.1% (72.0, 97.0), for vorasidenib 50 mg and TIBSOVO 500 mg, respectively, relative to untreated samples.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: November 25, 2019End of Document

Congress has urged the Administration to respond strongly and decisively, and in light of recent reports, we are renewing that call. On November 16, 2019, The New York Times published leaked Chinese government documents that shed new light on the role of the Chinese Communist Party, including its General Secretary Xi Jinping, in the ongoing human rights abuses in the XUAR. While we were pleased to see the Administration announce the imposition of sanctions against Chinese individuals and entities on October 7-8, 2019, these measures were a first step that do not go far enough in ensuring accountability for China's government and Communist Party.We urge you to publicly impose Global Magnitsky Act sanctions against Chen Quanguo, the XUAR Community Communist Party Secretary, as well as other senior party leaders who have had a role in setting and implementing China's ethnic and religious policies, including those in the Central Committee and XUAR united front work departments, political-legal commissions, and state security commissions. The continued inaction on Global Magnitsky Act sanctions in light of the voluminous evidence showing Chen, in particular, to be a key architect of the current system of internment camps is simply inexcusable. The Treasury Department should move to approve and implement these sanctions immediately.Since a bipartisan group of Members sent a letter on this issue in April 2019, journalists and researchers have revealed that senior officials in the PRC, from Xi Jinping down, are ordering and coordinating the mass internment and forced labor policies we are witnessing in the XUAR. The leaked documents acquired by The New York Times include previously undisclosed speeches by General Secretary Xi and reveal the dehumanizing terms used to justify the crimes against Uyghurs and other religious groups. These documents show that the Party views these groups as possessing a "virus" in their thought that must be eliminated, using, in Xi's words, the "organs of dictatorship" and "showing absolutely no mercy." Moreover, the system of forced labor that accompanies mass internment in the XUAR has effectively turned the region into a massive labor camp that cruelly exploits ethnic minority labor as part of a program of political indoctrination.We urge you to expand the scope of the sanctions and Bureau of Industry and Security "Entity List" designations already applied to Chinese government departments and companies responsible for this tragic situation. Since each of you plays a role on the End-User Review Committee on Entity List Decisions, we ask that you expand the Entity List to ensure that U.S. companies are not contributing to, directly or indirectly, the gross human rights violations in the XUAR.The list's expansion should include all Chinese companies involved in the "pairing assistance" program in XUAR, which subsidizes the establishment of manufacturing facilities in Xinjiang, and any company otherwise benefiting from the system of forced labor in the XUAR. The PRC government reportedly has begun to "employ" large numbers of Uyghurs, including many former detainees, in these enterprises, particularly labor-intensive textile and apparel factories, where they are strictly supervised. Uyghurs who refuse to accept such employment may be threatened with detention. Oppressive surveillance in the XUAR coupled with the government's policies of forced labor prevent companies from conducting meaningful due diligence to ensure their supply chains are free from forced labor.We ask that expansion of the Entity List supplement the efforts of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to investigate and block U.S. imports of goods made with forced labor from the XUAR, pursuant to Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930. In October, the CBP placed a "Withhold Release Order" (WRO) on garments produced by XUAR-based Hetian Taida Apparel Company, Ltd. based on the fact that those garments are being "produced with prison or forced labor." Members of Congress recently encouraged the CBP to issue additional WROs on Chinese companies using forced labor, particularly in the textile industry. Because forced labor is part of a larger Chinese government policy of social control, it is time for the Administration to take aggressive action to enforce U.S. law and eliminate illegal imports of goods made with forced labor and assembled or manufactured in the XUAR. A copy of the Congressional letter to Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan is included for your reference.We also believe the United States should establish stronger disclosure requirements to alert American investors about the presence in U.S. capital markets of Hikvision, Dahua Technology, and other Chinese enterprises complicit in human rights abuses. Such disclosure requirements should also include American and foreign companies listed on U.S. exchanges that source their products from or have a presence in the XUAR. The failure to disclose their business in the XUAR poses material, asymmetric risks to corporate reputation and shareholder valueespecially now that the U.S. government has shown it is prepared to use the Entity List to sanction companies contributing to human rights abuses.Chinese authorities have detained dozens of family members of U.S. government employees and U.S. citizens and permanent residents in a bid to thwart any effort to expose the details of human rights abuses occurring in the XUAR. In particular, we encourage you to actively seek the release of the family memberssuch as Gulshan Abbas and Kaisar Keyumof Radio Free Asia (RFA) Uyghur language service journalists and prominent Uyghur rights activists Rushan Abbas and Rebiya Kadeer. Efforts to intimidate U.S. residents through detention of their family members is unacceptable and requires a strong response from the Administration.The United States must lead the free world in addressing what may be crimes against humanity being committed in the XUAR. If "never again" is to mean anything in the 21st century, then we must respond to one of the greatest ongoing tragedies of our time. If the U.S. and American companies refuse or fail to act, it will be a stain on our history.We look forward to working with you on these timely and important issues.###Cory Gardner is a member of the U.S. Senate serving Colorado.

HYPOTHETICAL: HOW A REAL U.S.-CHINA WAR COULD STARTStates News ServiceDecember 21, 2019 SaturdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1681 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for the National Interest (former the Nixon Center):Editor's note: The following is a translation of Chapter 14 of the book If the U.S.and China Go to Warana‡a ,a¸cŽa¼an by the author and analyst Chen Pokong. The current volume was published in Chinese in 2013 and was later translated to Japanese.Key Point: The chapter sketches the hypothetical beginnings of a conflict scenario between the United States and China. In it, the U.S. responds to provocative Chinese cyberattacks by launching one of its own, tearing down the Great Firewall. In response, Chinese authorities clamp down Internet access completely, which America quickly responds to. Ultimately, regime-organized street violence endangers the lives of American consular staff, and U.S.-China relations quickly descend from the current modus vivendi to outright hostilities.While both the United States and China can be expected to avoid going to war, it's by no means difficult to imagine a scenario in which such a war might break out. Let's consider such a development from the perspective of a young Chinese computer technician named Xiaolu:After returning home from work one Friday evening, Xiaolu follows his usual practice of turning on his home computer and preparing to access his favorite overseas websites through proxies that will help him break through the Chinese government's internet firewall. To his great surprise, he finds himself able to freely browse the Voice of America website without a proxy. He tries the BBC Chinese-language website, and then Radio Free Asia, Epoch Times, Boxun, the Chinese-language websites of the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. . . surfing all of them with ease, he wonders if there's some bizarre fluke in the system. He quickly telephones a friend and tells him to give it a try, and the friend reports the same experience. Overjoyed, Xiaolu contacts all of his friends and tells them to log onto the internet as fast as they can.The situation continues the next day, and China's streets and microblogs are abuzz with the news. People wonder if the Chinese government has suddenly decided to lift its internet blockade, and if this means political reform has also been launched.Xiaolu stays glued to the internet all the next day and evening, too excited to sleep until he finally drifts off near dawn. By the time he awakens, the sun is high and the clock shows that noon is approaching. Luckily it's still the weekend, and Xiaolu doesn't need to be at work. Rolling groggily out of bed, he slouches over to his computer and goes online again, only to see a blank wall. Not only the foreign websites, but even China-based websites have disappeared and have been replaced with a uniform message of "Page not found." Shocked, disheartened and angry, Xiaolu wonders what happened. He turns on his television just in time to hear a CCTV presenter read out this news bulletin:"The United States has used the pretext of alleged Chinese hacker attacks on American websites to blame on the Chinese government and People's Liberation Army. These baseless accusations originate from the pathological fantasies of certain individuals in the United States, and we have always categorically refuted them. The United States is now using the pretext of 'freedom of information' to interfere with China's normal internet operations and oversight. This is a genuine cyberattack and a blatant cyberinvasion. It is a plot to overturn the Chinese government.Interfering with and sabotaging China's internet is a brazen violation of Chinese sovereignty and dignity. It is a last-ditch effort by American hegemonism to obstruct China's rise following its failure to impose 'peaceful evolution.'"Xiaolu now understands that his earlier access to overseas websites was due to the United States playing a technological wild card that destroyed China's internet blockade. His current inability to go online is due to the Chinese government taking the drastic step of cutting off all internet access after losing its "Great Firewall" to America's technical superiority.Through his shortwave radio, Xiaolu hears an announcement by the U.S. government:"Safeguarding freedom of expression and freedom of information is a universal value. The United States of America firmly upholds the Chinese people's freedom of information, the deprivation of which is an infringement of fundamental human rights. . . ."Related reports and discussion show that the cyber operation, codenamed "Airborne Freedom" and launched by the United States, is in fact retaliation for a cyberattack by China. China has for some time been carrying out cyberattacks and cyberespionage against U.S.-based websites, and repeated warnings from Washington to end the attacks have met with only temporary pullbacks by Beijing, followed by renewed onslaughts. Reaching the end of its patience, the United States has finally decided to take action, and a full-scale cyberwar has been launched between China and the United States.With internet access cut off, Chinese netizens begin taking to the street to express their indignation, their eyes directed straight forward or upward to signify their silent protest. The Chinese government issues an announcement: "The relevant departments have cut off internet access only as a temporary measure and as the only option. The United States, which launched a cyberattack to interfere with and sabotage normal internet operations in China, must take full responsibility."On the third night, internet access is miraculously restored. Strangely, however, unlike before, only overseas websites can be accessed, and almost no China-based websites. Xiaolu is initially baffled, but after surfing overseas websites, he gains an understanding of how the situation has developed.It turns out that after the Chinese government cut off all internet access, the United States used satellite technology to provide wireless internet service to China. Operation Airborne Freedom has entered its second phase. The U.S. government explains its rationale: "We first of all need to ensure that American organizations in China as well as the U.S. Embassy and consulates can continue to access the internet. . . . At the same time, we are helping the Chinese people to freely access information. . . ."The Sina and Sohu microblogging websites that Chinese netizens normally use have ceased operation, and have been replaced by internationally dominant social media such as Facebook and Twitter. The Chinese Baidu search engine has stopped working, but Google is available as a substitute, and Chinese netizens rejoice.The next day, the Chinese government plays a new card. The State Council issues a "Notice Regarding the Suspension of Internet Access":"Malicious interference and sabotage by hostile overseas forces resulting in severe chaos in the arrangements for our country's internet management has aroused mass outrage among the people. In order to ensure state security and normal information access, from this day forward the relevant departments will carry out comprehensive inspection, maintenance and rehabilitation of the internet. During this time, internet access will be suspended throughout the country.Specific provisions are as follows:1. Any work unit or individual who without authorization accesses the internet will be subject to confiscation of his computer, a fine, dismissal from employment or other penalties.2. Any individual who uses the internet to create or spread rumors or to transmit reactionary information, and in particular any individual who incites opposition or subversion of the government, will be held criminally liable.3. All internet cafes will be temporarily closed until further notice.4. Sales of computers must be registered under the purchaser's name. . . ."Over the next few days, China's netizens continue to enjoy access to overseas websites, and there is an explosive increase in satirical comments about the Chinese government on Facebook, Twitter and overseas Chinese internet forums. Rumors spread of police in some localities going door-to-door to examine internet browsing histories. Official media begin reporting on some people being investigated and having their computers confiscated. Overseas media report that rights defenders are being summoned and warned by the police, while some dissidents have been placed in criminal detention on allegations of using the internet to create or spread rumors to incite subversion of the government.Mobilized by netizens through Facebook and Twitter, increasing numbers of people begin standing in the streets with their eyes directed forward or upward in what come to be known as "stand-ins." Internet posting proclaim: "The Chinese people have stood up!" As another day passes, police are mobilized in a massive operation during which they physically push people away from "stand-ins." Some protesters who resist are arrested. Four police officers grab Xiaolu by his arms and legs and carry him off as he struggles and yells out, "The Chinese people have the right to stand up!"China's PLA Daily publishes a commentary entitled "Cyberinvasion is a War of Aggression," which states:"We must point out that cyberinvasion is a war of aggression. We sternly warn the American hegemonists that today's China is not the China of 1840; today's China is not a China that can be bullied or trampled upon. Under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party, we have achieved economic liftoff and military modernization that will bring about the great revival of the Chinese people. Our country and our people have the capacity to defend our homeland. In the face of serious provocation, the full force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army will resolutely follow the Party's command and is prepared to go to war at any time in retaliation against any who dare aggressive action against our country's sovereign rights and interests. We are prepared at all times to fight and to emerge victorious in repelling a frontal assault by the invaders. . . ."Load-Date: December 22, 2019End of Document

TIBETAN MAN DETAINED IN MARCH, NO WORD GIVEN TO FAMILYStates News ServiceNovember 7, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 574 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A Tibetan man detained by Chinese authorities in March has vanished in custody, with no word on his present whereabouts or charges made against him given to his family, a Tibetan advocacy group said on Thursday.Wangchuk, 45, was taken into custody on or around March 8 in Shigatse (in Chinese, Xigaze) prefecture after returning from a business trip to the regional capital Lhasa, the Dharamsala, India-based Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD) said.Wangchuk may have been detained for sharing politically sensitive material, including books by exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, on the popular Chinese social media platform WeChat, TCHRD said."He had received copies of these books from his friends living outside Tibet," the rights group said.News of detentions of Tibetans or of Tibetan protests against Chinese rule is frequently delayed in reaching outside contacts owing to strict communications clampdowns imposed by Chinese authorities in Tibetan areas.Relatives and friends have meanwhile received no word of Wangchuk's whereabouts or present condition, and family members have been subjected to travel restrictions and loss of state welfare payments and other benefits, the rights group said."Family members are restricted from traveling outside the county without written permission from the township government office. Increased surveillance from local authorities has disrupted the lives of family members," TCHRD said.Speaking to RFA's Tibetan Service, TCHRD researcher Pema Gyal said that Wangchuk's case shows how Chinese authorities in Tibet impose strict controls on social media use and restrict the Tibetan people's rights to openly access information and freely express themselves."The Chinese government's constant scrutiny has made it very difficult for Tibetan people to live in peace," Gyal said. "They have also announced rewards of 20,000 Chinese yuan for informants who report on [prohibited] activity.""This eventually provokes clashes and disrupts the unity of the Tibetan people."Rewards for informantsChinese authorities in Tibet now offer large cash rewards for information leading to the arrests of social-media users deemed disloyal to China, sources told RFA in earlier reports.Behaviors specified as illegal include online activities aimed at "attempting to overthrow [China's] socialist system," "advocating extremism," "destabilizing national security," and "defaming the People's Republic of China," according to a notice issued on Feb. 28 by three government departments of China's Tibet Autonomous Region.Also banned are online expressions of support for the Dalai Lama's Middle Way Policy, which calls for greater autonomy for Tibet while acknowledging Beijing's sovereignty over Tibetan areas now part of China.Regarded by Chinese leaders as a dangerous separatist, the Dalai Lama fled Tibet into exile in India in the midst of a failed 1959 national uprising against Chinese rule, and the sharing of the Dalai Lama's photo or teachings or public celebrations of his birthday have been harshly punished in the past.Authorities in Tibetan areas of China frequently monitor online discussions and search mobile phones for what they consider politically sensitive content, and foreign news broadcasts are heavily restricted.Reported by RFA's Tibetan Service.

AP Exclusive: China tightens up on info after Xinjiang leaksAssociated Press InternationalDecember 14, 2019 Saturday 6:41 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: DOMESTIC NEWSLength: 949 wordsByline: By The Associated PressBodyThe Xinjiang regional government in China's far west is deleting data, destroying documents, tightening controls on information and has held high-level meetings in response to leaks of classified papers on its mass detention camps for Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim minorities, according to four people in contact with government employees there.Top officials deliberated how to respond to the leaks in meetings at the Chinese Communist Party's regional headquarters in Urumqi, Xinjiang's capital, some of the people said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because of fears of retribution against themselves, family members and the government workers.The meetings began days after The New York Times published last month a cache of internal speeches on Xinjiang by top leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping. They continued after the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists worked with news organizations around the world including The Associated Press to publish secret guidelines for operating detention centers and instructions on how to use technology to target people.The Chinese government has long struggled with its 11-million-strong Uighur population, an ethnic Turkic minority native to Xinjiang, and in recent years has detained 1 million or more Uighurs and other minorities in the camps.Xinjiang officials and the Chinese foreign ministry have not directly denied the authenticity of the documents, though Urumqi Communist Party chief Xu Hairong called reports on the leaks "malicious smears and distortions."The Xinjiang government did not respond to a fax for comment on the arrests, the tightened restrictions on information and other measures responding to the leaks. The Chinese Foreign Ministry did not have an immediate comment.Xinjiang's government had already mandated stricter controls on information in October, before the news reports, according to three of the people, all Uighurs outside Xinjiang.They include orders for community-level officials to burn paper forms containing sensitive personal details on residents in their area such as their detention status, and for various state offices to throw away computers, tighten management of classified information, and ensure all information related to the camps is now stored on databases disconnected from the internet in special, restricted-access rooms to bar hackers, the Uighurs said."They became much more serious about the transfer of information," one said.Publication of the classified documents prompted the central government in Beijing to put more pressure on Xinjiang officials, several of the Uighurs said.Restrictions on information appear to be tightening further. Some university teachers and district-level workers in Urumqi have been ordered to clean out sensitive data on their computers, phones and cloud storage, and to delete work-related social media groups, according to one Uighur with direct knowledge of the situation.In other cases, the state appears to be confiscating evidence of detentions. Another Uighur who had been detained in Xinjiang years before said his ex-wife called him two weeks ago and begged him to send his release papers to her, saying eight officers had come to her home to search for the papers, then threatened she'd be jailed for life if she couldn't produce the papers."It's an old matter, and they've know I've been abroad for a long time," he said. "The fact that they suddenly want this now must mean the pressure on them is very high."Some government workers have been rounded up as the state investigates the source of the leaks. In one case an entire family in civil service was arrested. Abduweli Ayup, a Uighur linguist in exile, said his wife's relatives in Xinjiang - including her parents, siblings, and in-laws - were detained shortly after the leaks were published, although Ayup said they had no relation to the leaks as far as he was aware. Some people in touch with relatives outside China were also investigated and seized, Ayup said.It is unknown how many have been detained since the leaks.Earlier this week, a Uighur woman in the Netherlands told a Dutch daily, de Volkskrant, that she was the source of the documents published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. The woman, Asiye Abdulaheb, said that after she posted one page on social media in June, Chinese state agents sent her death threats and tried to recruit her ex-husband to spy on her.The leaked documents lay out the Chinese government's deliberate strategy to lock up ethnic minorities even before they commit a crime, and to rewire their thoughts and the language they speak. They reveal that facilities Beijing calls "vocational training schools" are forced ideological and behavioral re-education centers run in secret.The papers also show how Beijing is pioneering a new form of social control using data and artificial intelligence. Drawing on data collected by mass surveillance technology, computers issued the names of tens of thousands of people for interrogation or detention in just one week.The leaks come at a delicate time in relations between Washington and Beijing, amid ongoing negotiations to end a trade war and U.S. concerns about the situation in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory where police have clashed with pro-democracy protesters.Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved the Uighur Human Rights Policy Act, aimed at pressuring China over the mass detentions in Xinjiang. Beijing swiftly denounced the bill as foreign meddling. State media reported that the Chinese government was considering retaliatory measures including visa bans on U.S. officials.Load-Date: December 15, 2019End of Document

Mesut Ozil vs. China: Arsenal star makes human rights standCNN.comDecember 16, 2019 Monday 10:55 AM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: FOOTBALLLength: 1246 wordsByline: By Ravi Ubha, CNNBodyWith an hour gone and a sorry Arsenal trailing 3-0 to Manchester City Sunday, Mesut Ozil was substituted. He trudged from the pitch and as he approached the Arsenal bench petulantly kicked his gloves into the air.These are tough times for Ozil. He has become a lightning rod for Arsenal fans' dissatisfaction over the last few seasons as the club has slipped down the Premier League pecking order. Despite his undoubted creative talent, Ozil's languid playing style has led to criticism he lacks the fight to help his team.Sunday's substitution capped a torrid few days for Ozil, who has found himself at the center of a sporting and geopolitical row after a controversial tweet in which he took aim at China for its dealings with China's Muslim Uyghur minority in the northwest Xinjiang province.China is taking more and more of an interest in the world's game and it hasn't taken kindly to Ozil's social media intervention."Just because he's a well-known sportsman, it doesn't give him the right to comment on issues relating to the national interests and he needs to explain himself," was the verdict from online sports platform Sina Sports which released a post on Sina Weibo.READ: Mesut Ozil 'blinded by some fake news,' says ChinaThe US State Department has said that for the last two-and-a-half years, China has detained up to two million Uyghurs in what some describe as internment camps.Arsenal's German international is a devout Muslim with Turkish roots, and is good friends with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He is followed by more than 24 million on Twitter and reportedly Arsenal's highest paid player with a salary of Â£350,000 ($468,000) per week.The reaction to Ozil's tweet poses the wider question of whether athletes should steer clear of politics, or whether it is their right -- even responsibility -- to speak out.Football star Megan Rapinoe has long used her platform to campaign for equality, and recently urged Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo -- two of football's best ever players -- to speak up on non-sporting matters.Perhaps the most famous example of athletes speaking out is the Black Power salute of US athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos at the 1968 Mexico Olympics. It is generally celebrated as a progressive moment although it cost them dearly at the time. Colin Kaepernick's bended knee protest has also come at a price. He hasn't played in the NFL since 2016.READ: From the Black Power salute to Colin Kaepernick: What's changed?'Apolitical as an organization'Amnesty International said Ozil shouldn't be punished by Arsenal."In the past few years China has gone to incredible lengths to suppress information related to its unprecedented persecution of Muslims in Xinjiang," Amnesty International's business and human rights analyst William Nee told CNN. "Arsenal does not need to endorse Ozil's comments, but it must be aware that it is at risk of being a tool of Chinese censorship if it subsequently punishes him for his views."The reaction to Ozil's social media posts was swift from Chinese state broadcaster CCTV, which pulled Arsenal's marquee game Manchester City from its programming.Arsenal released a statement over the weekend saying that it's "always apolitical as an organization" and wanted to make clear "that these are Mesut's personal views." Yet the north London club didn't wade in after Hector Bellerin's bold political message last week on the day of the UK general election.The fullback used the hashtag, "F**kBoris," referring to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose Conservative Party ended up winning the vote.Arsenal has been outside the Premier League title reckoning for years, but with players making declarations on social media or its sealing eye-catching sponsorship deals -- as it did with Rwanda last year -- the club continues to attract headlines."Ozil is perfectly entitled to his own opinions and of course he should have the freedom to express them wherever he chooses," Simon Chadwick, professor of sports enterprise at the University of Salford near Manchester in England, told CNN.But Chadwick says it is more complex than that."He tweeted his messages about China via an account in which he specifically and primarily references his work at Arsenal," said Chadwick. "For many employees in most organizations, it is obvious and is often made clear that social media posts should not be made in the name of one's employing organization."Either Ozil was extremely remiss in making his comments in this way or else Arsenal hasn't effectively communicated with an employee regarding social media use."As for Arsenal's response, it seems to betray an absence of policy and strategy within the organization. The club should have been telling players not to make controversial political statements on social media, or else instruct them to do so from accounts that do not mention and are not associated with the club."Because they haven't been doing this, we now have a situation where the club is distancing itself from Ozil but not from Bellerin."Asked to comment Monday on Chadwick's thoughts, Arsenal reverted to its earlier statement.'Hugely sensitive' and 'very complicated'Chinese business is becoming a big player in world football. English Premier League side Wolves is owned by Chinese conglomerate Fosun and Southampton is owned by Chinese businessman Gao Jisheng."Arsenal is not alone in being somewhat clumsy in responding to such problems," added Chadwick. "Many European football clubs do not understand China at all well, hence they are prone to making gaffs."China is a hugely sensitive and often very complicated environment in which to do business. Many clubs are happy to take the money on offer in China but frequently fail to understand the context within which they do this."The Chinese government has become involved in the Ozil saga, inviting the 31-year-old to visit Xinjiang province to "distinguish right from wrong." He was "blinded by some fake news and influenced by some false words," according to a spokesman from the Chinese Foreign Ministry."He doesn't know that the Chinese government protects Chinese citizens, including the Uyghur ethnic people's freedom of religious belief, in accordance with the law," spokesman Geng Shuang said in a daily press briefing Monday.It is the second time in a matter of months sports has collided with politics in China.CCTV didn't air, as first planned, pre-season NBA games in October after Houston Rockets' general manager Daryl Morey's now deleted tweet in support of the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. NBA commissioner Adam Silver backed Morey's freedom of expression, which escalated matters.In Manchester City's pre-season tour of China in July as part of the Asia Trophy, the defending Premier League champion was criticized by Chinese media for not interacting more with local fans and media. It went with a "desire to win wallets, not hearts and minds," according to an editorial on the English language website of China's state-run press agency Xinhua."After some issues during Manchester City's tour to China this summer and the recent NBA controversy, it was only a matter of time before a Premier League player, club or the league itself became embroiled in such a problem," said Chadwick. "And this isn't just happening in sport, it is a regular issue for westerners across a range of industrial sectors."Visit our football page for more news and videosThe Premier League refused to comment.Load-Date: December 17, 2019End of Document

THE FIRST SEMINAR ON CHINA HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT TRAINING PROGRAMS TO RWANDA HELD SUCCESSFULLY FROM CHINESE EMBASSY IN RWANDAStates News ServiceDecember 6, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 548 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:On December 4th, 2019, the first Seminar on China Human Resources Development Training Programs to Rwanda was successfully held in Kigali. His Excellency Rao Hongwei, Chinese Ambassador to Rwanda, attended the event and delivered a speech. Mr. Zephanie Niyonkuru, Deputy CEO of Rwanda Development Board, Mr. Costantin Rukundo, Commissioner of Rwandan Patriotic Front, Heads of the human resource development departments of relevant institutions as well as about 200 trainee representatives attended the seminar.Ambassador RAO Hongwei said that China and Rwanda have carried out fruitful cooperation on human resources development in recent years. During the Chinese presidential visit to Rwanda in July 2018, the two heads of state witnessed the signing of an MOU on human resource development cooperation, which marked a new milestone in the evolution of the human resources development cooperation between two countries. In 2019, China Human Resources Training Programs made significant breakthrough in Rwanda. 353 Rwandan personnel benefited from the training programs hosted by the Chinese Government, reaching a historic record level.Ambassador RAO Hongwei said that Rwandan people are striving for the Vision 2050, aiming at higher income and higher living standards. China will continue to deepen cooperation with Rwanda in human resources development, provide Rwanda with more training opportunities and nurture Rwandan talents urgently required in various areas. China wishes more and more Rwandans benefit from China-Rwanda human resources development cooperation.Mr. Costantin Rukundo, Commissioner of Rwandan Patriotic Front highly appreciated the human resources training program hosted by the Chinese Government to Rwanda. He said that China has been helping Rwanda achieve independent and sustainable development by the way of teaching people how to fish. Through these training programs, Rwanda learned the valuable experience in running the Party and State from the Communist Party of China, which provided useful references for the construction of Rwandan Patriotic Front.Mr. Zephanie Niyonkuru, Deputy CEO of Rwanda Development Board spoke highly of the positive effects of the China Human Resources Development Training Programs, expressed appreciation to the Chinese Government for its long-standing strong support to Rwanda and wished to further strengthen cooperation in the field of human resources between two countries.The seminar was filled with warmth and harmony.

This news is overshadowing a separate Reuters report discussing why a Phase Two deal is unlikely to get done before the election.In any event, the Bloomberg report has helped catalyze a risk-on bias along with the news that Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.03, +0.83, +1.7%) is buying TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.45, +3.32, +6.9%) in a $26 billion stock deal, LVMH is acquiring Tiffany & Co.

(MDCO 83.83, +15.28, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash.These deals have helped give an added lift to the financial (+0.6%), consumer discretionary (+0.9%), and healthcare (+0.7%) sectors, which are among today's leaders.The biggest gainer, however, is the information technology sector (1.2%). Such outperformance typically follows when the market is feeling good about trade developments, yet it is being bolstered further by a hot semiconductor group, which is drafting off a Morgan Stanley upgrade of NVIDIA (NVDA 220.40, +9.51, +4.5%) to Overweight from Equal Weight. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.2%.Strikingly, longer-dated Treasury securities are also up today, which means their yields are lower, indicating that not everyone is sharing the same risk-on, growth-oriented mindset as the stock market. The 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.76%.The Russell 2000 is up 1.7%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 1.2%; the S&P 500 is up 0.6%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.5%.10:17OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:CPRI Weekly Nov29 36;5 calls are seeing interest with 3660 contracts trading vs. open int of 20, pushing implied vol up around 9 points to ~37%.

The energy sector (-0.2%) is the lone sector trading lower.U.S. Treasuries are little changed. The 2-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.62%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.37.

Study LJ401-BT01 is a pivotal, multinational, multicenter, randomized, controlled study with a target enrollment of approximately 100 patients that is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LJPC-401 as a treatment for iron overload in beta thalassemia (BT) patients who, despite chelation therapy, have cardiac iron levels above normal. The primary endpoint of this study is the change in cardiac iron levels, as measured by cardiac T2* magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), from baseline to 6 months following treatment. The Company recently conducted an interim analysis that included approximately one-half of the target-enrolled patients. There were no significant differences in the primary endpoint or key secondary endpoints between patients on the treatment arm and patients on the control arm.Topline results of Study LJ401-HH01 are also now available. Topline results from this study are consistent with the interim results reported in June 2019. The change in TSAT from baseline to the end of treatment (16 weeks), the primary efficacy endpoint of the study, was statistically significant: LJPC-401-treated patients had a mean reduction in TSAT of 33% compared to placebo-treated patients who had a mean reduction of 3% (p<0.0001). The requirement for and frequency of phlebotomy procedures, a key secondary endpoint of the study, was statistically significant: LJPC-401-treated patients had 0.10 phlebotomies per month compared to placebo-treated patients who had 0.50 phlebotomies per month (p<0.0001). LJPC-401 was well tolerated. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were injection site reactions (ISRs), which occurred in 79% of LJPC-401-treated patients compared to 6% of placebo-treated patients. The ISRs were all mild or moderate in severity, and no ISRs resulted in treatment discontinuation.The company expects to re-evaluate its current operating plan in light of the mixed results of these studies and to make adjustments as appropriate to manage the company's available cash resources.08:31LJPC La Jolla Pharm President/CEO George Tidmarsh, M.D., Ph.D., leaves the company to pursue other interests (5.58 )A search for a new Chief Executive Officer has been initiated.

We reiterate that we reject Xerox's proposal as it significantly undervalues HP. Additionally, it is highly conditional and uncertain. In particular, there continues to be uncertainty regarding Xerox's ability to raise the cash portion of the proposed consideration and concerns regarding the prudence of the resulting outsized debt burden on the value of the combined company's stock even if the financing were obtained. Consequently, your proposal does not constitute a basis for due diligence or negotiation.We believe it is important to emphasize that we are not dependent on a Xerox combination. We have great confidence in our strategy and the numerous opportunities available to HP to drive sustainable long-term value, including the deployment of our strong balance sheet for increased share repurchases of our significantly undervalued stock and for value-creating M&A. The HP Board of Directors is committed to serving the best interests of HP shareholders, not Xerox and its shareholders. HP has numerous opportunities to create value for HP shareholders on a standalone basis. We will not let aggressive tactics or hostile gestures distract us from our responsibility to pursue the most value-creating path.06:22ZIOP ZIOPHARM presents clinical data for controlled IL-12; reinforced favorable safety profile and initial data (4.72 )Co announced the presentation of new interim analyses of clinical data from two ongoing substudies in its Controlled IL-12 platform, or Ad-RTS-hIL-12 plus veledimex (Ad+V), both as monotherapy and in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor, for the treatment of recurrent or progressive glioblastoma multiforme (rGBM) in adults.Interim Update ReportedDecrease in tumor from baseline (time of Ad+V administration) resulting in a patient's lesion being too small to measure, assessed as a partial response (per iRANO), with follow up ongoing Subjects were comparable to the Main study except a higher percentage in the Expansion substudy had multifocal disease vs. unifocal disease and fewer recurrences Based on study design there was, as expected, a higher percentage of subjects in the Expansion substudy as compared with Main study (75% vs 40%) who received low-dose concurrent steroids Local, regulated IL-12 production using Ad+V in subjects with rGBM rapidly and safely activates the immune system06:21JEC Jacobs beats by $0.17, beats on revs; initiates $250 mln accelerated share repurchase program, offers FY20 Adj-EBITDA guidance (93.38 )Reports Q4 (Sep) earnings of $1.48 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.17 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.31; revenues rose 13.4% year/year to $3.39 bln vs the $3.29 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus."It's clear the strategic actions we have taken are resulting in a high-performance culture with strong execution discipline.

The ZEN Study was an open-label, single-center, randomized, 2-way crossover study to evaluate the relative bioavailability of varenicline administered as a preservative-free nasal spray (OC-01 nasal spray) as compared to varenicline administered orally as a single oral dose of Chanti.Top-line results indicate that the relative bioavailability (systemic exposure as defined by adjusted geometric mean AUC0-inf) was 13 times lower for a single dose of the highest strength of OC-01 nasal spray as compared to a single dose of the highest strength Chantix tablet (7.46 vs 99.67 h*ng/ml). Maximal concentration (as defined by adjusted geometric mean Cmax) was 14 times lower for a single dose of the highest strength of OC-01 nasal spray as compared to a single dose of the highest strength Chantix tablet (0.32 vs 4.55 ng/ml). The study demonstrated that OC-01 nasal spray was safe and well-tolerated at the doses tested. The number of subjects reporting any treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was 13 out of 21 (61.9%) after nasal spray administration and 9 out of 22 (22.9%) after oral tablet administration but there were no reports of serious TEAE noted with either oral or nasal administration.

National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien also inferred that the two sides were very close to a deal. This has been taken as a positive sign for trade talks and markets are responding in kind. Although the S&P Futures are up over eight points and trading around the 3119 area, the overall range was less than five handles. The overnight high currently resides at 3121.25, while the low sits at 3116.50.In Asia, both China and Japan closed higher on the day. The reports that China would crack down on IP theft has resonated across the equity complex. This helped the Shanghai rise 0.7%. The Nikkei also caught a bid and had its largest gain in two weeks with its rise of 0.8%.European markets are trading with the same tone as the US and Asia.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) edged above the S&P 500 (+0.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%), and Russell 2000 (+0.3%).The market heard from both President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, President Xi, on Friday. Mr. Xi called for mutual respect and equality in talks, but reiterated Beijing is willing to fight back if necessary. Mr. Trump said talks are moving along nicely and closing in on a deal, but the president suggested a deal should not be equal and should favor the U.S. instead.The takeaway was that the market still doesn't know for certain if a Phase One trade agreement will be signed this year, but talks are ongoing and appear to not be escalating. Separately, an upwardly revised reading in the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November was supportive for equities today.Leading the market in gains were the S&P 500 financials (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.7%), and industrials (+0.5%) sectors. The real estate (-0.5%) and energy (-0.4%) sectors were today's laggards.Nordstrom (JWN 37.95, +3.63, +10.6%) and Gap (GPS 16.94, +0.72, +4.4%) were among the biggest earnings-driven gainers in the consumer discretionary space, while an earnings-driven decline in Intuit (INTU 259.81, -11.34, -4.2%) put some pressure on the information technology sector (-0.1%).Elsewhere, the futuristic design of Tesla's (TSLA 333.04, -21.79, -6.1%) Cybertruck pickup was met with some confusion and mixed reviews. Ultimately, it appeared to be a sell-the-news case after the stock climbed about 40% in the past month.U.S. Treasuries ended the week on a flat note. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield was unchanged at 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.26. WTI crude declined 1.2%, or $0.70, to $57.88/bbl.Friday's economic data was limited to the revised reading for the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November:The final November reading for the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index checked in at 96.8 (Briefing.com consensus 94.9), which exceeded the preliminary estimate of 95.7 and the final October reading of 95.5. The November reading is in close proximity to the average level (97.0) since the start of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is the acknowledgment that consumers aren't anticipating sizable increases in inflation, unemployment, and interest rates, which suggests consumer spending activity should remain supportive for the U.S. economy.Investors will not receive any economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +28.4% YTDS&P 500 +24.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.5% YTDRussell 2000 +17.8% YTD16:12AGIO Agios Pharma presents new phamacodynamic and response data from both cohorts of perioperative study of vorasidenib and TIBSOVO (37.33 -0.85)Agios Pharma presented updated data from the ongoing perioperative study, confirming brain penetrance and robust biomarker suppression with treatment of single agent vorasidenib or TIBSOVO (ivosidenib) in low-grade glioma with an IDH1 mutation.As of the July 26, 2019 data cutoff, 49 patients were randomized before surgery, and 39 remain on treatment. The median (range) postoperative treatment duration for all doses was 5.42 (0.9-13.5) months for vorasidenib and 6.93 (1.0-13.2) months for TIBSOVO. Baseline characteristics were similar across the control and treated groups. Overall, 88% of patients had World Health Organization classified Grade 2 tumors. Less than a third of patients had prior radiation therapy and approximately half had prior systemic therapy.The safety analysis conducted for all 49 patients as of the data cut-off demonstrated that vorasidenib and TIBSOVO continue to have favorable safety profiles consistent with the Phase 1 data. 8.3% of patients in the vorasidenib group developed transaminase elevations, including one Grade 3 transaminase elevation at 50 mg daily which resolved with dose interruption. Grade 3 or higher events occurred in six (25.0%) vorasidenib patients and four (16.0%) TIBSOVO patients, with the majority related to postoperative complications. No patient discontinued treatment due to an AE.Data from the 42 efficacy evaluable patients (21 in the vorasidenib arm; 21 in the TIBSOVO arm) as of the data cut-off showed: among patients treated post-operatively with 50 mg vorasidenib, four patients (31%) achieved objective tumor responses (two achieved a partial response, defined as tumor shrinkage based on T2/FLAIR signal of at least 50%, and two achieved a minor response, defined as tumor shrinkage based on T2/FLAIR signal of at least 25% but less than 50%) according to the investigator by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology for low-grade glioma.Vorasidenib and TIBSOVO demonstrated brain penetrance, with mean brain:plasma ratios of 3.16 (vorasidenib 10 mg), 1.74 (vorasidenib 50 mg), 0.13 (TIBSOVO 250 mg), and 0.10 (TIBSOVO 500 mg). Mean percent reduction in 2-HG (95% CI) were 92.6% (76.1, 97.6) and 91.1% (72.0, 97.0), for vorasidenib 50 mg and TIBSOVO 500 mg, respectively, relative to untreated samples.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: November 25, 2019End of Document

CHINA ISSUES CONTRADICTORY STATEMENTS ON FATE OF PARENTS OF UYGHUR ACTIVIST IN EXILEStates News ServiceNovember 21, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1174 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:China's government has provided contradictory statements regarding the fate of the parents of a Uyghur activist in exile from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) after his case was highlighted by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to the activist.In a Nov. 5 statement, Pompeo said that the U.S. was "deeply troubled" by reports that China's government "has harassed, imprisoned, or arbitrarily detained family members of Uighur Muslim activists and survivors of Xinjiang internment camps who have made their stories public," in some cases, shortly after meetings with senior State Department officials.In particular, Pompeo mentioned Alfred Erkinalso known as Arafat Erkinand two other Uyghurs he met with in March, saying they and their families had been "directly impacted by the Chinese Communist Party's campaign of repression" in the XUAR, and calling on Beijing to "cease all harassment of Uighurs living outside of China, to release all those arbitrarily detained, and to allow families to communicate freely without repercussions."Five days later, an article carried by the English language version of the official China News Service cited a spokesperson of the XUAR government refuting Pompeo's statement, saying that "the family members of the said three activists live and work normally in Xinjiang."The spokesperson specifically dismissed claims by Erkin that his mother was placed in one of the XUAR's vast network of internment camps, where authorities are believed to have held up to 1.5 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities accused of harboring "strong religious views" and "politically incorrect" ideas since April 2017 and that his father had been arrested and sentenced in March 2018."The reality is that his father was sentenced because of his involvement in terrorist activities, while his mother, younger brother and younger sister all live a normal life," the article said, citing the spokesperson, who also urged Pompeo to "stop smearing and attacking Xinjiang with rumors."On Nov. 16, China's official Global Times tabloid daily tweeted a video it had produced in which it claimed that its reporters had spoken with the family members of Erkin and the two other Uyghurs mentioned by Pompeo, and "busted the lies peddled by [the] US Secretary of State" about the XUAR.In a segment of the video dated Nov. 12, the Global Times interviews Erkin's mother Gulnar Talat, who says she and other members of the family are "doing great at home" and "living a good life."She tells her son, who has been granted asylum in the U.S., that he "couldn't have studied overseas without a strong motherland [at] your back," exhorting him to study hard and "honor the country in the future."The Global Times also interviewed Erkin's uncle, Asat Talat, who said he had learned that his nephew was "posting rumors on social media" since he traveled to the U.S. in 2015 to study finance at a university in New York."We didn't send you abroad for thiswe thought you would focus on studying and be a useful man to the country when you return," he said."After learning about your shameful deeds, we were so disappointed."Contradictory statementsThe same day that the Global Times published its video, Erkin tweeted a confirmation that it included interviews with his relatives, saying that viewing it had left him "trembling" after seeing his mother's face and hearing her voice for the first time in more than two years."[I] saw my mom and my uncle in [the] Chinese government's propaganda video," he said, noting in a later tweet that it had not included any information about his father.Erkin also vowed to cease speaking out on social media if the Chinese government agreed to release his father, and even to hand himself over to authorities in China in exchange for his family being allowed to resettle in another country.He said that his mother appeared physically unstable in the video, which he claimed "proves my previous testimony" because she "went through [a] big [surgery] following her release from the camp after [she was] detained [for] over a year."Two days later, Erkin tweeted that he had received an email from the U.N.'s Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances (WGEID), to which he had submitted a request earlier this year, asking the group to inquire with China on his behalf about his parents' situation.According to the U.N. email, which Erkin tweeted a photo of, China said that his father, a journalist with the Yi-Li TV Station and resident of Ghulja (in Chinese, Yining) city named Erkin Tursun, was sentenced on May 5, 2018 to 19 years and 10 months of imprisonment and two years of deprivation of political rights for "harboring a criminal and inciting national enmity or discrimination."The rare response from China seemed to contradict earlier information provided by the XUAR spokesperson to the China News Service, that Tursun had been sentenced for "terrorist activities."Erkin also tweeted a photo of another section of the U.N. email, which said that China had also responded to the inquiry about his mothera teacher at the No. 9 Kindergarten in Ghuljasaying only that "now she lives an ordinary life."Erkin noted that the response seemed to imply that Talat had formerly been held in an internment camp, despite the XUAR government spokesperson's claims that she had never been detained."It's amazing that they are exposing their lies themselves," he said in an accompanying tweet.Mass incarcerationsMass incarcerations in the XUAR, as well as other policies seen to violate the rights of Uyghurs and other Muslims, have led to increasing calls by the international community to hold Beijing accountable for its actions in the region.While Beijing initially denied the existence of the internment camps, China this year changed tack and began describing the facilities as "boarding schools" that provide vocational training for Uyghurs, discourage radicalization, and help protect the country from terrorism, and Geng reiterated those points during his regular press briefing in the capital.Reporting by RFA's Uyghur Service and other media organizations, however, has shown that those in the camps are detained against their will and subjected to political indoctrination, routinely face rough treatment at the hands of their overseers, and endure poor diets and unhygienic conditions in the often overcrowded facilities.Pompeo last month singled out China as one of the worst perpetrators of abuse against people of faith, particularly in the XUAR.In September, at an event on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John J. Sullivan said that the U.N. has failed to hold China to account over its policies in the XUAR and should demand unfettered access to the region to investigate reports of the mass incarceration and other rights abuses against Uyghurs.Reported by Gulchehra Hoja for RFA's Uyghur Service.

Documents uncover horror from Chinese detention centersCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 24, 2019 SundayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 3100 wordsBodyControl towers, double-locked doors and video surveillance are there to 'prevent leaks'.' Uighurs and other minorities held in place are catalogued from how well Mandarin speaks and follow the strict rules for everything, including how they bathe and use the toilet. The score they receive decides if they can leave.'Teaching of manners' is mandatory, but courses to 'improve vocational skills' are offered only when they have been in detention for a year.The Chinese government has arrested nearly one million people, mostly from Muslim ethnic minorities, for what it calls voluntary job training. But a classified action plan leaked to a group of journalistic organizations reveals that these camps are exactly what people who were held there describe: secret centers of ideological re-education and behavior.The highly confidential documents contain a deliberate strategy by the Chinese government to lock up ethnic minorities to change their thinking and even the language they speak.They show how Beijing is at the forefront of a new form of social control based on the use of information and artificial intelligence. For example, from information collected using surveillance technologies, computers produced the names of tens of thousands of people to be questioned or detained in just one week.Together, the documents provide the most relevant description so far of how mass detention centres work, from the Chinese government itself. Experts say it details a vast system that detects targets, monitors and classifies ethnic groups, to beseen by force, especially uighurs, a Turkish minority of about 10 million people with their own language and culture."They confirm that this is a form of cultural genocide,"' said Adrian Zenz, security expert from the Xinjiang region in the far west of China, where many Uighurs live. They want to change, assimilate, subdue entire ethnic groups... They reveal that, from the outset, the Chinese government had a plan.''Zenz said the documents reflect the camp objective expressed in a 2017 report from the local branch of Xinjiang's Ministry of Justice: "Brainwashing, purifying hearts, supporting what is right, eliminating what is wrong."China has been trying to control Xinjiang, where Uighurs have been trying to control Beijing's heavy-handed government for decades. After the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, Chinese authorities began to justify severe security measures and religious restrictions by saying they were necessary to contain terrorism, arguing that many Uighurs were susceptible to the influence of Islamic extremists from other countries. Hundreds of people have since been killed in terrorist attacks, reprisals and racial riots, both Uighur and chinese of the majority ethnic group.In 2014, Chinese President Xi Jinping launched what he described as the "People's War on Terror" in response to Uighur bombings at a train station in Xinjiang's capital Urumqui, just hours after he concluded his first visit officer to that area."You have to build steel walls and iron fortresses. Place nets up and traps down,'' Xi would have said, according to the official press. "Strong repressing of terrorist activities should be the target of our current struggle."In 2016, repression intensified dramatically, after Xi appointed Chen Quanguo, a hard-line official transferred from Tibet, as Xinjiang's new administrator. Most of the documents wereissued in 2017, when Xi's war on terror gave way to an extraordinary campaign of mass detainments.(AP)These practices are maintained today. The Chinese government says they're working."It is precisely because of a series of preventive counter-terrorism measures and to contain extremism taken in a timely manner that Xinjiang, which had been plagued by terrorism, has not seen a single incident in three years,' said Geng Shuang, spokesman for the ministry of foreign relations.Geng did not speak of the specifically leaked documents, but Liu Xiaoming, China's ambassador to the UK, said they were 'pure inventions''.The documents were delivered to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists by an anonymous source. The Consortium verified their authenticity by comparing them with state press reports and public notifications of the time, consulting experts, comparing Zhu's firm with other samples and confirming the content with former employees and inmates of the centers Detention.They consist of a series of guidelines to follow in the camps, four bulletins on how to use technology to put a person in the crosshairs and a case in which a Uighur member of the Communist Party was sentenced to ten years in prison for telling his colleagues that  don't say bad words, watch pornography or eat without having prayed.The documents were distributed to all officials by the powerful Committee on Political and Legal Affairs of the Communist Party of Xinjiang, which oversees the police, courts and state security. They were personally signed by the top official of that time, Zhu Hailun.Through the documents, the government itself confirms what was already known about the camps by the testimonies of dozens of Uighurs and Kazakhs, satellite images and visits by heavily supervised journalists.Erzhan Qurban, of Kazakh origin and who left for Kazakhstan, was arrested by police when he returned to see his mother and accused of committing crimes abroad. He said he was a simple shepherd who had done nothing wrong. For the Chinese authorities, however, the time he spent in Kazakhstan was reason enough to arrest him.Qurban said he was locked in a cell with ten others last year and was warned not to engage in ''religious activities'' such as praying. They were forced to sit on benches with stiff postures for hours.They couldn't talk and two guards were watching them 24 hours a day. Inspectors made sure they had short nails and no moustaches or beards, which are a tradition among devout Muslims.Those who disobeyed these orders were forced to cend or spent an entire day alone in icy rooms."That wasn't education, it was punishment,"" said Qurban, who was held for nine months. They treated me like an animal. It was torture. I just wanted to get shot,'' he added.Who are arrested and why?On February 18, 2017 Zhu, the Chinese official who signed the documents, planted a cold winter morning on the stairs of the capital's municipal town and observed thousands of black-clad policemen, brandishing rifles."With the powerful fist of the People's Democratic Dictatorship, all separatist activities and all terrorists will be shattered,' Zhou said by a microphone.A new chapter in the state's repression was launched at the time. Police summoned the Uighurs and knocked on their doors at night for interrogations. Others were arrested at the border or at airports.In the years since, Uighurs and Kazakhswere sent to heaps of detention camps and the government built hundreds of schools and orphanages to house and re-educate their children. Many of those who went into exile do not know where their children or loved ones are.The documents make it clear that many of the detainees did nothing. One document explicitly states that the purpose of digital surveillance was to 'prevent problems before they arise'.' In other words, suppose who might rebel and arrest him before he did.This is done from a surveillance system called integrated joint operations platform or POCI. Developed by a state-owned military contractor, POCI began as a tool to share intelligence information developed after Chinese theorists studied the U.S. military's use of the technology information in Iraq and Afghanistan."There's nowhere else in the world where a computer can send you to a confinement camp,"' said Rian Thum, Xinjiang expert at the University of Nottingham. This has no precedent.''THE POCI produced names of people deemed suspicious, including thousands of 'unauthorised' magnets -- which were not registered with the Chinese government -- and its collaborators. The description of suspicious behavior was so broad that it included simply traveling abroad, asking someone to pray, or using phone applications that cannot be monitored by the government.THE POCI focused on users of 'Kuai Ya'', a cell phone app similar to the iPhone's Airdrop, which became popular in Xinjiang because it allows people to share videos and messages privately. One bulletin indicated that the authorities identified more than 40,000 Kuai Ya users for investigation and perhaps arrest. Of these, 32 were classified as belonging to "terrorist organizations.""They fear that people will spread religion through 'Kuai Ya'," a arrested individual said after police accused him of using the app. He spoke on the condition that he was not identified to protect himself and his family. "They can't regulate it... Then they want to stop everyone who has used 'Kuai Ya''.Of special interest were people who obtained foreign passports or visas, reflecting the government's fear of the influence of foreign Islamic extremists and their unease with any connection between the Uighurs and the outside world. Authorities were asked to verify the identities of people outside the country, revealing how China is watching uighurs even away from Xinjiang.Documents revealing the horror that thousands of people experienced in China. (AP)In recent years Beijing has lobbied countries that Uighurs, such as Thailand and Afghanistan, to send them back to China. In other nations, state security contacted the Uighurs and loundered them to spy on each other. For example, a restaurant owner in Turkey, Qurbanjan Nurmemet, said police called him with videos of his son tied to a chair and asked him for information from other Uighurs in Turkey.Despite the Chinese government's insistence that the camps are vocational training centres for the poor and the uneducated, the documents reveal that PC officials and university students are among the detainees.Once the names are produced, the lists of people are passed in the crosshairs to the regional authorities, who in turn hand them over to the district heads and then to the police stations, the militants who monitor the activities of the neighborhood and the pc's cadres living with Uigure families s.Some ex-detainees say they were cited by the authorities andthey were informed that their names were on the lists of people to be arrested. From there they moved to different levels of the system, which can be house arrest, detention centers with three levels of supervision and, in the most extreme cases, prison.Experts say the detensions are a clear violation of China's laws and constitution. Maggie Lewis, a professor of Chinese law at Seton Hall University in the United States, said the PC is ignoring the Chinese legal system in the Xinjiang case."When you're labeled an enemy, they go to war,"" he said. They don't even try to legally justify it... This is arbitrary.''The sweeps to send people to these camps seem wide. A bulletin says that in a single week in June 2017 the POCI identified 24,612 "suspicious persons" in Southern Xinjiang and that 15,683 were sent to ''education and training'' centers, 706 to prisons and 2,096 were placed under house arrest. It is not known if this is a typical week. Local officials say there are fewer than a million people receiving 'training'', but some researchers estimate that up to 1.8 million people may have been arrested at one time or another.The newsletters emphasize that the relationship must be carefully analyzed and that the people questioned must be pressured to give the names of friends and family. Mamattursum Omar, a Uighur chief arrested after working in Egypt, was interrogated in four detention centres over nine months. He told the PA that the police asked him to verify the identities of other Uighurs in Egypt.At one point, he claimed, they began torturing him into confessing that Uighur students had gone to Egypt to participate in a holy war. They tied him to what the Chinese call a 'tiger chair', gave him electric shocks, beat him with tubes and whipped him with computer wires."I couldn't stand it,"' Omar admits. I told them everything they wanted me to tell them.''Omar gave the names of six people who worked with him in a restaurant in Egypt. They were all sent to prison.What happens in underground centers?The documents also detail what happens when someone is sent to an 'education and training center''.The State Council of China recently said in a report that "the personal freedom of individuals in education and training centers is protected under the law." But the documents describe facilities with police units at the entrance, towers with guards, alarms that work by pressing a button and video surveillance systems that observe every corner.Inmates are allowed to leave alone in emergencies, such as illness, and must be accompanied by someone who 'supervises and controls them'. The use of cell phones is strictly prohibited to avoid 'conflinks between inside and outside'.'AP journalists who visited several camps in December 2018 saw towers with guards and high walls with barbed wire. A camp in Artux, north of Kashgar, was in the middle of a large, empty, rocky terrain and appeared to have a police station at the entrance, workshops, a hospital and dormitories, one with a sign that read 'workers' house'.Recent satellite images show that surveillance towers and fences were removed at some facilities, suggesting that some facilities eased their restrictions in response to international criticism. Shohrat Zakir, governor of Xinjiang, said in March that detainees could now apply to spend weekends at their homes, something that theAP could not independently confirm.The first area of the programme of these centres is ideological education, which seeks to change the way detainees think and act. It responds in part to an old Chinese belief that people can be transformed through education, a philosophy that was taken to extremes in the time of Mao Zedong."We went back to the dark days of the Cultural Revolution, except that they now employ high-tech,'" said Zenz, the researcher.It is assumed that by showing students their past mistakes, the centers promote "repentance and confession," according to the board. For example, Qurban, the Kazakh pastor, was handcuffed, interrogated by a Chinese han and forced to admit that he regretted traveling abroad.Indoctrination is accompanied by a 'modal education'', which teaches how to behave and "cut your hair and shave punctually," to 'change clothes regularly'' and to 'bath once or twice a week''. The tone of the document reflects the widespread government perception of the Chinese that Uighurs are prone to violence and must be civilized, as white colonial forces did in the Americas and Australia."It's a similar mindset projected by a savior that these poor Uighurs didn't understand were being led astray by extremists,"" said Darren Byler, an expert on Uighur culture at the University of Washington. They think uighurs are retarded, they have no education... dirty people, who have to be taught how to wash.''Students should be allowed to make a phone call to their relatives at least once a week and can connect with them with video at least once a month, according to documents. Those who are receiving training are told to pay attention "to the ideological problems and emotional changes that arise when they communicate with their families."Mandarin is mandatory. Beijing said that "the customs of ethnic groups and the right to use their spoken and written language are protected in the centres." The documents, however, indicate that in practice, classes are in Mandarin and that this is the language used in daily communications.The center where the Chinese would exercise ideological indoctrination to ethnic minorities. (AP)A former Xinjiang TV employee now living in Europe was selected to teach Mandarin during his month in 2017. He said that twice a day detainees had to line up and be checked by the police. A few randomly chosen were interrogated in Mandarin, he noted. Those who could not answer in Mandarin were beaten or deprived of food for days. Or they were prohibited from speaking.One day, the former teacher recalled, a policeman asked an old peasant, in Mandarin, if he liked the detention center. The man apologized by speaking a broken Mandarin in Uighur, explaining that he struggled to understand it by his age. The officer approached him and hit him on the head with a cane. The man fell to the floor, bleeding."They don't see us as human beings,"' said the former teacher, who did not want to give his name for fear that his family will suffer reprisals. They treated us like animals. Like pigs, cows, sheep.''Detainees are given tests of Mandarin, ideology and discipline. One short exam per week, a slightly longer test per month and a large one at the end of the year. The results are incorporated into a complex scoring system. Those who get good grades are rewarded with benefits such as family visits and can even "graduate" and leave. Those who do poorly are placed under stricter programs, with longer periods of detention. Ex-detainees told THE PA that the punishmentsinclude food deprivation, handcuffing, solitary confinement, beatings and torture.Inmate scores are incorporated into the POCI. Students are sent to programs to 'improve vocational skills' only after they have studied at least one year of ideology, law and Mandarin.When they leave these programs, the documents say, every effort must be made to get them to work. Some detainees said they were forced to sign contracts that made them work long hours, on low wages, and prevented them from leaving the factory during the week.Qurban said that after spending nine months in detention, a supervisor called him and told him that he had been ''forgiven'', but that he should never tell what he had seen. When he returned to his village, he was told to work in a factory."If you don't, they send you back to the center," one official said.Qurban showed up for a clothing workshop, which he was not allowed out of. He was released after working 53 days. He spent another month under house arrest, until he was finally allowed to return to Kazakhstan and see his children. He was paid 300 yuan, equivalent to about $42.Pastor all his life who never thought about politics, Qurban liked to tell how many friends he has had. Now, he claims, he hates them."I never committed a crime, I never did anything wrong,"' he said. You don't understand why they sent me there.''Advertising       Load-Date: February 24, 2020End of Document

HOW SHOULD UNIVERSITIES RESPOND TO CHINA'S GROWING PRESENCE ON THEIR CAMPUSES?States News ServiceNovember 4, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 649 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Over the last several months, opponents of the ongoing protests in Hong Kong have clashed with protest supporters at universities across the world. In Australia and New Zealand, pro-Beijing students have occasionally shoved, doxed, and threatened peaceful protesters. In some cases, these activities seem to have been directed by Chinese embassies and consulates, while others appear to have been spontaneous actions, undertaken by students from mainland China.Meanwhile, in mid-October, the London School of Economics suspended a plan to launch a China program funded by Eric X. Li, a Shanghai businessman known for his pro-Chinese Communist Party views. In Belgium, the former head of a Confucius Institute was recently accused of spying and banned from entering Europe's 26-country Schengen area.Such events have prompted larger concerns that as China's power grows, so too has its ability to shape, suppress, and censor speech around the world. This has raised alarm at the prospect that various forms of pressure emanating from China's government could erode the foundations of liberal education and democratic debate.How should universities encourage respectful dialogue on contentious issues involving China, while at the same time fostering an environment free of intimidation, harassment, and violence? And how should university administrators and governments involve themselves in this process? Charles EdelCommentsFrances Hui, a student at Emerson College in Boston, joined on-campus demonstrations in support of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. As a result, Hui said, other students harassed her. A social media post linked to one of her own essays, for example, and suggested that those who "oppose" China should be "executed." As a security measure, the college contacted the students involved. Hui asked the school to publish a statement rebuking those threats, but as of November 1 it had not.As the Chinese government and the Communist Partyand, occasionally, nationalist studentsthreaten academic freedom around the world, universities are struggling to adequately respond. That schools with experience in grappling openly with other threats to campus speech won't treat these issues as seriously is disturbing. It deprives some members of a university community of their free speech rights. In this environment, perfunctory appeals to respect freedom of expression are inadequate.What should universities do? In March, Human Rights Watch published a code of conduct to help schools combat these kinds of pressures. Universities need to publicly and repeatedly teach, and be seen as teaching, what freedom of expression means on campuses. They should say clearly that disagreement is fine. But that it is unacceptable to threaten those with whom one disagrees, including by reporting their conduct to a foreign government representative who could bring harm to the families of the students or faculty involved.Universities also need to publicly reject threats leveled by foreign governments, and establish ways for students to report any and all encroachments on academic freedom to the school. They also need to be transparent about their relationships, both academic and financial, with any Chinese state agency. And schools should gather and report annually on encroachments on academic freedom.Absent such steps, universities leave students and faculty members with the impression that an institutional response to these kinds of problems will always be weighed against a school's relationship with Chinese authorities, rather than encouraged by the school's standards and commitments to academic freedom. A failure to vigorously defend academic freedom from Chinese government influence will only invite more interference, and will erode the reputation of universities in democracies as places of open debate.Load-Date: November 6, 2019End of Document

Mike Pompeo backs Arsenal star Mesut Ozil in China row over Muslim Uyghur minorityCNN.comDecember 16, 2019 Monday 8:50 AM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: FOOTBALLLength: 922 wordsByline: By Ben Church & John Sinnott, CNNBodyUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has backed Arsenal soccer star Mesut Ozil in condemning China's treatment of its Muslim Uyghur minority.The US State Department has said that for the last two-and-a-half years, China has detained up to 2 million Uyghurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority, in what some describe as internment camps.Ozil, who is a Muslim, was highly critical of the Chinese regime on social media, but was met with scorn from China while the country's state media pulled coverage of Arsenal's English Premier League game against Manchester City Sunday.China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang also accused Ozil of being "blinded by some fake news and influenced by some false words."Arsenal distanced itself from Ozil's comments, but Pompeo tweeted his support for the under fire star Tuesday."China's Communist Party [CCP] propaganda outlets can censor @MesutOzil1088 and @Arsenal's games all season long, but the truth will prevail," tweeted Pompeo."The CCP can't hide its gross #HumanRights violations perpetrated against Uighurs and other religious faiths from the world."China had invited Ozil to visit Xinjiang to "distinguish right from wrong" after his social media messages."(In China) Qurans are burned, mosques were closed down, Islamic theological schools, madrasas were banned, religious scholars were killed one by one. Despite all this, Muslims stay quiet," Ozil said in a post on both Twitter and Instagram.READ: Chinese state media pulls TV coverage of Arsenal game after Ozil shows Uyghur support READ: Turkish President Erdogan attends wedding of Arsenal star OzilAllegations of abuse are rampant, including in firsthand accounts given to CNN describing torture and forced political re-education under the threat of violence.Defending his country's human rights record at a United Nations forum in early November, Chinese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Le Yucheng said that his country had made "remarkable progress" in the past four decades, including "lifting more than a billion people out of poverty."China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang also said: "He [Ozil] doesn't know that the Chinese government protects Chinese citizens, including the Uyghur ethnic people's freedom of religious belief, in accordance with the law," Shuang said during a daily press briefing Monday."I can tell him that China's Xinjiang currently enjoys political stability, economic development, national unity, social harmony, and people are living and working in peace."CCTV had originally planned to air Sunday's game live on CCTV-5 -- the station's sports channel -- at 12:30 a.m on December 16 local time.CCTV, which rarely explains why it changes its airing schedule, did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment as to the reasoning behind the decision not to show the game, which was the Premier League's leading match Sunday.Premier League champion Manchester City beat Arsenal 3-0 to stay in touch with leaders Liverpool.Chinese video streaming website PPTV -- a popular online platform -- also pulled the game from its schedule.Online sports platform Sina Sports released a post on Sina Weibo: "Ozil's remarks have upset his fans in China. Just because he's a well-known sportsman, it doesn't give him the right to comment on issues relating to the national interests and he needs to explain himself."Dongqiudi.com, one of the most popular soccer sites in China, released a statement Friday saying: "Freedom of speech has boundaries and it should be used on the basis of respecting other countries' sovereignty, not interfering in their domestic affairs."Meanwhile in an interview with state-owned newspaper Global Times Friday, a Chinese Football Association official expressed his "great indignation and disappointment" at Ozil's remarks."'East Turkistan' is not a nationalistic issue, not a religious issue, but separatism, terrorism, extremism, and is disdained and rejected by peace-loving people all over the world"Ozil's remarks not only hurt many Chinese fans who liked him, but also hurt the feelings of the Chinese people.

She gave her first interview to De Volkskrant, a daily newspaper in her country, and subsequently spoke to            The New York Time           s           .

Adrian Zenz, a leading Xinjiang researcher, and another expert on the region later contacted her and put her in touch with a journalist, The Times reported.Abdulaheb declined to say how she got the documents, De Volkskrant and The Times reported. All the documents contained stamps and letterheads of various Chinese authorities.The ICIJ on Saturday declined to say whether Abdulaheb was the source of its report, saying it does not comment on its sources. It also cited Zenz as saying that he did not give ICIJ the documents. Earlier in November, the journalism network said they received the documents "via a chain of exiled Uighurs."China brushed off the leaks as fabrications and attempted smears by Western countries, and continued to defend the country's tactics in the region.Associated PressAbdulaheb said she and her family have been receiving threats online and in real life since June, shortly after she posted the tweets, the newspapers reported. She has an ex-husband - a fellow Uighur exile and naturalized Dutch citizen - and two young children in the Netherlands.Below are some of the threats she and her family had received, according to De Volkskrant and The Times:• Several of her social media accounts and a Hotmail email got hacked.• She received a message in the Uighur language on Facebook Messenger that said: "If you don't stop, you'll end up cut into pieces in the black trash can in front of your doorway."• In early September, an old Xinjiang friend of her ex-husband, Jasur Abibula, contacted him out of the blue and invited him on a trip to Dubai for free. Abibula was met by his friend and several Han Chinese security officials. Han is the dominant ethnic group of China.• The officers then told Abibula about the documents, interrogated him about his ex-wife, and gave him a USB stick to put into her laptop - in other words, tried to recruit him as a spy. They also showed Abibula cellphone videos of his elderly mother in Xinjiang, suggesting they had access to his family back home.Courtesy of Bahram Sintash; Courtesy of Rushan Abbas; Samantha Lee/Business InsiderShe is making public her involvement in the leaks to protect her family, both newspapers said. Any new threats or attacks on her "will become a new story," Zenz told The Times."I can handle pressure well, but I'm afraid that something will happen to my children and their father," she told De Volkskrant. The Times said it could not independently verify the threats outlined by Abdulaheb. However, they mirror reports by other members of the Uighur diaspora, who have described to Business Insider receiving mysterious automated phone calls and sinister comments from Chinese-speaking strangers on Facebook and in real life.Uighur exiles have also told Business Insider that their relatives in Xinjiang have vanished days after speaking out against China's human-rights record.The Chinese government has come under increasing scrutiny for its mass oppression of the Uighurs in recent weeks.

U.S. Launches National Security Review of China-Owned TikTok: ReportsBillboardNovember 1, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Prometheus Global Media, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; TAGLength: 580 wordsByline: Chris EggertsenHighlight: The video-sharing app TikTok may be the subject of a national security review by the U.S. government, according to multiple reports published Friday (Nov. 1).BodyThe video-sharing app TikTok is currently the subject of a national security review by the U.S. government, according to multiple reports published Friday (Nov. 1).The stories, published by outlets including Reuters and            The New York Times , report that the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has opened an inquiry into the $1 billion acquisition of the U.S.-based video-sharing app Musical.ly by TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance in 2017, thereby giving it entry into Western markets. The CFIUS, which reviews foreign investment in U.S. companies for potential national security risks, is reportedly in talks with TikTok about steps it might take to divest from Musical.ly, which was folded into TikTok last August.In a statement sent to Billboard, a TikTok spokesperson said in response, "While we cannot comment on ongoing regulatory processes, TikTok has made clear that we have no higher priority than earning the trust of users and regulators in the US. Part of that effort includes working with Congress and we are committed to doing so.”The U.S. Department of the Treasury had not responded to Billboard’s request for comment by press time.In an Oct. 9 letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Sen. Marco Rubio called on the CFIUS to investigate TikTok, citing “ample and growing evidence” that the app was “censoring content that is not in line with the Chinese government and Communist party directives” in Western markets, including the U.S. That request was followed by one  last week from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Tom Cotton, who characterized the app as “a potential counterintelligence threat” and asked for an assessment of its national security risks in a joint letter addressed to U.S. Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. The senators voiced concerns that the app could become the target of a foreign influence campaign similar to Russia’s attempts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election by spreading propaganda on Facebook and other social media platforms.In response to Schumer and Cotton's letter, TikTok released a lengthy statement refuting the senators’ allegations, noting that the app stores its data outside China and is not subject to Chinese law as a result.“We have never been asked by the Chinese government to remove any content and we would not do so if asked. Period,” the statement read. “Our US moderation team, which is led out of California, reviews content for adherence to our US policies -- just like other US companies in our space. We are not influenced by any foreign government, including the Chinese government; TikTok does not operate in China, nor do we have any intention of doing so in the future.”TikTok has also been targeted for scrutiny by the National Music Publishers’ Association in the U.S., which earlier this month called on Congress to investigate the app over potential copyright theft. In response to that letter, TikTok denied the NMPA’s claims, stating that the company "has broad licensing coverage across the music publishing industry…and has paid royalties since its inception.”Though TikTok doesn’t operate inside China, ByteDance owns a separate video-sharing app, Douyin, that is widely used inside the country. According to the app tracker Sensor Tower, the two apps hit a combined 1 billion downloads worldwide in February, with TikTok being downloaded over 100 million times in the U.S. alone.Link to ImageLoad-Date: November 3, 2019End of Document

Secret documents reveal how China mass detention camps workAssociated Press InternationalNovember 25, 2019 Monday 5:42 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: DOMESTIC NEWSLength: 3237 wordsByline: By The Associated PressBodyThe watch towers, double-locked doors and video surveillance in the Chinese camps are there "to prevent escapes." Uighurs and other minorities held inside are scored on how well they speak the dominant Mandarin language and follow strict rules on everything down to bathing and using the toilet, scores that determine if they can leave."Manner education" is mandatory, but "vocational skills improvement" is offered only after a year in the camps.Voluntary job training is the reason the Chinese government has given for detaining more than a million ethnic minorities, most of them Muslims. But a classified blueprint leaked to a consortium of news organizations shows the camps are instead precisely what former detainees have described: Forced ideological and behavioral re-education centers run in secret.The classified documents lay out the Chinese government's deliberate strategy to lock up ethnic minorities even before they commit a crime, to rewire their thoughts and the language they speak.The papers also show how Beijing is pioneering a new form of social control using data and artificial intelligence. Drawing on data collected by mass surveillance technology, computers issued the names of tens of thousands of people for interrogation or detention in just one week.Taken as a whole, the documents give the most significant description yet of high-tech mass detention in the 21st century in the words of the Chinese government itself. Experts say they spell out a vast system that targets, surveils and grades entire ethnicities to forcibly assimilate and subdue them -- especially Uighurs, a predominantly Muslim Turkic minority of more than 10 million people with their own language and culture."They confirm that this is a form of cultural genocide," said Adrian Zenz, a leading security expert on the far western region of Xinjiang, the Uighur homeland. "It really shows that from the onset, the Chinese government had a plan."Zenz said the documents echo the aim of the camps as outlined in a 2017 report from a local branch of the Xinjiang Ministry of Justice: To "wash brains, cleanse hearts, support the right, remove the wrong."China has struggled for decades to control Xinjiang, where the Uighurs have long resented Beijing's heavy-handed rule. After the 9/11 attacks in the United States, Chinese officials began justifying harsh security measures and religious restrictions as necessary to fend off terrorism, arguing that young Uighurs were susceptible to the influence of Islamic extremism. Hundreds have died since in terror attacks, reprisals and race riots, both Uighurs and Han Chinese.In 2014, Chinese President Xi Jinping launched what he called a "People's War on Terror" when bombs set off by Uighur militants tore through a train station in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, just hours after he concluded his first state visit there."Build steel walls and iron fortresses. Set up nets above and snares below," state media cited Xi as saying. "Cracking down severely on violent terrorist activities must be the focus of our current struggle."In 2016, the crackdown intensified dramatically after Xi named Chen Quanguo, a hardline official transferred from Tibet, as Xinjiang's new head. Most of the documents were issued in 2017, as Xinjiang's "War on Terror" morphed into an extraordinary mass detention campaign using military-style technology.The practices largely continue today. The Chinese government says they work."Since the measures have been taken, there's no single terrorist incident in the past three years," said a written response from the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom. "Xinjiang is much safer. ...The so-called leaked documents are fabrication and fake news."The statement said that religious freedom and the personal freedom of detainees was "fully respected" in Xinjiang.When asked about the documents on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang reiterated that issues surrounding Xinjiang are "purely China's internal affairs.""Some media used underhanded tricks to sensationalize the Xinjiang issue," Geng said during a regular news briefing. "The plot to smear and slander China's anti-terrorism and deradicalization efforts in Xinjiang will not prevail."The documents were given to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists by an anonymous source. The ICIJ verified them by examining state media reports and public notices from the time, consulting experts, cross-checking signatures and confirming the contents with former camp employees and detainees.They consist of a notice with guidelines for the camps, four bulletins on how to use technology to target people, and a court case sentencing a Uighur Communist Party member to 10 years in prison for telling colleagues not to say dirty words, watch porn or eat without praying.The documents were issued to rank-and-file officials by the powerful Xinjiang Communist Party Political and Legal Affairs Commission, the region's top authority overseeing police, courts and state security. They were put out under the head official at the time, Zhu Hailun, who annotated and signed some personally.The documents confirm from the government itself what is known about the camps from the testimony of dozens of Uighurs and Kazakhs, satellite imagery and tightly monitored visits by journalists to the region.Erzhan Qurban, an ethnic Kazakh who moved back to Kazakhstan, was grabbed by police on a trip back to China to see his mother and accused of committing crimes abroad. He protested that he was a simple herder who had done nothing wrong. But for the authorities, his time in Kazakhstan was reason enough for detention.Qurban told the AP he was locked in a cell with 10 others last year and told not to engage in "religious activities" like praying. They were forced to sit on plastic stools in rigid postures for hours at a time. Talk was forbidden, and two guards kept watch 24 hours a day. Inspectors checked that nails were short and faces trimmed of mustaches and beards, traditionally worn by pious Muslims.Those who disobeyed were forced to squat or spend 24 hours in solitary confinement in a frigid room."It wasn't education, it was just punishment," said Qurban, who was held for nine months. "I was treated like an animal."___WHO GETS ROUNDED UP AND HOWOn February 18, 2017, Zhu, the Han Chinese official who signed the documents, stood in chilly winter weather atop the front steps of the capital's city hall, overlooking thousands of police in black brandishing rifles."With the powerful fist of the People's Democratic Dictatorship, all separatist activities and all terrorists shall be smashed to pieces," Zhu announced into a microphone.With that began a new chapter in the state's crackdown. Police called Uighurs and knocked on their doors at night to take them in for questioning. Others were stopped at borders or arrested at airports.In the years since, as Uighurs and Kazakhs were sent to the camps in droves, the government built hundreds of schools and orphanages to house and re-educate their children. Many of those who fled into exile don't even know where their children or loved ones are.The documents make clear that many of those detained have not actually done anything. One document explicitly states that the purpose of the pervasive digital surveillance is "to prevent problems before they happen" -- in other words, to calculate who might rebel and detain them before they have a chance.This is done through a system called the Integrated Joint Operations Platform or IJOP, designed to screen entire populations. Built by a state-owned military contractor, the IJOP began as an intelligence-sharing tool developed after Chinese military theorists studied the U.S. army's use of information technology in Iraq and Afghanistan."There's no other place in the world where a computer can send you to an internment camp," said Rian Thum, a Xinjiang expert at the University of Nottingham. "This is absolutely unprecedented."The IJOP spat out the names of people considered suspicious, such as thousands of "unauthorized" imams not registered with the Chinese government, along with their associates. Suspicious or extremist behavior was so broadly defined that it included going abroad, asking others to pray or using cell phone apps that cannot be monitored by the government.The IJOP zoomed in on users of "Kuai Ya," a mobile application similar to the iPhone's Airdrop, which had become popular in Xinjiang because it allows people to exchange videos and messages privately. One bulletin showed that officials identified more than 40,000 "Kuai Ya" users for investigation and potential detention; of those, 32 were listed as belonging to "terrorist organizations.""They're scared people will spread religion through 'Kuai Ya,'" said a man detained after police accused him of using the app. He spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to protect himself and his family. "They can't regulate it....So they want to arrest everyone who's used 'Kuai Ya' before."The system also targeted people who obtained foreign passports or visas, reflecting the government's fear of Islamic extremist influences from abroad and deep discomfort with any connection between the Uighurs and the outside world. Officials were asked to verify the identities even of people outside the country, showing how China is casting its dragnet for Uighurs far beyond Xinjiang.In recent years, Beijing has put pressure on countries to which Uighurs have fled, such as Thailand and Afghanistan, to send them back to China. In other countries, state security has also contacted Uighurs and pushed them to spy on each other. For example, a restaurateur now in Turkey, Qurbanjan Nurmemet, said police contacted him with videos of his son strapped to a chair and asked him for information on other Uighurs in Turkey.Despite the Chinese government's insistence that the camps are vocational training centers for the poor and uneducated, the documents show that those rounded up included party officials and university students.After the names were collected, lists of targeted people were passed to prefecture governments, who forwarded them to district heads, then local police stations, neighbor watchmen, and Communist Party cadres living with Uighur families.Some former detainees recalled being summoned by officers and told their names were listed for detention. From there, people were funneled into different parts of the system, from house arrest to detention centers with three levels of monitoring to, at its most extreme, prison.Experts say the detentions are a clear violation of China's own laws and constitution. Margaret Lewis, a professor of Chinese law at Seton Hall University, said the Communist Party is circumventing the Chinese legal system in Xinjiang."Once you're stamped as an enemy, the gloves go off," she said. "They're not even trying to justify this legally....This is arbitrary."The detention campaign is sweeping. A bulletin notes that in a single week in June 2017, the IJOP identified 24,612 "suspicious persons" in southern Xinjiang, with 15,683 sent to "education and training," 706 to prison and 2,096 to house arrest. It is unknown how typical this week might be. Local officials claim far less than a million are in "training," but researchers estimate up to 1.8 million have been detained at one point or another.The bulletins stress that relationships must be scrutinized closely, with those interrogated pushed to report the names of friends and relatives. Mamattursun Omar, a Uighur chef arrested after working in Egypt, was interrogated in four detention facilities over nine months in 2017. Omar told the AP that police asked him to verify the identities of other Uighurs in Egypt.Eventually, Omar says, they began torturing him to make him confess that Uighur students had gone to Egypt to take part in jihad. They strapped him to a contraption called a "tiger chair," shocked him with electric batons, beat him with pipes and whipped him with computer cords."I couldn't take it anymore," Omar said. "I just told them what they wanted me to say."Omar gave the names of six others who worked at a restaurant with him in Egypt. All were sent to prison.___WHAT HAPPENS INSIDE THE CAMPSThe documents also detail what happens after someone is sent to an "education and training center."Publicly, in a recent white paper, China's State Council said "the personal freedom of trainees at the education and training centers is protected in accordance with the law." But internally, the documents describe facilities with police stations at the front gates, high guard towers, one-button alarms and video surveillance with no blind spots..Detainees are only allowed to leave if absolutely necessary, for example because of illness, and even so must have somebody "specially accompany, monitor and control" them. Bath time and toilet breaks are strictly managed and controlled "to prevent escapes." And cell phones are strictly forbidden to stop "collusion between inside and outside.""Escape was impossible," said Kazakh kindergarten administrator Sayragul Sauytbay, a Communist Party member who was abducted by police in November 2017 and forced to become a Mandarin camp instructor. "In every corner in every place there were armed police."Sauytbay called the detention center a "concentration camp ... much more horrifying than prison," with rape, brainwashing and torture in a "black room" where people screamed. She and another former prisoner, Zumrat Dawut, also told the ICIJ detainees were given medication that made them listless and obedient, and every move was surveilled.AP journalists who visited Xinjiang in December 2018 saw patrol towers and high walls lined with green barbed wire fencing around camps. One camp in Artux, just north of Kashgar, sat in the middle of a vast, empty, rocky field, and appeared to include a police station at the entrance, workshops, a hospital and dormitories, one with a sign reading "House of Workers" in Chinese.Recent satellite imagery shows that guard towers and fencing have been removed from some facilities, suggesting the region may have been softening restrictions in response to global criticism. Shohrat Zakir, the governor of Xinjiang, said in March that those detained can now request time and go home on weekends, a claim the AP could not independently verify.The first item listed as part of the curriculum is ideological education, a bold attempt to change how detainees think and act. It is partly rooted in the ancient Chinese belief in transformation through education -- taken before to terrifying extremes during the mass thought reform campaigns of Mao Zedong."It's the dark days of the Cultural Revolution, except now it's powered by high-tech," said Zenz, the researcher.By showing students the error of their former ways, the centers are supposed to promote "repentance and confession," the directive said. For example, Qurban, the Kazakh herder, was handcuffed, brought to an interview with a Han Chinese leader and forced to acknowledge that he regretted visiting abroad.The indoctrination goes along with what is called "manner education," where behavior is dictated down to ensuring "timely haircuts and shaves," "regular change of clothes" and "bathing once or twice a week." The tone, experts say, echoes a general perception by the Han Chinese government that Uighurs are prone to violence and need to be civilized -- in much the same way white colonialists treated indigenous people in the U.S., Canada and Australia."It's a similar kind of savior mentality -- that these poor Uighurs didn't understand that they were being led astray by extremists," said Darren Byler, a scholar of Uighur culture at the University of Washington. "The way they think about Uighurs in general is that they are backward, that they're not educated....these people are unhygienic and need to be taught how to clean themselves."Students are to be allowed a phone conversation with relatives at least once a week, and can meet them via video at least once a month, the documents say. Trainers are told to pay attention to "the ideological problems and emotional changes that arise after family communications."Mandarin is mandated. Beijing has said "the customs of all ethnic groups and the right to use their spoken and written languages are fully protected at the centers." But the documents show that in practice, lessons are taught in Mandarin, and it is the language to be used in daily communication.A former staffer at Xinjiang TV now in Europe was also selected to become a Mandarin teacher during his month-long detention in 2017. Twice a day, detainees were lined up and inspected by police, and a few were questioned in Mandarin at random, he told the AP. Those who couldn't respond in Mandarin were beaten or deprived of food for days. Otherwise, speaking was forbidden.One day, the former teacher recalled, an officer asked an old farmer in Mandarin whether he liked the detention center. The man apologized in broken Mandarin and Uighur, saying it was hard for him to understand because of his age. The officer strode over and struck the old man's head with a baton. He crumpled to the ground, bleeding."They didn't see us as humans," said the former teacher, who declined to provide his name out of fear of retribution against his family. "They treated us like animals -- like pigs, cows, sheep."Detainees are tested on Mandarin, ideology and discipline, with "one small test per week, one medium test per month, and one big test per season," the documents state. These test scores feed into an elaborate point system.Detainees who do well are to be rewarded with perks like family visits, and may be allowed to "graduate" and leave. Detainees who do poorly are to be sent to a stricter "management area" with longer detention times. Former detainees told the AP that punishments included food deprivation, handcuffing, solitary confinement, beatings and torture.Detainees' scores are entered in the IJOP. Students are sent to separate facilities for "intensive skills training" only after at least one year of learning ideology, law and Mandarin.After they leave, the documents stipulate, every effort should be made to get them jobs. Some detainees describe being forced to sign job contracts, working long hours for low pay and barred from leaving factory grounds during weekdays.Qurban, the Kazakh herder, said after nine months in the camp, a supervisor came to tell him he was "forgiven" but must never tell what he had seen. After he returned to his village, officials told him he had to work in a factory."If you don't go, we'll send you back to the center," an official said.Qurban went to a garment factory, which he wasn't allowed to leave. After 53 days stitching clothes, he was released. After another month under house arrest, he finally was allowed to return to Kazakhstan and see his children. He received his salary in cash: 300 Chinese yuan, or just under $42.Long an ordinary herder who thought little of politics, Qurban used to count many Han Chinese among his friends. Now, he said, he's begun to hate them."I've never committed a crime, I've never done anything wrong," he said. "It was beyond comprehension why they put me there."___This story has been corrected to show that Sayragul Sauytbay was abducted in November 2017, not October 2017.Load-Date: November 26, 2019End of Document

Continue reading The big questions behind TikTok s looming national security investigationIllustration by Alex Castro / The VergeLess than two months after TikTok came under fire for appearing to censor videos related to the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, the app is facing a new challenge from the US government. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has contacted TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDancewith concerns that the app could pose a threat to US citizens.Those concerns will most likely lead to a national security review   one that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have been calling for since early October. In the end, ByteDance could be forced to sell off Musical.ly, the American company it acquired in 2017 that helped launch TikTok's viral success. If that happens, it could mark the end of TikTok in the US, and serve as a warning to any Chinese company looking to break into the American market.It could mark the end of TikTok in the USCFIUS's focus on tech is still relatively new. For the last 30 years, the committee, chaired by the secretary of the treasury, has been charged with structuring mergers and acquisitions between US and foreign companies in such a way that protects US national security interests. CFIUS typically wants to see companies create US-based leadership teams and have US-based servers to ensure China's government won't have free rein over data on American citizens.Under the Trump administration, the committee's role has been expanding, particularly as it relates to Chinese investments in tech companies.  Recently, the scope of CFIUS' authority has broadened with respect to foreign investments in sensitive technologies,  said Robert Williams, executive director of the Paul Tsai China Center at Yale Law School.In 2018, CFIUS began cracking down on Chinese tech mergers, a sign that it was increasingly concerned about giving foreign governments access to sensitive user data. On January 2nd, 2018 CFIUS rejected Chinese company Ant Financial's planto acquire the US financial organization MoneyGram, citing national security risks.  The MoneyGram episode is potentially instructive because it seems that concerns around a Chinese company having access to data on US citizens motivated the blocking of that transaction,  said Williams.The committee also started reversing deals that have already gone through. In March, CFIUS forced Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd to sell the gay hookup app Grindr, after a probe revealed the user data posed a threat to American citizens.  The Chinese government has likely taken a significant interest in that data, which could be useful in targeting dissidents at home and for blackmail abroad. As a Chinese company, there is likely nothing Kunlun could do to prevent the government from accessing user data,  wroteThe Verge's Casey Newton.Not every acquisition between a foreign and US company needs clearance from CFIUS. The approvals process is voluntary, and only required when the deal poses a potential threat to national security. TikTok didn't bother clearing the Musical.ly deal with CFIUS, which gives the committee grounds to investigate it now.The outcome of their investigation will likely hinge on whether TikTok can prove its independence from ByteDanceThe outcome of their investigation will likely hinge on whether TikTok can prove its independence from ByteDance, something the company already appears to be working on. In a statement on October 24th, TikTok said,  Let us be very clear: TikTok does not remove content based on sensitivities related to China.  Vanessa Pappas, the company's general manager, also tried to alleviate senators' concerns around data security, noting that, as of January, all TikTok's user data is stored in the US. There's the possibility of structuring a mitigation agreement that would allow the company to continue to own Musical.ly and to operate in the US subject to limiting conditions and reporting requirements,  added Williams. If that fails, however, CFIUS could force ByteDance to sell the company.  There are still some open questions about the extent to which companies can appeal a CFIUS or presidential decision through the judicial system,  Williams said.CFIUS could force ByteDance to sell the companySamantha Hoffman, an analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said the committee's concerns are well founded.  The [Communist] Party of China collects bulk data overseas and then uses it to help with things that relate to state security like propaganda and identifying public sentiment to understand how people feel about a particular issue,  she said.  It's about controlling the media environment globally. Once you have control, you can use it to influence and shape the conversation.  Even if it's not happening that much now it's really only a matter of time before it does Those surveillance concerns are much bigger than just TikTok.  The Chinese government has a history of gaining control over nodes in the information system,  said Sarah Cook, a senior research analyst for China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan at Freedom House.  They don't always mobilize them right away to harm freedom of expression, until something threatening happens and then they do. It seems clear TikTok is censoring information related to the Hong Kong protests, but at the same time, even if it's not happening that much now it's really only a matter of time before it does. CFIUS's recent expansion is likely an attempt to counter China's growing power.  What is interesting about this case is that the decision is clearly not solely based on the personal data that may be accessible,  noted Nevena Simidjiyska, a partner at Fox Rothschild LLP, who noted that questions of censorship haven't historically been a focus for the committee.  This is a new space for CFIUS regulation that will bring a lot more social media companies into scrutiny. At the center of the debate is how far China's control extends outside their national borders   a question US lawmakers are highly focused on. When TikTok appeared to be squashing content related to the pro-Democracy protests in Hong Kong, Senators like Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Marco Rubio (R-FL) began calling for an investigation. More congressional leaders joined when former TikTok employees toldThe Washington Postthey were instructed to take down political posts.  Ample & growing evidence exists that TikTok's platform for western markets, including the U.S., are censoring content in line with #China's communist government directives,  tweeted Rubio.In a statement emailed toThe Verge, he added,  I remain deeply concerned that any platform or application that has Chinese ownership or direct links to China, such as TikTok, can be used as a tool by the Chinese Communist Party. His concern was echoed in a letter Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) wrote to acting National Intelligence Director Joseph Maguire late last month.  While ByteDance claims TikTok does not operate in China and stores U.S. user data in the U.S., ByteDance is still required to adhere to the laws of China,  the senators wrote.The question is far from hypothetical. According to the 2019 Freedom on the Net report by Freedom House, China is the worst abuser of internet freedom in the world.  Censorship reached unprecedented extremes as the government enhanced its information controls in advance of the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre and in the face of widespread antigovernment protests in Hong Kong,  the report reads.China is the worst abuser of internet freedom in the worldBut according to Hoffman, true independence will be difficult to come by   especially for TikTok's parent company.  If we're talking about a company based in the [People's Republic of China], I would say it's impossible for them not to be influenced by the Chinese government,  she said.  It doesn't matter about the intent of the person setting up the company. It's not about that. It's about how the system operates. Tags:See Campaign:https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20948613/tiktok-national-security-investigation-cfius-china-bytedance-hawley-rubioContact Information:Zoe SchifferTags:,           Artificial Intelligence Newswire,           Wire,           United States,           EnglishLoad-Date: November 18, 2019End of Document

TIKTOK PARENT COMPANY COMPLICIT IN CENSORSHIP AND XINJIANG POLICE PROPAGANDAUS Fed NewsDecember 5, 2019 Thursday GENERAL_EDIT_CORRECTION ERROR Document ID 123 Has error Validate old format failed - Input Date Invalid - 00:10: Unparseable date: "00:10" ESTCopyright 2019 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 1499 wordsBodySAN SALVADOR, El Salvador, Dec. 5 -- The U.S. Embassy in El Salvador issued the following news release:Popular video app TikTok is "a vector for censorship and surveillance", according to a new report from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), which found the app's parent company ByteDance was complicit in police propaganda in Xinjiang.The report also names Chinese tech giant Huawei - which is banned from supplying equipment to Australia's 5G mobile network due to security concerns - works "extensively" in Xinjiang and directly with the Chinese Government's public security bureaus in the region.China's north-west region of Xinjiang has been described as an "open-air prison" where more than a million Uyghurs - a Turkic speaking ethnic group - and other Muslim minorities have been detained.China has repeatedly rejected the re-education centres are "concentration camps" and maintains they are "vocational centres" or "boarding schools" that are necessary to prevent the spread of terrorism.The ASPI report comes on the heels of a leaked cache of highly classified Chinese Government documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and shared with the ABC.Those documents, dubbed the China Cables, revealed 23 Australian citizens were singled out for deportation or detention.The leaks also highlighted the scale of mass internment in Xinjiang, where doors are double-locked to prevent escapes and there's a system of digital surveillance and "arrest by algorithm" designed to instil fear.APPS AIDING 'PROPAGANDA'The report coincides with ASPI updating its mapping Chinese tech giants project, adding companies including iFlytek, ByteDance (which owns TikTok), SenseTime, CloudWalk, Meiya Pico, and BeiDou to a public database.TikTok has faced allegations of censorship and "shadow-banning" - a stealthier form of censorship where particular topics are down-ranked in the app's algorithm so they don't show up in users' feeds.The ASPI report echoed United States Congress members' concerns about "the app's use of censorship to curate and shape information flows and export CCP media narratives to data privacy and the potential for the app to be used as a tool of surveillance in the service of the Chinese party-state".Its parent company, ByteDance, has recently said personal data from users in other countries is not shared with Chinese authorities.The viral video platform was the subject of controversy in recent days after a US teenager claimed she was blocked for sharing a video encouraging people to research the "holocaust" happening in Xinjiang, masked as a make-up tutorial.This was initially disputed by TikTok, but they later apologised and admitted the video had been removed for 50 minutes "due to a human moderation error", stressing the video did not breach community guidelines and "it should not have been removed".In a statement to the ABC, a TikTok representative said the company "does not remove content based on sensitivities related to China"."We have never been asked by the Chinese Government to remove any content and we would not do so if asked. Period," the statement said."We are not influenced by any foreign government, including the Chinese Government; TikTok does not operate in China, nor do we have any intention of doing so in the future."The video app also told the ABC it had previously taken a "blunt approach to minimising conflict on the platform" during its early days, referring to content which "promotes conflict between religious sects or ethnic groups".However, it added that: "The old guidelines in question are outdated and no longer in use.""As TikTok started taking off in new markets, we are working to empower local teams that have a nuanced understanding of each market," the statement read.But the ASPI report said the "meteoric growth" of TikTok, which is worth a "jaw-dropping" $110 billion and has an audience of 700 million globally, makes parent company ByteDance "uniquely susceptible to other problems that come with its closeness to the censorship and surveillanceapparatus of the CCP-led state".The company inked a "strategic" deal with the Ministry of Public Security's press and publicity bureau to promote the "influence and credibility" of police departments across China, and video-sharing app Douyin - the Chinese version of TikTok - accounts were used to disseminate propaganda.Report co-author Vicky Xiuzhong Xu said ByteDance was helping authorities gain more traction online to peddle propaganda, and that most of the company's cooperation with Xinjiang authorities was centred in the town of Hotan."[This month] ByteDance signed a deal with Beijing Radio and Television Bureau to propagate and showcase Hotan's 'new image'," she said."It would look benign if you don't think about the past two years," she said, during which Hotan had been subjected to "an aggressive campaign of cemetery, mosque and traditional housing demolition".ASPI co-author Fergus Ryan noted there was a "sad irony" in that TikTok has also been a platform where Uyghurs in Xinjiang have spread awareness of their plight.The report also zeroes in on ByteDance's links to Xinjiang's internet police, who used the video-sharing app Douyin to build a "new public security and internet social governance model" last year.Douyin accounts for Xinjiang police, and for local officials who go into Uyghurs homes to watch and surveil them, were also going "viral", Ms Xu said."It's not natural - organically, it should be those viral dances or lip-syncing - just silly funny stuff," she said."But why are you having all these police accounts going viral?"I don't think it's a coincidence ... ByteDance by helping the Government to boost its propaganda, it is also actively helping the Government to try and hide what's actually going on in Hotan."A ByteDance spokesperson said in a statement that Douyin allowed civic and law enforcement groups to set up user accounts "for purposes such as crime prevention alerts", just as social media platforms do in other countries."Douyin does not endorse the content generated by its users, but rather, similar to Twitter or Facebook, provides a platform to all of its users," it said."ByteDance does not produce, operate or disseminate any products or services related to surveillance."In Hotan, Douyin and Toutiao work on poverty alleviation efforts, similar to what they do in many regions across China."Huawei part of surveillance ecosystem, report claimsThe report alleged Huawei misrepresented its links to Xinjiang's security apparatus when it claimed its contracts were only through third parties.ASPI said Huawei worked "directly" with China's public security bureau in Xinjiang and had agreed to establish an "intelligent security industry" innovation lab in Xinjiang's capital Urumqi, and was "praised" by authorities for contributing to the "Safe Xinjiang" program, which ASPI described as a "code for a police surveillance system".A Huawei representative did not directly respond to any of the allegations about complicity of surveillance in Xinjiang, but said in a statement that: "Huawei develops technology that complies with the law in each jurisdiction in which it is sold and used.""Huawei is committed to human rights and has a strong record as an organisation that does good in the 170 plus markets where it operates," they said.Huawei slammed the report, accusing ASPI of trying to "destroy a private company for purely political purposes"."We find it extremely distressing and strongly object that an organisation like ASPI is once again seeking to damage our reputation in this manner."But Ms Xu said the report showed the inextricable links between tech companies and complicity in Xinjiang abuses, with the report highlighting that the crackdown offered "ample opportunities for incentivised expansion and profitability"."Everyone in Xinjiang - from telecommunications companies to social media companies to tech companies that make cameras - they form this ecosystem that enables and allows this mass detention, these gross human rights abuses to happen on a large scale," Ms Xu said.Maya Wang, from Human Rights Watch, said companies had an obligation to ensure they were not complicit in human rights abuses."Chinese law requires data localisation and also that companies provide broad 'assistance' to law enforcement, so it is difficult for companies to resist providing Chinese authorities with individual users' data when requested," she said.But she added there was a difference between companies that tried to do the right thing when operating in China and those that actively supported the Government's authoritarian agenda."Propaganda and censorship are two sides of the same coin - they aim to support the agenda of an authoritarian government to repress and control the population," she said.

The Trouble with TikTokPolitico.comNovember 3, 2019 Sunday 11:50 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1917 wordsHighlight: Journalists should not be promoting a platform with a documented history of political censorship.BodyMargaret Sullivan was having fun. The Washington Post media critic and former public editor of the New York Times collaborated in the production of a humorous musical video on  TikTok  earlier this month. "You hardened journos may think this is pointless," she tweeted, "but the street cred I now have with my 12-year-old twin goddaughters..." A few days later, another Washington Post TikTok popped up, tweeted by Dave Jorgenson, the Post's in-house TikTok expert. In it, happy newsroom faces flash by in a series of quick cuts, with the notable exception of a deadpan Marty Baron, the paper's executive editor.Set to upbeat music, these quirky videos seem relatively harmless. They're simple promotional vehicles, and they attract young TikTok-loving audiences. But America's journalists, like America's youth, are falling in love with the most effective medium ever introduced to extend Chinese media practices into the United States. Journalists should not be promoting a platform with a documented history of political censorship. Nor should journalists use TikTok as a news medium, because TikTok-unlike other attempts to extend authoritarian media globally, such as RT (Russia Today)-relies on its users' ignorance of its origins and practices. How many teens, or journalists, are aware  TikTok's Chinese parent company, Bytedance, paid what was at the time the largest fine in Federal Trade Commission history for invading the privacy of underage users? TikTok seems like a great new media story, and, in some ways, it is. For a relatively new social media platform, TikTok's numbers are staggering. It is the No. 1 app downloaded in the iOS store, and it's estimated that in the first quarter of 2019, more than 220 million TikTok app downloads occurred between Google Play and Apple's iOS store. Funny TikTok memes pop up on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, as well as in its proprietary app. If TikTok seems like it's everywhere these days, that's because Bytedance spends a fortune to keep teens hooked and to keep everyone else talking about it. In September, TikTok was the top advertiser on Snapchat, and the second-largest advertiser on Youtube. The Wall Street Journal reports that Bytedance plans to spend an astounding $1 billion advertising TikTok this year. But from a journalistic perspective, the question of what can't be found on TikTok is more important than the quirky music videos that dominate the app. TikTok, which is called Douyin in China, is the first successful global social media giant pioneered domestically under the Chinese censorship regime, and since the app's introduction, questions have swirled about what videos are allowed to appear on the platform. According to internal documents describing TikTok's guidelines obtained by the Guardian-policies that TikTok now claims are outdated and no longer employed-TikTok censored videos mentioning taboo topics in China, such as Tiananmen Square, Tibetan and Taiwanese independence and the Falun Gong. Likewise, videos and hashtags about the Hong Kong protests "barely exist on TikTok," the Washington Post noted. A former TikTok content moderator told the New York Times that, in the newspaper's words, "managers in the United States had instructed moderators to hide videos that included any political messages or themes, not just those related to China." TikTok is both an audacious attempt to extend Chinese global media reach and a fun app that promotes joy. Those two realities aren't mutually exclusive. In fact, they're symbiotic. According to the documents obtained by the Guardian, TikTok censored numerous subjects that extend beyond the obvious topics deemed dangerous to the Chinese state. According to the Guardian's reporting on the directives in the documents, TikTok suppressed videos about "a specific list of 20 'foreign leaders or sensitive figures' including Kim Jong-il, Kim Il-sung, Mahatma Gandhi, Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump, Barack Obama, Kim Jong-un, [and] Shinzo Abe." Think of how much social media vitriol is generated by figures on that list, and it's easy to understand why a fun app would want to blacklist those politically divisive figures.After the documents were revealed, the company issued a statement denying it continues its previous policies. "Let us be very clear," the company said, "TikTok does not remove content based on sensitivities related to China. We have never been asked by the Chinese government to remove any content and we would not do so if asked. Period. Our U.S. moderation team, which is led out of California, reviews content for adherence to our U.S. policies-just like other U.S. companies in our space. We are not influenced by any foreign government, including the Chinese government."Still, despite TikTok's new claims to be observing standard U.S. media practices, it's clear that until very recently TikTok more closely monitored its content than its American social media competitors did. Even if TikTok might not formally remove content, the former content moderator interviewed by the New York Times noted that TikTok employed what's commonly known as "shadow banning," a practice that would allow "such political posts to remain on users' profile pages but ... prevent them from being shared more widely in TikTok's main video feed."The global debate over the tension between free expression and social harmony is seemingly playing out everywhere today. China's enormous economic leverage has created new parameters for conduct and behavior by business partners seeking access to the Chinese market. Just as the NBA had to very carefully navigate a tweet by a Houston Rockets executive supporting the Hong Kong protests that infuriated the Chinese state, so too must Hollywood producers, video game corporations, book and newspaper publishers, and numerous other businesses navigate Chinese censorship demands. These demands are becoming more common and more insistent, and on platforms like TikTok, they'll no doubt continue to emerge.  Chinese censorship has gone global. Just as the U.S. government spent the second half of the 20th century encouraging the global expansion of American values, such as freedom of expression, the Chinese government has now opened the first half of the 21st century by promoting global restrictions intended to ensure approving portrayals of Chinese state authority. The consequences of this evolution in global media culture arise almost daily. When Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg proclaims the importance of free speech, as he did recently in a speech at Georgetown University, his implicit target is the Chinese regime that bans Facebook, not progressives who want Facebook to more tightly regulate political advertising and hate speech. Facebook, it should be noted, will soon launch "Lasso," a direct competitor to TikTok.In recent public pronouncements and congressional hearings, some U.S. politicians argue  Twitter and Facebook are, in fact, doing too little to combat the dangerous spread of misinformation and inflammatory propaganda. Under this line of thinking, moderation policies like TikTok's might offer a remedy to America's social media ills. Senator Kamala Harris, for example, has called for Twitter to shutter President Donald Trump's account because of what she says are his violations of Twitter's terms of service.  Zuckerberg had no answer when Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asked him whether Facebook would prohibit political advertisements featuring provable and obvious lies.  This battle between free expression and policing of content is playing out within TikTok, too. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that ISIS  uploaded gruesome torture and beheading videos-set to danceable music and accompanied with celebratory emojis-to TikTok. The videos were not detected and deleted by TikTok until the newspaper made the company aware of their existence. By then, they had been shared thousands of times. When terrorists and criminals violate terms of service by spreading messages or portraying crimes that directly inspire violence through algorithmic networks, some level of content control might be deemed legitimate even by libertarian critics. Questions like these speak to the most fundamental notions of what constitutes an ethical and responsible public sphere and how a society should organize and regulate its media.Democracy and efficiency often sit in conflict. The issues arising with TikTok, Facebook and Twitter are forcing every nation and society to calibrate its tolerance for media freedom on a spectrum that runs from the protection of liberty through the encouragement of accuracy to the enforcement of harmony.It's the responsibility of journalists to explain this context, and right now, they're falling down on the job. Not long ago, the New York Times published a largely celebratory article about TikTok and its embrace by American high school students and educators. The reporter, Taylor Lorenz, noted parenthetically that TikTok's corporate owner Bytedance is a "Chinese tech conglomerate," but nowhere was TikTok's history of censorship of content inimical to the Chinese state's authority mentioned.Perhaps more important, nowhere did Lorenz mention  TikTok paid a $5.7 million fine to the U.S. government earlier this year. The fine, paid to settle violations identified by the FTC, involved the illegal collection of "names, email addresses, pictures and locations of kids under age 13," as the Washington Post reported, adding that it was "a record penalty for violations of the nation's child privacy law." One would think a feature article celebrating a social media app's enormous popularity among American teens would note that it had not only demographically targeted users younger than 13, but that it had also admitted illegally collecting information about them. For users who might consider employing TikTok in schools-and news sites-around America, the inclusion of such relevant information is essential. The general tone of the piece would not have to change at all; TikTok is, in many ways, a liberating social technology that brings much joy to the lives of millions of American teenagers. But it's also a Chinese social media program that's settled with the FTC for illegally collecting information on underage users, has a history of censoring user-generated content, and is now said to be under investigation by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a governmental review panel. That national security investigation is looking into how the app sends data back to China. Just as any article about Facebook would be incomplete if it ignored Facebook's history of apologies for admitted privacy violations, any article about TikTok that omits its record of censorship and illegal behavior is irresponsible. This might be the juncture where TikTok and its American counterparts meet. None of the social media giants, whether American or Chinese, wants to reveal embarrassing information about how it actually conducts its work as media. Yet it seems clear  all social media-whether TikTok, Weibo, Facebook or Twitter-privilege state or corporate authority above the public's interest. That makes them terrific vehicles for advertising and propaganda.It also means  the need for independent, comprehensive and critical reporting about these apps is vital. Watching journalists vie to become "TikTok famous" like high school teenagers isn't encouraging.Article originally published on POLITICO MagazineLoad-Date: November 11, 2019End of Document

TikTok looks at branding to distance himself from its Chinese rootsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 29, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1515 wordsBody29 Nov. (Dow Jones) -- This year, TikTok made history as China's first social media company to truly grow it in the United States. Now, TikTok wants to discard his Chinese brand tag.As TikTok faces increasing scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and regulators, some employees and advisers have approached their top executives in recent weeks to suggest ways the company could be renamed, according to familiar with the discussions.The ideas discussed include expanding operations in Southeast Asia, possibly in Singapore, which would allow executives to distance China's video sharing app, and change the name of their brand in the United States, People.Meanwhile, TikTok has reduced the amount of China content featured in the app, hoping to minimize reminders of its Chinese roots to American users, people familiar with the company's practices said.Some investors in TikTok's parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, recognize that an attempt to differentiate application from China might be difficult to execute and that some of the ideas are, at best, a remote possibility. But discussions reflect how TikTok's meteoric rise is under threat and how some close to the company increasingly see Chinese ownership of the company as a liability.One reason for this concern: ByteDance investors, including Sequoia Capital and SoftBank Group, believe that growth in the United States is key to achieving their goal of making an initial public offering by the end of next year, they said familiar with the matter.ByteDance was recently valued at $75 billion, making it one of the world's most valuable new companies.A ByteDance spokeswoman said the initial public offering is not a priority goal of the company, and that consideration is not being considered moving TikTok's headquarters to Singapore.Adding that there is no discussion about rebranding TikTok. He also said the company doesn't determine how much Chinese content is in the app because users, and not TikTok, are the ones uploading the videos."It is well known that ByteDance was founded in China," he said. "But the reality is that the TikTok app doesn't operate in China and we've been developing and training teams in the markets where it operates."ByteDance operates a version of TikTok in China with a different name, Douyin, and the director of TikTok is based there, although the company's website does not mention any offices in China.For TikTok, the challenge is that many legislators and regulators, and some parents, are wary of the Chinese government's demand information on users of the app at any time. The increased tension between the two countries is due to the trade war."We're stuck in the middle," said one ByteDance employee. "We are a Chinese company, but we do business abroad."ByteDance isn't the only company in that situation. Since a 2018 law expanded the power of U.S. regulators to limit foreign access to technology deals, otherChinese companies have tried to find ways to manage or avoid these new restrictions.When ByteDance bought Musical.ly in 2017, the small social network in the United States that became TikTok, most Americans had not heard of it. ByteDance invested money in promoting TikTok in popular American apps and, earlier this year, more than 100 million Americans had already downloaded the app.That popularity provoked a backlash. After several senators expressed concern that TikTok was censoring content to appease Beijing and collecting data on U.S. users, the United States initiated a national security review."TikTok says they do not store U.S. user data in China. That's good, very good. All that is required is that a Communist Party official knock on the door step of its parent company, based in China, so that that data is transferred into the hands of the Chinese government, when it needs it," said Senator Josh Hawley (Republican for Missouri) during a data security hearing in early November.TikTok has said it stores U.S. user data in the United States and Singapore, although its website notes that the app may share user information with ByteDance."The Chinese government has never asked us to provide access to any data from any TikTok user who is a resident of the United States, and we would not do so if we were asked," a ByteDance spokesman said.TikTok's perception as a host of goofy and harmless content also took a hit when The Wall Street Journal reported last month that islamic State was posting propaganda videos on the app.In China, Uighur Muslims have used Douyin to post videos that draw attention to Beijing's mass internment campaign. Chinese law requires Douyin to remove any content that expresses political dissent; however, the videos seemed to go unnoticed by those who censor the company. Many videos have been deleted since then.The United States represents a small portion of the company's business: about 4% of TikTok users and their Chinese version, Douyin, are in the United States, a former employee said. The U.S. business is operating with a massive loss, the former employee said.However, ByteDance investors are eager to present the company as the parent company of the first social media company to grow in China and the West, based on a former executive. "Without America, it's not global," said that person.Investors also fear that, if the United States forces ByteDance to dispose of TikTok or ceases U.S. operations, other countries that have expressed concern about TikTok, such as Japan and India, could also decide to take action, according to familiar with the matter. Adding that TikTok might resist loss of access to the US market, but the loss of several countries would be devastating.TikTok has continued to invest heavily to grow in the United States, both to the delight and to the dismay of its American rivals.It has also spenthundreds of millions of dollars in ads on Snapchat and Instagram, generating significant revenue for both companies, but also raised concerns around Silicon Valley about increased competition."They operate outside China under a completely different set of rules," Adam Mosseri, executive and head of Instagram, a Facebook unit, told sports podcaster Bill Simmons in October. Mosseri also criticized the company for cloning Musical.ly, then buying it and renaming it TikTok.ByteDance spokesman noted that Mosseri's Instagram was purchased by Facebook. "There's a real lack of self-awareness here, " he said.Last week, Instagram introduced a tikTok-like product called Reels, which follows Facebook's attempt to launch a TikTok clone late last year with an app called Lasso. Application that has not yet gained traction. TikTok allows users to share and watch short videos that usually last less than 15 seconds.Meanwhile, rivals of the Chinese version of TikTok are preparing to attack. Tencent Holdings recently told his employees that his new priority is to aggressively confront Douyin, an acquainted person with the discussions indicated. Tencent has also allocated an unlimited budget to its own Weishi short video app, said such person.At a recent conference with analysts, Martin Lau, tencent's president, said the company plans to back Weishi with "a lot of marketing money and content," and described it as the tech giant's flagship short video app.A complicated factor for ByteDance is that it doesn't want to instill the Chinese government, based on people familiar with the company's thinking.Like other Chinese technology companies, ByteDance relies on the government to issue licenses to manage its business. When government ministries ask, it runs ads on their apps in China at no cost to promote government events, one of these people said.ByteDance also delivers certain user data, such as phone numbers and national identification numbers, to The Chinese police, but only when presented with a request -- a request for evidence -- that shows that the user is suspected of having violated local laws, the person said.A ByteDance spokesperson said the company adheres to local laws and regulations in the markets in which it operates. Regarding the ads, he said that some of ByteDance's Chinese apps offer free public service ads in certain cases, but that's consistent with other civic commitments in other apps, including TikTok.ByteDance seems to be asserting some independence. When protests broke out in Hong Kong in June, ByteDance initially had a policy of restricting content about protests in all its applications, including TikTok, a person familiar with the issue said.That changed over the summer, when the company's policy team decided to further adapt TikTok's practices to the laws and regulations of each country, the person said. The move caused some people at ByteDance to worry about them disturbing the Chinese government, the person said.A former employee of TikTok's Los Angeles office said it would be difficult for thecompany shake its roots. "We are a Chinese company," this person said. "And we respond to China for our actions."Translated by Luis Felipe CedilloEdited by Michelle del CampoCopyright © 2019 Dow Jones &Company;, Inc.

With this collaboration, overseas users will now be able to use WeChat Pay across multiple payment scenarios spanning shopping, restaurants, transportation and accommodation. For instance, overseas users can use WeChat Pay to purchase railway tickets.In recent years, more and more overseas visitors are travelling to mainland China and some have chosen to stay and work here. According to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, the number of inbound tourists reached 141.2 million in 2018, an increase of 1.2% over the same period of the previous year. Furthermore, according to the Minister of Science and Technology, China is also attracting talents from around the globe to start innovative new businesses. Currently, there are more than 950,000 foreigners working in China, and the country has cumulatively issued 336,000 overseas talent work permits in 2018.However, the inconvenience of not being able to use the widely adopted local mobile payments is becoming a major pain point for overseas people living or visiting mainland China.

Forced re-education: Secret documents reveal how China mass detention camps workStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeNovember 27, 2019 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 622 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBodyOther documents it obtained include "intelligence briefings" showing how police have been "guided by a massive data collection and analysis system that uses artificial intelligence to select entire categories of Xinjiang residents for detention".More than 20 pages of classified documents were obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.A popular mobile file-sharing application has been a key tool for the Chinese government to carry out surveillance on the Uyghur Muslim population in Xinjiang where a million of them are interred in locked-down camps with watchtowers and 24/7 surveillance.After bloody race riots rocked China's far west a decade ago, the ruling Communist Party turned to a rare figure in their ranks to restore order: a Han Chinese official fluent in Uighur, the language of the local Turkic Muslim minority.The documents, mostly from 2017, reveal plans to construct a large number of heavily secured facilities in which detainees are forcibly taught in the Chinese language, proper "manners", and "ideological education".File photo posted by the Xinjiang Judicial Administration to its WeChat account.China has repeatedly denied such accusations, saying that Xinjiang has not suffered any terror attacks in the past three years.In 2016, Beijing appointed a new leader for Xinjiang - Chen Quanguo. Most of the documents were issued in 2017. "Xinjiang is much safer...."Liu Xiaoming, China's ambassador to the United Kingdom, dismissed the papers as "pure fabrications".Kim hits 25-foot putt to capture LPGA finale, $1.5M prizeThe 21-year-old Floridian put that early wobble behind her to pick up three quick birdies before the turn to advance to 10 under. Charley Hull finished second at the LPGA's season-ending Tour Championship, one shot behind victor Kim Sei-young of South Korea.The northwestern province of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is described the Communist Party of China -ruled government as a "key battlefield in the fight against terrorism and [religious] extremism in China".Erzhan Qurban, a Chinese-born ethnic Kazakh, was held for nine months because he had spent time overseas in Kazakhstan.Other detainees have said there was torture or rape at the camps. One document states that the goal of the surveillance is "to prevent problems before they happen". This chimes with reverse engineering performed the advocacy group Human Rights Watch on the Integrated Joint Operations Platform security app used by police in Xinjiang. The IJOP spat out the names of people considered suspicious for behavior that includes going overseas, asking others to pray or using cell phone apps that can not be monitored by the government.Adrian Zenz said to Associated Press that this can be seen as a form of mass cultural genocide.The indoctrination goes along with "manner education", where behaviour is dictated, including ensuring "timely haircuts and shaves", "regular change of clothes" and "bathing once or twice a week".The release of the documents is likely to intensify global condemnation of the Chinese government.Detainees are frequently tested on Mandarin, ideology and discipline, and their scores feed into a point system tracked by computer.The detainees are referred to as "students" who must graduate from these camps. Prisoners are kept in detention for at least a year before "vocational training", a practice that violates China's own detention laws which prohibit authorities from holding suspects for that amount of time without charging the suspects with a crime.If indeed the so-called students "really need to leave the training centre due to illness or other special circumstances, they must have someone specially accompany, monitor and control them".Load-Date: November 27, 2019End of Document

AN FDI INVESTIGATIONStates News ServiceNovember 15, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 5267 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS):Scott Miller: I'm Scott.Bill Reinsch: I'm Bill. And we're The Trade Guys.Scott Miller: And we're The Trade Guys.Andrew Schwartz: You're listening to The Trade Guys, a podcast produced by CSIS, where we talk about trade in terms that everyone can understand. I'm H. Andrew Schwartz. And I'm here with Scott Miller and Bill Reinsch, The CSIS Trade Guys.On this episode of The Trade Guys, we're joined by a very special guest, Nancy McLernon. Nancy is the president and CEO of the Organization for International Investment and she'll break down the importance of foreign direct investment to the American worker and the overall economy. Plus, we'll dig into some recent foreign direct investment trends, including a huge drop-off in investment from China and a global turn towards emerging markets. Stay tuned for all that and much more on this episode of The Trade Guys.Andrew Schwartz: Gentlemen, here we go. We have a very special guest today. We have Nancy McLernon in here. Nancy, you're going to tell us all about foreign direct investment because that's what you do. Tell us first, just so we get this out of the barn, what exactly is foreign direct investment and what impact does FDI have on the U.S. economy?Nancy McLernon: Thanks so much and it's really great to be here. First, just a little bit about our organization.Andrew Schwartz: Sure.Nancy McLernon: We are a trade association, like so many folks here in D.C., but we are the only organization that exclusively represents international companies in the United States. So, yes, my bread and butter is foreign direct investment. We're now more than 200 companies strong. Our members are all significant investors and employers here in the United States in all different sorts of industries, from companies that are headquartered all over the world.What is foreign direct investment? So, it's a wonky term that really describes a simple action. It's when a company that is globally-headquartered in another country makes a deliberate decision to invest in the United States and employ people here. And they do it for a variety of reasons and one of which is to serve the U.S. marketplace. That clearly is an important factor but there are other things that drive foreign direct investment here that has to do with the quality of our workforce, the rule of law, because these firms not only manufacture here for our market but they also are a strong exporter from the United States, exporting about a quarter of all U.S. exports. So, there are a variety of reasons these companies do it. Companies like Nestle that is globally-headquartered in Switzerland. Samsung, globally-headquartered in Korea.Andrew Schwartz: I have a Samsung TV. They're awesome.Nancy McLernon: Excellent, excellent. They're awesome. Electrolux. Sweden-based Electrolux that makes their appliances down in North Carolina. I would guess that a lot of people don't know many of the brands that they purchase and love are made in the United States by "foreign companies." But when you unpack what these companies do here in the United States, there's not that much foreign about them.Andrew Schwartz: So, Trade Guys, jump in here. Scott, I know that you have a lot to say about this.Scott Miller: Well, look, globally-engaged companies serve consumers in lots of different ways. And they're looking for the best way to address a consumer market or their customer market. And we talk a lot about trade on the show. We talk a lot about physical importation of goods and exports of goods. But this is another way, and in some ways a very powerful way, of serving the local consumers in the United States.So, companies that directly invest in the United States, regardless of their headquarters, are creating jobs. They're creating employment here. And they're usually making products that are best tailored to the U.S. market. So, this is a very valuable part of our economy.Likewise, American-headquartered companies, who engage with the world, invest abroad. So, this is something that really is a hallmark of companies and it varies by business model. If you're Boeing, you can build a jet in the United States and fly it to its destination. But if you're Nestle, you want to be close to the consumer because of freshness. Lots of other food products are like that, just the way that you reach consumers, the way you go to market. So...Andrew Schwartz: And isn't foreign direct investment, isn't a lot of it a good sign for any healthy economy?Nancy McLernon: Yeah. I mean, some may call it a bellwether about how globally competitive we are. And the U.S. has been the number one location for foreign direct investment for some time. However, we've seen our share of foreign direct investment fall, rise, and fall again.So, in 2000, the U.S. attracted about 35% of the world's cross-border investment. And then by 2008, it had fallen to about 15%.Andrew Schwartz: Why was that?Nancy McLernon: Well, I think that the main reason was that other countries got more competitive. They really ramped up their attractiveness for bringing in foreign direct investment. And that was at a time that the Obama administration created SelectUSA, which is the federal government's first investment promotion agency. Prior to that, all of our recruitment of foreign direct investment came from governors. And it just became harder and harder for Ohio to compete against Germany, right? Because most other developed countries had a federal-level investment promotion arm.Since 2008, we went back up to about attracting 25% of the world's economy, cross-border investment. And then from 2017 to 2018, we dropped again for the first time in eight years, dropping down to about 23%. But it is a really, I think, very clear sign, yard stick, if you will, of how competitive we are as a nation when we attract companies that are not homegrown.Bill Reinsch: Yeah. I saw you had two really strong years in what, '15 and '16? Or '16 and '17?Nancy McLernon: Right.Bill Reinsch: And now, you've had decline. And this year, it looks to be on track also. So, is this have anything to do with the current administration? Or is this larger macroeconomic issues?Nancy McLernon: Yeah. So, I think that there are, just like anything else, there's a lot of different factors at play. Number one is worldwide foreign direct investment is contracting. So, from 2017 to 2018, it contracted about 14%. And the U.S. drop was about 8%. So, we dropped less than the sort of global contraction of FDI. But I think that the rise, not only in the United States but around the world, in sort of nationalism, multi-localization, sort of this forced domestic production, I think is having an impact on all of that.Scott Miller: Sure. Piece of it is aggregate demand, right?Nancy McLernon: Sure.Scott Miller: Declines in 2008 were clearly because our economy was in recession, okay? And-Bill Reinsch: Yeah. But that doesn't explain the last two years.Scott Miller: Other countries were growing faster. Last two years, the United States has actually been growing faster than Europe in particular. But also, Asia has slowed down some, versus say 10, 15 years ago. So, while aggregate demand is part of the story, it's only a part. And policy is different.Nancy McLernon: So, 2015 and 2016 were extraordinary years. 2017 and 2018 went back to normal levels. And again, we're still the largest, the most popular location for FDI. I think it's important to look at that global share because that again tells us how competitive we are with other countries. We don't want to leave any jobs on the global table, so to speak.And being attractive for FDI, part of that story is kind of, Bill, what you were mentioning. The current policies of sort of promoting an America-first environment provides some uncertainty. Some of our strained relationship with our most longstanding trading partners also has caused increased uncertainty.Andrew Schwartz: And that decreases foreign investment? Or no?Nancy McLernon: Yeah. No, it definitely can have-Scott Miller: At the margin, sure.Nancy McLernon: Yeah. And tariffs and other things that make it more costly to be a company that operates in multiple jurisdictions definitely has an impact as well.Andrew Schwartz: So, how can we say that we're open for business, yet at the same time, we're saying, "America first"? We're sending mixed messages, is what I'm hearing from you.Nancy McLernon: Well, I think that's probably true with most administrations, unfortunately. There is this, "We're open for business. We want to do the next ribbon-cutting at the next facility." But then there's a disconnect between that and policies that provide the same opportunities for all companies to succeed in the U.S. market.There was a time that we always... we put a flag on a company. And it's becoming, because of how companies have operated for the last 30, 50 years, it's becoming more and more difficult to do that, but more irrelevant to do so. And I think that we see our political leaders still kind of wanting to do that.Scott Miller: Here's a way to think about it, Andrew, is if you imagine, we have an open investment policy. Anyone can invest in America. We're delighted to welcome foreign investment into the economy. Foreign investors are treated equally before the law. They have all the rights and privileges that an American person or American company would.Nancy McLernon: Well, that's the hope.Scott Miller: That's the-Nancy McLernon: We've had some challenges to that but-Scott Miller: That's the positive side. The negative side is look at our imports. Half of our imports are intermediate goods. They're things we use to make other things. The tariffs on intermediate goods have made it less attractive to produce finished goods here, including the foreign-invested companies who are trying to produce finished goods, whatever they might be, in the U.S. So, we're welcoming with one hand and then we're raising the cost of doing business with the other. And that's-Bill Reinsch: Well, we're doing something else too. And I wanted to ask you about this. We welcome inbound investment. This administration seems to be actively discouraging outbound investment. The president's clear, he wants Americans to stay here and he wants them to produce more here. And they're under some pressure to do that.Bill Reinsch: Do you find that being reciprocated? Are your members having pressure from their home governments to do the same thing? To stay in the U.K., in Japan or Korea, in Norway or wherever it is?Nancy McLernon: Well, as I said, what's happening in this country is similar to what's happening in other developed countries. I think that we have this nationalism rising in a variety of places all over the world. And that is what is factoring into that contraction of FDI. And while, again, while we say we're open for business and policies that would negatively or disproportionately impact them. So my industry sector, if you will, so international companies in the insurance space, in the car space, in the food space, are operating from the specifics of their industry. However, as an industry of international companies in and of itself, a lot of policymakers don't know that some of my companies are quote unquote foreign, right? So when they introduce legislation, and this is true out of the administration as well in the regulatory space, trying to go after foreign companies, they don't realize that's their favorite washing machine manufacturer in the United States. That's their favorite local producer that's really globally owned. And so one of the main missions of our organization and what we try to arm our companies with is how to talk about their global heritage.In a way that people understand, "Okay, I'm a company that started off in the U.K., but we've been in the United States more than a hundred years. And we have imported policies, corporate culture that actually specifically benefit the United States." So when I think about what does foreign investment mean to the US, US economy, it first and foremost means paychecks. So 7 million Americans get a paycheck from an international company. And here is just a, I think somewhat of a shocking stat. Foreign companies are actually driving Made in America. 62% of all of the manufacturing jobs created over the last five years have been at international companies.Bill Reinsch: Foreign companies are driving made in America.Nancy McLernon: I believe that's what the stats know.Bill Reinsch: When you say we should be clear about definitions, when you say international companies, you're referring to foreign headquartered companies operating in the United States because we have international companies too. GE is an international company, but you're not talking about them.Nancy McLernon: And GE probably doesn't refer to themselves as an international company. Although GE Appliances is now owned by a foreign company.Andrew Schwartz: But you're talking about Japanese companies, German companies.Bill Reinsch: Headquartered companies operating in the United States.Nancy McLernon: Companies globally headquartered outside the United States with operations here.Bill Reinsch: Let me ask a question about that, it's frustrated me for years, I used to have battles with my friends in organized labor about this. And I think this is a problem that-Andrew Schwartz: Shocking that Bill had battles with his friends.Bill Reinsch: Thank you, Andrew. This is also, I think, true of this administration that fundamentally they look at investment location as sort of a zero sum thing. You know, for an American company, a dollar invested in Mexico for organized labor is a dollar not invested in United States. It's either here or there. And I've always thought that these things are win-win. That a foreign investment inbound produces gains on both sides.Nancy McLernon: That's what the statistics show, absolutely.Bill Reinsch: Have you got data on that? Maybe not now, but can you share it with us? I look for that.Nancy McLernon: Absolutely. Yeah, that definitely shows. I mean, there have been studies, and again, I don't have it here with me. US investment abroad, you know redounds to the benefit of Americans. But it's a hard economic equation sometimes when you're in the country receiving the investment. So the US receiving foreign direct investment, there's bricks and mortar. There is a more simple economic sort of math equation to take a look at it. But I absolutely agree with what you're saying.Andrew Schwartz: If you share the data with us, we will put it in the Trade Guys notes for sure.Bill Reinsch: The number that I used years ago was that for every US dollar invested outside the country, something like a dollar 32 came back, 15 or 20 cents to tax.Scott Miller: I used to work for a company that had almost no exports, exports only to Canada and Mexico from its US operations and yet one in five US jobs were attributed to with the international business and they were good jobs in logistics, RandD, all the headquarters functions of a global company that basically benefited from the fact that you had assets abroad and you had production abroad. So it's definitely a positive sum game. And the same goes for foreign companies who invest in the United States, it benefits the United States. It benefits the operations of the company. It makes them better companies overall, better able to serve consumers.Nancy McLernon: I'll give you an interesting example. So many years ago, and I don't think this will shock you guys, but maybe it will, Unilever, one of our members acquired Ben and Jerry's and Ben and Jerry's made sure that their corporate culture was intact because that was a big selling point of the company. But that acquisition has enabled Ben and Jerry's to compete in Europe against Haagen Dazs, right? So before it was just a US company and didn't have that global reach, the same thing is happening when US companies invest abroad as well, bringing lots of different things to the US market in a way that benefits us consumers.Andrew Schwartz: Do you want to hear a great story about Ben and Jerry's? You know, everybody pitches Ben and Jerry their favorite flavor, right? So I met Ben Cohen and I said, "Look, I've got the flavor of all flavors for you." And I said, "Ben, I know you're a music fan, you know, Cherry Garcia and everything. So I said, look, you've got to come up with a flavor called Neville Nation for the Neville brothers." Neville Nation. And I gave him like the whole recipe and everything.Nancy McLernon: Shocking that we haven't seen that yet.Andrew Schwartz: No. And I'm thinking like, this is a winner. Like who doesn't want to eat Neville Nation from new Orleans? It's like, you know, fudge brownie, it's got like praline in it, everything. And he just looks at me and he goes, "You know, I've got something with Dr. John in the works."Andrew Schwartz: And you know, to talk about crushing a guy. I mean, that's my story.Bill Reinsch: I think the Neville brothers will forgive you for this.Andrew Schwartz: The Neville brothers know this story. They were my neighbors in New Orleans and when I was at Tulane and they know all about it. And Dr. John also knows about it because he was a friend. God rest his soul.Bill Reinsch: Well there's some new laws about governing foreign investment. The committee on foreign investment in the United States has existed for some time now, but there's new legislation. Legislation was passed a year or two ago. How is that affecting your members? What are the changes? What are you noticing in terms of U.S. oversight and regulation of foreign investment?Nancy McLernon: Yeah, so our organization supported that law, sort of the modernization of CIFIUS when it passed.Andrew Schwartz: CIFIUS, the Committee on Foreign Investment-Nancy McLernon: Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. And you know, I think there were some elements to that bill that really just codified what was already happening in current law. I think it's really important for Congress to feel very confident in that review process because if they don't, deals become politicized very, very easily. We have found that over the years, competitors try to use that government review process to achieve something that they couldn't in the marketplace. So we were pleased to see Congress modernize CIFIUS so that they would have confidence in the process. We're involved right now in the regulatory stage wanting to ensure that CIFIUS reviews say focused on sort of defense related national security if you will, doesn't drip into protectionism and so right now I think there'll be more deals filed but it's not our expectation that it would discourage the kind of foreign direct investment we've been talking about here today.Bill Reinsch: It's really about China. I mean it's neutrally phrased, it's always neutrally phrased. So theoretically, anything your members are going to acquire is going to end up going through some level of review process. I think the expectation is that if you're going to see anything different, it'll mostly have to do with China. I mean the main thing to me that the law does is it expands the universe of stuff that they're going to look at because in the past it was just, it was outright accurate.Nancy McLernon: Personal data is factoring-Bill Reinsch: Look at a non-passive, non-acquisitions and joint ventures.Nancy McLernon: Even though, Bill, even though it's sort of aimed at China, some of my members, and I have some Chinese companies, but some of my non-Chinese member companies that have exposure in China are being impacted even though they're not a Chinese-owned company.Bill Reinsch: Really? How so?Nancy McLernon: Concern about supply chains and so forth that even though that the company is headquartered in Germany, if they have significant exposure in China and sort of how they're-Scott Miller: So the complexities of the real world are showing up in the administration as well.Bill Reinsch: This has been a common theme on this podcast in the past that supply chains make everything more complicated and this is a good example of that. There are all kinds of connections. I mean the other thing that's happened, thanks also to supply chains is all these things are in multiple jurisdictions. If your company in Germany is going to buy somebody, they may not need just us approval. They may need Chinese approval, they may need EU approval. They may need, you know, Canadian approval for that matter because they have facilities in all places and all places that are impacted. Does that make the process of making foreign investments a lot more complicated than it used to be? Or do people know how to navigate?Nancy McLernon: I don't think so. I think people know how to navigate it. I don't think so. And kind of the same things that they have to go through with antitrust rules. And so I think it's sort of baked in. You know, a big question mark out there is how will the growing nationalistic sentiment affect all of this? The majority of foreign direct investment in any developed country is through MandA, like 80 some percent. And you know, so I just gave the Unilever example, right?Nancy McLernon: Cross border MandA enormously benefits the companies.Bill Reinsch: Mergers and acquisitions.Nancy McLernon: Mergers and acquisitions enormously benefits the company being acquired because you've got cash flooded in, right? A foreign company that buys an entity is doing so because they believe in that company. It's a foothold into the market. And so all these other economic factors-Scott Miller: The home operation is recapitalized. But you have opportunities worldwide now. I love the idea of Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream got into Europe because Unilever purchased them. Otherwise, it would have not been.Andrew Schwartz: It's so much better than Haagen Dazs.Scott Miller: I think so.Andrew Schwartz: You know. Well, Nancy, let me ask you this.Bill Reinsch: What's your favorite flavor? What's your favorite flavor? Cherry Garcia? It would have been Neville Nation.Andrew Schwartz: It would have been Neville Nation, but of course it is Cherry Garcia.Nancy, let me ask you this. So we talked about some of the countries that are the top investors in the U.S.. UK, Japan, Germany, Ireland, France. China though, let's talk about China. China recently has cracked the top 10 right? So it's now accounting for about 1.4%, is that right, of FDI in the US?Bill Reinsch: It's way down.Scott Miller: Yeah, in terms of flow dollars.Nancy McLernon: Yeah, it's down. But their stock, China's stock in the U.S. grew the fastest out of the top 20 cumulative countries and it rose more than four-fold, from 2013 to 2018.Andrew Schwartz: Okay. So, let's talk about China going forward though. What should we expect, given the relationship with the United States and China right now, what should we expect China's share? Should it grow or shrink in years to come? What do you think?Nancy McLernon: Yeah, I think Chinese outbound investment, not just in the United States but in other countries is under some heavy scrutiny. I think there's been some directives in China to take care of that. So it's not just the US or other countries sort of putting up barriers. I think that Chinese companies are also realizing they're making the environment tough for them. And I expect to kind of see them pulling back even further for the environment to get a little softer for them.Bill Reinsch: Well, the Chinese I think are thinking are restricting outbound investment for their own domestic policy purposes. We were all also struck, and we've commented on this before by the McKinsey Global Institute Study from last February or March, that among other things talked about in China and India that they are beginning now to do what economists have been telling them to do for years, which is to move away from the export led growth model to a domestic consumption led growth model. But they're doing it with indigenous supply chains so that what you've got are Chinese companies, building Chinese supply chains. I think not necessarily because they have to or because we're precluding that or the Chinese government is precluding that, but for a variety of economic reasons that they're just they're trying to shorten the supply chain. And it may be that they're trying to insulate themselves from some of the vulnerabilities or some of the vagaries of other countries' policies or tariffs that are going on.Nancy McLernon: Yeah. But you know, Andrew, your mention of China, right? Chinese investment in the United States, Chinese companies right now is sort of the tip of the sword on policy affecting all of my companies. So initiatives that are introduced in Congress, regulation that are trying to go after Chinese companies would actually affect all of my member companies because it's very hard to sort of isolate out kind of going after companies from a certain country, which is why it is so important for our member companies, our organization to unpack the full story of foreign investment. Because still Chinese investment is still relatively small in the United States compared to companies from countries that have been investing in the United States for decades and more than a century.Nancy McLernon: And we've seen that happen over the last 30 years. So before this podcast, we were talking about when the US began its efforts in Iraq and France decided not to join us in that effort. And there was a whole outrage in Congress kind of going after-Bill Reinsch: Freedom fries.Nancy McLernon: -French companies. But initiatives were introduced that were going to affect all of my members. I think there is this sort of misconception that there's a monolithic foreign company when it's obviously enormously diversified.Andrew Schwartz: Right. So you in your organization have a lot of messaging to do, it seems.Nancy McLernon: When we started in 1990, and at that time it was the concern about Japanese investment in the United States, there was a big headwind against us. I've seen over the last 30 years, this sort of up and down, but mostly upward trajectory of support for global connections. And I think that starting in 2016 again, not just in the United States and not just with President Trump, on both sides of the aisle, there is a lot of skepticism about our global connections. And I don't know, maybe five years ago I was saying, "You know what? I think we're good. Maybe we don't need to ... People are understanding and supporting foreign direct investment." And now we're in really turbulent times. Again, I think that's not just in the United States. U.S. companies in Europe and in the U.K., all of global businesses have a challenge now because our political leaders, for the most part, are pushing this nationalistic sentiment. It's up to us to try to turn that around.Bill Reinsch: When I was a lobbyist and running a different association, when we talked, we talked a lot about tax and tax policy, which is a big deal for you guys I assume. Is it still a big deal? And how has the tax bill from last year affected your guys?Nancy McLernon: Yes, so I think tax and trade are always big deals for large corporations or for most corporations. And so in the 52 day sprint that Congress considered the tax reform, we felt that there that our companies were being heard and there were policies that were initially part of it that would have been discriminatory against our companies. At the end of the day, our organization supported it. Again, most of our companies are concentrated in the manufacturing sector and I think manufacturing companies in general did well in the tax reform.Bill Reinsch: Has that been your experience after the fact? Has it turned out the way you thought it was going to turn out?Nancy McLernon: So there's still some things up in the air. So regulations have not been finalized, but I would say overall tax reform made the US more competitive for foreign-Scott Miller: Well that's the story that never got out on the Tax Cuts And Jobs Act. Because everybody focused on the individual side. But the real changes, the substantive changes were largely on the corporate side. And they were quite, quite positive with territorial taxation and a much lower headline rate. All that made the United States a better place to locate production, whether from a foreign headquarters or domestically.Nancy McLernon: Yeah, absolutely.Andrew Schwartz: Well, this is a fascinating discussion and it brings me to one final thing I wanted to bring up. But as we go forward with these issues, it seems to me there's going to be an increasing overlap between national and economic security issues. How does that play out in your world?Nancy McLernon: Protecting national security is obviously the most important thing. What we need to make sure is that economic security is not subsumed into national security in a way that erects barriers. Because we know that that actually will threaten national security. Foreign direct investment in the United States actually strengthens our national security. It diversifies our economy and it gets other countries on the same side of the economic ledger as the United States. And many of our companies have very strong veteran's programs. DSM, which is a Dutch company manufacturing down in North Carolina the material for our military's flak jackets in North Carolina. And so it's interesting that national security would in any way feel threatened by foreign direct investment. But how any administration defines national security will absolutely impact whether we are open for business,Scott Miller: These are partners in both national security production, whether it's weapon systems or whatever the components might be. But they also enhance our economy. They lead to faster growth, they lead to more jobs and better jobs. So a net positive.Andrew Schwartz: Which is increasing a huge part of our national security.Nancy McLernon: Right.Scott Miller: Absolutely.Nancy McLernon: Well, there's a saying that when goods cross borders, armies don't. So strengthening our economic relationships with other countries, whether it's through trade or cross border investment, strengthens our national security. It doesn't weaken it.Andrew Schwartz: Yeah. I want to get a painting of Bill in a Napoleon outfit with that slogan and put it up in my office. That's my next big acquisition.Nancy McLernon: All right. Will you be posing for that, Bill?Scott Miller: The Neville Brothers ice cream brand that didn't happen.Andrew Schwartz: That's right. Reminding me of my ultimate failure. There you go.Nancy McLernon: Or a potential new business opportunity.Andrew Schwartz: You never know. Nancy, thank so much for being here today with the trade guys. This was really enlightening for me, interesting, and we hope to have you back sometime soon.Nancy McLernon: Appreciate it.

China threatens to retaliate if Germany bans 5G from HuaweiCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 15, 2019 SundayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 631 wordsBody       The Chinese ambassador to Germany pointed to the target of the millions of German vehicles that are sold in China.                                                The Chinese ambassador to Germany threatened Berlin with retaliation if Huawei Technologies is excluded as a 5G wireless equipment supplier. And to do so, alluded to the millions of German vehicles sold in China. "If Germany makes a decision that leads to Huawei's exclusion from the German market, there will be consequences," Ambassador Wu Ken said yesterday at a Handelsblatt newspaper event. "The Chinese government will not be unwilling to watch," he added, quoted by Bloomberg. The ambassador's comments come at a time when there is growing resistance to Huawei by some heavyweights in the coalition under Chancellor Angela Merkel. These members of the government challenged Merkel's policy toward China with a decree-law that could prohibit the operations of "unreliable" 5G technology vendors. Although this German legislation does not explicitly cite Huawei, it is tailored to the Chinese company and comes after months of debate on security at 5G, Bloomberg points out. Huawei, it is recalled, has repeatedly rejected allegations that its equipment is prepared for espionage and sabotage. German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier today put some water in the boil, warning against passing laws targeting specific companies. "We should not turn against specific companies and should instead insist that all electronic and high-tech components used in Germany meet the highest safety requirements," Altmaier said in a published interview this Sunday at Der Tagesspiegel. Good news and bad news It is recalled that last Wednesday, December 11, Huawei won a contract with Telefónica to expand the 5G in Germany. Under this contract, the Chinese giant will help German Telefónica, along with Finnish Nokia, in the construction and expansion of a fifth generation internet network.The announcement, made by Telefónica and released by Bloomberg, was good news for Huawei, especially after Deutsche Telekom decided to stop ordering equipment from Chinese suppliers.But the bad news quickly came back. Two days later, on Friday, Norway's telecommunications operator drove Huawei away from 5G. In fact, Telenor chose Ericsson as the leading 5G supplier in Norway, driving Huawei away after a decade of collaboration. Telenor said it had carried out an "extensive" security assessment process, also taking into account other factors, such as technical quality, innovation and network modernization. The "war" with the U.S. Huawei's issue is also a sensitive issue because Donald Trump's administration has sought to mobilize United States allies to drive Huawei away from the supply of 5G technology. And Portugal is part of the list of countries advised in this regard. Last December 5, the U.S. Secretary of State warned Portugal against Huawei's choice for 5G. In his passage through Lisbon, Mike Pompeo warned Portugal against the allocation of 5G telecommunications networks to Huawei, to which the Portuguese Government responded by ensuring that any decision will take into account national security. Andeven Washington has given the benefit of the doubt. In May, the Trump Administration announced that it had put Huawei on a 'blacklist' of entities banned from doing business with U.S. companies, citing reasons of "national security" and accusing the company of working with Beijing authorities.Shortly after the initial decision of Washington was announced, it was indicated that it would only take effect 90 days later, a deadline that in August was renewed for another three months. On November 18, a new "renewal" was given, with the new business deadline between the two sides remaining until February 16, 2020.Load-Date: January 27, 2020End of Document

YOU NEED TO KNOW US BETTER, AND TO STUDY MANDARINStates News ServiceNovember 21, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 831 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:From Chinese Embassy in AustraliaOn 21 November 2019, The Australian published a signed article YOU NEED TO KNOW US BETTER, AND TO STUDY MANDARIN by Mr. Wang Xining, Charge d'Affaires of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China to Australia. The full text is as follows:Over the past six months since I assumed my post in Canberra it has been shocking to learn that so much attention has been fixed on China by fellow Australians.It was equally shocking to find that so much distortion had occurred in the local portrait of my homeland. According to the descriptions by some Aussies and media reports, China seems to me an alien country, not the place where I grew up over the past half a century.One of the major reasons for this disparity in understanding China is that the Chinese perspective, the views of ordinary Chinese citizens, has seldom surfaced in this corner of the world. People indulge themselves in a self-righteous cognitive universe structured by ideologically censored or linguistically filtered information.At the supposedly prestigious The Australian Strategic Forum, which took place this Monday, the starry list of speakers and panellists fell short of representatives of the Chinese perspective.Although the audience was enlightened by a league of broad visions and in-depth analyses, the forum was still several stones throw from a qualified China debate, as there was no genuine or faithful presentation of the views and ideas from the target country.There was no commentator, not a single one, who reflected over the Mandarin language comments about Australia and its relationship with China that had appeared in amazingly large quantity in Chinese media, or on websites and social media. Either the Aussies don't read them or they just don't like them.But these comments represent the Chinese perspective, in one of many forms. Neglect of these discussions equals a self-imposed segregation from what really happens in the country and among the people. Truth hurts very often, but truth makes people stand up and march forward.If an Aussie reads Mandarin comments from Chinese journalists, scholars, businessmen and in most cases ordinary Chinese citizens, he or she will be astounded by the overwhelming support of the Chinese people for the government's decision to not permit Australian members of parliament Andrew Hastie and James Paterson to visit China, as they had tossed rounds of insult and pressure and showed no respect for the nation of which they are knocking at the door.To make it less barbaric, I wonder how an Aussie would react to someone who called you a "jerk" and then said he was going to teach you how to cook noodles in your house as he believes only he knows the right recipe.People in China would laugh out loud if they were told the Australians think the two MPs were rejected because they have different views, and the Chinese government cannot stand criticism.Talk with a notoriously knoweverything Beijing taxi driver. Shoot the wolf, he may say, quoting lyrics from a Korean War era song, as many people already did in their comment entries.Failure to grasp and understand the Chinese perspective makes many Australians complacent about Australia's superiority of wealth, culture and system over China. China must be wrong on many issues, particularly on political superstructure and ideological values, no matter how much progress has been made in economic transformation, poverty reduction, social coherence, cultural enrichment and international contribution, which benefit many other countries, including Australia.Absence of a Chinese perspective in any debate on China deprives Australians of adequate knowledge of how the Chinese system works, let alone opportunities to demystify the Communist Party of China and appreciate the many humane, rational, intelligent and, most importantly, democratic features of the Chinese political establishment.It is cynical that in a country boasting freedom of speech, different views from another nation are constantly and intentionally obliterated. Understanding truth succumbs to being politically right. A people said to be audacious and adventurous like kangaroos are scared of stepping out of the comfort zone of ideas and thinking. Chinese netizens now look at this continent and wonder where has the friendly, creative, inspirational, openminded and independent Australia gone. The country that contributed Wi-Fi and APEC seems to be losing its charm and recoiling into a cocoon woven by someone else. "A proud deputysheriff? Ha ha."If an Aussie really cares about the country's largest trading partner, believes in the basics of economics and social science, cherishes the fundamentals of human rights, respects mother nature and humanity, plans a good future for their children, please make an effort to know the Chinese perspective. To start with, study Mandarin.Load-Date: December 8, 2019End of Document

Huawei and ZTE can't be trusted. It's up to the FCC to keep them in checkCNN WireNovember 21, 2019 Thursday 5:56 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 705 wordsDateline: () BodyEditor's note: Tim Chapman is Executive Director of Heritage Action for America. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. () --  The conflict between the Trump administration and China will soon move to an unlikely arena: the Federal Communications Commission. On November 22, the FCC will decide whether to prevent US companies from using federal funds to purchase equipment from untrusted companies, like China's Huawei and ZTE --- two of the world's largest telecom equipment and phone manufacturers. The choice should be obvious: Trusting Chinese companies to essentially build our nation's wireless networks would be a huge mistake.Barring US companies from using federal funds toward purchasing Chinese-made tech equipment is tactically smart for several reasons. First off, China, our strongest geopolitical foe, is eager to sell us on new Huawei and ZTE 5G technology. They offer some of the world's most advanced wireless services, and they're happy to sell them at a cheap price --- heavily subsidized by the Beijing government. But giving these companies access to the US digital economy would put our national security at risk. After all, Chinese companies are not controlled by shareholders or the market --- Chinese President Xi Jinping has the final say. Chinese law requires all corporations to "support, assist, and cooperate with national intelligence efforts." That means Beijing can force companies to build backdoors into their communications products and spy on Americans or steal valuable intellectual property. The danger is not hypothetical. Countries around the world have already found vulnerabilities in Huawei products, and many have outright banned doing business with the company. The Trump administration itself has imposed several strong restrictions on the company, though they have yet to be fully implemented.If our 5G network uses Chinese technology, it could compromise vital military information, trade secrets and citizens' privacy. It sounds like science fiction, but it's already a way of life in China. Second, Chinese tech firms are a serious economic and technological threat to the United States. Huawei is the world's second-largest manufacturer of smart phones, ahead of Apple. Allowing US companies to buy Chinese-made equipment and services for our most important infrastructure would cripple US equipment providers and put our nation further behind in the race for technological innovation. That's unacceptable. Not only do we need homegrown 5G for national security reasons, we need it to preserve the global technological edge our country has maintained since Apollo 11.For too long, the Chinese government and its companies have manipulated currency, stolen US intellectual property, violated sanctions and dumped products overseas, harming American security and business interests in the process. While free trade is a foundational value of the American system, that's not what the Chinese want. The Chinese government wants total control of supply chains from start to finish in order to make nations like ours economically dependent, and they're willing to flout the law to do it. Until recently, the world has let them.This is why the commission's vote is so important. The right decision will not only cut off bad actors from up to $8.5 billion of government funds, but it will also send a strong signal that America is no longer apathetic to China's aggression. For decades, Western markets have turned a blind eye to unfair trade practices, human rights abuses and severe security concerns in order to get the latest tech at the lowest prices. But the Trump administration has taken a strong stance on these issues while holding Beijing accountable for its wrongful actions. The FCC should continue in that vein by protecting our information highway from the risk of capture by a hostile nation.The FCC's vote should serve as another sign that US-China relations have entered a new era under this administration. A wise decision would set the proper tone for a 5G strategy in the United States and bolster our trade and national security stance toward China for years to come.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

TikTok's catastrophic handling of a teen who posted anti-China videos shows it is almost impossible to run a viral platform while following China's rulesBusiness Insider USNovember 30, 2019 Saturday 03:51 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1233 wordsByline: ama@businessinsider.com,  (Alexandra Ma)Highlight: TikTok has repeatedly denied censoring politically controversial content. It's not doing a great job.BodyDado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters; Feroza Aziz/TikTok• TikTok publicly apologized to a 17-year-old girl who was suspended from the platform shortly after posting a series of videos condemning China's oppression of the Uighur Muslims.• Feroza Aziz remains unconvinced by TikTok's apology, saying she believes TikTok is helping China censor politically sensitive content.• TikTok is owned by a Chinese company. Tech firms in China often adhere to the Communist Party's demands to censor politically sensitive content.• TikTok has repeatedly denied censoring or demoting politically controversial content, and tried to emphasize its fun and lighthearted videos instead. It's not doing a great job.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.TikTok's catastrophic public-relations fallout over its suspension of a teen girl who posted anti-China videos has shown that it's almost impossible to run a viral social-media platform while following Beijing's rules.On Wednesday, the video-streaming app issued a public apology to 17-year-old Feroza Aziz, whose            account was suspended after she posted a series of viral videos condemning China's mass surveillance and detention of            Uighur Muslims.TikTok has repeatedly denied suspending Aziz over the anti-China clips, claiming she was suspended for posting a video featuring the terrorist Osama bin Laden on a previous account.That video showed a list of celebrity crushes, with bin Laden's image added as part of "dark humor" at the end, Aziz told Business Insider on Wednesday.Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1199805145644707848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw This is the "video of Osama bin Laden" TikTok says got Feroza Aziz suspended from the platform. https://t.co/yRpiH9jIaN           pic.twitter.com/yzL2FjUjLvAziz has publicly doubted that the bin Laden video was the cause of her suspension, saying she thinks she was punished for standing up to China instead.The inherent difficulty of running a social media platform according to China's rulesThe entire episode has brought to light the inherent difficulty of running a viral social-media platform while being under China's watchful eye.TikTok, which is run by Chinese company ByteDance, has exploded in popularity since it launched in 2017, having accumulated a total of 1.5 billion downloads in two years and outperforming Instagram in app downloads this year.It is mainly popular among teens, who create and share content that mostly involve memes, dances, and lip-syncing.China Stringer Network/ReutersSimultaneously, it has faced mounting criticism and concern over its links to the Chinese government, which often compels domestic tech companies to censor content.TikTok's Chinese counterpart, Douyin - which does not share the same content or userbase as TikTok - has routinely purged anti-China videos from its platform.Leaked internal instructions show China's influenceTikTok, which is based in California, has repeatedly tried to distance itself from its Chinese links. ByteDance is currently trying to separate TikTok from much of its Chinese operations.Feroza Aziz/TikTokBut a series of leaked internal instructions, published by multiple news outlets in recent months, show TikTok moderators being told to remove or demote politically and culturally sensitive posts. Here's a rundown of those reports:• In September, The Guardian reported on leaked internal guidelines instructing moderators to censor content that criticize controversial topics about China, such as its            socialist system, Tiananmen Square, and Tibet.• Moderators were also told to censor LGBTQ content in conservative countries, like Turkey,            according to The Guardian.• TikTok confirmed the guidelines in both reports, but said they were no longer in use and that "we have since made significant progress in establishing a more robust localized approach."• On November 5, six former TikTok employees based in the US told The Washington Post that moderators in China told them to censor "culturally problematic" videos showing vaping, "heavy kissing and more suggestive dance moves," and "social political topics."• TikTok has said that it doesn't censor political content or take instructions from China.• On November 22, the German news site Netzpolitik published a leaked excerpt from TikTok's new moderation guidelines, which included instructions not to promote videos related to political protest.• The company did not deny the authenticity of the Netzpolitik documents, but said it "does not moderate content due to political sensitivities. Our moderation decisions are not influenced by any foreign government."• On November 28, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) think tank published a report claiming that ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, works closely with the Chinese government to endorse police content, facilitate human rights abuses, and surveil and censor content around the world.• Bytedance denied all of ASPI's claims.• TikTok has also repeatedly insisted that it protects user data and has not handed them over to the Chinese government, which has the power to compel tech firms to            hand over personal data and private conversations, without the platforms having to notify users.John Phillips/Getty Images for TechCrunchTikTok has been keen to emphasize its lighthearted side, with the company's leader Alex Zhu telling The New York Times earlier this month that political discussion is            allowed as long as it aligns with the platform's "creative and joyful experience."The US military is trying to figure out what China can 'see' inside TikTokBut despite these attempts, it has not managed to shake off any suspicion of its links to Chinese censorship.The US Army and the            Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a national-security panel, are currently investigating how it handles user data.TikTok has publicly apologized to Aziz, but she still isn't convinced - meaning the company still has a lot to answer for."I really doubt that TikTok is ultimately saying the truth about what's happening here," Aziz told Business Insider on Wednesday. "I think that something is going on and TikTok doesn't want people to find out what's going in China."• Read more:• The 17-year-old who got suspended by TikTok after posting viral videos about oppressed Muslims accuses the company of lazy, racist assumptions about Islam and terrorism• Watch the video featuring Osama bin Laden that TikTok says it suspended a teen over after her other video criticizing China went viral• Report claims TikTok parent company ByteDance is working with China's Communist Party to spread propaganda on Xinjiang• China's ByteDance is moving to separate its TikTok app from its Chinese operations amid a US government probeNOW WATCH: Apple just revealed its AirPods Pro for $249, which feature noise cancellation.

State Department Hosts Foreign Press Briefing on Addressing 5G, SecurityTargeted News ServiceNovember 26, 2019 Tuesday 8:47 PM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 7366 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Department of State issued the following foreign press center briefing by Commissioner Brendan Carr, Acting Deputy Assistant Director Thyaga Nandagopal and Adam Hickey, deputy assistant Attorney General for National Security, on addressing 5G and security:MODERATOR: Okay. Welcome, everyone to the Washington Foreign Press Center. My name is Cheryl Neely, and I'm very pleased to have you and our special guests here for an update on how the U.S. is addressing 5G and security.First, the ground rules. This is on the record and camera, so that's pretty easy.And first, I would like to introduce our briefers. Immediately to my left, we have Commissioner Brendan Carr. He has been commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission since 2017. In his position, he focuses on regulatory reforms in telecommunications, and he is leading the FCC's work to modernize the infrastructure rules governing the buildout of 5G and other next-generation networks.In the middle, we have Dr. Thyaga Nandagopal, who serves in the Directorate of Computer and Information Science and Engineering of the National Science Foundation. He is the Deputy Division Director for the Division of Computing and Communication Foundations. Prior to this position, he managed wireless networking and mobile computing research within the networking technologies and systems programs at the NSF.And finally, we have Adam Hickey, Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the National Security Division at the Department of Justice. He supervises investigations and prosecutions of foreign state-sponsored computer intrusions and attacks, economic espionage, export control and sanctions violations, and malign foreign influence.And for the first two speakers, there was a link in your invitation to the bios. For the deputy assistant attorney general we have a printed bio at the front desk, if you would like a copy.Okay. And with that, I will turn it to our briefers for opening statements. Thank you.MR CARR: Thanks very much. Thank you to the State Department for the opportunity to join in this press briefing. I look forward to discussing 5G and the steps that we're taking in America to ensure secure, trusted, and vibrant communications networks around the globe.I'm happy to take questions from the esteemed members of the foreign press that are here today. Even if you're not esteemed, I'll still take your questions. And I'd like to begin with some opening remarks before I take those questions, but happy to address anything that you all may have.Advancing the build out of 5G networks has been the leading focus for me at the FCC. And after all, 5G networks will be the platforms upon which a new wave of jobs and economic opportunity will be created. Indeed, all these lifechanging technologies that we just hear about today - from connected cars to smart cities, remote surgery, virtual applications, virtual reality - none of that will work, or it won't work very well, without 5G.And so as networks transition from carrying voice calls and emails to these lifechanging applications, the security of these networks become only more important. There's already so much in modern society that runs on interconnected networks, from banking to transportation and even our power grids. This will become more so as carriers continue to build out 5G. If these networks are threatened, everything that we have come to rely on is threatened.In the U.S., we've acknowledged the threat that Chinese telecom firms pose to our networks for some time. In 2012, a congressional committee issued a report recommending that companies avoid using Huawei and ZTE equipment. In 2018, Congress passed legislation that prohibits U.S. Government agencies and contractors from using Chinese equipment.In May of this year, President Trump issued an executive order to secure our ICT infrastructure and supply chains. And separately, the Department of Commerce added Huawei to the entity list which imposes restrictions on its access to the U.S. market based on Commerce's determination that the company engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security interests. And just this month, U.S. Attorney General William Barr wrote a letter at the FCC, where I work, stating that we should not signal that Huawei and ZTE are anything other than a threat to our collective security.So the FCC's open to proceeding on the threats posed by Huawei, ZTE, and other equipment providers last year. The record that developed made clear the security threats posed by these firms. Both companies have close ties to China's communist government and military apparatus. It's been reported, for instance, that Huawei employees work as agents for the People's Liberation Army.Both companies are subject to Chinese law that obligates them to cooperate with any request from the country's intelligence services and to keep those requests secret. Indeed, China's national intelligence law requires that all organizations cooperate with the state intelligence work and provides them with no right to refuse. It also gives Chinese Government the power to take over a company's communications infrastructure.Both companies have apparently engaged in conduct like intellectual property theft, bribery, and corruption. Indeed, an independent cyber security firm recently found that over half of the Huawei firmware images they analyzed had at least one potential backdoor, and that each Huawei device they tested had an average of 102 known vulnerabilities.There's no sign that they will cease this pattern and these practices. With this and other evidence, it's not hard to see the threat that companies like Huawei and ZTE pose to communications networks. And because 5G networks are interconnected, even a small amount of compromised equipment could be devastating to a country's national security. 5G means that our secure networks must be secured both at the core and at the edge.I've heard some comments that Huawei equipment is cheaper than other equipment, and that's one reason to put it in the network. But I'd suggest that we need to take a long-term look at that value proposition. 5G and the rollout of Huawei equipment is part of China's Belt and Road Initiative; it's the digital version of that plan. And what do we see already with that Belt and Road Initiative? Debt-laden investments in ports, in railroads, in physical infrastructure. And we're seeing the same thing happen with Huawei and other gear.And when countries around the world default on those infrastructure projects, the physical ones, we've seen China take action, including seizing those assets. In the digital world, with the Huawei equipment, that can mean seizing the data that is going through these networks. So it's a very real threat.At the FCC, we're in a position to do something about that threat, and we are. Just last week, my colleagues and I voted to prohibit carriers from using federal dollars to purchase any equipment or services from companies that pose a national security threat, including Huawei and ZTE. And we're not stopping there. We are seeking additional comment on whether we should require all Huawei and ZTE equipment in communications network in the U.S. to be pulled out of that network and replaced with secure equipment.So importantly, this discussion is not just about network security in some narrow technical sense. It's also about what I've described as 5G values, values that China very clearly does not share. Indeed, President Xi told security officials in January that China does not walk the Western road of constitutionalism, separation of powers, or judicial independence. I think that's an understatement. Chinese tech companies have a track record longer than a CVS receipt of illegal and malign conduct: violating sanctions, stealing IP, reported lying about extensive partnerships with military apparatus, and oppressive state surveillance activities.So part of this conversation and similar ones taking place around the globe is about our shared 5G values. We need to work together to ensure that companies supplying the equipment and services integral to 5G networks are ones we can trust. And I'm pleased to report that we're seeing many countries recognize this position. In March, the European Commission released a set of recommendations to improve 5G security, which include assessing the risk that equipment vendors could be influenced by third-party countries. More recently, in May, the Czech Republic hosted representatives from more than 30 countries to build a common approach to 5G security, and that effort produced the Prague Principles which are a set of recommendations on how to build a secure and trustworthy 5G network, which, again, recognizes the risks of a third country wielding influence over an equipment supplier.Australia issued 5G security guidance to protect their networks, including from vendors who are likely to be subject to extrajudicial direction from a foreign government. Japan has imposed requirements to take cybersecurity measures, including ones to respond to supply chain threats. Taiwan has extended its existing measures regarding trusted equipment vendors to cover all 5G government networks and critical infrastructure. And most recently, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Polish President Duda signed a memorandum of understanding on 5G security.So we've seen a great deal of progress on securing 5G networks over the course of the past year. I'm confident that this progress will continue. And I look forward to answering any questions you may have.MODERATOR: And we'll go next to Thyaga.MR NANDAGOPAL: All right. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for - thank you to State Department for giving us an opportunity to brief the press. At the National Science Foundation we have long believed that security and connectivity are the foundations of the digital economy, and part of this foundation also implies an implied trust that the networks and the systems we put in place work the way they're intended to do, right. So I think that's a critical piece that we can all acknowledge that if we lose faith in our systems, then we will no longer use them. And digital economy depends on people using them widely and sharing the benefits at every member of every aspect of society.So one of the things that we have done to advance this is we invest heavily in all of these aspects in the networking and the connectivity space. We invest over $60 million each year into advanced research that kind of demonstrates the feasibility of new systems that can become the foundations and cornerstones of communication networks. So what we call as 5G has started with our investments more than 15 years ago from the National Science Foundation, and today, we are looking beyond 5G and continuing to invest in those.Similarly, in the security space, we invest every year upwards of $80 million in securing networks and systems across the digital economy. So through our secure and trustworthy cyberspace programs, which have - has seeded a lot of interesting research into identifying vulnerabilities, protecting systems, and also developing the future workforce that can protect us from future attacks and vulnerabilities. So these are things that the NSF strongly values and continues to invest and put money behind these principles.With that, I want to identify why vulnerabilities are a critical piece of software that everyone has to pay attention to. Let's think about the networks we use today. We think of 4G and LTE as the networks that drive discussions today. However, an often overlooked fact is that this thing called soft SMS that we all - the text messaging that we all rely on is based on a system from the '90s called Signaling System No. 7 - SS7 protocols. So these protocols were developed back in the '90s, nobody had a look - a behind-the-scenes look at how these things operated. Engineers designed it, they put something in place, and it turned out there's a bunch of a software vulnerabilities that existed in those that were never really paid attention to.And now, with - everyone knows that if you're doing a banking transaction you get a SMS code on your phone that tends to ask you to confirm, "Hey, this is you, right?" if you enter this code on your text. Now, there are attacks that are being discovered even today that allows any third person to pretend it's you and it's your phone that's receiving that text, and basically bypass any kind of two-factor security that modern financial systems rely on to a large extent. In fact, folks may be aware, Twitter recently opened up - they used to have just a phone-based authentication. They have now added additional options to allow - to bypass not just what had a single phone-based model, but also other authentication models because of the recognition that this matters and are secure.Now, why does it matter here? This vulnerability that I'm talking about is just one example and it's a software vulnerability, right. It is not something that had this legacy system that has been in place for more than 30 or 20 years now, and it still continues to this day. And why have now no one patched it? It has not been patched because it's what we call as a legacy system. Once you put in a piece of software and it runs on for a while, and people move on to writing more advanced stuff, now the old knowledge and the design principles that govern those decisions are in some sense lost, and some of these vulnerabilities are not discovered in time. And you discover them much later, many years down the road, and those vulnerabilities often end up revealing critical flaws that can be exploited by a malicious actor and bring down entire networks, right. And not just entire networks, but compromise - more critically, compromise data, right, make you vulnerable to snooping, right, loss of privacy and your assets - financial information. So those are - that's why it's very important to pay attention to software security.There is also a lot of discussion that has happened in the past about hardware security. The emergent nature of hardware and the intel - very complex designs that have gone into modern systems have - create areas where such vulnerabilities can be inserted into the supply chain, by like someone who's assembling a chip. They could put in an extra chip on the board that, if unverified, could be triggered remotely at a much later time. It can pass design checks, functional design checks for example. But it could be triggered at a later time when you are least expecting it.So there are vulnerabilities on both ends, but I specifically want to call out software vulnerabilities, because one key facet of 5G networks that folks are really touting as a positive is the ability to do a lot of functions that previously used to be done in hardware in the software domain. So why does that confer an advantage? 5G, by virtue of doing a lot of these functions in software, allows for quick development cycles. You don't need to change the equipment in the field; you can just simply push a remote upgrade to your software to the base station on your device and suddenly it can do some new things it was not able to do before. You don't have to send people to climb up towers or upgrade systems on the fly.So software-based functions allow us to generate and develop new capabilities for 5G networks really quickly and also to scale, to make this network support more people and more devices with less effort, which is why it's highly desirable. However, it also - if improperly designed, the very software-based architectures also opens up these networks to more attacks, right.And one can always talk about auditing a piece of software before it's deployed. So yes, when I create - well, when I audit a network, let's say - it doesn't matter which vendor it's from - I could ask the vendor to demonstrate the code and say, "Show me the entire code, let me check it, verify it before I put it on the network." It will pass all the security checks.However, when there is a performance upgrade, when there is a minor issue that you face, you'll want to call the vendor. Operators always call the vendors and say, "I have this problem. Can you fix this?" And they will say, "Well, here is an upgrade. I'm going to push this out today. Can I do it?" And you will not have - often there is not enough time to do a full-scale, again, audit of that update, and therefore you can always introduce vulnerabilities into the system. Whether it's intentional or unintentional, these things can happen over time.And the history of operating systems is a great example for anyone who has seen this. You have seen patches, and patches to fix problems caused by patches. And the current IT ecosystem or IT development ecosystem is not set up to support quick and rapid audits or real-time audits of all the code that comes up. This is an area that the National Science Foundation has been investing a lot through its investments in formal methods and verification processes, but there's a lot more work to be done.And the fact that 5G has a lot of the software components is what makes it much more vulnerable to security threats, right. And again, it's better to start with a model that incorporates security by design and follows through with sound, valid scientifically verified implementations. So even the current 5G standards have - even though they have put in a lot of effort into addressing some of the security concerns, whether it's preventing use of Stingray-like devices on a 5G network and so forth, there are many design choices that have been put in place, but those design choices always - do not always in any combination do not lead to sound, secure implementations.There are certain ways of verifying that certain choices are more secure than others, and these choices often come at the expense of performance. So if you want a highly secure system, it may not be as - it may not produce probably as much throughput as a completely insecure system, because it's a performance penalty to be paid ensuring that the traffic and everything is secure. So operators have to, in some sense, make a design choice at times. Okay, do I compromise on security or performance, or do I find a sweet spot? And the standards of design to allow all of - all these options.So being able to have a correct implementation that is secure does not always - it's not always guaranteed. And therefore every country that is relying on an operator deploying a 5G network has to always think about, "Is this design implementation secure?" right. And we do not have a way to validate those things on the fly, once again. A system engineer can essentially go and say, "I'm going to tweak the system to probably better performance because I'm experiencing high congestion in this particular cell tower," and that could open up a flaw, right. Because we still don't understand the impacts of all of those changes.So there is a lot of work that needs to happen. So I would argue that continuous visibility and real-time validation of network behavior is very, very important. And the ability to audit a network at any given time - what they call the spot checks of a network - is very, very critical. Which is why having this ability into the vendor's code and their processes is extremely important. And I believe the commissioner has spoken a little bit about the challenges to that effect.So I will basically leave that there, saying that the current standards process, while there is a lot of efforts being made to secure networks, it's - we can appreciate that, but it is not the be-all and end-all. Because there is always rush-to-market concerns and the ability to make money out of the deployed networks that kind of override sometimes the performance hits that providing a fully secure network will cost.So we need a lot more work to be done, but there are certain common principles that I articulated earlier about being able to audit and verify and validate in real time that every operator and vendor needs to be able to support.MODERATOR: Thank you. Adam.MR HICKEY: Good morning. I'll begin, as my colleagues did, with thanking the Foreign Press Center for hosting this - Cheryl, you in particular - as well as all of you for being here today.In my job at the Justice Department, I'm responsible for supervising our investigations into both computer hacking and the theft of trade secrets sponsored by foreign governments, in addition to our foreign investment security reviews, or the CFIUS process as you may know it. And across my portfolio, I have seen how actors can use and exploit access - that equipment and service providers have - to their customers' networks. Let me give you a couple examples.Last December, we unsealed an indictment charging two Chinese nationals and charging them with hacking into computer networks of managed service providers and using that access to target MSP customers around the world in at least a dozen countries, including in Europe. Now MSPs, as you may know, manage the IT infrastructure of some of the world's largest, most significant companies. And the defendants are accused of exploiting the MSPs' access to client networks and using that access to steal the clients' intellectual property and confidential business information. And the indictment also alleges that the defendants were doing this in association with the Chinese Ministry of State Security.And the second example, in 2017, we resolved a criminal investigation of a software company that had been hired as a contractor for the Defense Department. And during our investigation, we determined that the source code for DOD networks was being written by employees in the company's back office in Russia. Because it was stored in Russia, it was susceptible to being intercepted by Russian intelligence services, pursuant to a legal regime known as SORM.So when we look at 5G, we are increasingly concerned about the security of our telecommunications networks and their supply chains. We are more concerned because, one, more and more functions will depend on those networks. It's not just about our phones. More devices and services will be connected, meaning that human life and safety as well as traditional government functions are going to ride on those networks. Second, our national defense is going to depend not only our networks but those of our allies as well. And third, traditional mitigation measures like segregating and securing the core of the network won't be sufficient.Too often, we talk about security in terms of evidence that a provider has already stolen data or disrupted services; but if you wait to see a smoking gun, you might end up taking a bullet. It matters whether a provider in question has already willfully violated other laws, obstructed justice, or stolen intellectual property. It matters whether it behaves in an anti-competitive or abusive matter - manner, rather. It matters whether it operates under an authoritarian government, where it can be leveraged in the future at a time and place of that government's choosing to serve that country's national interests.The providers we choose to build the next generation of telecommunications networks must be trustworthy because we are entering a long-term relationship with them. It's not going to be possible to audit everything they do. We'll have to rely on their good faith and their respect for the law. That is why we need to support the evolution of trusted markets, trusted sources of supply for telecommunications equipment and services. Among other things, a trusted market is governed by the rule of law, where government requests for information are checked by statutes and regulations and an independent judiciary, and corporate structures and financing are open and transparent.Part of how we achieve trusted markets is to recognize that security is a feature worth paying for; or to put it a different way, that the cost of a product or service includes not just the money you pay for it but also the consequences of future theft and disruption it enables. Paying more at the front end, in other words, can reflect the value we place in trust and security in the long term, and certain actions the USG is taking now which prevent the use of untrusted providers in certain contexts correct for distortions that currently exist in the market for telecommunications equipment and services.Commissioner Carr referred to a letter that the attorney general recently sent to the FCC, and I'll quote from it briefly. As he wrote in that letter, the market is "wildly distorted" by state funding, and indeed that might be the point - "to lock up as much of the market as possible" and "lead to irreversible market dominance...causing unmitigatable harm to our national security." Avoiding that and promoting trusted, diverse, and free markets is a Department of Justice priority.And I look forward to taking your questions.MODERATOR: All right. Thank you all for those opening comments. We will open the briefing up to question and answers. We will be using the handheld mikes, the wireless mikes, so please wait for the microphone before you ask your question and state your name, outlet, and country that you're from. And we may have one or two questions from our journalists who are participating from the New York Foreign Press Center, and thank you very much.I think first we'll call on Jan from Czech Radio, if you're - yes, go ahead, in the back.MR CARR: Not Jan. Looked like a Jan. (Laughter.)QUESTION: Hi, good morning. My name is Jan Kaliba. I am from Czech Radio, the public broadcaster from Czech Republic. You mentioned (inaudible) conference, and we are an example of a country with some kind of cultural war between the political representation who favor China and speaking favorably to China and supporting Huawei to take part on building 5G network in the Czech Republic as a member of EU and NATO, and on the other hand part of the political representation and also the national security agency and cyber security agency telling people that there are the threats you are describing here.So now the time is important for the future of building the 5G network, so what's your communication right now towards Czech Republic or similar country who will decide soon regarding the future of building this network, and how would it - what effect would it have on the relations if the Czech Republic go forward and allow Huawei or Chinese companies to built 5G in the country which is a EU and NATO member? Thank you.MR CARR: Yeah, thanks for the question. I think right now where you see the FCC and the State Department is engaged extensively overseas, I think we're making a lot of progress. I mentioned some of the countries that have taken action recently. The goal is to make sure that every country has secure, trusted vendors in their network, and we're making progress on that.I leave it to the State Department to talk more broadly about U.S. relations with countries that may have insecure equipment in the network. But from what I understand, I've heard State Department officials, I believe, talk about needing to revisit the nature and extent of information sharing if countries do have a significant amount of insecure equipment in their network. State will be able to speak more directly to that issue, but that's my understanding of where things currently stand.MR NANDAGOPAL: I heard this question from some countries that talk about, oh, we have to deploy our 5G networks now, so we have to make these decisions and we are struggling with which vendor to go with. One - a different way to look at the problem is this: What is the rush to get into a decision right now?So one of the - many of the touted benefits of 5G come from having a 5G RF network plus a 5G standalone core network, so it is important to point out that many of the core standards of - that define the standalone core have not yet been defined. They are still in process of ratification, so we are talking about at least a couple of years before the equipment that can guarantee or provide the full-feature set of 5G are going to be out in the market.So I want to kind of clarify that it's not like there is a 5G network that's going to be fully full-featured and going to promise all the benefits ASAP. It's going to be incremental process. Clearly, the U.S. and China and many other countries are deploying early versions of it to keep exploring the gains, but for many countries there is also value in kind of waiting to see the entire features that come out, because in some sense every upgrade is also going to cost you money. So there may also be value in just waiting to see the entire features fully deployed before plunging headlong into a large-scale, country-wide upgrade of the system, especially for smaller countries.MODERATOR: Next question. Renzo. Could you make sure the microphone is on as well? Okay, thank you.QUESTION: Hi. Is it on?MODERATOR: Continue. Thank you.QUESTION: Okay. My name is Renzo Ruf. I work for CH Media, which is a group of newspapers in Switzerland. I have a DOJ question. In Switzerland, we have a telecom company that wants to work with Huawei. Would there be consequences when it comes to legal issues? Because Switzerland is a market economy, so the country won't tell the company that it can't do that.MR HICKEY: Will there be legal consequences in Switzerland or here, are you saying?QUESTION: Bilateral, sort of.MR HICKEY: So I take the question to be very similar to the first question, which is what happens if other nations choose untrusted providers. And like Commissioner Carr, I think the - formally I defer to the State Department, but we will have to think about how secure is the information we share with other nations. We take that into account now, right. We fold into determinations about what we share, "Well, is someone else going to be on that network and see what we're sharing with that government?" So you can play it forward and recognize that we'll probably have to make a similar calculation in the future. Whether there will be legal consequences, I'm not sure I follow quite that, what you might be thinking of when you say that.QUESTION: Because it's a private company --MODERATOR: Could you wait for the microphone, please?QUESTION: Thanks for this. Because it's a private company, would you sanction the whole country if a private company makes a decision to work with one of these Chinese companies?MR HICKEY: Yeah, I'm not making any kind of prediction as to sanctions or any kind of legal consequence in the way you're asking about it.MODERATOR: And just as a matter of course, questions about any sanctions would be referred to the U.S. Treasury.MR HICKEY: I think - look, the point of a briefing like this and other briefings is to lay out facts with the hope that you will take our point of view and some of the evidence we're pointing to back to your consumers, and so that those - your constituents and also political actors will read our point of view and weigh that in the balance of the choices that they make. I don't think any one of us is up here today to issue any kind of threat or ultimatum.MODERATOR: Thank you. Next question, Beatriz, in the back.QUESTION: Thank you. Beatriz Navarro with La Vanguardia. I see your point that, I mean, the whole issue of this briefing is to warn other countries about the risk of 5G, but many countries have already made up their minds, like Spain and some other big EU countries. I wonder what do you think about their mitigation effort. Is there a way to mitigate the risks that emanate from the 5G technology? Thank you.MR CARR: Well, one concern that we've had at the FCC when it comes to Huawei equipment, and part of what led to our decision last week to stop federal funding for carriers that put Huawei equipment in their network, is that it's very difficult given the way that Huawei gear is designed and deployed to engage in mitigation tactics.So a lot of vendors, for instance, in the equipment space put out essentially stock pieces of equipment that you could send to some sort of lab and check for issues before it goes into the network. The way a lot of the Huawei gear is deployed is it's bespoke, and so they will send individual engineers out into rural communities in the U.S. to install, to code, and to custom build. And from their perspective, they offer that as a bonus that you are getting custom equipment.From our perspective, that presents another level of risk because you can't test an out-of-the-box piece of equipment and know that's the same box, the same coding that's going to go into the U.S. network. So that's part of what was underlying our decision is the difficulty of some screening and mitigation measures that have been used before.MR NANDAGOPAL: And then for countries that have already decided that they have to go with at least one - a particular vendor, I would always argue that it is in the country - it's in the company's financial interest, the provider's financial interest, to create diversity, as Adam just pointed out, that - because diversity means you are able to play off of market forces and help them compete against each other. So you want to have a diversity of vendors because, hey, if there is a flaw that affects one part of the network, at least you can ensure that the network is robust because other parts of the network will still continue to operate and survive.So there is value in ensuring that you are not making any exclusive contracts or offers to any - I mean, so just financial savviness for these companies and operators to make the decision not to just go all in with one, but ensure there is financial diversity. And that's the way U.S. markets behave. U.S. operators always have a diversity of suppliers for - in all of the equipment, and I think it's a wise move that others should probably think about.MR HICKEY: Let me offer three quick points. With respect to mitigation, I think it was Commissioner Carr who said this, that the architecture of a 5G network is going to be fundamentally different from prior legacy networks. One simple difference is that the current 4G model, essentially the core, the center of the network, the node through which information passes, if you prioritize security there, the thinking goes the endpoints are less consequential. 5G isn't going to have that concept of a core; it's going to be more distributed. So it will be much harder to say, well, this is the part that matters more than the part that doesn't.Second, if you want to know how well mitigation works in certain circumstances, maybe read how others have tried it. And I know the UK has its national security - National Cyber Security Centre, which has a security center devoted to auditing Huawei equipment. They've put out public reports, and you can read in those reports their assessment of Huawei code, how - I don't want to use to word "buggy," but how buggy it is or how many - how difficult it is to audit, and their prediction as to whether they can assure the security of that network. That gives you, I think, an indication of what it's like to try to mitigate in that context.And third, being a prosecutor, my optimism is limitless. I think we are seeing more receptivity to our message, and that receptivity is often behind closed doors. I don't hear a lot of people, when we meet with them, disagree with our assessments as to threat and risk. They may make different - I'll call them business decisions in the short run, but I think actually we are persuading people of our view. There may be different decisions on the margin, but I don't know that the world is as locked in as some would have you believe.MODERATOR: Thank you. Is that Bas?QUESTION: Yeah.MODERATOR: Okay. Hi, Bas.QUESTION: Hi. I'm Bas Blokker. I'm from the Netherlands, from NRC newspaper. I hear what you just said, and I wanted to follow up on this because, as you said, behind closed doors they say different things sometimes than outside. What we keep reading is that, for instance, UK says those security risks are manageable and that - this morning I read that the German secretary of economics said we are as afraid of U.S. espionage as of Chinese. So what's going on there?MR HICKEY: Well, I'm not going to speak to any particular government. My own experience in the U.S. Government is that different officials might put things slightly differently depending on who you talk to within the government. My sense, I'll repeat it, is that the arguments we're making about threat and network architecture and the value of security, more or less they are getting a warm reception. That may mean because of budgetary or other constraints some nations may make different choices in the near term, but that doesn't mean that there is a binary choice and we have, quote, unquote, "lost" the struggle for 5G. I don't think it's going to look quite like that. As Dr. Nandagopal laid out, this is a longer term infrastructure development. So we - you're seeing us as part of a longer term strategy trying to educate the world about how we think about it. I don't think - this is not going to be decided before the end of 2019.With respect to legal regimes, there's a very big difference - and if you want me to go into more detail I will - between the Chinese national security law and the statutes and regulations and procedures we have in place here that allow for the collection of information subject, of course, to challenges to an independent judiciary. I think the differences between the two systems are pretty clear.MR NANDAGOPAL: I think even within the countries that you mentioned, it has to be recognized that it's not a unilateral or unanimous voice that is saying those things, right. There are differences of opinions and I would argue that, like what Adam was saying, there's a lot of what you call stakeholders within those countries that agree with all the points that are being made at this stage right now.MODERATOR: We have time for one or two more questions. And do we have any of our journalists here from Asia who had a question? Okay, not at this time. Please, go ahead.QUESTION: My name is Martin. I'm with NZZ Switzerland. We hear about 5G networks going up in the U.S. to a limited extent by the large U.S. telecoms. What are we to make of the security of those early networks going up? First question.The second question: The U.S. is really endorsing Ericsson from Sweden, Nokia from Finland, and Samsung from South Korea here as trustworthy vendors. How do you ensure that they remain trustworthy, how do you work concretely with them? And maybe a third question to Adam: How does the Commerce's proposed rule from this morning about securing the supply chain of ICT interact with the CFIUS process? I'm not exactly --MR HICKEY: Sure. I'm happy to clean that one up after my colleagues answer.MR CARR: So I'll start with the 5G buildout in the U.S. Right now, the U.S. has the largest 5G build in the world. We had about 13 cities get 5G last year. We have about 30-some odd cities today that have 5G, going to about 42 cities by the end of the year. Those builds up to now have been by some of the largest providers in the U.S. Those are providers that almost exclusively made decisions years ago not to include some of this equipment that's at issue today in those networks. It's a lot of the smaller, rural providers that are not first to 5G. They're still building out 4G networks that are the ones that up to now have had a lot of the Huawei equipment in their networks. And so that's principally been the focus of our actions at the FCC as opposed to those larger network providers that don't have so much of the equipment in it.I think your point about other countries that have vendors in the space, I think that's further evidence that the FCC position here, the U.S. position here, is not one of economic protectionism. We don't have a national champion in this particular space to the extent that you have with China and Huawei. And again, I think if you look at the confluence of evidence, both some of the structures that are in place in China, the lack of an independent judiciary, the unity of interest often between these companies and the communist regime, and then some specific actions within these companies that set them apart from those other companies that you mentioned.MR NANDAGOPAL: So with respect to verifying existing stuff, right. So one of the things that I can speak in support of the companies in the U.S. is that they are making a commitment to open source code and projects. So one example - like an audible example is the ONAP - ONAP; Open Networking Automation Platform - that has partners from pretty much every stakeholder within the United States networking communications community who are participating to create open source code base that will help automate and orchestrate resource allocations on these 5G networks.Now, why is this important? Because this is open source. There is a larger community of people who are looking at this. They can identify problems and verify and validate issues with them ASAP. And these are the - this is the code that gets deployed on networks. So that commitment is open - to open source is something that is probably somewhat more unique of the countries in the Western world to some extent. I think the other countries tend to leverage open source, but not contribute as much. So that's another way of providing the stability and to making sure these networks are secure.MR HICKEY: And to answer your third question. So Mr. Carr referred to the President's executive order in May. The proposed rule that came out this morning is a proposed regulation implementing that executive order. It's out for comment, so it's not a final rule; it's a notice of proposed rule-making.The way I think about CFIUS is it's capital inflows into the country. This EO and that rule relates to the purchase of goods and services from abroad. So rather than capital inflows, think of it as the inflows of goods and services. So it's separate legal regime.MODERATOR: Thank you. And we'll take our last question from New York.QUESTION: Claudio Pagliara from RAI (inaudible). I would like just to get some more accurate answer about a specific country - my country, Italy, which is in close talks with China about 5G. So which kind of consequences for a country which is a strategic ally of United States, like Italy, if Italian Government would decide to go on in this direction? Thank you.MODERATOR: Thank you.MR HICKEY: So I think I - like I said a few minutes ago, we're not here to threaten or scold; we're here to share information. We've expressed our concerns that if you use 5G equipment, or part of a 5G network includes equipment from an untrusted provider, there are likely to be greater risks of consequences, both to the theft of information and the disruption of that network. So that is the bottom-line message of what we're saying, is 5G networks are going to matter more than the phone network you use right now. It's going to carry more data and be more of a critical part of our life and critical infrastructure. And so if you don't trust who's building it, you are leaving yourself open to problems in the future.And at this point, I think we will leave it to our allies hopefully to internalize that information and make decisions based on it. And we'll see where it goes. But I think, as I said, we have the sense that this a longer term problem, this is a big problem. It's not going to go away in a few months, it's not going to get solved at the press conference. I think we're going to continue to share information and our experience as we can going forward.MODERATOR: Great. If there are no further burning questions, we have just another minute. And seeing none, we'll end it there. I'd like to thank all of our briefers for being here today. Thank you so much, as well as to our journalists. And with that, we will conclude the event.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6942133 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 30, 2019End of Document

THREE TIBETANS DETAINED IN CHINA'S GANSU AHEAD OF 'SENSITIVE' ANNIVERSARYStates News ServiceDecember 17, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 507 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:By Richard FinneyAuthorities in northwestern China's Gansu province have detained three Tibetans, including a painter of traditional religious art, apparently for sharing politically sensitive information on the social-media messaging platform WeChat, a Tibetan advocacy group said on Tuesday.The three were taken into custody in Sangchu (in Chinese, Xiahe) county in Gansu's Kanlho (Gannan) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture just days ahead of the 30th anniversary of the Dec. 10, 1989 awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama.Citing exile Tibetan sources with contacts in the region, the Washington, D.C.-based International Campaign for Tibet identified two of those detained as Tsegan, in his mid-30s, and thangka painter Lubum Dorjee. The name of the third man held is still unknown, ICT said.Notices circulated by Chinese government departments in Kanlho earlier this year had threatened closer police scrutiny of messages shared on WeChat and warned chat group members not to publish "illegal information" or "spread rumors," ICT said."Such opaque language can be used by Chinese authorities to define as a 'crime' almost any expression of Tibetan cultural or religious identity, reference to the Dalai Lama or his teachings, or mild statement of opinion," the rights group said.Regarded by Chinese leaders as a dangerous separatist, the Dalai Lama fled Tibet into exile in India in the midst of a failed 1959 national uprising against Chinese rule, and the sharing of the Dalai Lama's photo or teachings or public celebrations of his birthday have been harshly punished in the past.Cash awards for informersIn July, a Tibetan resident of western China's Sichuan province was taken into custody for sharing a photo of the Dalai Lama on WeChat, a local source told RFA in an earlier report.Rinso, a resident of Thangkor township's Village No. 3 in Dzoege (Ruo'ergai) county, a part of Tibet's historical eastern region of Amdo, was released on July 16 after being held for 10 days, the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Sources have told RFA that Chinese authorities in Tibet now offer cash awards of as much as 300,000 yuan (U.S. $42,582) for information leading to the arrests of social-media users deemed disloyal to China.Behaviors specified as illegal include online activities aimed at "attempting to overthrow [China's] socialist system," "advocating extremism," and "defaming the People's Republic of China," according to a notice issued on Feb. 28 by three government departments of China's Tibet Autonomous Region.Also banned are online expressions of support for the Dalai Lama's Middle Way Policy, which calls for greater autonomy for Tibet while acknowledging Beijing's sovereignty over Tibetan areas now part of China.Authorities in Tibetan areas of China frequently monitor online discussions and search mobile phones for what they consider politically sensitive content, and foreign news broadcasts are heavily restricted.Load-Date: December 17, 2019End of Document

GARDNER SENDS BIPARTISAN LETTER RAISING ALARM ON CHINA'S CORPORATE SOCIAL CREDIT SYSTEMStates News ServiceDecember 2, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 996 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON D.C. BodyThe following information was released by Colorado Senator Cory Gardner:Today U.S. Senators Cory Gardner (R-CO), Mike Braun (R-IN), Rob Portman (R-OH), Chris Coons (D-DE), Michael Bennet (D-CO) and 20 of their colleagues sent United States Trade Representative (USTR) Ambassador Robert Lighthizer a letter outlining their concerns with the Chinese government's efforts to develop and deploy its Corporate Social Credit System (Corporate SCS). The Corporate SCS represents China formalizing a system to punish American companies and workers for speaking out against the Chinese government. The letter asks Ambassador Lighthizer to prioritize research and analysis into the Corporate SCS and the implications such a system may pose for American workers, companies, and investors."I have serious concerns about what China's Corporate Social Credit System could mean for American workers and businesses," said Senator Gardner. "Our American values are not for sale and that's why we should track China's efforts to coerce American companies into complying with their flawed system."Read the full letter here or below:Dear Ambassador Lighthizer:We write to express grave concern over the Chinese government's continued efforts to develop and deploy its Corporate Social Credit System (Corporate SCS), and the implications such a system may pose for American workers, companies, and investors. Specifically, we ask that the Administration include research and analysis of China's Corporate SCS in future reports produced about China and the conditions of commerce between our two nations.In 2014, the Chinese Communist Party issued its "Planning Outline for the Construction of a Social Credit System (2014-2020)," which telegraphed the Party's efforts to create a unified algorithmic system to grade both domestic and international firms against more than 300 state-determined criteria, with the goal of "building a Socialist harmonious society." In practice, we worry that many of the criteria envisioned under the Corporate SCS could be used to:Coerce the onshoring of research and development by U.S. companies within China's borders;Require technology transfer or otherwise make it easier for Chinese interests to steal American intellectual property; andCoerce American corporate support to China's industrial and foreign policies (like Made in China 2025, the upcoming 14th Five-Year Plan, and policies towards Taiwan).Indeed, all corporate data collected and processed through the Corporate SCS will travel through basic infrastructure, databases, and algorithms managed by a consortium that includes Taiji Computer, Huawei, Alibaba, Tencent, and VisionVera. Key criteria informing the algorithms of the system could also be implemented in a manner that allows the Communist Party to extraterritorially pressure compliance with party doctrine and to suppress dissent. An August 2019 report prepared by the European Chamber of Commerce in China stresses that the "[Corporate SCS] will fundamentally change how business is done in China for every company and stakeholder in the Chinese market."Once the Corporate SCS is fully operational, firms with scores below a certain state-determined threshold will face an interlocking series of sanctions across multiple Chinese government agencies, including restrictions on procurement and business licenses, less favorable interest rates, higher inspection rates, and even potential debarment from the Chinese market. Scores can be affected not only by the actions of the company and its employees, but also by the actions of supplier or partner companies, extending the threat of Chinese retaliation to any American firm with a presence, or supplier, in China. In short, the Corporate SCS raises fundamental questions about whether promised market openings and regulatory reforms on paper will yield a level playing field in practice for American firms doing business in and with China.Equally, if not more concerning, penalties under the Chinese Corporate SCS could extend to the employees of American firms, including U.S. nationals. As a punishment for individuals representing companies deemed "untrustworthy," the Chinese government envisions levying travel restrictions, tax discrimination, personal sanctions, and other retributions. In this respect, there are few punishments that can be ruled "off the table," as the Communist Party's disregard for the rule of law, checks and balances, transparency, and a free press could result in a broad array of unjustified punishments.While the Corporate SCS is still in development, the skeleton of the system is coming online and already presenting serious challenges for U.S. companies. In September, news reports indicated that the Chinese Communist Party threatened to reduce the social credit scores of American companies unless those companies acknowledge Macau, Hong Kong, and Taiwan as part of China.What our country witnessed recently with respect to the National Basketball Association (NBA) over a tweet by one American team's general manager is not an aberration, but the latest in a litany of attempts by China to deploy its state and economic power to bend American entities to its will. It seems the SCS is designed, in part, to further and formalize this practice. For these reasons, formal U.S. government research, reporting, and analysis about China's Corporate SCS is critical to examining the terms of competition for our companies operating in and competing with China. Given the high stakes for open markets and our free market system, we urge you to ensure that this system is closely examined and considered in all relevant U.S. government reports.###Cory Gardner is a member of the U.S. Senate serving Colorado.

State Department Issues Travel Advisory on ChinaTargeted News ServiceDecember 31, 2019 Tuesday 8:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 430 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs issued the following travel advisory:Exercise increased caution in China due to arbitrary enforcement of local laws and special restrictions on dual U.S.-Chinese citizens.Country Summary: The Chinese government has asserted broad authority to prohibit U.S. citizens from leaving China by using "exit bans," sometimes keeping U.S. citizens in China for years. The Chinese government uses exit bans coercively:- to compel U.S. citizens to participate in Chinese government investigations,- to lure individuals back to China from abroad, and- to aid Chinese authorities in resolving civil disputes in favor of Chinese parties.In most cases, U.S. citizens only become aware of the exit ban when they attempt to depart China, and there is no method to find out how long the ban may continue. U.S. citizens under exit bans have been harassed and threatened.U.S. citizens may be detained without access to U.S. consular services or information about their alleged crime. U.S. citizens may be subjected to prolonged interrogations and extended detention for reasons related to "state security." Security personnel may detain and/or deport U.S. citizens for sending private electronic messages critical of the Chinese government.Extra security measures, such as security checks and increased levels of police presence, are common in the Xinjiang Uighur and Tibet Autonomous Regions. Authorities may impose curfews and travel restrictions on short notice.The Chinese government does not recognize dual nationality. U.S.-Chinese citizens and U.S. citizens of Chinese heritage may be subject to additional scrutiny and harassment, and the Chinese government may prevent the U.S. Embassy from providing consular services. Read the Safety and Security section on the country information page.If you decide to travel to China:- Enter China on your U.S. passport with a valid Chinese visa and keep it with you.- If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or the nearest consulate immediately.- If you plan to enter North Korea, read the North Korea Travel Advisory.- Enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.- Follow the Department of State on Facebook and Twitter. Follow the U.S. Embassy on Twitter, WeChat, and Weibo.- Review the Crime and Safety Reports for China.- Prepare a contingency plan for emergency situations.

Global and China Optical Fiber Preform Industry Report, 2019-2025 Featuring 13 Global and Chinese Optical Fiber Preform CompaniesPR NewswireNovember 7, 2019 Thursday 7:15 PM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1020 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, Nov. 7, 2019 BodyPR NewswireThe"Global and China Optical Fiber Preform Industry Report, 2019-2025"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.Optical fiber preform, playing an important role in the optical fiber and cable industry chain, seizes about 70% profits of optical fiber. Global demand for optical fiber preform stood at 16.2kt in 2018, a mere 5.5% growth, far lower than in 2017, as optical fiber market slowed down, but is projected to hit 25kt in 2025 with the growing demand from large-scale 5G construction, among others.Optical fiber preform is still in short supply in China, a large supplier worldwide. Yet, as more optical fiber preform projects become operational, the supply gap in the country will be narrowed, and over 85% will be self-sufficient in 2025, compared with 81.9% in 2018China's imports of optical fiber preform slumped in 2018, and the gloomy picture continues to 2019. That's because China still carries out the optical fiber preform anti-dumping policy (on July 10, 2018, the Chinese government announced to continue imposing anti-dumping duties on optical fiber preform from Japan and the United States for 5 years), and furthermore, trade tensions between China and the US have yet to be eased.Global optical fiber preform industry features a high concentration. There are just around 20 manufacturers, largely in Japan, the United States and China and typically Corning, Sumitomo Electric Industries, Shin-Etsu Chemical, YOFC and Hengtong Optic-electric. By capacity, YOFC boasts the largest share in the global market, followed by Corning.Both of the two giants had optical fiber preform capacity expansion projects in recent two years. In YOFC's case, in late 2018, Phase II of YOFC Qianjiang Co., Ltd.'s 500 t/a OVD optical fiber preform capacity expansion project went into production, sending YOFC's total capacity to 3,500t/a; YOFC also has such projects under construction as YOFC Qianjiang Phase III and Shin-Etsu YOFC (Hubei) Optical Preform Co., Ltd.'s Phase II and YOFC SDG (Hubei) Optical Preform Co., Ltd.'s new project. As for Corning, following operation of its optical fiber preform technological upgrading project in Hainan province in 2018, it pushed on with the construction of optical fiber preform technological upgrading and capacity expansion project which drew to an end in August 2019, with a capacity of 1,066 t/a.A combination of factors like anti-dumping policy are at play in the rapid growth of Chinese optical fiber preform companies which already have stronger competence in research and development and enlarge their capacity. As with large manufacturers YOFC, Hengtong Optic-electric, Futong Group and Corning (Hainan) Optical Communication, in 2019 other main optical fiber preform suppliers in China, like Jiangsu Etern, Tianjin Futong Xinmao Science & Technology, Hangzhou Cable, STL-Sterlite Technologies and Hebei Far East Communication System Engineering (HBFEC), also have deployed optical fiber preform projects. According to the disclosed projects, it is predicted that China's optical fiber preform capacity will outstrip 25kt/a in 2025, a sign of excess capacity.In 2019, the price of optical fiber preform products has dropped a bit in China due to higher risk of overcapacity, smaller supply gap and fiercer competition in the market.Global and China Optical Fiber Preform Industry Report, 2019-2025 highlights the following:Global optical fiber preform market (supply & demand, regional distribution, price, competitive pattern, and development trend) Chinese optical fiber preform market (policy, patents, supply & demand, import & export, competitive pattern, price, and development trend) Developments of global and China optical fiber & cable markets; 13 global and Chinese optical fiber preform companies (operation, optical fiber preform business, etc.).Key Topics Covered:1.

CORNYN, WARNER INTRODUCE UIGHUR PROTECTION ACTStates News ServiceDecember 4, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 439 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Texas Senator John Cornyn:Bill Prevents Technology Exports to China Used to Oppress UighursU.S. Senators John Cornyn (R-TX) and Mark Warner (D-VA) today introduced the UIGHUR Protection Act, which would place export controls on critical technologies to China, such as facial recognition software, that can be used to facilitate mass surveillance and detention."For years, members of China's Uighur population have been unjustly detained and surveilled by the Chinese government," said Sen. Cornyn. "American technology should not be used for the oppression of ethnic minority groups by foreign governments, and this legislation would ensure that the United States has no part in these despicable practices.""As we have seen from extensive reporting and leaked Chinese government documents, the Chinese government is undertaking systematic repression and internment of Uighurs and other ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous region in the People's Republic of China. This behavior extends beyond Xinjiang to other regions and online communities. We need to ensure that US companies are not enabling these efforts, intentionally or inadvertently, by selling specific technology items that provide critical capabilities to the Chinese government for their surveillance, censorship, and social control efforts," said Sen. Warner.Background:The UIGHUR Protection Act would require the President, no later than 120 days after enactment, to identify and place items and technologies on the Commerce Control List that provide a critical capability to the Chinese government for suppressing human rights. Special licenses may be granted by the President for the export, re-export, or in-country transfer to or within China for these critical technologies but the bill would require a presumption of denial.Uighurs, or Uyghurs, are an ethnic group living primarily in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) in China's northwest. Since an outbreak of demonstrations and ethnic unrest in 2009 and clashes involving Uyghurs and Xinjiang security personnel that spiked between 2013 and 2015, the Chinese Community Party (CCP) began a policy of mass internment through labor camps they refer to as "reeducation camps."According to various estimates, Xinjiang authorities have detained over one million Turkic Muslims, mostly ethnic Uyghurs, and Kazakhs, in these camps without formal charges, trials or hearings, and with no timetable for release. According to former detainees, treatment and conditions in the camps include beatings, food deprivation, and crowded and unsanitary conditions.Load-Date: December 5, 2019End of Document

Trump, Commerce Secretary Send Signal That China Deal Can WaitStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeDecember 4, 2019 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MARKETS; Pg. 1Length: 581 wordsByline: Jean GarciaBodyPresident Donald Trump said he doesn't have a deadline for reaching a US trade deal with China, and he suggested that he might wait until after the 2020 election before he comes up with a deal to end the trade war between both countries.The Australian share market is headed for another day of major losses after US President Donald Trump said he was in no hurry to sign a trade deal with China by the end of next week.US negotiators expect a phase-one deal with China to be completed before American tariffs are set to rise on December 15, the people said."In some ways, I like the idea of waiting until after the election for the China deal".The president added that Washington is in a stronger negotiating position than the Chinese regime, given China's weak economic performance.Investors and manufacturers alike have been hoping that the US and China might resolve this issue, which has slowed economic growth on a global scale.Trump has tried to make the case that he supports both Xi and the Hong Kong protesters, expressing confidence that they could work out a deal.Trump's statement on Tuesday prompted investors to reduce their exposure to risk, with Asian shares extending their losses, while the USA dollar slid to a one-month low, making gold more attractive. Fresh U.S. tariffs on Argentina and Brazil, plus a threaten to impose duties on French goods, are fuelling fears that risks are tilting towards an escalation of the crisis.Jeffrey Schlupp goal delivers fifth place for Crystal Palace against BournemouthIt was a scrappy affair and Palace kept the game scoreless thanks to wasteful play from the Cherries as they tumbled to their fourth straight defeat.Former Mexican foreign Minister Luis Videgaray, with whom Kushner met frequently, said Kushner patched up https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-nafta-kushner-insight/how-trumps-son-in-law-helped-salvage-the-north-american-trade-zone-idUSKCN1MC04M the negotiations a couple of times after they fell apart.A steady string of worldwide firms, including Apple, Dell, Google, Amazon, toymaker Hasbro have announced plans to shift part of their USA bound production from China to neighboring countries, such as Vietnam, Malaysia, and Bangladesh.Ross said that the tariffs scheduled to take effect on December 15 will stay in place unless "enough substantive progress has been made" in trade talks.A person familiar with the Chinese government's stance on the trade negotiations told Reuters the phase one trade deal could be in jeopardy if the House bill on Uighurs becomes law. Trump has said he has no intention of doing so.It said China was expediting the process for the list because the U.S. House bill would "harm Chinese firms' interests", and that "relevant" U.S. entities would be among the targets.The regime also announced unspecified sanctions against at least five US -based non-profit organizations, saying that they "played an egregious role in the Hong Kong amendment bill disturbance" and were "much to blame for the chaos in Hong Kong".Trump then threatened duties of up to 100 percent on French goods, from champagne to handbags, because of a digital services tax that Washington says harms U.S. tech companies. "Because otherwise, there's a tendency of the other side to say 'Oh, he needs it for political reasons, so we'll give him a worse deal than we would.' He's not going to play that game".Earlier on Monday, Trump said the Hong Kong legislation didn't help trade negotiations with the regime.Load-Date: December 5, 2019End of Document

Former General Manager at China's largest blockchain network NEO, Zhao Chen, joins CMCC Global as partner in ShanghaiPR NewswireDecember 19, 2019 Thursday 7:49 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 718 wordsDateline: HONG KONG, Dec. 19, 2019 BodyPR NewswireCMCC Global brings on Zhao Chen, former General Manager at NEO, as a partner to set up a Shanghai office and to focus on blockchain equity investments in the region.CMCC Global, one of Asia's first blockchain focused venture capital funds, announced today that Zhao Chen has joined the company as a partner. Zhao was formerly the General Manager of NEO Global Development, the team behind the largest China-based blockchain platform, NEO. Prior to this, Zhao was an early employee at OnChain, one of the most reputable blockchain solutions companies in China. At CMCC Global, Zhao will be responsible for setting up a Shanghai presence and will focus on covering China's rapidly growing blockchain ecosystem.In 2017, China announced blockchain to be one of the core pillars in the technology segment of their five-year development plan. In October 2019, the Chinese government re-affirmed this commitment with China`s president Xi Jinping stating that the country must make "greater effort" to develop and apply blockchain technologies and gain an "edge over other major countries". Given the determination of its government, China is well positioned to become a leading nation in the blockchain space. As this new era of the Internet takes shape, having a presence in China will be vital for investors looking to participate in the growth of both enterprise blockchain solutions and Web3 applications."CMCC Global has proved to be one of the leading blockchain investors in Asia and the West and I look forward to working with the team as CMCC Global grows its presence in China and beyond. I am thrilled to be joining CMCC Global and look forward to setting up a new office in Shanghai" Zhao said. "China is poised to become a dominant player in the global blockchain space and there will be many opportunities as Chinese blockchain companies grow both domestically and internationally.""We are excited to bring on Zhao as a partner at CMCC", said Martin Baumann, co-founder of CMCC Global. "We have known Zhao for a number of years through his work with NEO. He brings a wealth of blockchain expertise with him, as well as broader financial markets experience in China and internationally. We look forward to working with Zhao as we expand our reach and efforts in China.""The creation of a presence in Shanghai demonstrates our commitment towards discovering and supporting the leading blockchain teams globally", Martin Baumann continued. "China is working to be a dominant force in the Web 3.0 arena, utilizing opportunities in currency, identity, supply chain and other areas that involve the movement of value as opposed to just information as in the current version of the Internet. China is well positioned to be the global leader in this technology race. Companies like Tencent and Alibaba have rapidly overtaken the size and scope of many western tech companies - we foresee a similar evolution happening in this next blockchain empowered era of the internet."About CMCC GlobalCMCC Global was founded in 2016 and is one of Asia's first venture capital funds focused solely on blockchain investments.

TikTok issues public apology for suspending the account of the teen behind the viral Chinese takedown video disguised as makeup tutorialBusiness Insider USNovember 27, 2019 Wednesday 09:11 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1053 wordsByline: pleskin@businessinsider.com,  (Paige Leskin)Highlight: The incident has led to further speculation on whether TikTok censors political content that may offend the Chinese government.BodyFeroza Aziz/TikTok• A teen on TikTok has been            going viral for a series of videos showing her give a makeup tutorial while criticizing the Chinese government's treatment of its Muslim population.• The account of Ferrora Aziz was suspended shortly after her videos went viral, leading to further speculation on whether TikTok censors political content that may offend the Chinese government.• TikTok has issued a public apology to Aziz and reinstated one of her accounts, although they acknowledge that its moderation process "will not be perfect."• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.TikTok issued a public apology after suspending an account belonging to a teen who went viral for using her videos, disguised as makeup tutorials, to issue a statement about China's treatment of Muslims.Teenager Ferora Aziz says she has since regained access to her TikTok account, which was suspended shortly after she used it to post a series of videos earlier this week that have been watched more than 1.5 million times.In a statement published Wednesday on TikTok's website, the company also stood behind its initial decision to suspend Aziz's account, but also acknowledged that its moderation process "will not be perfect."Aziz has made the rounds across social media with her videos posted to her TikTok account,            @getmefamouspartthree, that appeared to be a series of makeup tutorials. However, each video switches after a just a few seconds to Aziz calling on viewers to learn about China's treatment of the Muslim Uighurs.Aziz says in her videos that they are designed in such a way in an attempt to fool TikTok's moderators from cracking down and removing her content. TikTok - an app not available in China but owned by the Chinese company ByteDance - has faced increasing scrutiny            over fears it censors content considered "culturally problematic" and offensive to the Chinese government. Further, others have alleged TikTok takes notably restricts content dealing with "social and political topics." When pro-democracy protests broke out in Hong Kong earlier this year, TikTok was            curiously devoid of any hints of unrest, and videos instead documented a prettier picture. Meanwhile, TikTok has continued to insist that it's independent from China.Therefore, Aziz grew suspicious when she received a message from TikTok not long after her videos went up that her account had been "temporarily suspended due to multiple violations of our Community Guidelines," she tweeted.Aziz argued on Twitter that her account was suspended "for trying to spread awareness." However,            TikTok has said her account was suspended because it was connected to another one of her accounts, @getmefamousplzsir, which was banned for violating rules.TikTok said the ban on Aziz's second account was part of "scheduled platform-wide enforcement" of certain violations, including videos containing "terrorirm or terrorist imagery." TikTok pointed the finger            at a video in which a picture of Osama Bin Laden flashes on the screen. Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1199805145644707848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw This is the "video of Osama bin Laden" TikTok says got Feroza Aziz suspended from the platform. https://t.co/yRpiH9jIaN           pic.twitter.com/yzL2FjUjLvTikTok said in its statement that while it "recognize(s) that this video may have been intended as satire," it maintains strict policies. In Wednesday's statement, TikTok said that Aziz's account suspension and her China callout videos are two separate incidents with no correlation to each other. Even further, TikTok blamed "a human moderation error" for causing Aziz's video about China's treatment of Muslims for disappearing off the platform for 50 minutes Wednesday morning.Aziz responded on Twitter, where she made it clear she didn't believe that the situation with her TikTok account was merely a coincidence as the company says."Do I believe they took it away because of a unrelated satirical video that was deleted on a previous deleted account of mine? Right after I finished posting a 3 part video about the Uyghurs?" Aziz wrote. "No."Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1199829366341062656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw UPDATE: tik tok has issued a public apology and gave me my account back.

"Ni Hao Cassandra": the santiaguina youtuber who fell in love with ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 30, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 666 wordsBodyWith more than 42,000 followers, the young designer has been living in Beijing for more than three years and maintains as a hobbie a channel dedicated to meeting cities with her boyfriend.Cassandra Armijo (28) was always attracted to Asian culture. It was her mother who recommended that she study the Chinese language that, a decade later, would lead her to live and be happy on the other side of the world. "If you are going to learn a language so rare and far from the West, you better decide on Mandarin Chinese, as China's global presence is getting bigger," are the words that changed his life.Time passed and it was not until when he was a graphic design student at Diego Portales University that he decided to enter the Confucius Institute of the Catholic University to learn this language.There, he managed to stand out among his peers until he reached the advanced level of the language. But the young Santiaguina still felt that she didn't know enough, something else was missing. It was after leaving the university and finishing his classes that he discovered the opportunity he was looking for: "At that time I learned about the Chinese government's scholarships and decided to apply. My surprise and excitement was when in 2014 I won a scholarship to study for a year."For one season, Cassandra studied in Kaifeng, an ancient and traditional town located in the northwest of the country that was even a capital in ancient China. This experience allowed him to connect with culture and fall in love with the language.After returning to Chile, the designer suffered what she defined as a "serious reverse cultural shock", because during her studies she met Haoyang, her boyfriend. "I had to go back for a year and a half, which meant separating from him and maintaining a long-distance relationship that we managed to overcome," he says.His time in Santiago was brief. She worked hard enough, applied for a job in Beijing and returned at the end of 2017 to work as a designer in a company dedicated to international marketing.Walking camera in handIt was after her return to the Asian giant that Cassandra explored her side of youtuber. "Basically, the channel is my hobby with Haoyang, I combine it with my free time," she says.As he recalls, it was on his first trip to China that Armijo wanted to share his experience. In 2014 he started with a blog called "NiHaoCassanda.com", which in Spanish means "Hola Casandra". After settling in the capital, he decided that his videos should be the way to communicate with his family, highlighting his discoveries and cultural differences between the Eastern and Western worlds.Currently, Ni Hao Cassandra has the Youtube channel "Ni Hao Cassandra", with more than 42 thousand followers, a space that in a didactic way teaches tips on how she learned the language, her experience in iconic places like The Wall of China and even how her partner reacts to try Chilean sweets, reaching up to 280 thousand reproductions."It's a way to share my experience for those who want to come to this beautiful country, because I realized that there were a lot of people with misinformed and outdated information about China." Thanks to her hobby, she and her boyfriend expanded the borders of their blog by traveling in different parts of Southeast Asia.Moreover, last October they had to face greater challenges, after Cassandra and Haoyang were invited by a travel company aimed at foreigners, asking them to choose two destinations with all the expenses paid and thus tell the world their Stories.At the moment, the Chilean doesn't plan to move from Beijing. Rather, he still wants to continue to explore with camera in his hands two places that remain in the inkwell: Guilin, a town in southern China with large mountains that evoke the Dragon Ball drawings, and the Tibet, a spiritual sectorwith the one he's dreamed of all his life.The entry "Ni Hao Cassandra": the youtuber santiaguina who fell in love with China was first published in The Third.Load-Date: February 24, 2020End of Document

Feds: Chemical engineer at center of industrial espionageAssociated Press State & LocalDecember 23, 2019 Monday 7:29 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: STATE AND REGIONAL; Member ExchangeLength: 3979 wordsByline: By ROBERT MOORE, Citizen TribuneDateline: MORRISTOWN, Tenn. BodyMORRISTOWN, Tenn. (AP) - A high-performing, Chinese-born chemical engineer began work at Eastman Chemical Company in Kingsport in September 2017 as the alleged linchpin in a broader industrial-espionage scheme devised to steal tens of millions of dollars worth of trade secrets, proprietary information she planned to use to jump-start a competing business in China, according to federal court documents.Xiorang "Shannon" You, a naturalized U.S. citizen, allegedly conspired with a Chinese engineer to hijack $119.6 million worth of trade-secret information, according to an indictment drafted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy C. Harker and Matthew W. Walczewski, a prosecutor with the National Security Division of the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington D.C.The case against You and the Chinese engineer, Liu Xiangchen, who remains in China, involves a relatively obscure sector of the economy, yet one that accounts for an estimated $3 billion in annual worldwide economic activity - polymer coatings sprayed inside metal drink and food cans that minimize flavor loss and prevent the container from corroding or reacting with the contents.This federal prosecution centers on an entirely uncommon substance, but it has elements in common with higher-profile espionage cases: an alleged double agent; alleged state-sponsored theft; fevered, eleventh-hour computer downloads; and a potential financial impact large enough to buoy or blow holes in the economies of four countries.And while the alleged $119.6 million theft is a haul, according to the FBI, it's just an ice cube perched on the tip of an iceberg. The FBI estimates the annual economic loss to China through the theft of trade secrets, pirated computer software and counterfeit goods ranges from $225 billion to $600 billion.As a yardstick, Tennessee state government's entire spending plan for this fiscal year is $38.5 billion. This year's U.S. military budget approximates $716 billion.You allegedly stole trade secrets from Eastman that represent $13 million in research-and-development costs. The remaining $106.6 million in alleged intellectual-property theft occurred at You's prior employer, the Coca-Cola Corporation in Atlanta, according to William Leckrone, a Knoxville-based FBI agent who testified at You's detention hearing.Federal prosecutors do not allege You stole from Coca-Cola directly. They maintain You plundered trade secrets belonging to six chemical companies that entrusted Coca-Cola with their proprietary can-coatings formulations, according to Leckrone.The chemical companies and their reported research-and-development setbacks are: PPG Industries, $39 million; Sherwin-Williams Valspar, $30 million; Dow Chemical, $25 million; and AkzoNobel, a Dutch company, $7.3 million. The combined research-and-development losses at BASF and Toyochem, a Japanese firm, are $5.3 million, according to the FBI agent.The federal government believes that You transferred the proprietary information to Xiangchen.When U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents questioned You in September 2018 after she returned to the United States from China - three months after she lost her job at Eastman - she was carrying the trade-secret information from all seven companies, but that's just one facet of the government's proof, according to Leckrone.The FBI agent testified that while You was still employed at Eastman, she was receiving a full-time, $7,000-a-month salary from Xiangchen's company, Weihai Jinhong Polymer Company. The FBI has the employment contract. Text messages recovered from You's phone provide a detailed roadmap of You's dealings with Xiangchen, according to Leckrone.Also, in the weeks before You was arrested on Feb. 12 in Lansing, Michigan, she was shopping for an apartment in an exclusive beachfront high-rise in Weihai, China, a city of 2.8 million inhabitants located about 250 miles across the Yellow Sea from the Koreas. Prosecutors interpret the apartment search as an indication You wasn't long for the United States.What makes You's prosecution more intriguing is that she received 13 million Chinese yuan, about $1.86 million, in grant-like awards from the Chinese national government and the Shandong provincial government.While employed at Eastman, You won the Thousand Talents Program grant and the Yishi-Yiri award by using the stolen trade secrets "as the basis for (her) application," according to the indictment. Eastman was unaware of the awards.Part of the award money is earmarked for startup costs. The rest goes to the prize winner.It appears You would have pocketed about $715,000. Leckrone testified You was in line to receive one million yuan a year for four years, about $572,000, for the Yishi-Yiri award. Thousand Talent winners normally receive about one million yuan.However the bounty was divvied, the return on the investment for the national and provincial governments could have been enormous.Acquiring $119.6 million worth of proprietary technology for $1.86 million is the equivalent of buying a $1 million house for $15,625, and Harker suggested the actual value of the coatings formulations could be several times the research-and-development costs.A federal grand jury in Greeneville indicted You, 56, and Xiangchen, 61, for conspiracy to steal trade secrets, seven counts of stealing trade secrets and a single count of wire fraud. If convicted of the lot, she faces a federal prison sentence that ranges between 210 and 262 months.Federal inmates must serve 85 percent of their sentences before they're eligible for supervised release. A bottom-of-the-range sentence would mean You would be approaching 71 years old when she's set free.Xiangchen would be around 76 years old, but he has nothing to worry about from the U.S. attorney's office as long as he stays in China or in countries that don't have extradition treaties with the United States. The U.S. and China do not have an extradition treaty.By any professional measure - in the field of metal-can coatings - You is a star among street lamps. But when it came to the way she allegedly plotted to plunder Eastman and Coca-Cola's partners - and the way she allegedly belittled and otherwise mistreated coworkers and alleged coconspirators - she was a difficult employee, according to the FBI agent.You was in her late 20s in 1992 when she began work in the United States. Seven years later, she renounced her Chinese citizenship and became a U.S. citizen around the time she earned a doctorate from the Emulsion Polymers Institute at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania, according to court documents.You's upward professional trajectory reached a milestone when she landed the job as principal engineer for global research at Coca-Cola in 2012, which was one of the best years ever to be a leading polymer engineer.In 2011, France banned the use of bisphenol-A - a synthetic compound that had been a standard in the coatings industry for more than 50 years - after research suggested that even low-dose exposure was linked to cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease, heart attack, hypertension and angina. California followed France's lead on BPA shortly thereafter.At the time, BPA was also a common component of coatings for plastics. In 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned the use of BPA in the manufacture of baby bottles and "sippy cups" after further research indicated BPA could mimic the effect of estrogen, the primary female sex hormone.Apart from the fact that micro-dosing infants and children with an estrogen biosimilar never sounded like a good idea, the industry-wide stampede away from BPA had begun, and You was at the center of the BPA-free universe.The six chemical companies that You allegedly compromised had agreements with Coca-Cola to share their BPA-free trade secrets to advance research and development in the field, according to Leckrone."The entire industry (was) interested in coming up with the best can coating product they (could) develop ... They wanted it and they needed it," Leckrone testified.Access to the six companies' trade secrets was on a strict, need-to-know basis. You had access to everything, and she was the only point of contact for more than one company, according to Leckrone.In March 2017, Xiangchen allegedly first approached You about stealing the BPA-free trade secrets. Xiangchen sweetened the pot with the enticement that if You were successful, Weihai Jinhong would sponsor her application for the Thousand Talents and Yishi-Yiri awards, according to the indictment.At some point, Coca-Cola managers decided to eliminate You's research division, which ceased operations on Aug. 31, 2017. Toward the latter part of You's employment in Atlanta, the timeline the FBI advances becomes critical.On Aug. 10, Coca-Cola paid You $33,912 to sign a document affirming she had not retained any trade secrets. Coca-Cola provided You with a hard drive to which she was supposed to download the proprietary information. When You returned the hard drive, it was blank, according to Leckrone.Ten days later she traveled to China to defend her application to the Yishi-Yiri award program.On Aug. 29, shortly after 11 p.m. - two days before You's employment in Atlanta ended - Coca-Cola computer logs show the files containing the six chemical companies' trade secrets were moved, but they do not show the destination.Coca-Cola security software could not block the file transfer. The chemical companies' proprietary information would later be found on You's Eastman-supplied laptop in Kingsport, Lekrone testified.Coca-Cola computer forensic security staff may have strongly suspected You had stolen the files, but they couldn't prove it. For the time being, You was in the wind, allegedly with $106.6 million worth of trade secrets.Seventeen days after You started work at Eastman on Sept. 1, 2017, she traveled to China for four days - with Xiangchen's assistance - to defend her application to the Thousand Talents award.You's relationships with Eastman employees were deeply flawed from the outset and they never improved significantly before she was fired in June 2018, according to the FBI."One manager described her as a 'nightmare,'" Leckrone testified. "Others described her as unwilling to work on the product that they wanted, that she continually worked on products that Eastman wasn't attempting to develop; that she was reluctant to go to the lab space ..."You, whose title was packaging application development manager, let it slip to coworkers that she owned homes in Boston, Atlanta and Shanghai, and that she planned to put the United States behind her and retire to a comfortable life in China. At one point, she told a supervisor that she didn't need her salary, and she accepted the Eastman job as a favor to the company, according to the FBI agent.The beginning of the end for You at Eastman dawned on April 27, 2018 when she left for what was supposed to be an eight-day trip to China to meet with Eastman officials in Shanghai "to assist them in developing their image.""As she put it, she was famous in the industry, and that she needed to go to China for this trip," the FBI agent testified.Eight days passed and You was still in China. Eastman officials contacted You and strongly urged her to return to Tennessee. You overstayed by 17 days, according the FBI agent, who later learned You had been at the Weihai polymer company.Eastman higher-ups called her in for a "counseling" session, which was scheduled for 1 p.m. on May 21, according to the FBI agent, who testified that 20 minutes before the confab started You was downloading Eastman's coatings-related trade secrets.When the counseling meeting commenced, You's supervisor presented her with a multi-page document.She lost it."You took the papers and threw them at individuals and became very angry, and so Eastman elected to stop the meeting for the day, let cooler heads prevail and (they) asked Dr. You to go home and work from home for the day ..." Leckrone testified. "Instead, she toured the Eastman facilities looking for executive management to complain and talk to."Eastman's computer security was better in 2018 than Coca-Cola's computer security was in 2017.By the time the meeting reconvened the next day, Eastman had identified the trade-secret files that You had transferred to her company-supplied laptop, and they wanted the hard drive, along with her company iPhone back. They followed her home to her Johnson City residence and got both.In short order, an Eastman computer specialist identified files stolen from Eastman and the six other chemical companies. That's when Eastman notified the FBI.The images retrieved from You's iPhone included photos of the Eastman lab. That's important because the sequence of machinery Eastman uses is integral to the quality of the final BPA-free product, the FBI agent testified.The discovery was for naught. Not surprisingly, You had copied the files to another location.In May 2018, the FBI appeared to have You dead-to-rights, but agents didn't take her into custody. Once a person is indicted or arrested on a federal criminal complaint, the defendant can demand a trial in 70 days. More than eight months would pass before prosecutors were ready to present the evidence to a grand jury.By that time, You had found new employment at an unidentified chemical company in Lansing, Michigan.Response from the alleged victim companies was cautious. None addressed the details of the alleged theft."As an innovation-driven maker of additives and specialty materials, Eastman takes protection of its intellectual property seriously and we have controls in place to help prevent and to detect theft of confidential information" said Amanda Allman, director of Eastman corporate communications. "Those controls worked in this case, and we have been cooperating with law enforcement in this matter for some time."However, this case involves someone who worked for Eastman for less than 10 months after 25 years with other U.S. companies, so our involvement with the person and the case was relatively limited." Allman added. "Because of our limited visibility into the specifics of the case, we are not in a position to comment further."Max Davis, Coca-Cola communications manager, said, "At this time, we are going to respectfully decline participating in this story.""The proprietary research and development work done by our scientists brings great value to our customers, and ultimately impacts our position in the competitive marketplace," said Mark Silvey, PPG Industries director of corporate communications. "As a result, it is essential that we safeguard and protect that intellectual property."Joost Ruempol, senior spokesperson for AkzoNobel Global Communications, declined to comment because the criminal case has not been adjudicated.Sherwin-Williams Valspar, Dow Chemical, BASF and Toyochem did not respond to a request to comment.You's defense attorney, Johnson City lawyer Thomas C. Jessee, says he can't comment on the facts of the alleged industrial-espionage case, but he did say You rejected the government's plea offer and plans to go to trial, which is scheduled to begin in U.S. District Court in Greeneville on April 28.In an order to continue the trial, U.S. District Judge Ronnie Greer indicated he's disinclined to postpone the trial a third time. In the meantime, You will remain incarcerated in Johnson City unless circumstances arise that would require her to be transferred to another penal institution.The 155-page transcript of You's detention hearing provides a rare look-see inside federal prosecutors' brief cases. The same is true for the defense.Jessee characterized You's case a "prosecution by trick." Jessee does not maintain his client did not possess coatings-related information she obtained while working at Eastman and Coca-Cola.What Jessee argues is the formulations belonging to Eastman and the six other chemical companies were old science that's not worth anything close to $119.6 million. He suggested that if the six Coca-Cola-affiliated chemical companies possessed the industry's Holy Grail - the perfected BPA-free coatings technology - they wouldn't have had agreements with Coca-Cola in the first place."Quite frankly, she doesn't need any of that stuff," Jessee told then-U.S. Magistrate Clifton Corker. "They need her more than she needs some piece of paper of a test they did in 2011, and that's what the proof will show."Jessee told the judge that despite what research chemical companies conduct behind closed doors, the most important result is a patent, which become a public document after public approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.The defense attorney argues the value of the files his client possessed should be "depreciated."If Jessee could convince jurors the trade secrets are worth substantially less than $119.6 million, he could make the case that 210 to 262 months is not an appropriate sentence.Jessee also argued that You had ample opportunity to relocate to China after she was fired from Eastman in June 2018, but she remained in the United States for eight months and took a job in Michigan. If she had stolen valuable intellectual property belonging to Eastman and the other six chemical companies, Jessee maintains, she would have been in China.When FBI agents arrested her in Michigan in February, her apartment contained only one folding chair, one collapsible table and a mattress, which was resting on the floor, a paucity of amenities the FBI concluded was an unambiguous indication she didn't plan to stay in the U.S. for long.Inside You's sparsely furnished apartment, FBI agents confiscated what they call a "go-bag," a brief case that contained You's passport, naturalization papers, banking and insurance information, college degrees and thousands of dollars in U.S. currency, Euros, British pounds, Australian dollars and Chinese yuan.Jessee argued that the government routinely runs public-service announcements encouraging people to keep vital information in one place in case of a natural disaster, so having the documents together suggests uncommon organization, not criminality."There's no reason you would need five currencies in your go-bag in order to avoid an earthquake," Harker countered.The Chinese have a slang word for Chinese students who study abroad and then return to pursue their careers. It's haigui, or "sea turtle," so named for the reptiles' propensity to travel large distances through salty waters, but return to their beach of birth to lay eggs.The Thousand Talents and the Yishi-Yiri programs were created to transform expatriate scholars and industry leaders like You into haigui. The Chinese governments, in part, play on Chinese nationalism to convince scholars residing in other countries to come home, but patriotism isn't the only draw.Apart from cash awards, Thousand Talent Program winners arrive in China with the honorific title of "national distinguished experts." Part of the money the winners received is used to construct state-of-the-art research facilities, and they get what Leckrone called a "fast pass" through customs.The Chinese government reported that between 2008, when the Thousand Talents Program was created, and 2018, approximately 7,000 people received Thousand Talent awards, including a small number of top performers who are not Chinese.The FBI does not allege all, or even most of, the 7,000 are engaged in spying or trade-secret theft, but the bureau has concluded that some, like You, are state-sponsored thieves that do economic harm to the United State and other countries.What makes alleged intellectual-property theft a nightmare to police is the Thousand Talents and Yishi-Yiri programs are just two of more than 200 similar programs overseen by the Chinese government, according to John Brown, assistant director of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division."Time and time again, the Chinese government has proven that it will use any means necessary to advance its interests at the expense of others, including the United States, and pursue its long-term goal of being the world's superpower by 2049," Brown testified before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in November."These individuals are not 'spies' in the traditional sense of intelligence officers, but they are nonetheless collecting information sought by the Chinese government ... With our present-day knowledge of the threat from Chinese talent programs, we wish we had taken more rapid and comprehensive action in the past, and the time to make up for that is now," Brown added.Brown told committee members when the FBI began high-profile arrests and prosecutions of Chinese nationals allegedly involved in trade-secret theft in 2018, the Chinese government demonstrated what the FBI believes demonstrates consciousness of guilt - the Thousand Talents website went dark, and other public sources of information about talent programs disappeared."If these programs are as innocuous as they try to imply, why the shift to secrecy?" Brown asked.The recently announced partial trade deal between the United States and China contains assurance that China will take a harsher stance on intellectual-property rights.Bill Priestap, who was assistant director of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division when he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2018, said he expects the trade rift with China to deepen, not to close. Priestap told senators he foresaw the day when meaningful U.S. involvement in Chinese economy could end."While U.S. companies may be able to operate and profit in China for a time, it is on borrowed time," Priestap testified. "The Chinese government will permit foreign companies to operate only so long as it is advantageous to China ... A company may be allowed to operate simply to give China a better opportunity to understand how to copy the business and outcompete it globally."From the viewpoint of the Chinese government, many of the foreign companies doing business in China represent a temporary failure of the domestic market to meet demand," he added. "The government believes that if something can be made in China, then it should be made in China."In an October 2017 message to You, Xiangchen reported he submitted false information to either the Thousand Talent or Yishi-Yiri decision-makers "in order to increase the possible monetary award they could receive," according to the indictment.The indictment also suggests China was not entirely a safe harbor for alleged trade-secret pirates. The trade secrets would not be held directly by Weihai Jinhong, Xiangchen's company. You, Xiangchen and You's aunt, Hong Mai, planned to form another company to hold ownership of the chemical companies' intellectual property.This would have allowed them to effectively launder the stolen trade-secret information through the second company, obscuring its origin, according to the indictment.The indictment identifies Mai as an unindicted coconspirator. Not only did she plan to reap benefits from the alleged trade-secret theft, You and Xiangchen largely communicated through Mai. She negotiated with Xiangchen and Weihai Jinhong on You's behalf, facilitated payments between Weihai Jinhong and You, and conducted her niece's banking business in China, officials allege.And while the Thousand Talent, the Yishi-Yiri and other talent-attraction programs appeal to Chinese patriotism, national duty and love of homeland, You wanted to get paid, according to the FBI agent."On April 8, 2018, Dr. You tells Xiangchen, 'I won't work, I won't work until Weihai Jinhong Group confirms my benefits, salary, house, et cetera,'" Leckrone testified. "'I won't do anything before seeing money. (I am) taking the risk in all this, and won't give away technology without money.'"Load-Date: December 24, 2019End of Document

Secret documents reveal how China mass detention camps workAssociated Press InternationalNovember 25, 2019 Monday 11:03 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: DOMESTIC NEWSLength: 1076 wordsByline: By The Associated PressBodyThe Chinese government has detained more than a million Uighurs, Kazakhs and other ethnic minorities for what it calls voluntary job training. But a newly revealed classified blueprint shows that the camps Beijing runs in China's far west are instead secret centers for forced ideological and behavioral re-education.The confidential documents, leaked to a consortium of international journalists, lay out the Chinese government's deliberate strategy to lock up minorities, most of whom are Muslims, to rewire their thoughts and even the language they speak.The documents stipulate watch towers, double-locked doors and blanket video surveillance "to prevent escapes." They describe an elaborate scoring system that grades detainees on how well they speak the dominant Mandarin language, memorize ideology and adhere to strict rules on everything down to bathing and using the toilet.They also show how Beijing is pioneering a new form of social control using data and artificial intelligence. With the help of mass surveillance technology, computers issued the names of tens of thousands of people for interrogation or detention in just one week, including university students and party officials who wouldn't need vocational training.Taken as a whole, the documents give the most significant description yet of how the mass detention camps work in the words of the Chinese government itself.Experts say they spell out a vast system that targets, surveils and grades entire ethnicities to forcibly assimilate them - especially Uighurs, a Turkic minority of about 10 million with their own language and culture."They confirm that this is a form of cultural genocide," said Adrian Zenz, a leading security expert in the far western region of Xinjiang, where many Uighurs live. "It really shows that from the onset, the Chinese government had a plan."Zenz said the documents echo the aim of the camps as outlined in a 2017 report from a local branch of the Xinjiang Ministry of Justice: To "wash brains, cleanse hearts, support the right, remove the wrong."China has struggled for decades to control Xinjiang, where hundreds, both Uighurs and Han Chinese, have died in terror attacks, reprisals and race riots. In 2014, Chinese President Xi Jinping launched what he called a "People's War on Terror" in response to terror attacks carried out by radical Uighur militants.In late 2016, the crackdown intensified dramatically when Xi named Chen Quanguo, a hardline official transferred from Tibet, as Xinjiang's new head. Most of the documents were issued in 2017."Since the measures have been taken, there's no single terrorist incident in the past three years," said a written response from the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom. "Xinjiang is much safer....The so-called leaked documents are fabrication and fake news."The statement said that religious freedom and the personal freedom of detainees was "fully respected" in Xinjiang.The documents came from an anonymous source, and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists verified them by consulting experts, cross-checking content and comparing signatures. They consist of a notice with guidelines for the camps, four bulletins on how to use technology to target people, and a court case sentencing a local Uighur party official to 10 years in prison for telling colleagues not to say dirty words, watch porn or eat without praying.Issued to rank-and-file officials by the powerful Xinjiang Communist Party Political and Legal Affairs Commission, the documents confirm what is known about the camps from the testimony of Uighurs and Kazakhs, satellite imagery and highly restricted visits by journalists to the region.Erzhan Qurban, a Chinese-born ethnic Kazakh, was held for nine months because he had spent time abroad in Kazakhstan. Qurban said he was locked in a cell with 10 others last year, forced to sit rigidly for hours and forbidden to pray or even talk."It wasn't education, it was just punishment," said Qurban. "I was treated like an animal."Other detainees have said there was torture or rape at the camps.The documents show direct links between the internment camps and the extreme digital surveillance in Xinjiang. One document states that the purpose of the surveillance is "to prevent problems before they happen."This is done through a system called the Integrated Joint Operations Platform or IJOP, built by a state-owned military contractor. The IJOP spat out the names of people considered suspicious for behavior that includes going abroad, asking others to pray or using cell phone apps that cannot be monitored by the government. These people were then called in for questioning and funneled into different parts of the system, from house arrest to detention centers with three levels of monitoring to prison.Once inside, the documents show, detainees are subject to forced indoctrination.The first item listed as part of the curriculum is ideological education. It is partly rooted in the ancient Chinese belief in transformation through education - taken before to terrifying extremes during the mass thought reform campaigns of Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution.The indoctrination goes along with "manner education," where behavior is dictated, including ensuring "timely haircuts and shaves," "regular change of clothes" and "bathing once or twice a week." The tone, experts say, echoes a general perception by the Han Chinese government that Uighurs are prone to violence and need to be civilized.Mandarin is mandated. Detainees are frequently tested on Mandarin, ideology and discipline, and their scores feed into a point system tracked by computer. Detainees who do well are to be rewarded with perks like family visits and early graduation, and those who do poorly are to be sent to a stricter "management area" with longer detention times.Students go for "vocational skills improvement" only after at least one year of learning ideology, law and Mandarin. After they leave, the documents say, every effort should be made to get them jobs. Some detainees describe being forced to sign work contracts for low pay.Independent experts on Chinese law say the detentions are a clear violation of China's own laws."They're not even trying to justify this legally," said Maggie Lewis, a professor of Chinese law at Seton Hall University. "This is arbitrary."___A longer version of this story is available at https://apnews.com/4ab0b341a4ec4e648423f2ec47ea5c47Load-Date: November 26, 2019End of Document

The Latest: Sarah Sanders stokes Twitter feud with BidenAssociated Press InternationalDecember 20, 2019 Friday 4:00 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICAL NEWSLength: 2152 wordsDateline: LOS ANGELES BodyLOS ANGELES (AP) - The Latest on the Democratic presidential debate (all times local):10:40 p.m.An onstage moment from Thursday night's Democratic debate has sparked a Twitter back-and-forth between President Donald Trump's former spokeswoman and Joe Biden.The former vice president imitated a stutter as he related a tale of how he connects with people as he campaigns, including a child who may have had a speech impediment.Afterward, former Trump press secretary Sarah Sanders seemed to imitate a stutter as she tweeted, "I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I hhhave absolutely no idea what Biden is talking about. #DemDebate."Sanders followed up with a tweet saying she wasn't making fun of anyone but "pointing out I can't follow much of anything Biden is talking about."Biden suffered from a stutter as a child. After the debate, he tweeted in response, "I've worked my whole life to overcome a stutter" and encouraged "empathy" to understand those who have experienced the same.__10:30 p.m.Pete Buttigieg is taking increasing heat from his rivals as he rises to the top in polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.Targets included his high-dollar fundraisers, including one in a wine bar, pointed out by Elizabeth Warren, and his experience, raised by Amy Klobuchar. Buttigieg is the mayor of South Bend, Indiana.Minnesota Sen. Klobuchar points to her two terms in the Senate and her prodigious list of other accomplishments, suggesting that Washington experience, which Buttigieg criticizes, is more an asset than a liability.Klobuchar says Democrats need someone leading the ticket "that has actually won and been able to show that they can gather the support that you talk about." Klobuchar often notes her widespread victories in politically diverse regions of Minnesota.Klobuchar, a moderate, sees Buttigieg as someone she can peel support from in neighboring Iowa, but where he has led in recent polls and has among the campaign's most robust organizations.Likewise, Warren is hoping to slow Buttigieg's momentum in New Hampshire, which neighbors her home state, Massachusetts.__10:20 p.m.It came at the tail end, but the most fiery back-and-forth at Thursday's Democratic presidential debate came in the form of former Vice President Joe Biden's renewed criticism of the estimated costs of the "Medicare for All" health care proposals of some of his opponents.Biden calls it "absolutely preposterous" for candidates like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders to maintain that middle-class Americans would actually save anything under proposals that cost tens of trillions of dollars over a decade.Sanders, who has reminded debate opponents he "wrote the damn bill" on Medicare for All, complained of the "byzantine and complex administration of thousands of separate health care plans" that exist now. Sanders said taxes will go up under his proposals but noted the savings in the elimination of premiums and copays."Put your hand down for a second, Bernie, OK?" Biden asked as he launched into his initial explanation."I'm just waving to you, Joe," Sanders replied.__10 p.m.Democratic presidential candidates - most of them white men and several in their 70s - were asked to respond Thursday to former President Barack Obama's comments that if women ran countries there would be significant improvements, and that a lot of problems are caused by old men not getting out of the way.Bernie Sanders was asked to respond first. The 78-year-old Vermont senator quipped "and I'm white too." Sanders says he disagrees with Obama, noting that's "maybe a little self-serving." He says the bigger issue is that the power in America resides with a handful of billionaires.Former Vice President Joe Biden, 77, says, "I'm going to guess he wasn't talking about me either." Biden says he has more experience than any candidate on the stage in Los Angeles, and with that experience comes judgment and wisdom. Asked if he would run for a second term at age 82 if he wins in November, Biden wouldn't commit but said "it's a nice thought."Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar is talking up her history of winning in her state, noting she outperformed Donald Trump there in 2016. She also touted her record of passing bills in Washington.Seventy-year-old Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, asked about possibly being the oldest person ever elected president, noted, "I'd also be the youngest woman ever inaugurated."__9:45 p.m.Wine caves, campaign contributions and access.A dispute over big-dollar donors and fundraising between Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has spilled onto the presidential debate stage.Warren on Thursday night described a lavish Buttigieg fundraiser in a "wine cave" with $900 bottles of wine and crystal chandeliers, noting that, unlike the South Bend, Indiana mayor, "I do not sell access to my time."The Associated Press reported last week of Buttigieg's fundraiser at the Hall Rutherford wine caves in California's Napa Valley, with a chandelier with 1,500 Swarovski crystals and bottles of cabernet sauvignon selling for as much as $900.Warren for weeks pushed Buttigieg to open his fundraisers and be more transparent about donors. His campaign has said Buttigieg doesn't solely rely on big-dollar donations and has received an outpouring of small amounts averaging $32 during the last three-month reporting period.On Thursday, Buttigieg countered Warren, saying it wouldn't "pollute my campaign" if Warren herself made a maximum donation to his campaign.It's a head-spinning back and forth. Buttigieg says Warren held big fundraisers when she ran for Senate last year, and transferred millions of those dollars to her 2020 campaign under rules written by Congress for members. She says she doesn't "meet behind closed doors with big-dollar donors" and hasn't held private fundraisers as a candidate for president.__9:20 p.m.A possible boycott of the 2022 Beijing Olympics? South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg says "any tool should be on the table" in dealing with China.Buittigieg and other Democrats seeking their party's presidential nomination are advocating a mix of policies in response to China's mass detention camps for Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim minorities.Billionaire Tom Steyer is stressing the need for a relationship with China, a "frenemy," to combat the global challenge of climate change.Asked specifically about Chinese military buildup, former Vice President Joe Biden says China would need 17 years to achieve the status of the U.S. military. He also says it must be clear the U.S. will not abide by any human rights abuses on the part of China.The Chinese government has long struggled with its 11 million-strong Uighur population, an ethnic Turkic minority native to Xinjiang province, and in recent years has detained 1 million or more Uighurs and other minorities in the camps.__9:15 p.m.Bernie Sanders is calling for a U.S. policy toward Israel that makes space for both Israeli security and a "pro-Palestinian" perspective.Sanders, who would be the first Jewish president if he wins the Democratic nomination in 2020 and bests President Donald Trump, has called for the United States to consider conditioning aid to Israel as a means to nudge its government away from expanding settlements in the West Bank and other moves that have impeded Israel-Palestinian relations.Two of the other Democratic presidential candidates debating in Los Angeles on Thursday, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg, have joined Sanders in leaving the door open to such conditions on U.S. aid to Israel.__9:05 p.m.Former Vice President Joe Biden is pushing back against criticism that it's naive to suggest a Democratic president could negotiate with some Republicans.Harking back to his eight years as former President Barack Obama's trusted adviser, he says it's time to build on that work and invite Republicans to participate. Besides, he says, with a Democrat in the White House Republicans won't have President Donald Trump "to intimidate those half a dozen Republicans we may need."Subtly jabbing Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Biden says he refuses "to accept the notion, as some on this stage do," that compromise is a thing of the past. He says, "If that's the case, we're dead as a country."Given the impeachment proceedings that have touched on Trump's questions about Biden's tenure and his son's work in Ukraine, Biden says he should be the one angriest with Republicans for "the way they've attacked me, my son and my family."___9 p.m.Race took the debate stage toward the end of the first hour, as questions of diversity were posed to candidates.Asked why he was the lone minority candidate on the debate stage, Andrew Yang said most people of color don't donate to political campaigns because they lack the disposable income.Yang, who is Asian American, lamented the absence of California Sen. Kamala Harris - who suspended her campaign earlier this month despite qualifying for the debate - and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, whom Yang predicted would return to the debate stage.He then turned the issue into a pitch for his candidacy, telling moderators his proposed "freedom dividend," which would give every American $1,000 a month, would "guarantee" he would not be the only minority candidate on stage.Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar was asked what she would say to white Americans uncomfortable with the idea of becoming a racial minority. She responded that the country must "strive for a more perfect union," which means including people of color in economic progress and fighting voter suppression.Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said climate change is also part of addressing racial inequality, and said all candidates "have an obligation" to speak to issues such as criminal justice, the economy and the environment. particularly in the absence of candidates of color.__8:50 p.m.Former Vice President Joe Biden is acknowledging that the blue-collar workers whose causes he champions may suffer in a push to make American business greener.Biden was asked at Thursday night's Democratic presidential debate if such jobs will likely be lost with a move toward cleaner energy. He responded that "the answer is yes."But Biden says those same workers would benefit from the higher-paying jobs created in such an economy.Billionaire Tom Steyer agrees with Biden on job creation, while Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is pushing for a declaration of a national emergency on the need to address climate change.__8:35 p.m.Democratic senators are demonstrating divergent views on free trade, with Vermont's Bernie Sanders vowing to vote against the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement and Minnesota's Amy Klobuchar promising to support it.Though Sanders says it would make "modest" improvements in the economy, he says nowhere in the agreement do the words "climate change" appear. What's more, the Democratic Socialist says, it's "not going to stop corporations from moving to Mexico" to take advantage of cheaper labor.However, Klobuchar says the agreement includes improved environmental and labor standards, and a better agreement for the U.S. on pharmaceutical sales.Klobuchar says the agreement can "encourage work made in America."__8:20 p.m.As the national impeachment debate turns toward the U.S. Senate, the Democrats vying for their party's nomination to replace President Donald Trump are united in pushing for his removal from office.On the debate stage Thursday night, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota says Trump's situation is even more serious than the events that brought down Richard Nixon, calling Trump's alleged misdeeds "a global Watergate." Referencing the 1974 book by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, Klobuchar wondered of Trump, "If he is so innocent, then why doesn't he have all the president's men testifying?"Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren - who, along with Klobuchar, will likely participate in an impeachment trial early next year - are focusing on the need to eradicate what they see as Trump's corruption. Former Vice President Joe Biden is calling Trump's removal "a constitutional necessity."__7:55 p.m.Seven candidates are taking the stage for the final Democratic presidential debate of 2019.Former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren are clustered at the top of the field. They are being joined by South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and billionaire philanthropist Tom Steyer.The Los Angeles debate in the heart of the holiday season is overshadowed by Congress' historic impeachment vote, raising the prospect that it may draw the smallest audience yet. But the stakes are not small in the broader tug-of-war between passionate progressives and pragmatic moderates who are battling over the party's positions on core issues like health care, immigration, education and trade.Load-Date: December 20, 2019End of Document

The Jenbacher gas engines bring the total install base for China Water to 104 units. China Water Industry is working closely with INNIO Jenbacher to use gas engines in landfills to generate energy from waste in 10 Chinese provinces.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191119005621/en/China Water Industry and INNIO celebrating 100th Jenbacher gas engine delivery in Guangzhou, China. Copyright: China Water Industry GroupWith large urban populations, China is among the top 10 municipal solid waste generating countries. The Chinese government has environmental regulations in place to deal with the management of landfills and to encourage the utilization of municipal waste. Under the national "One Belt, One Road" policy, China Water Industry has focused on expanding both domestic and overseas markets to actively develop and deploy the international landfill gas power generation segment. Across 10 provinces, China Water Industry engineers designed and built landfill gas power generation projects to convert landfill gases to electricity. China Water Industry is working closely with INNIO to use Jenbacher technology to increase the efficiency and output of the power generated from the landfills.The China Water Industry and INNIO Jenbacher relationship has led to the installation of 104 Jenbacher gas engines to produce electricity from recovered landfill gas, which is then fed into the Central China Power Grid (CCPG). The China Water Industry technical team selected the Jenbacher gas engine based on its years of operating experience. China Water Industry 's leadership has turned to INNIO Jenbacher to provide more gas engine technology in the future."As waste continues to be a growing threat to China's environment, our engineers are leading the way in managing methane gas by using technology to convert this waste to clean energy," commented Lin Yue Hui, Executive Director and CEO of China Water Industry. "Critical to our success are INNIO Jenbacher gas engines, which have been key in helping us generate value from waste in a sustainable way."China Water and Jenbacher combined technology has helped with the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from both methane recovery and the replacement of electricity that would have been generated by the utilization of fossil fuels."INNIO is pleased to support China Water Industry across China in delivering clean electricity to the grid from landfill gas," said Carlos Lange, President and CEO of INNIO. "In China, INNIO has succeeded in meeting customer heat and power needs by supplying more than 900 MW to a wide variety of industries - such as independent power producers, utilities, commercial buildings and data centers. More than 200 MW installed capacity in China is used to convert landfill gas to energy, regardless of size or complexity of the project."China Water Industry has applied for participation in the international carbon trading market based on flexible compliance mechanisms introduced in the Kyoto Protocol. It expects to transfer and obtain project-level emission reduction offsets with developed countries. Following verification, the carbon emission reduction can be transferred in the future.* Indicates a registered trademarkAbout China Water Industry (CWI)CWI, listed on Hong Kong stock exchange (HK. 1129), is the professional investment and operation management service provider, which focuses on water supply, wastewater treatment, solid waste disposal and real estate.

SENATOR HAWLEY INTRODUCES BILL TO ADDRESS NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS RAISED BY BIG TECH'S PARTNERSHIPS WITH BEIJINGStates News ServiceNovember 18, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 663 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Missouri Senator Josh Hawley:Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the National Security and Personal Data Protection Act to combat the flow of Americans' sensitive personal data to China and countries that similarly threaten America's national security. The introduction of this legislation follows a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism hearing chaired by Senator Hawley that explored the tech industry's ties to China. During the hearing, experts testified that Apple's decision to store iCloud encryption keys in China and TikTok's ties to the Chinese government pose a threat to America's national security.Senator Hawley said, "Current law makes it far too easy for hostile foreign governments like China to access Americans' sensitive data. Chinese companies with vast amounts of personal data on Americans are required by Chinese law to provide that data to Chinese intelligence services. If your child uses TikTok, there's a chance the Chinese Communist Party knows where they are, what they look like, what their voices sound like, and what they're watching. That's a feature TikTok doesn't advertise."And it's not just Chinese companies that create this risk. Chinese law allows the Communist Party to seize data from American companies operating in China whenever it wants, for whatever reason it wants. This legislation takes crucial steps to stop Americans' sensitive data from falling into the hands of hostile foreign governments."Senator Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) is an original cosponsor of the National Security and Personal Data Protection Act.BackgroundChina and countries that similarly threaten America's national security are taking steps to vacuum up our sensitive data:Today, countries like China can acquire and use personal data in ways that pose a grave threat to America's national security. As revealed last week, China could use "images of our servicemen and women" obtained from sites like TikTok to train its autonomous weapons. U.S. officials currently are assessing TikTok for national security reasons. China also could build or steal massive profiles on Americans. And China could use aggregate location data from phones to identify bridges or roads to target for sabotage.Senator Hawley's bill cuts off the flow of sensitive data to China and countries that similarly threaten America's national security:Some American companies agree to give sensitive data to China in exchange for entering the Chinese market. As FBI Director Christopher Wray testified, Chinese law "compels U.S. companies that are operating in China . . . to provide whatever information the government wants whenever it wants." This law means that when American companies store encryption keys in China, China can read the messages those keys protect.Senator Hawley's bill prohibits American companies from transferring user data or encryption keys to China and other countries that similarly threaten America's national security.Senator Hawley's bill prohibits American companies from storing data in China and other countries that similarly threaten America's national security.China can obtain data by inserting its own companies into the United States where those companies then collect data on unsuspecting Americans.For Chinese companies, and companies from other countries that similarly threaten America's national security, Senator Hawley's bill:Prohibits transferring user data or encryption keys to those countries or storing that data in those countries.Prohibits collecting more data than necessary to provide a service hereProhibits using collected data for secondary purposesChina and other countries that similarly threaten America's national security, can purchase American companies that already have collected information on Americans.Senator Hawley's bill changes the default rule for mergers of certain companies to block those mergers unless companies obtain pre-approval from CFIUS.Load-Date: November 19, 2019End of Document

Struggle for The DealThe Commentator: Yeshiva UniversityNovember 3, 2019 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 853 wordsByline: Meir Lightman Meir Lightman BusinessBodyRemember the shaky relationship between Ross and Rachel that lasted throughout the 10 seasons of Friends and spanned most of our childhood? This is the perception of many who see the bickering between the Presidents of the U.S. and China on trade. While there is general optimism from analysts, investors and consumers, there is no clear indication that the two countries are headed towards an agreement.Beginning at a campaign rally in June 2016, President Trump accused China of the "greatest job theft in history," and initiated two executive orders to counter the unfair trading practices of our largest Asian trading partner. The main reasons for such a divide are because we have had a growing trade deficit and the Chinese government has seized American technology as the government seeks to boost its own technology industry. For years, the United States and China have had a rocky relationship but since President Trump took office, he made it his responsibility to construct a deal that will mutually benefit the two largest economies in the world. This goes without saying that neither nation can survive without the other; China relies on U.S. agriculture while the U.S. is dependent on the Asian country's manufacturing and abundance of steel. Even more so, the global economy relies on the two largest trading partners and, therefore, has reciprocated with unpredictable fluctuations in markets around the world.Last year, when the United States Administration added three levels of tariffs valued at $550 billion worth of Chinese goods, China counteracted by levying duties on $110 billion worth of American products. Just a couple of months ago, the White House decided as "a gesture of good will" to delay the increase from 25% to 30% in tariffs on $250 billion worth of goods, which was set to take effect on October 15. As a result, China mutually agreed to soften the burden by exempting pork and soybeans from additional tariffs.Most recently, the two countries have agreed to "Phase One" of what claims to be a larger agreement. On October 11, China acquiesced to increase purchases on U.S. agriculture goods, while also coming to terms with new guidelines on intellectual property, financial services and currency management. As a result, the U.S. has postponed the tariff increases that were set to take effect on in the middle of October, leading markets in both countries to increase since the announcement. Throughout the prolonged negotiations, this has been the most significant step toward reaching a possible settlement and the countries remain optimistic that there will be a deal signed earlier than previously expected.The back and forth between these countries is nothing new. This tit-for-tat has been going on for the last two years, commencing with U.S. inquiries into the Chinese telecom conglomerate Huawei and its tight-knit relationship with the Chinese regime. In May, Huawei and its counterpart ZTE Corp. were blacklisted from performing business with American companies and alluded to in a national emergency announcement issued by the White House. With cybersecurity threats on the rise, the Executive Order stated that the exchange of technology developed in adversarial countries can "create and exploit vulnerabilities in information and communications technology or services, with potentially catastrophic effects and thereby constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States." Technology has become the new driving force of countries and as the race to implement 5G intensifies, Chinese companies are seeking to become the global cartel for the new equipment.The longer these two countries battle over trade, the greater the chance that other countries will look to jump into China's 1.4 billion consumer market and attempt to replace the role of U.S. companies. As U.S. companies fear this possibility, Chinese companies are also on high alert not to lose 19% of the country's exports that are transported to the U.S. Although trade has continuously grown between the U.S. and China over the last 40 years, it will be a heavy blow to both sides, if the countries cannot strike a deal.Ultimately, as a result of the current tariffs and the fear of additional increases, major household names such as Google and Gap have relocated manufacturing operations to other countries such as Vietnam or Bangladesh. The next 12 months will be one of the most heightened periods of tension for President Trump, not just because he will be on the campaign trail, but he will need to secure a decades-long trade deal to garner support amongst Americans. Currently, China appears to view itself as the underdog with Chinese President Xi Jinping mentioning the word 'douzheng,' struggle, almost 60 times in a recent speech to members of the Communist party. As analysts hope that the 2020 U.S. election will encourage the two countries to move closer to a deal, for now, all eyes are on the two world leaders and the subtle hints they continue to drop.Photo Caption: A deal yet to be reached Photo Credit: PixabayLoad-Date: November 3, 2019End of Document

CHINA'S PUBLIC DIPLOMACY SPENDING IN SOUTH AND CENTRAL ASIA QUANTIFIED AND EVALUATEDStates News ServiceDecember 10, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1223 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: Williamsburg, VA BodyThe following information was released by the College of William and Mary:by Alex Wooley, AidDataAidData, a research lab at William and Mary, today released new data and analysis capturing the results of China's strategic public diplomacy efforts in 13 countries of South and Central Asia (SCA).Based on primary data collection (through AidData's TUFF methodology) and secondary data synthesis, the quantitative research includes new numbers on China's total investment in financial diplomacy in the region for the period 2000-2017, including all infrastructure investments, humanitarian aid, budget support and debt relief.For the period 2000-2017, AidData uncovered $126 billion in committed, implemented or completed projects in the SCA region by official Chinese agencies and banks. Of this, some $120 billion is in infrastructure investments.Beijing has ramped up the volume and sophistication of its public diplomacy overtures in the region over time, said Samantha Custer, AidData's director of policy analysis, who led the research team. But infrastructure as a part of its financial diplomacy dwarfs Beijing's other public diplomacy tools in terms of sheer scale and visibility.Eighty-five percent of infrastructure investments go to new construction projects, and two countries in particular captured half of Beijing's financial diplomacy investments: Pakistan an early signatory to the Belt and Road Initiative and Kazakhstan. In fact Pakistan received almost six times as much of China's financial largesse over the period as did rival India.To assemble the new dataset, AidData researchers collected information on grants, concessional loans, non-concessional loans from Chinese government agencies, policy banks, state-owned commercial banks and investment funds.Is China getting a return on its investment to promote a more positive image of itself? Complementing the quantitative data collection, the researchers also interviewed 216 individuals in 145 organizations in six SCA countries, in order to understand how Beijing's public diplomacy efforts are perceived.At the end of the day, citizens appear to be somewhat polarized regarding Beijing's financial diplomacy overtures in their countries, said Siddhartha Ghose, AidData associate director and a co-author of the report. These activities are associated with both lower approval and disapproval of Chinese government leadership. Some of these mixed feelings regarding Beijing's role as an economic partner may stem from the fact that the Chinese government often ties its offers of financing to the use of Chinese firms, labor and supplies, with limited trickle-down to the local economy."As a case in point, we found that Beijing tended to allocate a greater share of its financial diplomacy between 2000 and 2017 to countries with a higher number of new Chinese firms and Chinese migrants. Moreover, in several cases, there were concerns regarding the utility and equity of Chinese government-backed infrastructure projects.The report notes that economically, Chinese leaders have several goals for the SCA region: productive use of surplus foreign currency reserves, preferential bilateral trade and investment deals, efficient transportation routes for Chinese exports and access to new sources of energy and raw materials.The researchers asked leaders in recipient countries to describe China's foreign policy motivations for its strategic charm offensive.Interviewees across the six country studies highlighted a range of motives for Beijing's engagement in their countries, said Tanya Sethi, a co-author of the report and a Senior Policy Analyst at AidData. These include marshalling support for the One China principle, ensuring safe passage for Chinese exports and imports, shoring up stability in its Western regions, such as Tibet and Xinjiang, contesting the hegemony of strategic competitors like India and Russia and minimizing censure for its domestic policies. In addition to swaying popular perceptions, Beijing is keen to influence the behavior of leaders to align with its preferred policy positions.In addition to financial diplomacy, the research team produced data and analysis on four other types of public diplomacy: informational/media, cultural, exchange and elite-to-elite. The team found that it is a crowded space for influence: citizens in SCA countries often feel greater cultural, linguistic and historic affinity with India in South Asia, or Russia in Central Asia. Other findings included:Beijing has expanded the reach of its media partnerships throughout the region, but are most attuned to two countries: India and KazakhstanChina is most comfortable and prolific in cultivating relationships with political elites. Inroads with ordinary citizens have been superficial at bestBeijing places a disproportionate emphasis on wooing two countries Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan with its exchange diplomacy in the form of sister cities and student scholarshipsMany interviewees welcomed China's investments in their economies, but cautionary tales of debt distress, allegations of corrupt practices and the overall opacity of backroom deals have stoked public debate and, in some cases, contributed to regime change," said Custer. "Meanwhile, a recurring theme was that Beijing's overtures towards foreign publics is complicated by perceived cultural and linguistic distance from China for many SCA publics."The researchers define public diplomacy as a collection of instruments used to influence the perceptions, preferences, and actions of citizens and leaders in another country, a means to win over foreign publics and advance its national interests. The new findings are contained in AidData's report "Silk Road Diplomacy: Deconstructing Beijing's toolkit to influence South and Central Asia," released today at an event in New Delhi.The AidData research was conducted in partnership with the Asia Society Policy Institute and the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and with the support of the U.S. Department of State. The report and its findings will be presented in New Delhi at a special event on Dec. 10 held with the Observer Research Foundation.AidData is a 30-person research lab at William and Mary that equips policymakers and practitioners with better data and evidence to improve how their sustainable development investments are targeted, monitored and evaluated. AidData uses rigorous methods, cutting-edge tools, and granular data to answer the question: Who is doing what, where, for whom, and to what effect? Its current and recent partners include USAID, the World Bank, the Hewlett Foundation, the Gates Foundation, the Cloudera Foundation, the Global Environmental Facility and Germany's Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development.AidData manages the most comprehensive and detailed source of project-level information on China's global development footprint ever assembled. China itself does not publish a project-level, country-by-country breakdown of its foreign aid program. Using an innovative open-source methodology, Tracking Underreported Financial Flows (TUFF), AidData does both. TUFF is a rigorous, replicable methodology that triangulates open-source information to systematically create project-level data detailing official finance originating from opaque donors and lenders.Load-Date: December 12, 2019End of Document

Video app TikTok unblocks teen who posted on China's MuslimsAssociated Press InternationalNovember 28, 2019 Thursday 6:49 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 324 wordsDateline: SAN FRANCISCO BodySAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Chinese-owned video app TikTok says it has unblocked a U.S. teenager and restored her viral video condemning China's treatment of its Muslim minority.The video was removed for 50 minutes Wednesday due to a "human moderation error," according to a statement from Eric Han, an American who heads TikTok's U.S. content-moderation team. The site's guidelines don't preclude the video's content, Han said.TikTok is popular with millions of U.S. teens and young adults but several U.S. senators have raised concerns about data collection and censorship on the site of content not in line with the Chinese government. The U.S. government has reportedly launched a national-security review of the site.The 40-second video, which news reports identified as the work of 17-year-old Feroza Aziz of New Jersey, starts off as an innocuous tutorial on how to get long eyelashes.It then segues into an appeal for viewers to inform themselves of plight of the Muslim minority in China. "This is another Holocaust, yet no one is talking about it," Aziz says.China is estimated to have detained up to 1 million minority Muslims Uighurs in prisonlike detention centers. China's government insists the detention sites are "vocational" centers aimed at training and skills development. It has sharply criticized Western countries that called for an end to mass arbitrary detentions and other abuses of Uighurs and other Muslims in the Xinjiang region.TikTok has said its data is not subject to Chinese law and that it does not remove content based on "sensitivities related to China."Han said Aziz was locked out of her account because of an earlier video she posted featured a photo of Osama bin-Laden, which violated polices against imagery related to terrorist figures.Aziz asked rhetorically on Twitter if she believed she was blocked after posting the video about Uighurs because of the unrelated earlier "satirical" video. "No," she said.Load-Date: November 29, 2019End of Document

Self-confessed Chinese spy spills secrets in AustraliaAssociated Press InternationalNovember 23, 2019 Saturday 10:19 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 742 wordsByline: By TRISTAN LAVALETTE, Associated PressDateline: PERTH, Australia BodyPERTH, Australia (AP) - A self-confessed Chinese spy has given Australia's counterespionage agency inside intelligence on how Beijing conducts its interference operations abroad and revealed the identities of China's senior military intelligence officers in Hong Kong, media reported.Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told reporters Saturday that the detailed accusations of China infiltrating and disrupting democratic systems in Australia, Hong Kong and Taiwan are "very disturbing."The Nine network newspapers reported that Chinese defector Wang "William" Liqiang told ASIO - the country's counterespionage agency - that he was involved in the kidnapping in 2015 of one of five Hong Kong booksellers suspected of selling dissident materials. The incident has been a reference point for protesters during the ongoing unrest in Hong Kong.He would be the first Chinese intelligence operative to blow his cover."I have personally been involved and participated in a series of espionage activities," Wang reportedly said in a sworn statement to ASIO in October.He revealed that he was part of a Hong Kong-based investment firm that was a front for the Chinese government to conduct political and economic espionage in Hong Kong, including infiltrating universities and directing harassment and cyberattacks against dissidents.Using a South Korean passport, Wang said he meddled in Taiwan's 2018 municipal elections and claimed there were plans to disrupt the democratic self-ruled island's presidential election in January.He said he helped funnel around 20 million yuan ($2.8 million) of campaign donations to Han Kuo-yu, mayor of the Taiwanese port city of Kaohsiung and a presidential candidate who has vowed to make peace with China.Han vehemently denied the allegations in a statement released by his campaign."Forget about 20 million yuan," Han said. "I would resign as Kaohsiung mayor if I had taken even 1 yuan from the Communist Party."Communist Party-ruled China claims Taiwan as its territory to be reunited by force if necessary.Wang said he faced detention and possible execution if he returned to China.He said he currently was living in Sydney with his wife and infant son on a tourist visa and had requested political asylum.Australia's Home Affairs Department told The Associated Press that it does not comment on individual cases."The purpose of protection visas is to safeguard people who cannot return to their home country due to a well-founded fear of persecution or risk of harm," a spokesperson said. "Each case is assessed on its merits."In Beijing, China's Foreign Ministry did not respond Saturday to a faxed request for comment on Wang.In Hong Kong, calls to the China Innovation Investment Limited office went unanswered Saturday. The company was identified by Wang as a front for Chinese intelligence operations in the city.According to its website, CIIL is an investment holding company incorporated in the Cayman Islands in February 2002 and listed on Hong Kong's stock exchange in August the same year. It has investments in several companies in Hong Kong and China that are involved in energy storage products, lightning products, energy saving and media terminals.Resource-rich Australia relies on China for one-third of its export earnings, but relations have been frosty for some time.The Australian government has been trying to neutralize China's influence by banning foreign political donations and all covert foreign interference in domestic politics."These are very disturbing reports," Frydenberg said. "The matter is now in the hands of the appropriate law enforcement agencies.""The government makes no apologies for the strong measures that we've taken to ensure that we have foreign interference laws in place," he added. "We will always stand up for our national interest whether it's on matters of foreign policy, foreign investments or other related issues."Former ASIO boss Duncan Lewis warned Friday that the Chinese government was seeking a "takeover" of Australia's political system.Prime Minister Scott Morrison dismissed such concerns, saying that national intelligence agencies were on top of any threats.Last week, Liberal Party members Sen. James Paterson and Rep. Andrew Hastie said they had been barred entry to China for a study trip because of their criticism of the Chinese government.___Associated Press writers Eileen Ng in Hong Kong and Yanan Wang in Beijing contributed to this report.Load-Date: November 24, 2019End of Document

Rubio Joins Blackburn, Scott, Cornyn, Cotton to Urge Response to National Security Threats Posed by Chinese DronesTargeted News ServiceDecember 18, 2019 Wednesday 5:17 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 839 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, issued the following news release:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) joined Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Rick Scott (R-FL), John Cornyn (R-TX) and Tom Cotton (R-AR) in writing to Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao and Administrator Stephen Dickson of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to express concerns regarding the national security threats posed by Chinese drones."We...urge you to immediately restrict the use of this equipment and technology that has the potential to jeopardize the security of critical information and infrastructure gained through this and other FAA programs," the Senators wrote. "American taxpayer dollars should not fund state-controlled or state-owned firms that seek to undermine American national security and economic competitiveness."The full text of the letter is below.Dear Secretary Chao and Administrator Dickson:We write to express concern regarding the national security threats posed by Chinese drones and urge the Department of Transportation (DOT) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to ensure that the use of such drones is excluded from its programs and partnerships.Given the information presented in several government directives regarding the use of Chinese-manufactured drones, we were dismayed to learn that on December 3, 2019, one of the ten lead participants of DOT and FAA's Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Integration Pilot Program (IPP) announced its decision to partner with Da Jiang Innovations (DJI) Inc., a Chinese drone company, and use DJI drones for aircraft inspections, delivery of aircraft parts, airport perimeter security, and various airport safety inspections.On August 2, 2017, the Department of the Army released a memorandum ordering a halt on the use of DJI applications and products, citing an "increased awareness of cyber vulnerabilities associated with DJI products." Subsequently, on August 9, 2017, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) released an unclassified bulletin which specifically warned against DJI for targeting critical infrastructure and law enforcement and providing U.S. data to the Chinese government. The bulletin states with "high confidence" that "the company [DJI] is selectively targeting government and privately owned entities within these sectors to expand its ability to collect and exploit sensitive U.S. data." The bulletin also warns that DJI-created apps, when used in conjunction with their UAS hardware, collect GPS locations and photographs taken by the device, register facial recognition data even when the system is off, and automatically upload information to cloud storage to which the Chinese government most likely has access. The bulletin continues, "[a] foreign government with access to this information could easily coordinate physical or cyber attacks against critical sites."On May 20, 2019, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued an industry alert of the potential risks to an organization's information posed by Chinese-made drones and DJI in particular. The alert states that the products "contain components that can compromise data and share information on a server accessed beyond the company itself."More recently, on October 30, 2019, the Department of Interior announced that it was grounding its fleet of more than 800 non-emergency drones purchased from China until a security review is completed. Further, Section 848 of the Fiscal Year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act specifically prohibits the Department of Defense from operating or procuring UAS manufactured in the China.We commend the goal of the UAS IPP to partner federal, state, local, and tribal governments with the FAA to evaluate and integrate new technologies into airspace operations. We, however, urge you to immediately restrict the use of this equipment and technology that has the potential to jeopardize the security of critical information and infrastructure gained through this and other FAA programs. American taxpayer dollars should not fund state-controlled or state-owned firms that seek to undermine American national security and economic competitiveness. We therefore request the following information:1. Have the DOT and FAA reviewed the reports by ICE, CISA, the Army, and any other agencies to appropriately grasp the magnitude of the threat posed by the use of DJI hardware and software, and if so, what conclusions were drawn?2. Have the DOT and FAA conveyed their concerns with regard to data protection to the relevant state, local, and tribal partners in the IPP and any other program that may involve the use of drones?3. What, if any, security efforts have the DOT and FAA worked to implement with state, local, and tribal officials to ensure critical infrastructure data does not fall into the hands of the Chinese government?Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to your prompt response.Copyright Targeted News ServicesTeamManager-6970585 TeamManagerLoad-Date: December 21, 2019End of Document

US criticizes China for abuses revealed by leaked cablesAssociated Press InternationalNovember 27, 2019 Wednesday 7:50 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: WASHINGTON DATELINELength: 856 wordsByline: By MATTHEW LEE, AP Diplomatic WriterDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Tuesday that a cache of leaked documents proves that Chinese authorities are engaged in massive and systemic repression of Muslims and other minorities in western China, as a number of foreign governments expressed serious concern about the scale of the campaign.Pompeo said the documents underscored "an overwhelming and growing body of evidence" that China's leaders are responsible for gross human rights violations in the Xinjiang region."They detail the Chinese party's brutal detention and systematic repression of Uighurs and members of other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang," Pompeo told reporters at a State Department news conference. "We call on the Chinese government to immediately release all those who are arbitrarily detained and to end its draconian policies that have terrorized its own citizens in Xinjiang."Pompeo's comments come at a delicate time in U.S.-Chinese relations amid ongoing negotiations to end a trade war and U.S. concerns about the situation in Hong Kong, where pro-democracy protests have turned violent with clashes between police and demonstrators. Notably, his criticism was not accompanied by a warning about possible sanctions for the mass detentions, although U.S. lawmakers are pressing for penalties to be imposed."There are very significant human rights abuses," Pompeo said. "It shows that it's not random. It is intentional and it is ongoing."The leaked classified documents were provided to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which worked with The Associated Press and news organizations around the world to publish the material.The documents, which include guidelines for operating detention centers and instructions for how to use technology to target people, reveal that the camps in Xinjiang are not for voluntary job training, as Beijing has claimed.They show the camps are used for forced ideological and behavioral re-education. They also illustrate how Beijing uses a high-tech surveillance system to target people for detention and to predict who will commit a crime.Voluntary job training is the reason the Chinese government has given for detaining more than a million ethnic minorities, most of them Muslim. But a classified blueprint leaked to the news organizations shows the camps are instead precisely what former detainees have described: forced ideological and behavioral re-education centers run in secret.The documents lay out the Chinese government's deliberate strategy to lock up ethnic minorities even before they commit a crime, and to rewire their thoughts and the language they speak.The papers also show how Beijing is pioneering a new form of social control using data and artificial intelligence. Drawing on data collected by mass surveillance technology, computers issued the names of tens of thousands of people for interrogation or detention in just one week.Pompeo said the documents should encourage other countries to come forward with their concerns.U.S. allies were among the first to step up."We have serious concerns about the human rights situation in Xinjiang and the Chinese government's escalating crackdown, in particular the extra-judicial detention of over a million Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities," a British Foreign Office spokesperson said. "We want to see an end to the indiscriminate and disproportionate restrictions on the cultural and religious freedoms of Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang."German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told the German China-Cables team that "if indeed hundreds of thousands of Uighurs are being detained in camps, then the international community cannot close their eyes."In Brussels, the European Commission said it was calling on China "to uphold its international and international obligations and to respect human rights including when it comes to the rights of persons belonging to minorities especially in Xinjiang but also in Tibet and we will continue to affirm those positions in this context in particular."Japan's foreign ministry said it believed "freedom, respect for fundamental human rights and the rule of law, which are the universal value in the international community, are guaranteed in China as well."Meanwhile, there were indications that China was moving to destroy documentary evidence of abuses.A man now living in exile said a Uighur cadre he knew had reached out to him in October. The cadre, who manages paperwork at a community-level office in southern Xinjiang, said that recently the government had ordered all papers to be burned and destroyed."All the shelves are totally empty," his friend said. The man declined to be identified out of fear of retribution to him or his family.The man said papers stored in such offices are forms filled in by government workers monitoring everyone in the community, containing sensitive personal information such as marriage status, residence registration and whether they are detained. Information from the forms are inputted into a database in a separate room in the office, while the forms themselves are stored on shelves.Load-Date: November 28, 2019End of Document

PHILIPPINES AUTHORITIES ARREST HUNDREDS OF CHINESE LINKED TO ONLINE SCAMStates News ServiceDecember 20, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 526 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Philippine authorities arrested more than 300 Chinese nationals suspected of involvement in an online investment scam and working without permits, the latest in a series of large-scale roundups this year of foreign workers mostly from China, immigration officials said Friday.The raid in suburban Quezon City on Thursday night netted 342 Chinese citizens, the largest number of Chinese arrested at one time as part of a nationwide crackdown on undocumented foreign workers, the Bureau of Immigration said.In a news release, Bureau of Immigration (BI) Commissioner Jaime Morente said the Chinese were caught at Global Trade Center Building while working without visas and proper permits from the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp."This is another massive arrest by our Intelligence Division, in coordination with the Quezon City Police District-National Capital Region Police Office. This could not have been possible without their help," he said.Fortunato Manahan Jr., the bureau's intelligence chief, said the company used several different names."We had reason to suspect that the company is a front for illegal cyber activities and investment scams," Manahan said."We coordinated this operation with the Chinese government, which confirmed the company's involvement in illegal activities, victimizing mostly their compatriots in China," he said.Immigration officers recovered thousands of mobile phones being used for online and phone scamming, according to Manahan.In addition, the Chinese government "reportedly cancelled the passports of those involved, making them undocumented aliens and tagging them as fugitives," the news release said.September, October arrestsPreviously, Philippine authorities deported 312 Chinese nationals in November who were among 512 foreigners arrested in October in the Manila suburb of Pasay city on suspicion of being involved in a similar online investment scam targeting people in China. Others arrested were from Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Taiwan and Vietnam.In September, officials arrested 277 Chinese nationals in metro Manila's Pasig city over a similar online scam after receiving a tip from the Chinese Embassy, according to Morente. The next week, authorities arrested 324 in Palawan province.Nearly 200,000 Chinese nationals are working in the country, mostly employed by Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs) and other online casinos catering to Chinese nationals, businesses that are prohibited in Beijing, according to government records.The influx of Chinese nationals into the Philippines has led to calls from nationalist groups to ban the activity, saying the presence of Chinese workers here was causing social problems along with soaring rental rates for office and commercial properties.Earlier, Duterte's defense chief, Delfin Lorenzana, expressed alarm over the influx of Chinese workers. He suggested casinos known to employ Chinese citizens could be used as a cover by Beijing to spy on Philippine military and security installations near the gaming businesses.Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Load-Date: December 20, 2019End of Document

Report: U.S. taxpayer-funded research has fueled China's riseThe Blade (Toledo, Ohio)November 18, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 The BladeDistributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWSLength: 971 wordsByline: Liz Skalka, The Blade, Toledo, OhioBodyNov. 18--     Nov. 18--Americans have unwittingly fueled China's global rise by funding U.S.-based researchers who turn over their knowledge and intellectual capital to China through a sophisticated talent recruitment program, a new report shows.The report, commissioned by a Senate committee headed by Sens. Rob Portman (R., Ohio) and Tom Carper (D., Del.), reveals that federal grant-making agencies have failed to prevent the flow of information overseas, while the FBI also has been slow to address the threat posed by China's efforts."These failures continue to undermine the integrity of the American research enterprise and endanger our national security," concludes the report by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations that will be the subject of a Senate hearing Tuesday.Summing up China's program, a Senate investigator said: "These aren't just Chinese versions of the Rhodes Scholarship or the Fulbright scholarship."Based on its findings, the committee determined the federal government has failed to stop China from acquiring American intellectual property and using research grants to enrich its own technology and research sectors.While China has more than 200 talent recruitment programs, the committee looked at China's "Thousand Talents Plan," described by Senate investigators as the nation's largest and most advanced recruitment effort. While other nations employ talent recruitment programs, investigators said the scale and financing of China's program sets it apart, and is part of a greater effort by Chinese leaders to build up their intellectual capital and transition away from a manufacturing economy.Through legally binding contracts incorporating non-disclosure agreements, participants were incentivized to lie on U.S. grant applications, create "shadow labs" overseas, and transfer American intellectual property to Chinese universities and research institutions -- actions that investigators described as unethical, verging on illegal.In one instance described in the report, a researcher at the U.S. Department of Energy's National Laboratories who also was a Chinese talent recruit removed 30,000 electronic files before returning to China. Another recruit stole information about jet engines used by the U.S. military. At the National Institutes of Health, officials were unaware that a medical researcher was spending six months a year in China.The report cites several federal agencies: the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and the Energy and Commerce departments, which offer billions to foreign nationals to conduct pioneering research in the U.S. In many instances, it determined the agencies lacked the proper oversight to monitor how grant money was being used.It also found the State Department, the agency responsible for processing visa applications, does not track ties to foreign talent recruitment programs."This report reveals that American taxpayers have been unwittingly funding the rise of China's economy and military over the last two decades by detailing not only the lengths and expense China has gone to in order to steal American intellectual property, but also the shocking fact that our own federal agencies have done little to stop their actions despite being aware of China's talent plans," Mr. Portman said in a statement.The NSF said it recently issued a policy stating its workforce may not participate in talent recruitment by foreign governments, and will soon clarify its policy for researchers to disclose foreign and domestic support.Following the report's release, investigators could not say if any Ohio universities are under probe, but they hope to make them aware of the issue after several related cases gained widespread attention.In Toledo, a solar-panel company founded by a UT physics professor was accused of taking millions in state and federal funds while secretly plotting to move its operations to China, where it now does business after declaring bankruptcy in the U.S.Earlier this year, a University of Kansas researcher receiving federal grant money was indicted on federal charges for hiding that he also was working full time for a Chinese university. The researcher, Feng "Franklin" Tao, has denied the charges, saying a fellow researcher was seeking to capitalize on U.S. fears of Chinese espionage. In the wake of similar investigations, Chinese researchers have raised concerns about profiling and harassment.China's program offered participants money and other incentives, and in some cases required them to recruit other members. At the time of its launch in 2008, the Chinese government set out to recruit 2,000 researchers and scientists in a decade; one report indicated the program had far exceeded its target, recruiting 7,000 people as of 2017.But in the wake of FBI and Senate scrutiny, investigators said the Chinese government has taken down a list of scientists participating in the program and have removed references to it online.With Mr. Portman as chairman, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations also has conducted research into the role the U.S. mail system plays in shipping fentanyl from China and the "Confucius Institutes" set up at universities across the country, including at UT.Mr. Portman, the top trade official under President George W. Bush, routinely has expressed his concern about Chinese trade practices and intellectual property theft, an issue with bipartisan consensus in Congress."These talent plans are a win-win for China," Mr. Portman said.

House passes Uighur human rights bill to sanction Chinese officialsStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeDecember 4, 2019 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 608 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBodyUnited States diplomats might soon be barred from entering Xinjiang, where more than 1 million Uighurs and other Muslim minorities are believed to be detained in internment camps."We urge the USA to immediately correct its mistake, to stop the above bill on Xinjiang from becoming law, to stop using Xinjiang as a way to interfere in China's domestic affairs", said the statement, attributed to the ministry's spokeswoman, Hua Chunying.The bill notably urges Trump to slap sanctions on Chinese officials behind the Uighur policy, including Chen Quanguo, the Communist Party chief for Xinjiang. It must still pass the U.S. Senate and then be sent to the White House for President Donald Trump to sign into law, or veto.It calls on President Trump to condemn the abuses against Muslims and call for the closure of mass detention camps in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, according to Reuters.China will respond further depending on the development of the situation, the statement said.Earlier on Monday, Beijing slapped punitive measures on Washington in retaliation for the latter's backing of the widespread ongoing protests in Hong Kong, announcing sanctions on NGOs and suspending visits by USA warships and aircraft.Among other provisions, the bill requires the president to submit to Congress within 120 days a list of senior Chinese government officials guilty of human rights abuses against Uighurs in Xianjiang or elsewhere in China.Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called China's treatment of the Uighurs "an outrage to the collective conscience of the world", adding that "America is watching".Mr Mendendez, the top Democrat on the foreign relations committee, said it was "recognition that the USA government can not afford to stand idly by as millions of Uyghur Muslims continue to be unjustly imprisoned, subjected to a mass surveillance state, and forced into labour camps by an autocratic regime". Classified documents, leaked to a consortium of news organizations, lay out the Chinese government's deliberate strategy to lock up ethnic minorities to rewire their thoughts and even the language they speak.Zuckerberg defends ad policyRequested if Trump tried to foyer him about Fb's insurance policies by host Gayle King , Zuckerberg stated "No". Similar fears have played out in the United Kingdom ahead of its general election this month.The vote is sure to draw China's ire.China has denied mistreatment at the camps, which Beijing says provide vocational training to help eliminate religious extremism and teach new skills to people of the region.It would also effectively ban the export to China of items that can be used for surveillance of individuals, including facial and voice-recognition technology.In an extensive talk in London, he said that Chinese officials wanted to reach an agreement, but "we will see if the agreement will be correct or not, it has to be correct".Thomas Massie, the sole member of Congress to vote against both the Hong Kong and Uighur bills, said he did so because he considered the issues to be Chinese domestic affairs."The Chinese Government and Communist Party is working to systematically wipe out the ethnic and cultural identities of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang", said Sen.It was the latest example in a number of overwhelmingly bipartisan congressional actions aimed at intensifying pressure on China over everything from its human rights abuses in Xinjiang to its stance on the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong."Each and every speech on the House floor tonight was a forceful indictment of crimes against humanity", said UHRP executive director Omer Kanat.Load-Date: December 4, 2019End of Document

CONGRESSMAN DENVER RIGGLEMAN DENOUNCES CORRUPT PRACTICES BY CHINESE BUSINESS AND STANDS UP FOR AMERICAN CONSUMERSStates News ServiceNovember 15, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 940 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of Virginia Rep. Denver Riggleman:Congressman Denver Riggleman delivered an address on the House floor this morning that sent a strong message of disapproval to China and one of support to American consumers. Congressman Riggleman offered a motion to recommit on H.R. 4863, the United States Export Finance Agency Act of 2019. H.R.4863 is a reauthorization of the Export Finance Agency, the official export credit agency of the United States. The agency helps facilitate international trade for United States companies. The bill in its current form does nothing to address Chinese threats and allows Chinese state-owned businesses to benefit from American financing, putting our national security at risk."The question is do we, as Americans, as members of Congress that have sworn an oath to protect this country, allow EXIM to finance Chinese government-controlled entities that are building military installations in the South China Sea?" asked Congressman Riggleman. "Installations which one day may threaten the lives of U.S. servicemembers. Do we allow EXIM to support Chinese companies that support Beijing's brutal repression of religious minorities in western China, or the surveillance of freedom-loving protesters in Hong Kong?"The motion to recommit would have sent the bill back to the House Financial Services Committee instead of allowing a House of Representatives vote. You can watch the Congressman's speech here, and a transcript of the speech can be found below.I offer this MTR for a very simple reason, China is a problem, China is major human rights violator, China is responsible for unprecedented amounts of personal data and intellectual property theft, and China's military seeks to extend its reach throughout the world. [Staff1] Based on my experience in DoD and the intelligence communities, I can personally attest to the multitude of threats China poses! If my colleagues across the aisle believe that part of a healthy Ex-Im Bank is ignoring the issues China presents, then go ahead and vote against this MTR and guarantee uncertainty for a long term Ex-Im reauthorization.But, if like me, you understand and care about what happens to freedom and democracy around the world, and if you care about human rights around the world, and you want to see the Bank reauthorized with a purpose, then please join me in in supporting this MTR that imposes necessary and just requirements for entities wishing to do business with Chinese State Owned Enterprises.I want to share a quote from our Speaker of the House on China. When speaking to a group of survivors at the 30 year anniversary of Tiananmen Square Speaker Pelosi said, and I quote, "We cannot allow economic interests with China to blind us to the moral injustices committed by China." Well said Madame Speaker, I couldn't agree more. I would also like to add, that missing from that quote, is that we should not allow economic interests with China to blind us to threats of national security.In that same vein, earlier this week the Financial Services Committee held a hearing focused on Multilateral Development Banks. My colleague Mr. Sherman, who is the Chair of the Asia Subcommittee on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, attended that hearing and spoke eloquently and forcefully, arguing and I quote, "As long as China benefits one penny from this institution, it is an attack on the national security of the United States."Well, if Mr. Sherman is alarmed by World Bank loans benefitting small-scale farmers in China, surely he and his colleagues don't want Ex-Im assistance supporting China's largest semiconductor manufacturer, China's major technology providers such as Huawei, or China's Export-Import Banks, or their state-owned shipping group that is taking over ports in Europe, South America, and other parts of the world as we speak.The questions we face today are not partisan. The question is do we, as Americans, as members of Congress that have sworn an oath to protect this country, allow Ex-Im to finance Chinese government-controlled entities that are building military installations in the South China Sea? Installations which one day may threaten the lives of U.S. servicemembers. Do we allow Ex-Im to support Chinese companies that support Beijing's brutal repression of religious minorities in western China, or the surveillance of freedom-loving protesters in Hong Kong?I use these examples to make the point that we are united in this body, and we should be. Its easy, its simple, and its good for America and American businesses and good for the millions of oppressed people in China that we pass this MTR.To make this amendment even easier to implement, it does not mandate any particular bureaucratic procedures for Ex-Im. My amendment achieves the same objective of the original bipartisan Waters McHenry agreement but provides more flexibility so that Ex-Im can remain nimble.In closing I would say to all my colleagues who claim to be interested in helping American workers and American businesses, Pass the USMCA! Pass an Ex -Im reauthorization that is tough on China and also good for American workers, these things are not mutually exclusive! To borrow the phrase so many of my colleagues like to use, "We can walk and chew gum at the same time". And we can do it easily, today, with bipartisan support. And if the People's House does the People's business then the Senate will take those measures up, and the President will sign them into law, and your constituents will thank you for it!I urge all of my colleagues to join me, thank you and I yield back my time.###Load-Date: November 15, 2019End of Document

China say self-confessed spy seeking asylum is fraudsterAssociated Press InternationalNovember 24, 2019 Sunday 3:51 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 600 wordsByline: By TRISTAN LAVALETTE, Associated PressDateline: PERTH, Australia BodyPERTH, Australia (AP) - China refuted the explosive claims of a self-confessed spy seeking asylum in Australia, saying Sunday he is a convicted fraudster wanted by Shanghai police.The Nine Network newspapers reported that Chinese defector Wang "William" Liqiang has given Australia's counterespionage agency inside intelligence on how Beijing conducts its interference operations abroad and revealed the identities of China's senior military intelligence officers in Hong Kong.Wang claimed he was involved in the kidnapping in 2015 of one of five Hong Kong booksellers suspected of selling dissident materials. The incident has been a reference point for protesters during the ongoing unrest in Hong Kong.He said he currently was living in Sydney with his wife and infant son on a tourist visa and had requested political asylum.The Chinese Embassy on Sunday hit back at Wang and referenced a statement from Shanghai police, which said Wang was sentenced in Fujian province in October 2016 to one year and three months in prison for fraud with a suspended sentence of 1 ½ year.It said he was wanted in relation to a fraud case from earlier this year."On April 19, 2019, the Shanghai police opened an investigation into Wang who allegedly cheated 4.6 million yuan from a person surnamed Shu through a fake investment project involving car import in February," the statement said.The embassy said Wang left for Hong Kong on April 10 carrying a fake Chinese passport and a fake Hong Kong permanent resident ID.It said the Shanghai police were investigating the matter.Wang would be the first Chinese intelligence operative to blow his cover. He told Nine Network he faced detention and possible execution if he returned to China.Wang claimed he was part of a Hong Kong-based investment firm that was a front for the Chinese government to conduct political and economic espionage in Hong Kong, including infiltrating universities and directing harassment and cyberattacks against dissidents.Using a South Korean passport, Wang said he meddled in Taiwan's 2018 municipal elections and claimed there were plans to disrupt the democratic self-ruled island's presidential election in January.Resource-rich Australia relies on China for one-third of its export earnings, but relations have been frosty for some time.The Australian government has been trying to neutralize China's influence by banning foreign political donations and all covert foreign interference in domestic politics.Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told reporters Saturday that Wang's claims were "very disturbing.""The matter is now in the hands of the appropriate law enforcement agencies," he said. "The government makes no apologies for the strong measures that we've taken to ensure that we have foreign interference laws in place.He added, "We will always stand up for our national interest whether it's on matters of foreign policy, foreign investments or other related issues."Former ASIO boss Duncan Lewis warned Friday that the Chinese government was seeking a "takeover" of Australia's political system.Prime Minister Scott Morrison dismissed such concerns, saying that national intelligence agencies were on top of any threats.Last week, Liberal Party members Sen. James Paterson and Rep. Andrew Hastie said they had been barred entry to China for a study trip because of their criticism of the Chinese government.Hastie told Nine Network on Sunday that Wang should be protected by the Australian government. "I'm of the view that anyone who's willing to assist us in defending our sovereignty deserves our protection," he said.Load-Date: November 24, 2019End of Document

The new rules went into effect on December 1. China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), which is the state agency responsible for internet and technology regulation, wrote that the decision was part of its moves to "safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of citizens in the cyberspace" and prevent fraud, according to Quartz.Recent reports indicate that China has around 854 million internet users. The new legislation will also ban residents from transferring their mobile numbers to other people. According to Quartz, China appears to be the first country to require facial ID to sign up for mobile and internet services. The new legislation is part of China's wider efforts to keep close tabs on its citizens and monitor their activities and behaviors. Thomas Peter/ReutersLast month Chinese state media announced the development of a new "super camera," and artificial intelligence-driven 500-megapixel camera capable of identifying individual faces in crowds of tens of thousands of people in "perfect detail." State media said the device, which is five times more powerful than the human eye, could have "military, national defence and public security applications."China last year also said it developed a new surveillance camera which could identify users based on their walking style and silhouette. The "gait recognition" technology has reportedly already been rolled out in several Chinese cities, including Beijing and Shanghai.Read more: China has started ranking citizens with a creepy 'social credit' system - here's what you can do wrong, and the embarrassing, demeaning ways they can punish youChinese censorship and monitoring has soared under Chinese President Xi Jinping, and thousands of new censorship and surveillance initiatives have been issued every year. In 2014, the Xi's government announced plans for its "social credit system," a vast, mandatory ranking system of all of its 1.4 billion citizens. According to China, the ranking system seeks to reinforce the notion that "keeping trust is glorious and breaking trust is disgraceful."The plan, which has already been implemented in some cities, will be fully implemented in 2020. Blocking the sidewalk, jaywalking, fare evasion, and even loitering can lower your social credit score.            Punishments for maintaining a low social credit score include being banned from taking trains, having your internet speed cut, and being publicly shamed.NOW WATCH: Extremists turned a frog meme into a hate symbol, but Hong Kong protesters revived it as an emblem of hopeSee Also:• Rudy Giuliani was angling for a 6-figure business deal with a corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor while pushing him to get political dirt on the Bidens• Americans would rather talk about literally almost anything else than Trump this Thanksgiving, and the numbers prove it• The US is losing its crown to China as the world's biggest diplomatic power, think tank saysSEE ALSO: China's 'Great Firewall' is taller than ever under 'president-for-life' Xi JinpingLoad-Date: December 2, 2019End of Document

Rep. McHenry: House Democrats Vote to Prop Up Chinese Communist Party With Taxpayer-Backed FinancingTargeted News ServiceNovember 15, 2019 Friday 8:42 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 772 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Patrick McHenry, R-North Carolina, ranking Republican member of the House Financial Services Committee, issued the following news release:Today, Republicans and Democrats made clear that there is bipartisan opposition to H.R. 4863, the "U.S. Export Finance Agency Act." The bill, introduced by Chairwoman Maxine Waters (CA-43), stripped all Republican provisions from a previously bipartisan compromise between the Chairwoman and Ranking Republican Patrick McHenry (NC-10). Most importantly, these provisions would have limited the Export-Import (Ex-Im) Bank's taxpayer-backed subsidies to businesses owned by the Chinese Communist Party that are acting contrary to our national interest.Instead of taking meaningful action to combat the generational threat of China, Democrats' partisan bill also weakened support for small businesses by delaying a rise in Ex-Im's small business mandate, removed tough debarment penalties to address fraud and corruption at Ex-Im, and gutted reforms requiring Ex-Im to prove heavy users of the Bank need Ex-Im as a lender of last resort as well as prove that financing for those users does not help foreign entities at the expense of U.S. jobs.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made clear this bill will not be considered in the Senate and the President issued a veto threat. There is a path to a bipartisan, long term reauthorization of the Bank--Democrats just need to say yes. Republicans filed a discharge petition on November 14th to ensure the Bank remains fully operational and can continue to strengthen the competitiveness of the U.S.Watch highlights from the floor debate on this partisan bill here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r-qb6FvP_g)Ranking Member McHenry on Democrats' unnecessary partisanship: "The bill we're debating today encapsulates so much of what is wrong in Congress today. This is a partisan bill to reauthorize what a bipartisan group support and it's a failure of legislating. That's why we have a partisan bill on the House Floor to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank."McHenry on Democrats' unwillingness to combat the generational threat of China: "Earlier this year, Chairwoman Waters and I joined together to introduce a bipartisan Ex-Im reauthorization bill, H.R. 3407. It included sensible reforms for Ex-Im that both parties could support. ...in that bill we took on the generational challenge that is incumbent upon us as American policy makers to be sensible to, which is the threat and aggression of China. Both the economic and military aggressiveness of that regime. The bill that we negotiated would have served as the most comprehensive and the longest extension in authorization of the Ex-Im Bank, and it had a chance to get the President's signature and actually be legislated in the Senate. Sadly, the Democrats walked away from that agreement because it limited Ex-Im subsidies to some businesses owned by the Chinese Communist Party. The Democrat Majority stripped out all the reforms we'd agreed to."McHenry on combatting Chinese aggression through the Ex-Im Bank: "As we all know, Beijing poses a strategic threat to our national interest through its economic and military aggression. We know about the Chinese government's shocking abuse of human rights, we see this in Hong Kong in the suppression of freedom there. We know the Chinese government's true motives for the Belt &#38; Road Initiative and the Made in China 2025 Initiative, and that's to extend China's global dominance. They're not a strategic ally, they're a threat. And if we are savvy to this, we'll ensure that we don't take an important tool of our government and subsidize Beijing. If we want to counter Beijing's ambitions, we shouldn't use Ex-Im to provide cheap financing for the Chinese Communist Party."McHenry on Democrats' weak attempt to address China through the restatement of current practices: "The Democrats put in this bill meaningless language for political cover rather than to do something right and real for the U.S. economy. ... The Democrat bill would do nothing to stop Ex-Im from financing government-controlled companies that are acting contrary to our national interest, but which may not happen to be on this entity list at the Commerce Department. Take Huawei, for example, which Ex-Im had authorized transactions for before the company was put on the entity list in May. Under the Democrats' bill, Ex-Im subsidies for Huawei were perfectly fine in April, but in May were unacceptable, that's ridiculous and it's bad policy for the American taxpayer to subsidize Chinese aggression."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6930449 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 19, 2019End of Document

Continue reading WeChat keeps banning Chinese Americans for talking about Hong KongProtesters gather outside Hong Kong Polytechnic University on November 25 | Photo by Chris McGrath/Getty ImagesPro-democracy candidates won a landslide victory in Hong Kong yesterday, but many Chinese Americans have been unable to express their approval online. WeChat, a popular social media messaging app, has been censoring political messages and disabling people's accounts if they voice their support for the movement   even if they're in the United States.Bin Xie, an information security analyst at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, wrote  The pro-China candidates totally lost  in a WeChat group before having his account shut down.Xie is now part of a WhatsApp group for Chinese Americans who've recently been censored on WeChat. He joined the group to talk about what is happening and discuss what can be done to make it stop.  If you have censorship in China   fine,  he toldThe Verge.  But in this country? I'm a Republican but on WeChat I suffer the same as Democrats [using WeChat]  we are all censored.  Once the veil has lifted and people realize the protestors aren't all violent terrorists, the whole thing crumbles. WeChat is owned by China's Tencent and widely used within the country. Research by Citizen Lab suggests the company has implemented a dual system, with heavy censorship for Chinese users and less restrictive rules for foreigners. But it is easy for Chinese American users to fall onto the censored side of the system, particularly if their account has been previously linked to a Chinese phone number. (Tencent did not respond to a request for comment.)In recent months, China's online censorship practices have had remarkable power over Western companies, as prominent figures in the US speak out about the treatment of protestors in Hong Kong. In just the past six months, the Communist Party in China has forced an NBA general manager to apologize for a pro-Hong Kong tweet, gottenHearthstoneplayer Ng  Blitzchung  Wai Chung suspended, and pressured Apple into taking down an app used by protestors. Part of the problem the [Communist] Party finds itself in is that the disinformation its spread to people in China is so wildly inaccurate that there's very little middle ground,  says Sarah Cook, a senior research analyst at Freedom House.  Once the veil has lifted and people realize the protestors aren't all violent terrorists, the whole thing crumbles. The Communist Party has painted itself into a corner when it comes to conversations about Hong Kong, even on the outside. In China, WeChat is used as a messaging app, a social media platform, a news outlet, and a payment platform. It's owned by China's largest tech company, Tencent, and claims to have 1 billion daily active users.  WeChat is like this super app in China,  explained Cook.  When someone's personal WeChat account gets disabled, people find that it affects their daily life. Losing an account in this way is relatively common in China. The country's draconian internet laws allow the government to access user data and censor content on social media platforms at will. Yet the app is so integrated into daily life that it's almost impossible to stop using.For Americans who have family or friends in China, the app has become a critical way to stay in touch since the country blocks Facebook and Twitter. Yet it's also proved problematic as people try to talk about politics   a term that has a loose meaning for people in China.  The red lines are constantly shifting,  Cook says.  It's political, religious, social, and economic content. Even information about public health. Things that used to be on the safe side of the red line are no longer safe. Another WeChat user who lives in Minnesota says he posts political content that appears to support the Chinese government, but he codes his messages in such a way that his readers know he's been ironic.  Chinese people know what I'm writing,  he says.  It superficially looks like I'm supporting, but the tone shows I am not.  Even though I'm an American, I'm monitored. And even though he is part of Xie's WhatsApp group, he says he avoids talking about some politically sensitive topics to keep his family in China safe and ensure he's still able to visit.  I can't speak freely like I used to,  he says.  I still have to go back and visit my family, and I see the consequences of speaking out. George Shen, a WeChat user in Boston who works at IBM, started a White House petition asking Congress to stop Tencent from censoring people in the United States.  Tencent, with operations in the U.S., has been systematically engaging in censoring public opinions, suppressing dissidents, violating free speech rights of American citizens and hindering American democracy,  he wrote.Congress didn't respond to Shen's petition, but he's continued to lobby politicians like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) who've recently spoken out against China censoring content on the video-sharing app TikTok. His hope is that lawmakers will impose sanctions on Tencent if it does not agree to follow the First Amendment and allow Chinese Americans to discuss politics on the app.The WeChat user in Minnesota says he's surprised Congress still hasn't acted.  I came to the US for freedom and democracy,  he adds.  But over the last few years, I feel that even though I'm an American, I'm monitored. I can't speak freely like I used to, even though I live in the US. Tags:See Campaign:https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/25/20976964/chinese-americans-censorship-wechat-hong-kong-elections-tiktokContact Information:Zoe SchifferTags:,           Artificial Intelligence Newswire,           Wire,           United States,           EnglishLoad-Date: December 13, 2019End of Document

Huobi Releases Details from the Hainan Free Trade Port International Cooperation Forum on Digital Economy and BlockchainPR NewswireDecember 9, 2019 Monday 9:00 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1064 wordsDateline: HAIKOU, China, Dec. 9, 2019 BodyPR NewswireAs a founding co-organizer of the Hainan Free Trade Zone & Global Digital Economic Forum, Huobi Group today shared key takeaways from the forum which commenced on the morning of December 5th. During the forum, notable Chinese government officials gave opening speeches commenting on the development of blockchain in mainland China. Prominent government officials expanded on details of Hainan and Greater China as a whole. Sun Shiwen, Deputy Secretary of People's People Government of Hainan Province gave the opening address. Sun said to speed up the development of the blockchain industry, Hainan would accelerate the construction of a free trade area, which would promote the integration of the real and digital economy.Later in the morning,Ministerial Panel: International Exchange and Cooperation in Digital Economyoccurred with the participation of representatives from Russia, Kazakhstan, Bahrain, Indonesia and Gibraltar. The guests included ministerial level officials from Belt and Road Initiative partner countries, who were VIP guests invited to the forum to explore possible synergies of their nation's blockchain initiatives with those of the Chinese government. The first questions concerned the initiatives and stances of the panelist's governments towards blockchain. Present were Albert Isolas, Gibraltarian Minister for Digital and Financial Services, who said "Gibraltar was the first county to issue regulation on blockchain, with Huobi becoming one of the first companies to licenses under our regulatory framework." While Saparudin, Executive Governor of Bangka, Special Economic Zone of Indonesia, said his government has launched many projects to promote the development of blockchain, which included three special development zones.After the panel, Leon Li, founder of Huobi Group gave a speech titled "Building a Global Financial Infrastructure with Blockchain and Digital Finance". In his remarks on the global financial landscape, Leon said blockchain and digital currency would become the supporting technologies for a new generation of global financial infrastructure. Leon predicted that financial intermediaries in digital payments would increasingly be sidestepped, as blockchain allowed high efficiency and low-cost transactions between users. According to Leon, "blockchain has advantages in cost and efficiency, which would be valuable for developing nations." Leon expects countries increase their regulatory cooperation to promote a global regulatory framework.How Huobi's technology could play a major part in the collaboration was highlighted when Leon gave suggestions to improve global financial security in a speech about financial infrastructure. Leon said recent announcements regarding characteristics of Huobi Chain could provide invaluable to partner nations in building their financial infrastructure. In describing Huobi Chain as open source, autonomous and customized for financial applications, Leon said "the public chain could enable partner organizations and countries to set up their own chains and nodes".On the 6th, a major portion of the forum was dedicated to Hainan's role in the blockchain ecosystem. Cao Shiping, Chief Engineer of Department of Industry and Informatization of Hainan Province provided valuable insights on local initiatives regarding blockchain. In particular, Hainan is currently home to over 100 blockchain enterprises, including Huobi. Cao said blockchain will have a vital role in the Hainan Free Trade Zone, which will implement new port policies in February 2020, which include revamped tax policies. Cao said "the government of Hainan's policies promote the application and research of various channels within the blockchain industry, including depositary receipts and digital assets." Special policies in the Hainan free trade zone will allow a freer flow of goods, personnel, capital and logistics, thus giving economic benefit to local companies participating in the digital economy.Shan Zhiguang, Director of Ministry of Information Technology and Industrial Development in China's State Information Center (SIC) made a keynote speech about BSN, which Huobi recently joined. Shan said BSN could be national information infrastructure for Chinese enterprises, but still could be deployed globally at a low cost.One major highlight of the forum was the launch of the BSN Developer Competition, which Huobi China will organize alongside China Mobile and UnionPay. The BSN developer competition will propagate blockchain knowledge and cultivate qualified developers of BSN, thus providing development, innovation and entrepreneurship opportunities. It is hoped with BSN architecture, the developer competition, which will be held four times per year with each competition lasting three months will provide infrastructure solutions required to develop smart cities and digital economies.About BSNBlockchain Service Network (BSN), China's first blockchain alliance seeks to support small and medium-sized companies to develop blockchain-based solutions. As a trans-regional public infrastructure network, the BSN was jointly launched by the State Information Center (SIC) with other institutions joining on. The network aims to reduce the technical and economic threshold for the application of blockchain. BSN will nurture a new industries and business models based on blockchain technology.

TikTok stars can earn considerable amounts of money through the platform when their followers purchase virtual gift emojis priced upwards of $50 to send to their favorite streamers, who can then turn those emojis back into cash. Children are vulnerable to being solicited to buy and send emojis in exchange for favors, such as live video chats and giving out personal phone numbers, without parental permission. This has become a disturbingly popular trend.TikTok's policies allow for the sharing of data with any of ByteDance's business partners. This includes advertising networks, outside service providers, and any subsequent sharing that these third parties choose to engage in, regardless of whether it corresponds with TikTok's policies. Although TikTok has created a version of the app geared for children under 13, it still fails to protect them or older teenagers from data surveillance and predatory behavior.American parents are woefully unaware of the extent to which their children are being exposed to invasive data collection practices while using TikTok. Despite widespread calls for greater transparency, TikTok does not disclose the age demographics of its user base. According to an October 2019 Forbes report, 41 percent of active users in the U.S. are between the ages of 16 and 24, making TikTok one of the most dominant ways to target young users. TikTok masterfully deploys advanced technological tools such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and facial recognition in order to increase time spent on its platform and capture the attention of American youth.TikTok's age ratings, data collection policies, and safety practices fail to adequately warn parents and vulnerable young people of the material they will encounter. Earlier this year, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reached a $5.7 million settlement with TikTok's predecessor Musical.ly over claims that it illegally gathered personal information from children, the largest civil penalty ever obtained by the FTC in a children's privacy case. TikTok's record of violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and refusal to delete videos and other data even after requested by parents reveals that TikTok does not properly protect children in the social media age.It is crucial that Chinese-linked efforts to collect data from American children ends. Because TikTok is owned by ByteDance, the app is subject to foreign laws that allow China's government to seize its information and technology. In light of these concerns, I would like to know what TikTok is doing to protect children's privacy on its platform and the steps it has taken to safeguard minors from unauthorized data collection and deceptive marketing schemes. Please provide a written response to the following questions by November 26, 2019.How many American children under the age of 18 are using TikTok, broken down by each age group?How much revenue has TikTok generated from American customers over the past 5 years for in app emoji purchases, and what percentage of that revenue was from children under the age of 18?What efforts has TikTok taken to require parental consent for minors to use its app, and what safeguards does TikTok have in place to ensure that parents of minors are aware of and consenting to each emoji purchase on TikTok?How is the version of TikTok for children ages 12 and under different from the version for users ages 13 and up?To which third party providers does TikTok share information that is collected from child users under the age of 13 and teenage users ages 13 to 17?Thank you for your attention to these important issues. I look forward to your response.Sincerely,Marsha BlackburnUnited States SenatorLoad-Date: November 6, 2019End of Document

TikTok emerges as Silicon Valley's scapegoat in WashingtonPolitico.comNovember 5, 2019 Tuesday 11:19 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1721 wordsByline: soverly@politico.com,  (Steven Overly)Highlight: TikTok offers Silicon Valley CEOs a chance to wrap themselves in American values on market dominance, data privacy and online speech.BodyThe wildly popular video-sharing app TikTok may not be the competitor that Silicon Valley wants, but it could provide what the U.S. tech industry needs right now - a Chinese-owned foil to divert the ire of lawmakers in Washington.The Gen Z favorite is causing existential strife among established social media titans, as TikTok's quirky platform has begun to outcompete the likes of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube in app downloads and buzz among younger users. Yet TikTok also offers Silicon Valley CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg a chance to wrap themselves in American values on market dominance, data privacy and online speech, at a moment when U.S. tech companies are more beleaguered than ever in Washington."It certainly diverts attention, negative attention, from the U.S. platforms," said Robert Atkinson, president and founder of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. "The mob is shifting, if you will, over to a new target. And TikTok is a juicy, ripe target to go after."The newfound focus on TikTok and its Beijing-based parent company ByteDance most notably includes a national security review being conducted by the Trump administration. And, though TikTok declined to appear, scrutiny of the company proved the main theme of a highly critical, if sparsely attended, hearing before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Tuesday.Here are some of the tech policy debates where the rise of TikTok is proving timely:Stifling speechCritics accuse Facebook, Google and Twitter of failing to appropriately moderate content on their platforms, particularly controversial political speech. Democrats say they're too permissive of lies, hate speech and harassment, especially from President Donald Trump and his supporters, while Trump and other Republicans say they're too eager to censor conservatives.Now the companies can point to TikTok as an example of how not to handle online speech, as lawmakers like Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) - who chairs the panel that held Tuesday's hearing - raise fears the company is bowing to censorship pressure from Beijing."I would bet that Facebook is having a field day with this," said Samm Sacks, a cybersecurity policy and China digital economy fellow at New America. "At the very moment when Mark Zuckerberg and the company has been under immense scrutiny here at home, we now have a perfect foil. You don't trust Facebook? Well, just look at TikTok. It's brilliant."Zuckerberg has already spent weeks warning that free speech is in danger if China sets the terms of online expression."China is building its own internet focused on very different values, and is now exporting their vision of the internet to other countries," he said during a speech at Georgetown University last month, throwing a red flag to critics clamoring for U.S. regulators to hobble Facebook's power and influence. "Until recently, the internet in almost every country outside China has been defined by American platforms with strong free expression values. There's no guarantee these values will win out."While dissidents around the globe use Facebook's messaging service WhatsApp to communicate, TikTok has faced accusations that it censors mentions of the anti-government protests roiling Hong Kong, Zuckerberg noted.  "Is that the internet we want?" he asked.TikTok disputes such accusations. Before Wednesday's hearing, its U.S. general manager, Vanessa Pappas, sent a letter to committee members asserting the platform's independence from the Chinese government, writing that the company does not "remove content based on sensitivities related to China (or other countries).""We [have] never been asked by the Chinese government to remove any content, and we would not do so if asked," she wrote.A TikTok spokesperson added: "The more Mark Zuckerberg has come under scrutiny, the more TikTok has shown up in his speeches, interviews and op-eds. You would have to ask him if this is pure coincidence."At Tuesday's hearing, Hawley proved skeptical of that claim, calling on TikTok to "now appear under oath to tell the truth about their company."Still, the lawmaker told reporters after the hearing that he's not inclined to give Facebook and other tech heavyweights a pass in the face of Chinese competitors."Thankfully, they're not the Communist Chinese government, but I don't know that they're exactly good actors, either," Hawley said of U.S. tech platforms.Mishandling sensitive user dataTikTok's Washington woes are not limited to Capitol Hill. The Trump administration is reported to be probing potential national security risks stemming from ByteDance's 2017 acquisition of the app Musical.ly, a deal that helped create TikTok in its current form and precipitated its surge of popularity in the U.S.It's part of broader criticism of Chinese technology behemoths that has festered in Washington for years and is now exploding amid Trump's trade war with Beijing. Citing national security concerns, the Trump administration has slapped Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei with trade sanctions.The anxiety around TikTok centers in part on fears that the data it collects on its U.S. user base could make its way to the Chinese government. "When aggregated, the data could be useful in improving Chinese machine learning tools to help China better understand, predict and manipulate the behavior of Americans," said Jim Baker, a former FBI general counsel who is now director of national security and cybersecurity at the R Street Institute.Facebook and other tech giants have faced criticism for obscuring their own uses of consumer data and failing to handle it securely. The leak of Facebook data to political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica before the 2016 election yielded a record $5 billion Federal Trade Commission fine and helped inspire national calls for data privacy legislation.Nevertheless, Silicon Valley may now find itself positioned as the transparent alternative to China."Instead of importing the values of censorship and control to the U.S., we should be exporting our values of openness and transparency to them," Kara Frederick, a fellow at the Center for New American Security who previously worked at Facebook, said at the hearing.TikTok says it stores data from its American users only in the U.S. and Singapore and doesn't even have data centers in China. But that doesn't satisfy critics like Hawley, who maintain it would be a trivial matter for Beijing to demand the company hand over data anyway.All the same, questions about TikTok's data privacy practices are a reminder that China does not adhere to existing global privacy standards and that its own data governance rules are "very much a work in progress," said Paul Triolo, who heads the geo-technology practice at political consulting firm Eurasia Group."If China remains outside of these regimes, Chinese firms, not just ByteDance/TikTok, but bigger players like Alibaba, will indeed be used increasingly as foils around D.C. debates on data privacy," Triolo said.Upending big tech's market dominanceWhen Facebook was called to testify in July before a House antitrust subcommittee on the state of internet competition, then-public policy director Matt Perault identified TikTok among the rivals nipping at its heels. The fast-growing social network is already proving to be a primary exhibit as Facebook makes a case for why it doesn't have a monopoly on social media."It plays on their side politically because it does show, again, competition is real," said Atkinson at ITIF. "It can happen very quickly and it can certainly be Chinese competition, which we're going to have to grapple with."Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg made similar points in media interviews earlier this year, arguing that dismantling Facebook, as some Democrats want to do, could leave a vacuum for Chinese counterparts to enter. Already, Chinese firms like Alibaba, JD.com, Tencent and Baidu rank among the world's largest internet companies.Since then, federal and state antitrust enforcers have nevertheless launched investigations into both Facebook and Google."On the one hand, I think it's absolutely a legitimate concern that if you don't have U.S. companies playing a big role, if you were to break them up, et cetera, you could have voids which could well be filled by Chinese companies, which could create serious problems," said Ed Black, president and CEO of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, whose members include Google, Facebook and Amazon."Having said that, it shouldn't be a basis to excuse legitimate inquiry and scrutiny of companies," he added.Silicon Valley's own China ambitionsThe debate around TikTok may also renew gripes about American internet firms largely being excluded from the lucrative Chinese market, even as Chinese rivals gain a foothold in the United States. American firms have been eager to expand into China but have stayed out - or been kept out - due to censorship concerns and other barriers to entry."This is a very salient issue and will become even more so as other Chinese social media and e-commerce platforms expand outside of China, even as .... most regulators assume the Chinese government will have some access to data collected by Chinese companies," Triolo said.Heritage Foundation tech policy lead Klon Kitchen noted at Tuesday's hearing that under a Chinese law that takes effect in the new year, foreign firms doing business in the country will also have to comply with government data demands.Google already sustained sharp criticism from lawmakers this year after reports surfaced that it had worked to build a censored search engine, dubbed Dragonfly, to comply with the Chinese government's demands. Google's vice president of public policy, Karan Bhatia, told a Senate Judiciary panel in July that project had been terminated.The rise of TikTok and the reported national security investigation are bound to draw more attention to what it takes to do business as a tech company in China. And on that front, Silicon Valley may struggle to use the upstart social media firm as a scapegoat."The TikTok investigation will undoubtedly spark new debate about how and whether Google could reenter the China market," Triolo said.Cristiano Lima contributed to this report. Article originally published on POLITICO MagazineLoad-Date: November 6, 2019End of Document

World Graphene Industry Report 2019-2025 with a Focus on the Chinese Market - Chinese Graphene Market Will Sustain Growth Rates of at Least 50% During 2019-2025, Bolstered by PoliciesGlobeNewswireNovember 11, 2019 Monday 6:38 AM PTCopyright 2019 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: RESEARCH ANALYSIS AND REPORTSLength: 1017 wordsBodyDublin, Nov.  11, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The     "Global and China Graphene Industry Report, 2019-2025"   report has been added to     ResearchAndMarkets.com's  offering.Graphene is featured with excellent performance and enjoys a rosy prospect China  as a key graphene market saw a market size of roughly RMB280 million  (or $42 million, 1 US dollar = 6.6174 yuan) in 2018, an upsurge of over  70% from the previous year. Bolstered by policies, Chinese graphene  market will expectedly sustain growth rates of at least 50% from 2019 to  2025.The Chinese graphene market is characterized by the following:• Graphene  industry is still in its infancy and graphene is being researched  vigorously in all countries, leading to a boom in patent filings. The  Chinese government has issued a set of policies supporting the industry,  for example, graphene was taken as a priority in the Development Plan  for New Materials during the 13th Five-year Plan Period (2016-2020),  through which China has led the world in a number of graphene patents  and researches. In 2018, graphene patent fillings in the country  outnumbered 30,000.• Graphene powder finds most application in  China nowadays (Graphene powder is used in battery conductive additives,  lithium battery materials and special coatings; graphene film gets  utilized for thermally conductive films, flexible displays and  sensors.). Taking features like high thermal conductivity and small size  into account, graphene film will be increasingly applied in domains  such as smartphones, computers and wearable devices, so its market share  will rise further.• Use of graphene in a lithium battery is  mature enough currently. Over 50% of graphene in China is demanded by  lithium batteries. As research goes on and technology advances, the  downstream application of graphene will be expanding. Besides its  widespread use in anti-corrosion coatings, resins, rubber and battery  materials, graphene also plays an ever more important role in emerging  industries, for instance, new-generation display devices, big health and  advanced manufacturing, with the advent of new products like  graphene-based organic photovoltaic (OPV) films.• There are over  300 producers of graphene power and films in China, but most of them are  incompetent for large-scale industrial production though their products  are mature enough to be put into mass production. Key players include  Beijing Moxi Holding Group Co., Ltd., Der Future Science &  Technology Holding Group, 2D Carbon (Changzhou) Tech Inc. and The Sixth  Element (Changzhou) Materials Technology Co., Ltd., among which Beijing  Moxi Holding Group Co., Ltd. boasts the biggest market share, commanding  over 20% of the market in 2018.This report focuses on the following:• Graphene (definition, performance, preparation methods, development course, industrial chain)• Global graphene industry (development status quo, market size, prices, prospects of industrialization, patents, etc.)• China's graphene industry (policy climate, current development, patents, enterprises' forays, etc.)• Upstream  (graphite, methane, etc.) and downstream (lithium battery,  supercapacitor, transparent electrode, integrated circuit, etc.) markets  of graphene, applications of graphene, etc.• 19 foreign and 16 Chinese graphene manufacturers (operation, graphene business, etc.)Key Topics Covered          1 Overview of Graphene Industry1.1 Definition1.2 Performance1.3 Preparation Method1.4 Development History1.5 Development Bottleneck1.6 Industry Chain2 Development of Global Graphene Industry2.1 Status Quo2.2 Market Size2.3 Market Price2.4 Industrialization Prospects2.5 Overview of Patents2.5.1 Total Filings2.5.2 Structure2.5.3 Patent Filings in Major Countries2.5.4 Patent Filings in Major Companies2.6 Competitiveness Analysis3 Development of Chinese Graphene Industry3.1 Policy Environment3.2 Current Situation3.2.1 Graphene Powder3.2.2 Graphene Film3.3 Industrialization Development3.3.1 Industry-University-Research Collaboration3.3.2 Industrial Park3.3.3 Patents3.4 Enterprises' Layout4 Upstream Sectors4.1 Graphite4.2 Others4.2.1 Methane4.2.2 Ethanol5 Downstream Applications5.1 Lithium Battery5.1.1 Graphene Application5.1.2 Market Situation5.2 Supercapacitor5.2.1 Graphene Application5.2.2 Market Situation5.3 Transparent Electrode5.3.1 Graphene Application5.3.2 Market Situation5.4 Integrated Circuit5.5 Others5.5.1 Polyester-based Composites5.5.2 Electrically Conductive Printing Ink5.5.3 Heat Dissipating Material6 Major Global Graphene Manufacturers6.1 Northern Graphite6.1.1 Profile6.1.2 Operation6.1.3 Graphene Business6.2 CVD6.3 Focus Graphite6.4 Lomiko Metals6.5 Applied Graphene Materials6.6 Graphene NanoChem plc6.7 Haydale Graphene Industries6.8 Other Enterprises6.8.1 Graphene Laboratories6.8.2 Graphenea6.8.3 Graphene Square6.8.4 Grafoid6.8.5 XG Sciences Inc.6.8.6 BGT Materials Limited6.8.7 Angstron Materials6.8.8 Graphenano6.8.9 Vorbeck Materials6.8.10 CambridgeNanosystems6.8.11 GrapheneFrontiers6.8.12 GraphenePlatform Corp.7.

China and India are using the same playbook to trample on their minorities, and the rest of the world is too powerless to stop themBusiness Insider USNovember 23, 2019 Saturday 07:00 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1980 wordsByline: ama@businessinsider.com,  (Alexandra Ma)Highlight: Muslims are being threatened in Xinjiang, Kashmir, and Assam. Though these regions are hundreds of miles apart, they seem to follow the same playbook.BodyChina Daily via Reuters• Muslims in Xinjiang, China, are being surveilled and locked up en masse by regional authorities who see them as terrorists whose religion are akin to a disease or cancer.• Meanwhile, India revoked the autonomy of the mostly-Muslim region of Jammu and Kashmir, and is building detention camps for ethnic Bengalis - most of them Muslim - in the northeastern state  of Assam.• There are several parallels between these two countries' actions - both claim their projects are to prevent violence and explicitly told other countries to butt out of their affairs.• The rest of the world is too powerless to stop these economic powerhouses from continuing their mass internment projects.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.China and India, two economic powerhouses with some of the largest populations in the world, are brutally oppressing their ethnic and religious minorities. But the international community is loathe to rebuke them.In Xinjiang, Chinese authorities have installed the equivalent of a 21st-century police state, with the Uighur ethnic minority monitored by electronic spyware, and locked up en masse in prisons and detention camps. Uighurs call the region East Turkestan.In August, Indian authorities revoked the semi-autonomy of the disputed territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and placed the region under an internet and phone blackout that largely remains today.Residents - many of whom are Muslim - have been placed under virtual house arrest, unable to worship on holidays or harvest crops.In Assam, northeast India, officials are also building internment camps to hold hundreds of mostly-Muslim ethnic-Bengalis, whom the state has declared illegal immigrants because their names are not included on the National Register of Citizens.Many of them have lived in India their whole lives, but their citizenship documents are nonexistent, lost, or riddled with spelling errors. Indian authorities said this week they want to extend the policy throughout the country, making activists grow more fearful for Muslims' safety."In Assam, the camps are currently set up within existing prisons," Angana Chatterji, co-chair of the University of California, Berkeley's Initiative on Political Conflict, Gender, and People's Rights told Business Insider."Reportedly about 600 to 700 people are being held in them," she said, adding that the prisons and camps being built "are being likened to concentration camps."Though Xinjiang, Kashmir, and Assam are hundreds of miles apart, they all seem to follow the same playbook.Anuwar Hazarika / REUTERSBoth countries target Muslims to 'prevent violence'China has repeatedly claimed that its actions in Xinjiang are a counterterrorism measure, and even            cites Islamophobia to justify its actions.            Leaked Communist Party documents, published last week by            The New York Times, shows authorities referring to Uighurs' religion as a cancer, disease, or drug addiction.Meanwhile, India's External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar has said the country cut off Kashmir's internet and communications to fight radicalization and "prevent the loss of life." Locals and law-enforcement officials            have been involved in            violent clashes, and thousands of people have been detained.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which is built on Hindu supremacy, has also capitalized on local Hindu suspicion in Assam of ethnic Bengalis, who have different ethnic identities, religions, and languages, said Meenakshi Ganguly, the South Asia director of Human Rights Watch.Amit Shah, the country's home minister, has referred to illegal Muslim immigrants in India as "termites" and threatened to throw them into the Bay of Bengal. The government has justified its actions in Assam as a matter of national security.Anuwar Hazarika / REUTERSEthnic tensions are an 'internal matter'Both China and India have batted away international criticism by insisting that those issues are            internal matters - and to an extent, their tactics are working.The Chinese government forbids foreign journalists from entering Xinjiang to report, opting instead to organize heavily-choreographed and chaperoned tours to the region that involve bizarre performances of Uighurs dancing or learning Chinese in classrooms. At least two such trips have taken place.Beijing has repeatedly dismissed reports of physical and psychological torture in those camps, claiming instead that they are "free vocational training" - even though many of the detainees doctors, journalists, or other professionals.ReutersIndia, meanwhile, has repeatedly said that the Kashmir issue can only resolved bilaterally between India and Pakistan, citing two historic agreements on the matter. The issue of illegal immigration in Assam and elsewhere is            a matter of national security, according to Indian politicians. In October, Indian authorities took a group of mostly right-leaning Members of the European Parliament on a tightly-controlled trip to Kashmir, which included a stay in a luxury hotel and a peaceful boat ride, the BBC reported. The delegation did not witness any clashes or detentions.But Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a vocal critic of Indian policy in Kashmir, was barred from entering Kashmir during a trip to India in early October."I was told it was not a good time" by Indian authorities, Van Hollen told Business Insider. "India's actions are fueling the more extreme elements on the ground," he added, referring to anti-India militants in the region, many of whom are funded by Pakistan.Adnan Abidi/ReutersDarren Byler, a Uighur expert and University of Colorado researcher, said the Chinese and Indian government tours are likely helping quell foreign criticism."I think the people that go on those tours, they understand that this is being staged for them, at least to some extent," he told Business Insider."But they also see it as a way of justifying, saying they've done their due diligence, and they've taken a look at what's happening on the ground - so they can sign off, check the box, to say they've looked into the box, and say there's nothing there."Thomas Peter / REUTERSCriticism will not be toleratedChina has repeatedly batted away criticism over Xinjiang, saying that its policies helped clamp down on terrorism and violence in the region. Shortly after The Times published the leaked Uighur files, the Chinese foreign ministry said its tactics in the region were "worth learning from."India, meanwhile, has embarked on a disinformation campaign regarding Kashmir, accusing the BBC and Reuters of lying about massive protests in the region            even though they were recorded on video.While both China and India's actions are driven by nationalism, it's important to note that they're not coordinating on tactics - the two countries have an extremely complicated relationship, due in part to China's encroachment near Indian territory and its friendly relationship with India's main rival, Pakistan.REUTERS/Adnan AbidiToo big to punishAnother similarity between the Xinjiang, Kashmir, and Assam crises is the lack of tangible, international action against them.Not a single Muslim country is standing up to China over its actions, either to preserve existing economic ties or in response to Chinese threats to suspend future investment. Many Western countries have publicly criticized China's actions in Xinjiang - but have taken limited steps to stop the atrocities.The European Union, for example, has told China to "change" its actions but has not taken any tangible steps to ensure it. The 28-nation bloc lacks a coherent view toward China - and Beijing has capitalized on this disunity by            pitting EU countries against each other to prevent a united policy that could hamper its plans.Philippe Wojazer/ReutersLast month the US Commerce Department blacklisted 28 Chinese companies,            including eight highly-valued AI startups, in response to their role in the "implementation of China's campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance" against Muslims in Xinjiang.The sanctions were hailed as a good first step, but there is no evidence of change in China's activities, or any indication that the US will take further measures.An executive at Dahua, one of the sanctioned tech firms, even appeared to celebrate after the announcement, telling            a business newspaper: "The fact that we are under the US control list shows that we indeed have a strong technological capability."Associated Press/Andy Wong"I think there's a lot of rhetoric - people want to care, they want to project that they're caring, but when it actually comes down to some kind of human or economic cost, they're not willing to take that step," Byler, the Uighur expert, said."They also point a finger at the Muslim-majority countries, saying: these countries aren't even taking a stand at all, or they're supporting the Chinese state," he added. "So that helps them feel justified in saying, 'at least we're condemning it, we've taken that step.'"Aside from written statements of concern, the US has not taken any concrete action against India over its crackdown in Kashmir and Assam either.The House Asia subcommittee held hearings on human-rights violations in the region in late October, and the US Commission on International Religious Freedom            issued a report this week noting their concern over India's using the citizenship list to tacitly set a religious requirement on citizenship and oppress Muslims.Mukhtar Khan / Associated PressThe US is also "highly unlikely" to impose economic sanctions on India over Kashmir, a former US diplomat specializing in South Asia told Business Insider, noting that Washington hasn't sanctioned Pakistan for harboring militants in Kashmir either. The source had declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.But "that doesn't mean that it's okay to apply a communications blockade on an entire region, and put a bunch of people who are mainstream politicians and who used to be in alliances with the ruling Indian government, into preventive detention," the person said.An appropriate venue to raise India's actions in Kashmir would be at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHCR) the diplomat said. But the fact that the US, the most powerful country in the world, quit the UNHCR - calling it "hypocritical and self-serving"  - has effectively neutered its leadership in human rights and leverage to condemn India's human rights abuses.Denis Balibouse/ReutersThere is also evidence to suggest that UNHCR condemnations don't work: Earlier this year 22 mostly-Western countries wrote a joint letter slamming China's "arbitrary detention and restrictions on freedom of movement of Uighurs, and other Muslim and minority communities in Xinjiang."The harsh language of the letter was outweighed by 37 other countries - including Syria and North Korea - standing up for China.And in September, amid the Kashmir blackout and Assam's citizenship crisis, Trump hosted Modi at a rally in Houston, Texas, where Modi defended his government's actions in Kashmir.What China and India are doing to their Muslim minorities is bleak. But without powerful countries and international bodies willing to take a stand, these persecutions are likely to continue unimpeded.NOW WATCH: We can thank the US military for the smelliest weapon in the worldSee Also:• People in China are bypassing its internet firewall to read explosive leaked files about Uighur oppression, and saluting an official who disobeyed Xi Jinping• Maps show 500 suspected 're-education' camps and prisons where China is locking up and torturing its Muslim minority• China tells Uighur Muslims they are abducting their families so they can cleanse their brains like they have a disease, leaked documents showLoad-Date: November 23, 2019End of Document

US likely to hit China over human rights despite trade talksAssociated Press InternationalDecember 5, 2019 Thursday 9:41 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICAL NEWSLength: 696 wordsByline: By BEN FOX, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - Congress is poised to hand President Donald Trump a second chance in less than a month to anger the Chinese government and attack its record on human rights as he tries to deliver a long-sought trade deal with Beijing.Members of the Senate said Thursday that they expect to quickly and easily pass legislation calling for sanctions on Chinese officials and other measures to address the brutal crackdown on the ethnic Uighur minority in China's northwest. The House passed its version in a 407-1 vote Tuesday.Senate approval is expected within the next two weeks and could be unanimous. The White House has not commented on the legislation, but Trump may have no choice but to sign it as he did the recent bill supporting human rights in Hong Kong."My sense is that if it passes by an overwhelming margin as it did in the House ... it's difficult not to sign it or allow it to become law," Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said.It places Trump in an awkward position since he has made challenging China on trade, not human rights, a signature issue of his administration. He has repeatedly called Chinese President Xi Jinping a friend and has lamented the money and effort the U.S. has spent "policing the world."The legislation nearing approval in the Senate would direct the administration to come up with a list of Chinese officials who could face sanctions for their role in the repression of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang Province.China has detained at least 800,000 Uighurs, ethnic Kazahks and other ethnic minorities in internment camps. People have reported being subjected to forced political indoctrination, torture, beatings and food deprivation as well as being denied the freedom to practice their religion or speak their native languages.Rubio told The Associated Press that the U.S. has a duty to call attention to the repression regardless of the trade war that threatens global economic growth."Anywhere in the world where people are being put in camps, where they are then stripped of their religious and ethnic identity by force and by threat, is somewhere that the United States should speak out," he said.China has said the camps are for voluntary job training. But classified documents leaked to a consortium of news organizations, including the AP, show the camps are instead precisely what former detainees have described: forced ideological and behavioral re-education centers run in secret. The documents detail the Chinese government's deliberate strategy to lock up ethnic minorities, attempt to rewire their thoughts and force them to speak the dominant Mandarin language.The papers also show how Beijing is pioneering a new form of social control using data and artificial intelligence. Drawing on data collected by mass surveillance technology, computers issued the names of tens of thousands of people for interrogation in a high-tech mass detention system in just one week.In addition to the sanctions, which could result in Chinese officials having overseas assets frozen, the legislation calls for closing the internment camps and would also puts export restrictions on any U.S. technology used to track and monitor people as part of the crackdown."It's incredibly important for the people affected by this nightmare," said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch.The Chinese government will "of course be furious," said Richardson, who noted it also puts the Trump administration in a difficult position even though it has declared support for religious liberty around the world."It's hard to tell where something like this fits into the administration's overall strategy," she said. "You would assume that if they want to get a trade deal they wouldn't be sanctioning technology companies and regional police officials."The White House had no immediate comment. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, said he was pleased to see Republicans and Democrats standing up to China."This is the 21st century," Graham said. "We are not going to tolerate a totalitarian regime running concentration camps for people based on their religious status.

New Zealand rugby star Williams joins Ozil in speaking out against against China's Xinjiang campsCNN WireDecember 23, 2019 Monday 8:23 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 600 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN) BodyHONG KONG (CNN) --  New Zealand rugby star Sonny Bill Williams has joined soccer player Mesut Ozil in speaking out against alleged human rights abuses by the Chinese government in the country's far-western Xinjiang region.Williams posted an image of a hand colored in the style of the Chinese flag, bloodily gripping another hand, painted like the flag of East Turkestan, on his official Twitter account Monday. East Turkestan is what some Muslim-majority Uyghurs call their home region of Xinjiang. "It's a sad time when we choose economic benefits over humanity," wrote Williams, who converted to Islam in 2009.Cross-code star Williams won the rugby union World Cup with New Zealand in 2011 and 2015. He became the world's best paid rugby player in November after signing a two-year contract worth $10 million with rugby league club the Toronto Wolfpack. Williams told CNN in November that his faith has helped him manage difficult times in his career. He was a prominent presence in New Zealand after the Christchurch mosque attacks in January, in which 51 people were killed.The US State Department estimates that up to two million Uyghurs and other Muslim-majority minorities have been held in huge detention centers in Xinjiang, where they have allegedly undergone political re-education.Former detainees and Uyghur exiles claim it is part of a program designed to eradicate their culture and customs, turning them into Chinese-speaking patriotic citizens.The Chinese government has repeatedly denied the camps are "detention centers," saying instead they are voluntary "vocational training centers" targeted at de-radicalizing citizens.Ozil backlashIn a post to his social media on December 13, Arsenal midfielder Ozil denounced his fellow Muslims who had stayed quiet on Xinjiang."(In China) Qurans are burned, mosques were closed down, Islamic theological schools, madrasas were banned, religious scholars were killed one by one," he said in the post. In response, Chinese state media pulled coverage of Arsenal's English Premier League game against Manchester City.Arsenal distanced itself from Ozil's comments, but US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted his support for the under fire star on December 17."China's Communist Party (CCP) propaganda outlets can censor @MesutOzil1088 and @Arsenal's games all season long, but the truth will prevail," tweeted Pompeo."The CCP can't hide its gross #HumanRights violations perpetrated against Uighurs and other religious faiths from the world."China had invited Ozil to visit Xinjiang to "distinguish right from wrong" after his social media messages.In a rare press conference Thursday, China's ambassador to Australia Cheng Jingye said that all of the "trainees" at the Xjinjiang camps had graduated. He didn't provide any evidence for his claims.The Chinese government also censored the US Democratic Presidential Debate on Friday morning, local time, after moderator Judy Woodruff asked Mayor Pete Buttigieg if the US should boycott the 2020 Olympics over Beijing's Xinjiang policies.This isn't the first time that sport and politics in China have collided in 2019, but unlike soccer or basketball, rugby does not have a high profile in the country. In October, the NBA's relationship with China was tested following a now-deleted tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey expressing support for anti-government protests in Hong Kong. An estimated 300 million people play basketball in China.CNN's Ben Church and John Sinnott contributed reporting.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Sen. Carper Issues Statement at Hearing on Securing U.S. Research Enterprise From China's Talent Recruitment PlansTargeted News ServiceNovember 21, 2019 Thursday 8:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 978 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs permanent subcommittee on Investigations issued the following statement by Ranking Member Thomas R. Carper, D-Delaware, at a hearing entitled "Securing the U.S. Research Enterprise from China's Talent Recruitment Plans":"During the two terms I was privileged to serve as Governor of Delaware, more jobs were created in our state than any other eight-year period in Delaware history. I did not create one of them. Working with our state legislature and many stakeholders throughout Delaware and beyond our borders, we sought to create a nurturing environment for job creation and job preservation."Among the elements of that nurturing environment are a well-educated workforce, an affordable tax burden, commonsense regulations, public safety, access to capital, transportation infrastructure, quality health care at reasonable prices, the ability to export goods and services, clean air and water, open space, beautiful beaches, cybersecurity, investments in R&#38;D that can be commercialized, protection of intellectual property, access to decision makers, and the list goes on."To this day, my team here in DC and in Delaware and I continue to work every day with many partners to improve that nurturing environment."Those of us serving in Congress and the administration play a key role in ensuring our country continues to be a place where businesses can thrive and create jobs."A big part of our job when it comes to economic competitiveness involves helping the United States to remain on the cutting edge when it comes to science and research. We invest a significant amount of taxpayer money in doing that. The agencies represented before us today spend $44 billion each year to fund research at colleges and universities and other institutions across this country. These investments have led to major innovations."For example, a National Science Foundation grant supported a Stanford University project that eventually led to the founding of Google, one of the most successful companies in the world."And NIH and Department of Energy grants were critical to the success of the Human Genome Project, an historic undertaking that will deliver medical and economic benefits for years to come."As the report we issued today points out, though, the Chinese government has for more than a decade sought to boost its own research and innovation capabilities by exploiting investments that America has made and is making. They've recruited thousands of experts from a wide range of fields to transfer intellectual property developed here in the United States to China in order to benefit Chinese researchers, Chinese businesses, and ultimately, in many cases, the Chinese military."A number of American researchers who've been drawn into this effort even sign contracts with their Chinese employers. In at least some cases, these contracts give China ownership of"technologies and innovations that Americans discover and develop. Some of those contracts even require that information about the researchers' Chinese ties be kept from their American employers and the federal agencies that fund their work."Our report contains examples of contracts that researchers working with the Chinese government must sign, along with case studies detailing the steps that some American researchers have taken to aid China while hiding their activities from our government."I hope that the publication of this information will inspire a serious and urgent conversation on university campuses and among scientists and researchers about the growing threat that China's talent recruitment efforts pose for our country. I hope it also leads to an appreciation of the consequences that come from giving a foreign government so much access to and control over the vital research we rely on to fuel our economic competitiveness and bolster our national defense."Having said that, we should not be stepping back from international collaboration in science and technology. As China's aggressive efforts show, our scientists, research institutions, and universities remain the best in the world and serve as a magnet for talented people looking to do meaningful, cutting edge work. We need to keep investing in that work while doing more to keep scientists, their innovations, and the jobs that flow from those innovations here in our country."But we also need to be smart and take the steps necessary to ensure that conflicts of interest are disclosed and those who might be looking to cheat and steal to get ahead no longer receive federal research dollars."I was pleased to hear in preparing for this hearing about some of the steps agencies have begun taking to better manage and secure federal research programs. For example, agencies have reached out to universities and research institutions across the country to raise awareness about this threat and to emphasize the importance of fully reporting foreign collaborators. Some have also implemented policies prohibiting employees from participating in foreign talent recruitment plans."These are good first steps but we need to do more. Due to our lax oversight of federal research grants and the ineffective and mixed messages agencies have been delivering to schools and researchers on this topic over the years, we've given the Chinese and likely other countries a running start. We can't continue to allow this to happen!"I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today about how we can further improve our efforts to deny our competitors and adversaries the opportunity to continue to reap economic and military gains at our expense in the future."My thanks again, Mr. Chairman, for your leadership on this issue and for the work you and your staff, along with my own staff, have put into this hearing and our report."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6935100 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 21, 2019End of Document

Former CIA officer gets 19 years in prison for selling secrets to ChinaCNN WireNovember 23, 2019 Saturday 6:10 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 558 wordsDateline: (CNN) Body (CNN) --  A former CIA case officer was sentenced to 19 years in prison this week for conspiring to provide sensitive US information to the Chinese government.Jerry Chun Shing Lee, 55, worked for the agency for 13 years in several locations, and had intimate knowledge of its classified information and names of covert CIA officers in China.In May, he pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit espionage on behalf of the Chinese government. At the time, his defense team said he was not a Chinese spy. But court documents detailed how he communicated with two Chinese intelligence officers who'd send him envelopes with requests for secret information in exchange for cash. The Chinese intelligence officers asked him for 21 different pieces of information, mostly about CIA matters, court records show. A thumb drive with secret informationIn May 2010, in response to requests by the Chinese intelligence officers, Lee created a document that provided locations in which the CIA would assign officers and a sensitive operation that the CIA would assign officers with certain experience, according to court records.After Lee created this document, he transferred it from his laptop to a thumb drive. The document included US national defense information that was classified as secret.FBI agents who searched his Hawaii hotel room in 2012 found the thumb drive with the document. Lee told federal investigators he never delivered the thumb drive to the Chinese."The search also revealed that Lee possessed a day planner and an address book that contained handwritten notes made by Lee that mostly related to his work as a CIA case officer prior to 2004. These notes included, among other things, intelligence provided by CIA assets, true names of assets, operational meeting locations and phone numbers, and information about covert facilities," the Justice Department said in a statement. A cash offer and a promiseLee left the CIA in 2007 and moved to Hong Kong. That's where the two Chinese intelligence officers approached him three years later and offered to pay him for national defense information he'd acquired as a CIA case officer. They offered him $100,000 cash and a promise to take care of him "for life" in exchange for his cooperation, court records show.Almost immediately after, he started receiving requests for information from the Chinese intelligence officers. Most of the requests asked for sensitive CIA information, including national defense information, court records show.Between May 2010 and December 2013, he deposited hundreds of thousands of dollars into his bank account, according to records. "Americans entrusted with our government's most closely held secrets have a tremendous responsibility to safeguard that information," said G. Zachary Terwilliger, US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. "Instead of embracing that responsibility and honoring his commitment to not disclose national defense information, Lee sold out his country, conspired to become a spy for a foreign government and then repeatedly lied to investigators about his conduct."Lee pleaded guilty to conspiracy to deliver national defense information to aid a foreign government on May 1.CNN's Tammy Kupperman and David Shortell contributed to this reportTM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Money has been leaving China at a record rate. Beijing is battling to stem the tideCNN WireDecember 19, 2019 Thursday 11:43 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1002 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Beijing is stepping up the battle to stop money flowing out of China as the country contends with economic woes and trade war tensions that have eased but show no sign of ending altogether. Money was leaving the country at a record clip earlier this year through unauthorized channels, according to analysts. That's bad news for China, which needs to keep financial reserves high to maintain confidence in its markets. Now Chinese officials are trying harder than ever to avoid a repeat of the financial scare four years ago that sapped its money reserves by hundreds of billions of dollars. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange, a key government regulator, said Sunday that its most important job next year is to prevent major financial risks, avoid "abnormal" capital flows across its borders and crack down on illegal trading activities. "We need to fight a critical battle" to defuse financial risks and maintain market stability, SAFE said in an statement. The pledge was an unusually strong one for the agency, which deployed the kind of military language more often used by top leaders in China.Cracking downThe agency has already started cracking down on capital flight. In November, it fined Chinabank Payments $4.2 million --- one of the largest-ever fines SAFE has imposed --- for moving money overseas. The regulator didn't say how much had been transferred, but it could have been tens of millions of yuan because China calculates fines based on the amount of money in question.The online payments firm, a subsidiary of billionaire Richard Liu's JD.com, told CNN Business that the transfers were made by "external merchants" who had taken advantage of loopholes. But it said it felt "deeply sorry" and would reflect on its management. Major corporations aren't the only ones linked to the flight of money out of China. Earlier this month, a Bank of China customer took out $50,000 in cash from his bank account over the course of a week. SAFE fined the bank nearly $6,000 for breaking a government rule limiting how much foreign currency people can take out of their accounts within a short period of time.While the amount was small, it still symbolizes how far the government is willing to go to crack down on such withdrawals. "Controls on outflows are increasingly tight," said Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis Bank. Fleeing moneyThe threat of fleeing capital stems from concerns about the country's economy, which has been hurt by cooling domestic demand and a prolonged trade war with the United States. The People's Bank of China also allowed the yuan to weaken, a way to help the country to counter the impact of higher US tariffs on its exports. Since the trade war began last year, the currency has depreciated by around 12% against the US dollar.A weaker currency, though, raises the risk that people will try to move money out of the country, which in turn threatens to drive the yuan's value even lower. The Chinese government has been able to stop some money from leaving. About $74 billion left China through regulated channels in the first half of this year --- the smallest amount in a decade, wrote Gene Ma, head of China research for the Institute of International Finance, in an October report. Even so, a record amount of funds have left China through "unrecorded transactions" during that time, he said. The Washington-based trade group estimates that $131 billion left China in the first six months of 2019 --- the most recent data available --- through "hidden capital outflows." (People can move money through such means, for example, by asking friends and family to pool the annual limit on foreign currency they are allowed to withdraw from Chinese banks, or by claiming to make investments overseas that don't really exist.)Ma wrote that the surge was triggered by "intensifying trade tensions."China has also been trying to help its economy by cutting benchmark interest rates, which will likely increase the amount of money leaving China, said Herrero, the Natixis Bank economist.And while China and the United States recently agreed to a "phase one" trade agreement that could cool tensions between the two countries, Herrero said that deal isn't likely to alleviate the pressure on China entirely. She said the yuan's respite might be "temporary," adding that China's central bank will likely let the currency depreciate again if the deal is not signed, or is eventually watered down.Lessons learnedChina has good reason to keep its money in the country. The last time China experienced this kind of capital flight was in 2015 and 2016, when the economy faltered and the People's Bank of China suddenly devalued the yuan, roiling global financial markets. On average, the amount of money leaving China was equivalent to 6% of the country's GDP in each of those two years, according to an estimate by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government think tank. In total, China lost $1.28 trillion, and it was forced to tap into its foreign exchange reserves to prevent its currency from rapidly depreciating even further. China's foreign reserves shrank by more than $800 billion in those two years before recovering some losses in 2017. Since then, Beijing has significantly tightened control of capital and made it more difficult for people to exchange money for foreign currency or transfer funds abroad. "Chinese regulators have learned their lessons during the frightening period of 2015-16," analysts from Bank of America wrote in November. Analysts at UBS also pointed out that China has taken steps to offset capital flight. They noted earlier this month that the country recently opened up its financial markets further to attract foreign investors and companies. Those kind of measures can boost interest from foreign investors in the Chinese market and attract more money within the country's borders.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.
