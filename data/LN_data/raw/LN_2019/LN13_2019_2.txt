CHINESE TECH GIANT HUAWEI TAKES US GOVERNMENT TO COURTStates News ServiceMarch 7, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 853 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):Nike ChingSTATE DEPARTMENTChinese tech giant Huawei said Thursday it has filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of a U.S. law that bars government agencies and contractors from doing business with the company.The lawsuit filed in a federal district court in Texas argues that a section of the 2019 defense appropriations bill is an unconstitutional infringement on Huawei's ability to conduct business in the United States. Congress included the restriction in the bill after determining that Huawei and another Chinese tech company, ZTE Corp., posed a risk to national security, claiming it could be manipulated by Chinese intelligence services into cyberspying."We are compelled to take this legal action as a proper and last resort," the company's chairman, Guo Ping, said in a statement. "This ban not only is unlawful, but also restricts Huawei from engaging in fair competition, ultimately harming U.S. consumers." Huawei is seeking to play a leading role in developing 5G, the fifth-generation of wireless technology.The lawsuit is half of a dual legal battle Huawei is fighting with U.S. authorities. In the other half, the daughter of Huawei's founder is fighting extradition to the United States to face several criminal charges.Huawei Technologies Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou arrives back at home after her court appearance in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, March 6, 2019.Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer and the daughter of founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested last December in Vancouver, Canada, at the request of U.S. prosecutors, who have accused her of overseeing transactions that violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.Her lawyers argued Tuesday that it will take time to develop her defense in part because of political issues and comments by U.S. President Donald Trump. Meng, who is under house arrest, is scheduled to be back in court May 8 for a new hearing.Separate issues, US saysU.S. officials reject that her extradition case is related to the broader U.S.-China trade talks. The State Department Wednesday told VOA that her case is a law enforcement matter, and Canada is honoring its treaty obligations by considering the U.S. extradition request.The Canadian court timetable suggests that the Huawei extradition battle could linger beyond the ongoing U.S.-China trade talks aimed at resolving a wide range of American concerns over China's trade, investment and intellectual property rights policies. Negotiators have indicated talks could wrap up in the coming weeks.Although U.S. officials say the Huawei CFO court case and the trade talks are entirely separate issues, they point to the deep divisions between the two governments on trade and technology issues.FILE - Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, takes questions during a TV news interview on Capitol Hill in Washington, April 26, 2018.Expand equipment banAs the trade talks drag on, with few outward signs of significant progress, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators, including Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn, are calling for expanding the ban on Huawei equipment so it cannot be used in U.S. energy infrastructure."Huawei has recently become the world's largest maker of inverters, the sophisticated control systems that have allowed the rapid expansion of residential and utility-scale energy production," wrote 11 senators in a letter to Secretary of Energy Rick Perry and the Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen."Our federal government should consider a ban on the use of Huawei inverters in the United States and work with state and local regulators to raise awareness and mitigate potential threats," the senators wrote.Several U.S. lawmakers, blasting Huawei's close ties to the Beijing government, told VOA's Mandarin service that Huawei "should never be in America doing business" and they will "do whatever we can to block that.""[You need to] realize that companies like Huawei and ZTE are wholly subsidiaries of the Chinese Communist party and therefore we have significant concerns about the extent to which they are able to infiltrate our domestic industry here," said Republican Congressman from Wisconsin Mike Gallagher.Senator Marco Rubio questions witnesses before the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing about "worldwide threats" on Capitol Hill in Washington, Jan. 29, 2019."We shouldn't allow Huawei to operate in the U.S.," said Republican Florida Senator Marco Rubio, "They are a state-supported national champion, not only dominate the global telecommunications market in 5G but if compelled by the Chinese government, they will have to turn over data."Last month Huawei's founder Ren Zhengfei insisted his company has never spied for the government, and he would rather shut down the company than agree to any such request for information. Skeptics point out that no Chinese company can refuse to obey such a government request, because there is no independent judicial system in China for which a company can appeal.Yihua lee and Xu Ning from VOA Mandarin Service contributed to this report.Load-Date: March 24, 2019End of Document

ADDRESS AT THE RECEPTION IN HONOUR OF ISA OFFICIALS BY H.E. AMBASSADOR TIAN QI PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF CHINA TO THE INTERNATIONAL SEABED AUTHORITYStates News ServiceMarch 4, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 713 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: KINGSTON, Jamaica BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:From Chinese Embassy in JamaicaYour Excellency Mr. Michael Lodge, Secretary-General of the International Seabed Authority,Mr. Alfonso Ascencio-Herrera, Deputy to the Secretary-General and the Legal Counsel, Your Excellencies Ambassadors, Permanent Representatives and Deputy Permanent Representatives,Members of the LTC and colleagues from the ISA secretariat,Good evening. Welcome and thanks for attending the reception.Confucius said, "What a great pleasure it is to have friends coming from afar!" It is indeed a great honour for us to have so many friends of the same line here this evening.At present, international seabed affairs are facing a crucial juncture of transition from exploration to exploitation. At the Council session last week, the parties held in-depth discussions on the Regulations for the exploitation of deep-sea mineral resources, reached many consensus, which will properly guide the LTC's work in the following two weeks. We also believe that the final Exploitation Regulations should be a interests-balanced, systematic and operational fine legal document.This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the 25th anniversary of the establishment of ISA. It is also the 23rd anniversary of China's accession to the UNCLOS and member of ISA. China's initiative to build a community of shared future for mankind corresponds to the Principle of Common Heritage of Mankind governing the international seabed area and its resources. As a developing country, China actively supports other fellow developing countries in participating in seabed affairs. For many years, China has consistently contributed to the Voluntary Trust Fund of the Authority to finance the participation of developing country members in meetings of the LTC and the Finance Committee. In future, China will continue its deep engagement in international seabed affairs, with Chinese strength and wisdom, to support other developing countries, the relevant funds and projects of ISA and its 25th anniversary celebrations.The exploration contractors sponsored by China have strictly fulfilled their contractual obligations and actively participated in ISA's work related to the protection of the deep seabed environment and the improvement of capacity building of developing countries. Last May, COMRA, a Chinese mining-site exploration contractor, and ISA co-hosted in Qingdao, China the International Workshop on the Development of a REMP in the Northwest Pacific Ocean. The outcome of the workshop has laid a valuable foundation for the development of REMPs in other related seabed areas. COMRA has trained more than 30 scientists and engineers from other developing countries including Pakistan, Jamaica, Kenya, Mexico and Argentina since 1998. China Minmetals Corporation, another Chinese contractor, will start at-sea training for candidates from developing countries this April. On 21 December 2018, Beijing Pioneer Hi-Tech Development Corporation (Beijing Pioneer), a State-owned enterprise, submitted to the ISA Secretary-General an application for a plan of work for exploration in the western Pacific Ocean. The area consists of two parts with equal estimated commercial value, one of which is to be allocated to the Authority as the reserved area. The application is sponsored by Chinese government with a statement issued by the Ministry of Finance of China. If the application is approved, I believe Beijing Pioneer will fulfill the obligations contained in the exploration contract and contribute their strength to the development of the international seabed undertaking.Ladies and gentlemen, friends,China is ready to work with all other parties, in accordance with the spirit and principles of wide consultation, joint contribution, shared benefit and scientific balance between the promotion of the exploitation of deep-sea mineral resources and the protection of the deep-sea environment, to promote the implementation of the principle of "the common heritage of mankind" and contribute to the common interest and well-being of mankind.I wish the 25th session of ISA and the 25th anniversary celebrations great success!Load-Date: March 12, 2019End of Document

Gov't Report Confirms Rep. Smith's Warning of Chinese Gov't Influence in U.S. SchoolsTargeted News ServiceFebruary 27, 2019 Wednesday 6:44 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 813 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Chris Smith, R-New Jersey, issued the following news release:* * *- Smith requested today's GAO report on 'Confucius Institutes'* * *At the request of Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), with Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH), the non-partisan Government Accountability Office (GAO) published a new report on Chinese government-funded Confucius Institutes at universities in the United States; the report was released on Wednesday."The GAO confirms that China's censorship of sensitive topics--such as the 'Three Ts' of Taiwan, Tibet, and Tiananmen--extends to U.S. schools that host Confucius Institutes," Smith, Ranking Member of the House global human rights subcommittee, stated. "Rather than our influencing China toward greater respect for free speech and academic freedom, Beijing is pulling our universities toward self-censorship and intellectual acquiescence."There are 96 Confucius Institutes at colleges and universities in the U.S. as of December, 2018, according to the GAO. The institutes are partly funded and overseen by Hanban, a program that is part of the Chinese Ministry of Education, and are founded "to promote Chinese language and culture" in partnerships with schools in foreign countries, according to the GAO."When tailored by the Chinese government, programs at these institutes can be synonymous with academic malware seeking to influence young minds. Regrettably, the effort is part of China's long arm of authoritarianism seeking to misrepresent itself to unsuspecting students," Smith said. "As the report shows, there are serious and well-founded concerns about academic censorship at these institutes."Smith had asked for the GAO report to investigate whether or not agreements between China and Confucius Institutes are made public, what pressure or influence is exerted on these academic institutions by the Chinese government, and what concerns exist regarding freedom of speech and academic freedom.Wednesday's GAO report studied 90 agreements between Confucius Institutes and schools, and found that almost half, 42 agreements, "contained language about the agreement being confidential or the ability of either party to the agreement to share or release the agreement or other information." Furthermore, the confidentiality language in these agreements mirrored that of a sample agreement posted on Hanban's own website.The GAO, which interviewed officials at 10 U.S. schools with Confucius Institutes, published reports of school officials and researchers expressing serious concerns about China's influence over Confucius Institutes. These concerns included:. Funding of Confucius Institutes from the Chinese government could result in academic censorship or the "perception" of academic censorship;. Hanban's influence on the hiring process at Confucius Institutes;. The possible reluctance of schools with Confucius Institutes to host events on issues that could feature criticism of China, such as Tibet, Taiwan, or Tiananmen Square;. Reluctance of academic officials to apply for Confucius Institute funding for an academic project, because of concerns of Chinese censorship;. Hanban reportedly supplying materials used at some schools "for other classes, such as non-credit courses, or those offered to the community or at elementary or secondary schools."The report also published reported instances of active censorship or intimidation by Confucius Institute or Hanban officials:. According to one researcher, "the Confucius Institute Chinese director" at the school "allegedly removed literature about Taiwan from another professor's door.". In another reported case from an academic conference, "a Hanban representative tried to remove information on Taiwan from the program provided to conference attendees.". In another case, Hanban would not fund a research proposal on environmental studies because it was not a Chinese-related subject matter.Smith's request to the GAO came on the heels of two investigative hearings he chaired in 2014 and 2015 on the threat of Chinese influence to academic freedom at U.S. universities. At the December 4, 2014 hearing, and the June 25, 2015 hearing, he outlined serious concerns of Members of Congress, academics, and others about the lack of respect at these Confucius Institutes for free speech and academic freedom, and the influence of the Chinese government in the academic affairs.Smith has chaired 68 hearings on China's human rights abuses and influence in foreign countries including the U.S. He authored legislation (HR 6010) last Congress "to require an unclassified interagency report on the political influence operations of the Chinese Government and Communist Party with respect to the United States, and for other purposes." He is reintroducing the legislation this Congress.Contact: Matt Hadro, 202/225-3765, matt.hadro@mail.house.govCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6626906 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: February 28, 2019End of Document

ACTIVIST UNDER HOUSE ARREST IN KAZAKHSTAN, PROMPTING FEARS OF PRESSURE FROM CHINAStates News ServiceMarch 11, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1134 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Authorities in Kazakhstan have placed activist Serikzhan Bilash under house arrest for two months on charges of "inciting ethnic hatred" after he campaigned for the release of fellow ethnic Kazakhs from detention in China, prompting concerns the move was made in response to pressure from Beijing.A Kazakh citizen born in neighboring China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), Bilash and his group Atajurt work to release ethnic Kazakhs from political "re-education camps," where authorities in the XUAR are believed to have detained more than one million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities accused of harboring "strong religious views" and "politically incorrect" ideas since April 2017.Reuters news agency cited Atajurt in a report, saying security forces had broken into Bilash's hotel room in Almaty early on Sunday, detained him and quickly flown him to the Kazakh capital Astana.On Monday, Agence France-Presse cited Bilash's lawyer Aiman Umarova as saying a court had ruled that her client be released to house arrest for two months until he is tried for "inciting ethnic hatred." Under the terms of the arrangement, he will not be permitted to engage in activism.RFA's Uyghur Service confirmed the reports through one of Bilash's associates on Monday.According to AFP, police have sealed Atajurt's office, confiscating computers and other equipment activists said contained data about re-education camp detainees in the XUAR, and have refused to return the key to the building.Reuters quoted Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang in Beijing as saying he was aware of Bilash's case, and suggesting the activist had illegally entered Kazakhstan last year."According to what is understood he may have some debt problems in China," Lu told Reuters."This kind of person has ulterior motives to make things up. I think the aims behind this need no explanation," he added, without elaborating.Bilash's arrest has drawn significant attention in Kazakhstan, which is a major trading partner of China, but whose citizens are wary of Beijing's policies toward their ethnic brethren and other Muslim minorities in the XUAR.While Astana has refrained from criticizing Beijing, the Kazakh government has negotiated the release of around two dozen people of dual Kazakh and Chinese citizenship detained in China.Speaking to RFA on Monday, Dolkun Isa, president of the Munich-based World Uyghur Congress exile group, called Bilash's arrest "a political decision, not a legal one.""I believe Kazakhstan arrested him due to enormous pressure from the Chinese government," Isa said."Serikzhan Bilash hasn't violated any Kazakh or international laws in pursuing the human rights of Kazakhs detained in China's re-education camps," he added, calling on authorities in Kazakhstan to release the activist and allow him to return to his work.Ilshat Hassan, president of the Washington-based Uyghur American Association, told RFA that instead of arresting Bilash, the Kazakh government should be providing assistance to him and his organization."As an independent and sovereign state, Kazakhstan should protect its own people and not take orders from China," he said, calling for the activist's "immediate release." Brownback blowback Bilash's arrest came as U.S. Ambassador for Religious Freedom Sam Brownback on Monday defended his claim that re-education camps in the XUAR were "created to wipe out the cultural and religious identity" of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities as part of Beijing's wider "war with faith," following a tersely worded statement from China's foreign ministry condemning his remarks.Last week, while presenting a speech on religious freedom at the Foreign Correspondents' Club in Hong Kong, Brownback accused authorities in the XUAR of persecuting Uyghurs, Tibetan Buddhists, Christians and practitioners of Falun Gong, but warned China that its attack on faith is one "they will not win."On Monday, Lu Kang dismissed Brownback's statement, saying China "protects its citizens' freedom of religious belief in accordance with law," and accusing Washington of "cooking up or using the so-called religious issues to interfere in other countries' internal affairs."Lu specifically addressed the situation in the XUAR, saying the authorities had set up "vocational and educational training centers as a preventive measure against terrorism and extremism," and that government policies in the region "enjoy extensive support from all ethnic groups."Responding to Lu's statement during a forum on religious freedom on the democratic island of Taiwan on Monday, Brownback said his office had tracked down information on hundreds of Uyghurs in the XUAR that are missing and believed detained for their faith."Where are they? What is happening to them? Why can't their family members hear from them?" Brownback asked, according to media reports, which said the ambassador called on China's government to provide the whereabouts of the individuals. Camp network Though Beijing initially denied the existence of re-education camps, Shohrat Zakir, chairman of the XUAR, told China's official Xinhua news agency in October 2018 that the facilities are an effective tool to protect the country from terrorism and provide vocational training for Uyghurs.Reporting by RFA's Uyghur Service and other media organizations, however, has shown that those in the camps are detained against their will and subjected to political indoctrination, routinely face rough treatment at the hands of their overseers, and endure poor diets and unhygienic conditions in the often overcrowded facilities.Adrian Zenz, a lecturer in social research methods at the Germany-based European School of Culture and Theology, has said that some 1.1 million people are or have been detained in the campsequating to 10 to 11 percent of the adult Muslim population of the XUAR.In November 2018, Scott Busby, the deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor at the U.S. Department of State, said there are "at least 800,000 and possibly up to a couple of million" Uyghurs and others detained at re-education camps in the XUAR without charges, citing U.S. intelligence assessments.Citing credible reports, U.S. lawmakers Rubio and Chris Smith of the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China recently called the situation in the XUAR "the largest mass incarceration of a minority population in the world today."Since 1999, the U.S. has designated China a "Country of Particular Concern" under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, for having engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom.

China's Huawei Launches Court Challenge To US Security LawLive Briefs PRO Global MarketsMarch 7, 2019 Thursday 1:52 AM ESTCopyright 2019 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 632 wordsBody Chinese tech giant Huawei is launching a US court challenge to a law that labels the company a security risk and would limit its access to the American market for telecom equipment.Huawei Technologies Ltd's announcement comes as the biggest global maker of network equipment for phone and internet companies fights US efforts to persuade allies to exclude the company from next-generation telecom systems.Huawei said it filed a lawsuit asking a federal court in Plano, Texas, to throw out a portion of this year's US military appropriations act that bars the government and its contractors from using Huawei equipment.Huawei, China's first global tech brand, is at the centre of US-Chinese tensions over technology competition and cyber-spying.The company has spent years trying to put to rest accusations it facilitates Chinese spying or is controlled by the ruling Communist Party."We are compelled to take this legal action as a proper and last resort," the company's rotating chairman, Guo Ping, said at a news conference.Guo said the ban would limit competition, slowing the rollout of fifth-generation communications and raising consumer prices.Huawei has about 40% of the global market for network gear but its US sales evaporated after a congressional panel in 2012 cited the company and a Chinese competitor, ZTE Corp, as security risks and told phone carriers to avoid dealing with them.US authorities "have hacked our servers and stolen our emails" but have presented no evidence to support their security claims, Guo said.He complaining Washington was "sparing no effort to smear" the company.Washington's campaign to persuade allies to shun Huawei threatens to block access to major markets as phone carriers prepare to invest billions of dollars in fifth-generation equipment.Huawei says the new law would shrink its potential US market further by prohibiting the government from buying the Chinese vendor's technology and from buying goods or services from or giving grants or loans to companies or other third parties that do.The US accounts for 20% to 25% of the global market for computer and telecom technology.The company is challenging the US law as an unconstitutional "bill of attainder", or a measure that targets a specific individual for penalties without a trial.The company says that infringes its due process rights and improperly has Congress play the role of a court.The ban is "based on numerous false, unproven and untested propositions," said Song Liuping, the company's chief legal officer, at the news conference."Huawei has an excellent security record and programme. No contrary evidence has been offered."The Chinese government has accused Washington of fabricating or exaggerating security concerns to block a successful Chinese competitor.In January, US prosecutors filed charges accusing Huawei of stealing trade secrets and its chief financial officer of lying to banks about dealings with Iran.The executive, who is the daughter of the company's founder, was arrested on December 1 by Canadian authorities and is fighting a US extradition request.China's government arrested two Canadians, a former diplomat and a businessman, on December 10 in what was widely seen as an attempt to pressure Canada to release the executive, Meng Wanzhou.On Monday, the government accused the two men of acting together to steal state secrets. That followed the Canadian government's announcement on Friday that the extradition proceeding would be allowed to continue.Huawei executives deny wrongdoing and say American security warnings have yet to affect sales outside the US.The company's 2018 revenue forecast is USD100 billion and its founder, Ren Zhengfei, said last month this year's target is USD125 billion.By Associated Press Reporterssource: Press AssociationLoad-Date: March 8, 2019End of Document

HUAWEI'S PRESENCE IN HUNGARY COMPLICATES PARTNERSHIP WITH US, WARNS POMPEOStates News ServiceFebruary 11, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1095 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):Nike ChingSTATE DEPARTMENTU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is warning Hungary the presence of Chinese telecommunication manufacturer Huawei in the European country is complicating Budapest's partnership with Washington.The chief American diplomat Monday arrived in Budapest on Monday, the first leg of his European trip. Huawei has established Hungary as a European hub, where it can develop its fifth-generation mobile networks."If that equipment is co-located in places where we have important American systems, it makes it more difficult for us to partner alongside them. We want to make sure we identify [to] them the opportunities and the risks associated with using that equipment," said Pompeo.FILE - Attendees pass by a Huawei booth during the 2019 CES in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. Jan. 9, 2019.While noting sovereign nations such as Hungary will "make their own decisions," Pompeo said it's imperative the United States shares potential risks from Huawei with its NATO allies.American officials are increasingly troubled by Huawei's expansion in Europe, especially in NATO member states where Washington believes the Chinese telecom manufacturer poses significant information security threats.Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Peter Szijjarto, right, shakes hands with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in the ministry in Budapest, Hungary, Feb. 11, 2019.At a joint press conference with Hungarian Foreign minister Peter Szijjarto, Pompeo said he has raised with Szijjarto "the dangers of allowing China to gain a bridgehead in Hungary."But the U.S. pressure campaign against Huawei faces challenges. Hungary has said it has no plans to reconsider the decision to award the 5G networks contract to Huawei.Many in China believe that the U.S. government concerns over Huawei's security are at least in part aimed at helping American companies better compete against foreign rivals. But U.S. officials reject that notion."That sounds like a lot of mirror imaging to me," said U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for International Security and Nonproliferation Christopher Ford in an interview with VOA, noting "the Chinese government has actually been extraordinarily grand in its ambitions to do just that sort of thing with Chinese companies."Ford pointed to numerous public reports in recent years that have blamed Chinese government-backed hackers with cyber campaigns stealing corporate secrets and financial data."Cyber-facilitated theft of intellectual property, for example, has become notorious around the world. But the Chinese government has been doing that very systematically in order to advantage its own national champion industries in particular sectors," Ford added.FILE - Fitbit's new Alta HR device is displayed in New York, March 1, 2017. The Pentagon is doing a broad review of how military forces use exercise trackers and other wearable electronic devices.Social media threats?Weary of data collection and Chinese technology transfer for military purposes, the U.S. government is considering tighter restrictions on the use of social media apps that have geolocation features within diplomatic and military facilities.While the State Department does not expressly prohibit the use of commercial geolocation applications on smartphones and other personal electronic devices by employees serving internationally, measures are taken to address the potential security risks.The State Department has issued guidance requiring each post to develop a policy regarding the restrictions placed on using personal electronic devices."We obviously need to continue to be mindful of that, and to update and improve our understanding of best practices," said Assistant Secretary of State Ford.Last year, the Pentagon started prohibiting personnel from using geolocation features on electronic devices while in locations designated as operational areas.Those restrictions could impact popular social media applications like TikTok, a Chinese-made app for sharing short videos that is popular among young adults.SEE ALSO:AP Explains: The Promise and Hype of 5G WirelessAll social media companies gather data on their users, but experts warn that Chinese companies in particular pose unique challenges because the Beijing government has absolute authority to request private user data."The user in Western countries might not be aware that in China, the government has a far broader reach compared to over here, so they can request data out from a private company on national security grounds," Claudia Biancotti, visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), told VOA in a recent interview.Biancotti added in China, "they don't really have independent courts to oversee the process.""If this information is sent to China, it can be easily accessed by the government and leveraged, say, to make Beijing's surveillance software better at recognizing Western faces, or at extracting intelligence on Western military activities," warned Biancotti in a recent report.TikTok, launched as Douyin in China in 2016, is owned by Chinese internet technology company ByteDance who later acquired Musical.ly, a popular lip-sync app among American teenagers. ByteDance merged Musical.ly with TikTok in 2018 as a means of entering the U.S. market.Last October, TikTok surpassed Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Snapchat in monthly installations.TikTok recently updated its privacy policy for U.S. residents, removing all references about storing data in China.Last August, TikTok stated in the privacy policy: "We will also share your information with any member or affiliate of our group, in China," but the latest update in January of 2019 deleted the word "China."The company wrote an email to VOA's Mandarin service that they regularly update their privacy policies while noting that TikTok does not operate in China.TikTok's current privacy policy stated it automatically collects technically and behavioral information from users, including IP address, location-related data or other unique device identifiers."We may also collect Global Positioning System (GPS) data and mobile device location information." But users can switch off location information functionality on their mobile device if they do not wish to share such data."We will share your information with law enforcement agencies, public authorities or other organizations if legally required to do so," TikTok stated.VOA's Mandarin Service, Jeff Seldin and Mo Yu contributed to this report.Load-Date: March 24, 2019End of Document

House Ways and Means Committee Issues Testimony From U.S. Trade Representative LighthizerTargeted News ServiceFebruary 27, 2019 Wednesday 7:21 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 911 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe House Ways and Means Committee issued the following testimony by U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer at a hearing entitled "U.S.-China Trade":"Mr. Chairman Neal, Ranking Member Brady, and all the distinguished Members of this great committee: thank you for the opportunity to testify this morning."The Committee is meeting at a historic moment for those of us interested in U.S. trade policy. Under President Trump's leadership, Americans are benefiting from the strongest economy in the developed world. Over the last year, the U.S. economy has grown at an annual rate of roughly 3 percent - significantly better than that of any other G-7 country. Our unemployment rate is 4 percent. Inflation is very low. These are great times for American workers."Americans who trade are benefiting from this growth. Through the first 11 months of 2018, total U.S. exports of goods and services were up 7.3 percent from the same period in 2017, and up 13.7 percent from the same period in 2016. We've seen similar percentage increases on the import side. Last year, the United States created 264,000 new manufacturing jobs - the highest such figure in 21 years."We have new trade agreements with South Korea, Mexico, and Canada. We are working with you on talks with Japan, the European Union, and the United Kingdom. We are aggressively enforcing U.S. trade laws. All of these efforts have one purpose: to build a higher standard of living for all Americans. I am happy to report that our efforts are working."Of course, no challenge in the trade space is greater than that presented by China.* In 2000, the year before China joined the WTO, our trade deficit in goods with them was $83 billion. Last year, through November, it was on pace to exceed $417 billion.* In 2000, the year before China joined the WTO, there were 17.3 million manufacturing jobs in the United States. By 2016, 5 million of those jobs were lost.* Last month, USTR issued its annual report on China's compliance with its WTO obligations. We concluded that "China's actions have done severe harm to other WTO members and the multilateral trading system, which was never designed to deal with a non-market economy of China's size."* Last March, USTR issued the results of a detailed investigation into China's policies regarding intellectual property, technology transfer, and innovation. We found that China had engaged in numerous unfair practices - including forced technology transfer and cybertheft. In a supplemental report last November, we found that China had not changed its ways.* Together, these reports represent nearly 500 pages of detailed, thorough analysis of the systemic and structural problems in the Chinese economy that are hurting U.S. workers and businesses."These facts - and many others of which Members are already aware - raise a very difficult question: How should the United States deal with a country like China, which is the world's second largest economy - and which continues to operate under a market-distorting system? In the whole history of U.S. trade policy, I am not aware of another country that has presented such a severe challenge to American policymakers. In retrospect, we should have taken this question more seriously when China's economy was much smaller. But we did not, and now this Administration - and you - must deal with the result."Fortunately, in President Trump, we have a leader in the White House who recognizes the importance of the China challenge - and who has empowered his Administration to take firm and unprecedented actions in response. I am also encouraged by the strong bipartisan support we have received from Members who recognize the gravity of the issues before us. Speaker Pelosi has long been a leader on this issue - as long ago as 2000, she wisely warned about the dangers of granting permanent normal trade relations to China. I regularly confer with Chairman Neal, Ranking Member Brady, and now Chairman Blumenauer and Representative Buchanan and many other members of this Committee - and I have been greatly aided by their wisdom and support."I want to emphasize that Congress has been extremely helpful in our recent talks with China. The Chinese government is very aware of the strong desire for structural change - and enforcement - found on both sides of the aisle. And your support has been critical in persuading China to take our concerns more seriously."As you know, we have had near-constant negotiations with China in recent months. Both sides are seriously engaged at the highest level - and significant progress has been made. While it is too early to predict the outcome, I want to emphasize two key points:"First, this Administration is pressing for significant structural changes that would allow for a more level playing field - especially when it comes to issues of intellectual property rights and technology transfers. The issues on the table are too serious to be resolved with promises of additional purchases. We need new rules."Second, any agreement must be enforceable. We at USTR are very aware of the history of our trading relationship with China, and the disappointments that have resulted from promises that were not kept. Thus, the Administration is focused on making sure that we have the ability to enforce any new agreement."Again, I am happy to discuss these issues with you. I look forward to your questions."[TheHill]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6626854 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: February 28, 2019End of Document

Earlier this month, he released a report by the same name, which is the first product of the Project for Strong Labor Markets and National Development from Rubio's committee staff.

I believe we are at a critical moment. When the history of the 21st century is written, the defining factor will be the relationship between the U.S. and China."American competitiveness faces an unprecedented threat from the Chinese government. We have not yet encountered a threat like China, which unlike previous competitors has developed tremendous commercial power to use against American interests across the world."While the challenge we face with the Chinese government is ultimately one of national security and more fundamentally about whether or not the future of the world will be marked by authoritarianism one of the most immediate concerns we face today comes in the form of China's industrial policy."The Chinese government's plan, called 'Made in China 2025,' is a plan for industrial dominance in ten key technological sectors, some of which the U.S. is the current global leader. For Chinese companies to meet the production targets the plan sets out, it will take their success at the expense of the U.S."To some extent, this is already happening. The initial period following China's accession to the World Trade Organization witnessed a devastation to American small and medium-sized manufacturers in concentrated areas throughout the country an effect now known as the 'China Shock.'"Understanding the goals of Made in China 2025, we must decide whether this 'shock' should be allowed to expand up the value chain and across industries. I for one believe that this cannot be an option."A committee produced report that I recently released, titled 'Made in China 2025 and the Future of American Industry,' lays out the challenges posed by this whole-of-society industrial plan, as well as a path forward to strengthen American economic security."One thing is clear: just as business firms compete, so do nations. Through plans like Made in China 2025, China has set its sights on many of the high-value industries that America cannot afford to lose."Through this whole-of-society strategy, the Chinese government attempts to steal, subsidize, and ultimately compete its way to the top of the global production value chain. In sum, they aim to supplant American industrial leadership by any means necessary."Fortunately, the American system contains intrinsic advantages that the Chinese government's totalitarianism rejects. Our marketbased economy and free society operate with an efficiency and openness that is impossible in China's command and control regime."American freedoms and the open exchange of ideas attract talented and idealistic individuals from across the globe who contribute to the continuous building of our nation's capabilities."American ingenuity and innovation, in combination with our political freedoms, have created the world's most successful and forward-thinking companies."Small businesses, which support dignified work, strengthen families, and sustain communities, are particularly susceptible to the dangers of state-backed import competition. Trade normalization with China occurred with the optimistic promise of fair market access, economic liberalization, and an improvement in Chinese political and human rights."However, instead of opening, China took advantage by discounting international trade rules and norms to the detriment of American productive capabilities."Chinese industrial and trade practices including large-scale subsidies, forced technology transfers, and obstructing market access to foreign firms underscore the nation's disregard for its international trade commitments."Beyond merely breaking the rules, the Chinese government is seeking to dictate the terms and conditions of the future of global trade for its own benefit."In the absence of a concerted American policy response, Made in China 2025 threatens to replicate the effects of 'China Shock' on high-value capital goods, such as computers and aerospace products."It is important to note that these threats to American competitiveness are not contingent upon the total success of Made in China 2025 or any other industrial plan."Command and control central planning is a flawed economic approach with countless pitfalls and downsides."However, as many Americans workers know personally, this does not mean that such an approach cannot have devastating impacts on U.S. production, jobs, and small businesses."In many important measures, China has already achieved success, capturing leading positions in global economic standings previously held by the U.S."In order to confront this challenge, we must choose to prioritize national development, economic dynamism, and small business competitiveness."This growth agenda entails a focus on domestic physical investment and labor market stabilization."It also means that we must enact in-kind responses to malicious Chinese trade and industrial practices."As an economic development agency, the Small Business Administration is particularly suited to support innovation-focused production ecosystems."Programs such as the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC), the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) serve as tools which can be used to further promote a nimble, innovative, and high-growth industrial strategy."I look forward to engaging with the witnesses to explore the findings of the Made in China 2025 report and its implications for the future of American competitiveness."Load-Date: February 28, 2019End of Document

PHILIPPINES TURNS OVER TO BEIJING EX-CHINESE GOVT OFFICIAL WANTED FOR GRAFTStates News ServiceJanuary 16, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 386 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:An ex-government official from China wanted for "corruption and economic crimes" involving U.S. $210 million faces deportation after being arrested in the Philippines and turned over to Chinese authorities in Manila, the Filipino immigration bureau said Wednesday.Presidential Anti-Corruption Commission (PACC) and immigration agents took Xie Haojie, 49, into custody during a raid on Sunday at a condominium in Pasay city, a suburb of Manila, Immigration Commissioner Jaime Morente said.Xie had been hiding in the Philippines since last year after fleeing China to evade prosecution over a criminal offense, Morente said, adding that his counterpart in Beijing had asked PACC to help them track down the fugitive. Both agencies had coordinated closely with each other in making the arrest, he said."He will immediately be deported back to China so he could face the cases lodged against him. His name will also be included in our blacklist to prevent him from re-entering the Philippines," Morente said of Xie."We will not tolerate the presence of undesirable aliens using the Philippines as a hideout. Fugitives will be sent back to face their crimes," he added.After Xie was presented to reporters in Manila, senior officials from the Philippine anti-corruption agency and Philippine Bureau of Immigration "turned over Xie today to Chinese authorities in a ceremony held at the office of the PACC at the Palacio del Gobernador in Intramuros, Manila," immigration officials said in a press release.The arrest was tied to the Chinese government's all-out campaign against corruption that cracked down on abusive government employees, including high-ranking officials.Xie was under investigation for allegedly embezzling public funds and taking bribes in his capacity as a general manager of a state-owned enterprise, said La Yifan, director of international cooperation for China's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, according to a report published by the Philippine Star on Wednesday."The Philippines and China will continue to strengthen our cooperation in going after Chinese fugitives hiding in our country, including former government officials wanted for corruption," Morente said.Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Load-Date: January 16, 2019End of Document

Kennedy Files Legislation to End China's Unguarded Access to America's College CampusesTargeted News ServiceMarch 28, 2019 Thursday 8:31 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 398 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe office of Sen. John Kennedy, R-Louisiana, issued the following news release:U.S. Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) filed a package of bills today that will protect national security by ending China's unfettered access to American college campuses.The main bill, the Confucius Act, addresses concerns about Confucius Institutes, which receive direct funding from the Chinese government to promote Chinese studies on American college campuses. The bill reduces China's influence on U.S. colleges and universities by granting full managerial authority of Confucius Institutes' teaching plans, activities, research grants and employees to the universities. This is a necessary step after the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations warned earlier this year that the institutes pose a serious threat to academic freedom by pushing China's history of censorship and control.Confucius Institutes partner with more than 100 campuses across the U.S., including Xavier University in New Orleans. The FBI has acknowledged that it is warily watching Confucius Institutes, and several universities have severed ties with the institutes.Sen. Kennedy also filed the Protecting American Technology Act of 2019 to safeguard the information and technology produced on college campuses by requiring a deemed export license to be in place before foreign nationals can conduct scientific research in university labs. This will prevent controlled technologies from leaking to America's competitors."The FBI has warned us that China is exploiting our open research and development environment. In other words, China cheats. Confucius Institutes supposedly promote Chinese studies on U.S. college campuses.

Canada fired its Chinese ambassador after his 'mind-boggling' remarks on the arrest of Huawei's CFOBusiness Insider USJanuary 28, 2019 Monday 06:27 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc.

He later added that if the US dropped the extradition request it would be "great for Canada."• Trudeau said in a statement on Saturday that he had asked for and accepted McCallum's resignation.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau fired the country's ambassador to China, John McCallum, on Saturday after he spoke out about the arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou.It is the latest twist in the ongoing saga over Meng, who was detained in Vancouver last month on reported suspicion of breaking US trade sanctions.McCallum told Chinese language media on Tuesday last week that Meng had some, "strong arguments" for avoiding extradition to the US. He also said Meng getting extradited "would not be a happy outcome."His comments prompted astonishment from fellow diplomats who thought they undermined Canada's position. David Mulroney, the former Canadian ambassador to China, called McCallum's remarks "mind-boggling."McCallum apologized on Friday, telling the Toronto Star that he "misspoke," but then added that if the US dropped its extradition request, it would be "great for Canada."Read more: China is outraged that the US wants to take the arrested Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou off Canada's handsThe Toronto Star reported on Wednesday that Trudeau was standing by McCallum, but that changed at the weekend. Trudeau announced in a statement on Saturday: "Last night I asked for and accepted John McCallum's resignation as Canada's ambassador to China."Meng's case has sent tremors through China-Canada relations, and following her arrest on December 1, two Canadians have been detained in China and a third had a prison sentence upgraded to the death penalty.China claims that the arrest was politically motivated by the US, which has been lobbying allied countries to freeze out Huawei's new 5G network plans on national security grounds. It claims Huawei could be acting as a backdoor for the Chinese government.Chinese state media reacted derisively to the news of McCallum's resignation. State-run newspaper The Global Times said: "Ottawa is now as sensitive as a frightened bird."NOW WATCH: I cut Google out of my life for 2 weeks, but the alternatives prove why Google is so much betterSee Also:• Canada blames US for Huawei CFO arrest backlash that left 2 citizens in Chinese prisons and a 3rd on death row• Huawei's chairman brazened it out among world leaders at Davos, talking up 5G while the company faces a criminal probe• Federal prosecutors are leading a criminal investigation into Huawei and allegations that it stole trade secrets from US companiesSEE ALSO: What you need to know about Meng Wanzhou, a Chinese tech founder's daughter whose arrest could set fire to US-China relationsLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

US-China battle over Huawei comes to head at tech showAssociated Press InternationalFebruary 25, 2019 Monday 4:26 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 905 wordsByline: By KELVIN CHAN, AP Business WriterDateline: BARCELONA, Spain BodyBARCELONA, Spain (AP) - A global battle between the U.S. government and Chinese tech company Huawei over allegations that it is a cybersecurity risk overshadowed the opening Monday of the world's biggest mobile industry trade fair.Huawei has an outsize presence at MWC Barcelona, from its displays in three separate show halls down to its red sponsorship logo adorning visitor pass lanyards. The focus at this year's meeting is new 5G networks due to roll out in the coming years. But the dispute over Huawei, the world's biggest maker of networking gear, is casting a pall.The United States government dispatched a big delegation to press its case with telecom executives and government officials that they should not use Huawei as a supplier over national security concerns. U.S. President Donald Trump's administration says the Chinese government could use Huawei equipment to snoop on the world's internet traffic - accusations Huawei has rejected, saying there has been no proof of a cybersecurity breach.In a fresh salvo, 11 U.S. senators on Monday called for the federal government to ban solar power inverters - advanced control systems - made by Huawei, saying they pose a national security threat to U.S. energy infrastructure.Huawei's counteroffensive includes making its case directly to government officials, companies and journalists. It has unveiled a new folding 5G phone and its executives are speaking on keynote panels at the show. Formerly known as Mobile World Congress, the show is a key forum for lobbying and deal-making that's expected to draw 100,000 visitors."The geopolitical tensions between the U.S.A. and China will undoubtedly be a hot topic," said Shaun Collins, CEO of research firm CCS Insight. "There is little doubt that operators around the world are concerned that draconian sanctions on their ability to use Huawei's 5G infrastructure could have detrimental effects on their 5G roll-out plans."Behind closed doors, U.S. officials have been suggesting that Ericsson of Sweden and Finland's Nokia should be preferred suppliers, but telecom providers like Huawei for its cheap but good quality equipment. That helps lower the cost to customers of using new 5G networks, which promise lightning fast download speeds and less signal lag - advancements that will help develop self-driving cars, factory robots and remote surgery.At Huawei's sprawling main pavilion, lit in shimmering LED lights, the company showed off virtual reality racing games that use 5G to provide crisper graphics and quicker response times than 4G."Definitely compared to other big global vendors, they're cost efficient," said Sharif Shah Jamal Raz, a vice president at Bangladesh mobile operator Robi Axiata, as he and his colleagues inspected Huawei's display of network base stations and modular antennas.Trump tweeted last week that he wanted the U.S. to catch up in the 5G race through competition, "not by blocking out currently more advanced technologies." Though he didn't mention China or Huawei, the comments could be seen as a more toned-down approach to the company, which has long been blocked in the U.S.Guo Ping, one of three Huawei executives who take turns as chairman, told reporters Sunday that he read Trump's tweet as an admission that the U.S. needs faster internet networks and is lagging in this respect.Guo stressed that his company "will never allow for backdoors in our equipment," and it would never violate laws and regulations in countries where it operates.U.S. allies in Europe are still making their minds up on allowing Huawei gear in 5G networks and it's not clear if Washington's lobbying campaign is having an effect, with some viewing it as a calculation of technical risks rather than as part of a broader battle for tech supremacy between China and the U.S.The CEO of Ericsson, Borje Ekholm, said countries face "critical decisions" as they roll out 5G networks."As we talk to our customers, they are feeling the uncertainty and they are concerned," Ekholm said at the MWC show.A ban on Huawei could delay the rollout of 5G in Europe by two years, said Nick Read, CEO of Vodafone, one of the world's biggest mobile operators.  The "implication is suddenly you've got to do a massive swap of equipment. Hugely disruptive to national infrastructure, consumers (and) very, very expensive," he said.The head of Britain's government surveillance agency, Jeremy Fleming, said Monday that China's tech dominance posed a complex strategic challenge."We have to understand the opportunities and threats from China's technological offer," Fleming said in a speech in Singapore, according to a transcript. "We have to take a clear view on the implications of China's technological acquisition strategy in the West."The British government is carrying out a review of the risks involved with telecom infrastructure that will help it decide on Huawei's role in 5G networks. U.K. cybersecurity officials have said previously they think the risks involved with Huawei can be managed.GSMA, an association that represents 750 mobile operators worldwide, is recommending a testing and certification regime for Europe to ensure confidence in network security.Guo called for the industry and governments to develop "clear and unified" cybersecurity standards and regulations, and said decisions should be made by technical experts rather than politicians.___Follow Kelvin Chan at www.twitter.com/chanmanLoad-Date: February 26, 2019End of Document

Here's why the US is terrified of one Chinese company controlling the world's 5G networksBusiness Insider USMarch 6, 2019 Wednesday 09:21 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1744 wordsByline: sghosh@businessinsider.com,  (Shona Ghosh)Highlight: The US has owned the internet - and it's scared China might go on to own the next-generation communications network.BodyReuters• US officials stepped up their rhetoric against Huawei, just as the Chinese firm made a big pitch about its 5G business at the mobile industry's flagship gathering.• At the Mobile World Congress, the top US cyber official, Robert Strayer, asked European governments to consider the "threat" posed by using Huawei's 5G equipment in their mobile networks.• Huawei shot back, and said the US also had surveillance systems.• Security experts told Business Insider that the US was afraid of yielding control of telecoms infrastructure to Chinese firms that might have to kowtow to laws from an undemocratic regime.• Huawei upped the ante in its fight with the US over its telecommunication devices on Thursday local time, announcing that it filed a lawsuit against the US government, which has banned its federal agents from using the equipment, citing privacy concerns.US lobbying against Chinese firm Huawei, one of the biggest phone makers and telecommunications kit providers in the world, hit a new level this week during the phone industry's big annual conference.Around 100,000 technology vendors, carriers, and device makers head to Mobile World Congress in Barcelona every year both to strike deals and to showcase emerging technologies. This year, the conversation was dominated almost exclusively by 5G, as carriers look to introduce next-generation, superfast mobile networks.The conference was heavily sponsored by Huawei, as the firm made its big pitch about its 5G capabilities.But looming in the background were the months of negative press about whether Huawei's equipment might provide a backdoor that would allow the Chinese government to spy on people.The firm's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, is awaiting Canada's decision on whether to extradite her to the US, after            alleged sanctions violations. And the company was also indicted by the US for            alleged theft of trade secrets.Rotating chairman Guo Ping took to the stage on Tuesday morning to talk up Huawei's 5G business to a cavernous auditorium filled with telecoms executives and journalists.His speech took an unexpected turn about halfway through, when he fired a shot at the US government, turning claims that Huawei spies on behalf of China back on America.Shona Ghosh/Business Insider"PRISM, PRISM on the wall, who is the most trustworthy of them all?" Guo said onstage, in reference to the PRISM surveillance system used by America's intelligence agency. "Huawei has a strong track record in security in three decades. Three billion people around the world. The US security accusations of our 5G has no evidence, nothing."Behind him, a slide appeared in his presentation with the statement: "Huawei has not and will never plant backdoors." There was even some muted laughter from the audience.Elsewhere around the conference centre, Huawei's logo adorned lanyards of thousands of attendees, while ads for its Mate X foldable phone greeted visitors as they entered the building.RAFAEL MARCHANTE/ReutersJust five hours after Guo's swipe, US government officials held a small press conference to make their position on Huawei clear. Up until that point, there had been no visible sign of the US government delegation, which had quietly turned up to Mobile World Congress to lobby its European allies not to use Huawei's equipment in their networks.Reading from a printed statement, with no microphone or slides, top US cyber official Robert Strayer said: "The United States is asking other governments and the private sector to consider the threat posed by Huawei and other Chinese information technology companies."Read more: Huawei said it built a folding phone similar to Samsung's Galaxy Fold - but killed it because it was so badWhen pressed by reporters, Strayer refused to say whether the US had proof that Huawei might have built backdoors into its telecommunications equipment.And asked if the US might simply be worried about leaning too heavily on a foreign tech company, Strayer said: "Really I think the question is this: Do you want to have a system that is potentially compromised by the Chinese government or would you rather go with a more secure alternative?"The US will be hoping that Strayer's comments, and its behind-the-scenes lobbying, will land more effectively with its allies than Huawei's attack on the big stage at MWC.Huawei upped the ante in its fight with the US over its telecommunication devices on Thursday local time, announcing that it filed a lawsuit against the US government, which has banned its federal agents from using the equipment, citing privacy concerns.Former FBI official: The US is worried about China's rising military and economic powerReutersSecurity experts with ties to the US government said America's lobbying efforts are about more than just protecting the West's nascent 5G networks from potential Chinese spies.Joseph Campbell, a director in the global investigations and compliance practice at Navigant Consulting and formerly assistant director of criminal investigations at the FBI, says the Huawei fight is a proxy for bigger US fears about China's ambition."We don't know as private citizens all the intelligence information the US and its allies have gathered relative to China and Huawei," Campbell told Business Insider during a phone interview. "But... there's no doubt China is a significant threat for the United States, they are committed to becoming a lead economic and military power in the world.""Data is power," he added. "Eventually Huawei could be in the position where it could interfere with data traffic, sharing usage, or even engaging in proactive activity to extract that information and use it for their own benefit."Ang Cui, CEO of security firm Red Balloon, added that whoever dominated 5G would potentially have access to billions of additional connected devices expected to be enabled by the faster network. According to Ericsson, there will be a total of 29 billion connected devices by 2022."Whoever gets to dominate 5G infrastructure will become the owner of the next generation of the world's telecoms infrastructure," he said. "If you look back 30 years, [the US Defense Department] funded... what became the internet. US companies provided a lot of the technology and infrastructure."Cui added: "The internet turned out not to be perfect, but the world doesn't suspect that the US runs a pervasive surveillance mechanism."Still, Huawei did play on fears that the US does carry out wide-ranging surveillance with its reference to the PRISM system, and the            newly introduced Cloud Act, which would force Amazon, Microsoft, and other tech providers to hand over data.Campbell, the former FBI staffer, said it came down to differences in the legal approach by the two countries.Actually obtaining data under a law like the Cloud Act, he said, involves many layers of authorisation and back-and-forth between the FBI, the Attorney General, and a further judicial process.And such laws in the US are intended to help criminal investigations and national security investigations, Campbell said. He added that China's approach to data-gathering was more self-serving."Their usage of laws is much more towards benefiting the state in general and the ability to drive its own economic and military capabilities," he said.Huawei's business is much bigger in Europe, the Middle East, and African than it is in the USIt would be a major victory if the US does manage to persuade more European governments to ban Huawei, simply because its business in EMEA is so much bigger than in the US.The Americas account for only a small portion of Huawei's business, according to its most recently available financial report from 2017. Just 6.5% of its $90 billion in revenue came from the Americas that year, while Europe accounted for more than a quarter. Its strongest-performing division was its carrier business - the arm that would be providing 5G equipment to telecommunications providers.Here's how much revenue Huawei makes across its different businesses, and what percentage comes from different regions. The figures are in Chinese yuan:HuaweiOne problem for US lobbying efforts is that Huawei is already deeply embedded in European telecoms networks, and is already helping to test 5G networks in the UK."They are a trusted vendor, a trusted provider," one senior UK telecoms executive involved in 5G testing told Business Insider at Mobile World Congress. The person added that operators would come to their own decisions about Huawei, but would listen to advice issued by UK intelligence.Detecting whether there are vulnerabilities in a piece of equipment or the software that runs on it is difficult, Cui said. "If someone puts in a backdoor, they're going to hide it. So this is not going to be on a spec sheet, it's not going to be an obvious thing they give access to."He likened a backdoor to the hidden blocks in a Super Mario game which remain invisible to the player."You jump, you don't see anything, but something happens," Cui said. "It's a cheat in the system that no one knows about, and that changes the entire security system. It could be in the hardware or the firmware, and perhaps not even a full bug, but a small vulnerability somewhere in the code that only you know about."UK intelligence is due to publish a report on Huawei in the coming weeks, and early indications suggest that the authorities will conclude they can mitigate the risk from using the Chinese firm's kit.For the US though, the risk is just too high."Certainly Germany, the UK, have independent abilities to assess the threat posed by Huawei, and determine if they can put in the right mitigations," said former FBI exec Campbell. "Obviously the US doesn't feel mitigation techniques would be effective... they would prefer to eliminate that threat."NOW WATCH: Why Apple's dongle problem isn't getting any betterSee Also:• Huawei's war with America just went up a level, with the Chinese company planning to sue the US government• The Trump administration is warning allies to stay away from a powerful Chinese company - but not everyone's listening• Huawei said it built a folding phone similar to Samsung's Galaxy Fold - but killed it because it was so badSEE ALSO: Huawei just upped the ante in its fight with the US in new lawsuit against the governmentDON'T MISS: US officials called Huawei 'duplicitous and deceitful' just as the Chinese firm is making its big 5G pitchLoad-Date: March 6, 2019End of Document

Tension between Uighurs and ChinaThe Gulfordian: Guilford CollegeFebruary 15, 2019 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLDNATION; Pg. 1Length: 647 wordsBodySince around the summer of 2017, reports have surfaced of large fortified buildings popping up throughout China's Xinjiang Uighur (pronounced like 'we-gur') Autonomous Region.These accounts have contained disturbing information indicating that the Chinese government is kidnapping and detaining Uighurs within security-thick campuses in large numbers.The Uighur population of China is "mainly Muslim, (they) speak a Turkic language, and (they) live in Xinjiang, which is the far northwestern part of China," James Millward, a Georgetown University history professor, said in a November 27, 2018 video posted on The Atlantic's website.The Uighur people are no strangers to conflict with The People's Republic of China, Millward said.In September 2008, The Guilfordian covered "restrictions on the Muslim holiday Ramadan" placed within Xinjiang, "banning women from wearing veils and men from growing beards," among other decrees hindering Muslim populaces from observing their faith.In September 2009 this paper covered a series of riots followed by mass stabbings within Xinjiang, which the Chinese government claimed were instigated and carried out by Uighurs.The Guilfordian last covered tensions between the Uighurs and the Chinese government in February 2018, when concerns arose around the testing of facial recognition technology throughout the Xinjiang province.China's history of control over Xinjiang and her Uighurs is one of fluctuation. China's past empires, in their weakness or strength, would hold power over the Xinjiang region or lose power over the region; the current Communist government took control of Xinjiang in 1949. As stated in "China's 'War on Terror,'" an article from the July-August 2002 volume of the journal Foreign Affairs, "[w]ith the end of China's imperial era, the Uighurs twice briefly achieved statehood...The second (Uighur state) ...was pressured into integrating with the People's Republic of China shortly after the (Republic's) formation."As reported by several sources, post-9/11 anti-Muslim sentiments established an excuse for the People's Republic of China to oppress its Muslims specifically. "In a post-9/11 international environment, being a Muslim...could become a source of vulnerability. And it is easy to label any discontent from the Uighurs against the state control as terrorist acts. And this is exactly what is happening" explained one member of  Guilford community, who recently spoke on the condition of anonymity.The 2002 Foreign Affairs article corroborates with the following statement: "In the wake of the September 11 attacks on the United States, China has launched its own 'war on terror.' Beijing now labels as terrorists those who are fighting for an independent state in the northwestern province of Xinjiang."According to this member of the Guilford community, who has requested anonymity, resistance against the Chinese government exists in the historical memory of Xinjiang's Uighur people who vividly recall their predecessors' self-governance.The Chinese government has sought to justify its current concrete camps within the Xinjiang province. A Feb. 9 online article in Bloomberg magazine by Cagan Koc reports "the detention and 're-education' of as many as [one] million minority Muslim Uighurs in China's far west..." According to an October 2018 report from Radio Free Asia "those in the camps are detained against their will, routinely face rough treatment at the hands of their overseers, and endure poor diets and unhygienic conditions in the often overcrowded facilities."The Chinese government generally represses all religions in China, said the Guilford community member who spoke anonymously. "There is an assumption that Muslims are prone to terrorism (especially after 9/11). Many Chinese lack an understanding of Muslims...despite (the fact) that Islam came to China in the 7th Century C.E." Load-Date: February 15, 2019End of Document

Off campus, Dalai Lama talks China with studentseval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'stanforddaily_com-box-3','ezslot_1']));The Stanford Daily: Stanford UniversityJanuary 1, 2019 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1021 wordsByline: Devin BanerjeeBodyFang Zheng was 22 years old when a Chinese tank ran over his legs. It was 1989, and he was one of tens of thousands of protesters in Tiananmen Square rallying against the government's repressive policies. Fang Zheng, 44, was run over by a Chinese tank in 1989 and held captive for three years. In his first meeting with the Dalai Lama on Thursday, he asked the leader about the prospects of a Chinese democracy. (VIVIAN WONG/The Stanford Daily)On Thursday afternoon, in a quiet, shady courtyard of the Stanford Park Hotel in Menlo Park, Zheng rolled his wheelchair up to a microphone to ask Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, what the prospects of democracy are in the country where Zheng lived for four decades. Leaning forward in a red and gold chair, the Dalai Lama listened closely, furrowed his brow and then replied: "I myself hope to return to Beijing. But right now I cannot."In a rare private event during his four days in the Bay Area, the 75-year-old leader of Tibet met with Chinese and Tibetan students and scholars after giving two public lectures at Stanford the same day. For 70 minutes he spoke on the current state of China, Tibet and India, intertwining the lessons of human compassion and religious harmony that won him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 and made him one of the most recognizable figures in the world.Greeting a group of Chinese college students from Stanford and UC-Berkeley in the front row with a traditional Chinese "ni hao" greeting, the Dalai Lama immediately launched into an assessment of China's current political and social state."After 60 years, there is no civil war or external threat to China," he said. "But they have kept certain habits from the time when there was threat: suppression, censorship and too much control."Chinese censorship, particularly on the Web, has clouded the country's reputation this year, especially after Internet giant Google temporarily yanked its search engine from China-based servers in March, when it was found that Chinese hackers had attacked Google and other U.S. technology companies. The Chinese media is also heavily censored by the government."One point three billion people have the right to know the reality and to judge for themselves what's right and what's wrong," the Dalai Lama said. "Therefore the censorship is immoral. It's self-destructive."Censorship is just one part of the trust deficit that China has created, the Dalai Lama said. He compared China to India, saying both suffer from heavy corruption but India is trusted by the international community because its democratic values highlight individual freedom while China's domestic policies encourage suppression."Individual creativity of diverse people is very necessary," he said. "Look at India. For the last 60 years, there has been accountability because of democracy, rule of law and freedom of information. And there is secularism in the government-which does not mean rejection of religion, but means respect for all religions."China's trust deficit is a hindrance to talks between Tibet and the Chinese government over Tibet's autonomy. The Dalai Lama called the tension "man-made" and said it can "easily be solved" if the Chinese government understands that Tibet is not seeking separation or independence, but instead "meaningful autonomy" of governance."Sooner or later we have to talk to the Chinese government," the Dalai Lama said. "It has to be understood that we are not seeking separation. We are not seeking independence. We are seeking meaningful autonomy."Independence would refer to a Tibet that governs itself at every level without China's hand, while autonomy would refer to a Tibet that governs its internal affairs but gives international and military decision-making power to China.Speaking to the group of Chinese students in attendance, the Dalai Lama said, "You are the people who will create this century. Please think more wisely." He described groups of Chinese students who protest his visits to the U.S. with "too much emotion, too much anger.""They never listen to my explanation," he said. "Good thing I sit at a big table, otherwise they would reach over and..." He made swinging motions with his fists.At 75 years old, the Dalai Lama said he is looking toward "complete retirement." He now devotes himself to two main commitments: promoting human values through secular paths and promoting religious harmony."The future belongs to people, not necessarily governments," he said. "Basically all people want a happy life. Everyone must have a right to pursue that goal."The private meeting was organized by Tenzin Seldon '12, who made news earlier this year when it was found that her private Google e-mail account was hacked by someone with a Chinese IP address. Seldon, whose parents were born and raised in Tibet but later fled to India, is a former regional coordinator of the New York-based nonprofit Students for a Free Tibet. She worked for one of the Dalai Lama's nonprofit organizations in Dharamsala, India, over the summer, where she had the opportunity to meet the Dalai Lama and ask him to speak with Chinese and Tibetan students on his visit to the Bay Area."What struck me the most was how knowledgeable His Holiness was about the intricacies of China," Seldon said after Thursday's event. "It's quite an undertaking for a spiritual person to be on the level where he can talk about political and economic implications. This relates directly to what I went through."-Correction: In a previous version of this article, it was stated that Tenzin Seldon was born and raised in Tibet. In fact, her parents were born and raised in Tibet before fleeing to India, where Seldon was born and raised.While you're here...We're a student-run organization committed to providing hands-on experience in journalism, digital media and business for the next generation of reporters.

Internet abuse stems from school in ChinaThe Stanford Daily: Stanford UniversityJanuary 1, 2019 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 974 wordsByline: Ryan MacBodyWhen Jaehyun Park '12 glanced up at the scoreboard after the first two hours at the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ACM-ICPC) World Finals in Harbin, China last month, he was elated. Scrambling to solve rigorous computer science problems involving "theoretical and mathematical thinking," Park and two other Stanford students saw that they were in first place.Stanford's lead didn't last for long, however.By the end of the competition - one of the most prestigious in the field of computer science - the team had slipped to 14th place. Shanghai Jiaotong University eventually claimed the top spot, completing all 11 problems with a "very fast and precise" pace that Park called "just amazing."Other than that, Park knew little about the victors."I knew that they won the competition twice during last 10 years, but nothing more than that," he said.Less than three weeks after the contest, Jiaotong University was back in the headlines for its computer prowess, but instead of being lauded, the school found itself in the center of a global hacking investigation. Computer science experts and National Security Agency investigators looking to find the source of a hacking scheme - dubbed "Operation Aurora" - which targeted large companies such as Google, Adobe and Yahoo! this year, suggested that the Shanghai school had been a home base for the coordinated online attack.In the attack, unidentified hackers stole private data and accessed information in personal e-mail accounts, one of which belonged to Stanford student Tenzin Seldon '12. Google later threatened to pull operations out of China, but has since acquiesced and is currently in talks with the Chinese government regarding continued operations in the country.Investigators allege that, based on evidence, Jiaotong and Lanxiang Vocational School in China's Shandong Province were involved with Operation Aurora.For a university of Jiaotong's stature, such allegations are especially troubling and could have an immediate effect on the school's reputation. Duncan Clark, a visiting scholar with the Freeman Spogli Institute and an expert on Chinese Internet policies, said that Jiaotong, which has 33,000 students, is considered by some the Chinese equivalent of an American Ivy League university.Yet Clark was hesitant to completely blame the university or the Chinese government for the hacking scheme."Nobody knows what's going on and some people in the government don't even know what the heck is going on," he said. "There's a lot of bandwidth and computing power, but it's not necessarily well-administered [in China]."Calling the investigation into Operation Aurora an "evolving situation," Clark, however, did not rule out the possibility of government involvement or the idea that the Chinese administration knew about the attack and simply "turned a blind eye." He also suggested that highly organized students might have performed the attacks for the sake of "sport.""In the West we tend to perceive China as a highly disciplined, top-down society," Clark said of organized hackers working independently of the government. "But we realized that it's quite the opposite and rules are often broken."He went on to detail how, in another possible scenario, hackers outside the country might have employed false signs to try to frame the universities for the attacks.The Chinese schools involved have already denied allegations, with The New York Times reporting that a Jiaotong spokesperson was "shocked and indignant" about the accusations. An anonymous professor from Jiaotong's School of Information Security Engineering was quoted in the same story saying, "I'm not surprised. Actually, students hacking into foreign Web sites is quite normal."The Chinese government is no stranger to obtaining private information from corporations. In a highly publicized case in 2005, Chinese journalist Shi Tao was jailed after it was revealed that he had a sent a government document through his personal Yahoo! e-mail account.For Clark, despite all the possibilities, the nature of the cyber attack "points to a political element," which might suggest a growing hard-line approach to administration policies. The scholar said that with current economic concerns and worries of outside influence on development, uncompromising factions at the top level of the Chinese communist party have been gaining strength.With changes in positions occurring in the party in 2012, Clark said, this new faction may be taking a no-nonsense approach to dealing with outside corporations, possibly exemplified by the cyber attack. He went on to call the current faction running the government "xenophobic" and "paranoid."Yet in a country fast approaching 400 million Internet users, China's move toward heavy Web regulation and monitoring may not be a straightforward trend. Clark stated that there were many factions in the government that may be able to shift the direction of the government, a sentiment echoed by FSI scholar and sociology Prof. Xueguang Zhou."China is undergoing drastic transformation in a very short period of time," Zhou wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "In this process, the Chinese government is not monolithic; rather, the government is fragmented and faces diverse forces pushing and pulling in different directions. It is useful to understand the Chinese government, its policies and behaviors, in light of these dynamics."While you're here...We're a student-run organization committed to providing hands-on experience in journalism, digital media and business for the next generation of reporters.

US FIRMS REGISTER AS FOREIGN AGENTS OF EMBATTLED CHINESE TELECOM GIANT HUAWEIStates News ServiceMarch 22, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1003 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Center for Responsive Politics:By Anna Massoglia and Karl Evers-HillstromChina's Huawei has launched a multi-part strategy to reshape the embattled Chinese telecom giant's image through litigation, lobbying and public relations efforts.The company has signed contracts with two public relations firms, Racepoint Global and Burson Cohn and Wolfe (BCW), to head its U.S. foreign influence campaign, according to Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) filings identified by the Center for Responsive Politics' Foreign Lobby Watch tool.Huawei has spent upwards of seven figures on lobbying efforts reported under the domestic Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) in prior years but this is the first FARA disclosure by agents of the Chinese telecommunications giant.According to a FARA filing, BCW will develop a campaign to improve Huawei's reputation in the U.S. by working with business partners, advisory council members, media outlets, influencers and "key opinion leaders" with a budget of $160,000.Racepoint similarly states it will visit with analysts, influencers and media members and "draft content generation for the purpose of educating policymakers and legislators on client positions" but will "have no direct contact with government officials."Huawei agreed to pay Racepoint $55,000 per month through September 2019. On top of that monthly retainer, Huawei agreed to pay "reasonable" expenses and billing rates for individual team members of up to $320 per hour for the three managing directors. Racepoint's contract also anticipates the potential of "talent," "key opinion leaders" and "celebrity" related costs.Huawei does not appear to currently have any Facebook ads actively targeting users in the U.S., but the telecommunications giant does have ads targeting a plethora of other countries ranging from Australia to the United Arab Emirates. However, it's digital power may pivot more on less traditional internet advertising given a proliferation of social media influencers' paid posts promoting Huawei on Instagram. In January, Huawei enlisted two popular Emirati influencers for an ad for its new phone.Huawei's lobbying and public relations campaign has also reached Canada and the United Kingdom, according to lobbying records for those countries.The public relations effort comes as the U.S. pushes its allies to ban Huawei from participating in the rollout of 5G, the next generation of cellular mobile communications. The U.S. argues that Huawei could use the platform to spy for the Chinese government.The Department of Justice in January indicted Huawei and its CFO Meng Wanzhou on charges of attempting to steal trade secrets, obstructing justice, committing wire fraud and violating economic sanctions on Iran. At the heart of the U.S. case against Huawei's CFO is the company's alleged ties to two suspected shell companies.The company's contacts with media organizations suggest the foreign influence campaign is already well underway. On March 21, USA Today published an op-ed from Huawei in which the company pushes back on U.S. warnings that the company is under control of the Chinese government and therefore should not be involved in building the 5G network.On March 7, Huawei announced it has formally sued the U.S. government for enacting restrictions on Huawei products, claiming they are unfounded and unlawful.The lawsuit itself may end up shining more light on Huawei's ownership structure and relationship with the Chinese government, Peking University professor He Weifang said in a "rare interview" with the South China Morning Post."If Huawei is proved innocent by US court, it will be a big thing for Huawei, which Huawei cannot buy through mass public activities," he said.Though Huawei says it is independent of the Chinese government and would not allow the government to use its technology for espionage, national security experts aren't so sure.Jerome Cohen, a New York University School of Law professor and expert in Chinese law, told CNBC that Huawei "would have to turn over all requested data and perform whatever other surveillance activities are required" by Beijing.The new FARA disclosure stops short of insinuating Huawei is directed by the Chinese government and the firms' decision to register under FARA rather than the LDA does not necessarily insinuate as such."It is our understanding that Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. is a private, employee-owned company," Racepoint's registration records claim. Both firms say that they have requested but not yet received confirmation that Huawei is not supervised, owned, directed, controlled, financed or subsided by a foreign government.In addition to the requirement that lobbying for foreign governments be disclosed under FARA instead of the LDA, the LDA exemption to FARA registration only applies to lobbyists actually engaging in lobbying activities that do not principally benefit a foreign government or political party.In this case, it is not clear why the firms chose to register under FARA rather than the LDA. The FARA disclosures do not include definitive information as to whether the firm's activities would be considered lobbying under the LDA's definition or if they may be deemed to the principal benefit of a foreign government.The requirement that lobbying activities not be to the principal benefit of a foreign government in order to fall under the LDA exemption provides DOJ "significant leeway as to whether it applies or not," according to Joshua Rosenstein, an attorney with Sandler Reiff Lamb Rosenstein and Birkenstock.Rosenstein explained that " absent an advisory opinion, it's much safer to register under FARA" when it is not clear if the LDA exemption applies since the burden of proving the exemption applies falls on the agent if you're in a "grey area."Racepoint and BCW did not respond to requests for comment prior to publication.Feel free to distribute or cite this material, but please credit the Center for Responsive Politics.Load-Date: March 23, 2019End of Document

Chinese hackers are ramping up attacks on US companiesCNN WireFebruary 20, 2019 Wednesday 11:55 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 567 wordsByline: By Jethro Mullen, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Hackers in China have significantly stepped up attacks on US companies as the two countries have clashed over trade and technology.Top cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike saw "a big resurgence" last year in efforts by China-based groups to break into the systems of American businesses for commercial gain --- a trend that "shows no sign of stopping," said Michael Sentonas, the company's vice president of security technology.The spike in attacks on US targets --- which include telecom operators, pharmaceutical firms and hotel chains --- is "likely tied to increased tensions between the two countries," CrowdStrike said in a report published Tuesday. Chinese attacks on US companies had fallen away in recent years after the two governments agreed in 2015 not to conduct cybertheft of trade secrets and intellectual property against one another for commercial gain. That drop-off now "appears to have been reversed," CrowdStrike said.Tensions between the United States and China escalated sharply last year as Washington slapped heavy tariffs on huge swathes of Chinese exports and cracked down on some of the country's top tech companies, including Huawei and ZTE. Cybertheft is one of the key US complaints against China in the dispute over trade and technology.The Chinese government has repeatedly denied any involvement in cyberattacks.Even after US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping agreed to a truce in the trade war in December, the American government continued to pressure Beijing on cybertheft. The US Justice Department charged two Chinese nationals in late December, accusing them of participating in a global hacking scheme to steal business secrets as part of a campaign allegedly directed by the Chinese government. Following the indictments, the Chinese Foreign Ministry urged the US government to "stop smearing China on cybersecurity and withdraw the so-called charges against Chinese nationals to avoid causing serious damage to China-US relations."The intensified US pressure on Huawei has also strained relations between the two countries. Washington is pushing American allies to ban Huawei from participating in super-fast 5G networks, saying its equipment could be used by the Chinese government for spying. US prosecutors have also brought charges against Huawei and one of its top executives over alleged bank fraud and sanctions evasion. Huawei rejects the claims that its products pose a security risk and denies all the US charges.Hackers in China are showing particular interest in targeting telecommunications operators around the world, according to CrowdStrike. That's a sensitive issue a time when many governments, under pressure from the United States, are debating whether using Huawei equipment in next-generation wireless networks poses a security risk.Telecommunications operators are a popular target for hackers because they "have an amazing amount of information" on the general public and other organizations like governments and businesses, Sentonas said.Companies in the hospitality industry come under frequent attack for similar reasons, he added.The US government last year attributed to China the hack of Marriott's Starwood hotel chain, which potentially exposed the personal information of approximately 500 million guests.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

'UNPRECEDENTED DANGER': Billionaire investor George Soros just went scorched Earth on China during his annual Davos speechBusiness Insider USJanuary 24, 2019 Thursday 05:04 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1009 wordsByline: jciolli@businessinsider.com,  (Joe Ciolli)Highlight: Billionaire investor George Soros warned a crowd at Davos about the "mortal danger facing open societies," and took China's government to task.BodyBusiness InsiderAP Images• George Soros, the billionaire investor and chairman of Soros Fund Management, delivered his annual speech at the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland.• Soros absolutely unloaded on China and President Xi Jinping, warning the audience of the "unprecedented danger" the world faces at the hands of the emerging nation.• Soros also doubled down on comments made during his 2018 address, which saw him criticize "IT monopolies" like Facebook and Google. He believes that their behavior is enabling China's quest for a closed society.DAVOS, Switzerland - George Soros has made a tradition out of giving a big speech at the World Economic Forum's            Annual Meeting.And based on how the last two years have gone, he's not in the business of making friends - especially not in the Chinese government.The 2019 version of this - delivered on Thursday evening - featured Soros absolutely unloading on the emerging nation. After briefly greeting attendees, the billionaire investor and chairman of Soros Fund Management launched straight into his prepared spiel."I want to use my time tonight to warn the world about an unprecedented danger that's threatening the very survival of open societies," he said.He continued: "I want to call attention to the mortal danger facing open societies from the instruments of control that machine learning and artificial intelligence can put in the hands of repressive regimes. I'll focus on China, where Xi Jinping wants a one-party state to reign supreme."And with that, Soros was off and running.Read more: Legendary billionaire Ray Dalio told a crowd at Davos that the next economic meltdown scared him more than anything - here's what he said, and why he's so worriedAt the center of his anti-China argument was the concept of a centralized database of personal information called a "social credit system."While Soros acknowledged that such a set-up doesn't yet exist, he said he fears the capabilities afforded by the world's technology heavyweights will hasten its arrival - and, in the process, dismantle what remains of an open society.The speech was similar in tone to the one delivered by Soros in 2018, which saw him lament the global dominance of tech titans like Facebook and            Google. He called them a "menace," and warned that their insatiable thirst for growth could eventually lead them to collaborate with authoritarian regimes like China.Soros' latest comments pushed that discussion further, and explored the aftermath of a global environment where China's move away from an open society succeeded in full.Read more: 'World power is shifting': A self-made Lebanese billionaire explains why all the best business opportunities are in the East, even as the trade war rages"My key point is that the combination of repressive regimes with IT monopolies endows those regimes with a built-in advantage over open societies," Soros said. "The instruments of control are useful tools in the hands of authoritarian regimes, but they pose a mortal threat."He continued: "China isn't the only authoritarian regime in the world, but it's undoubtedly the wealthiest, strongest and most developed in machine learning and artificial intelligence. This makes Xi Jinping the most dangerous opponent of those who believe in the concept of open society."What the US can do about the China situationWhen President Donald Trump embarked upon his ongoing Chinese trade crusade, Soros was pleased. In his mind, China needed to be challenged before it was too late, and Trump was taking a step in the right direction.However, according to Soros, the president's follow-through has been disappointing. He noted that Trump's political desires made him more amenable to compromise, while he should've been taking a harder stance.So what can the US do to play hardball and keep Xi from executing this nefarious closed-society plan? Soros outlined a pair of ideas.First, he said that the ongoing global trade war should be focused solely on China. While it appears to be fairly targeted at the moment, Soros argued Trump should forget about other nations entirely.Second, Soros said the US's handling of ZTE and Huawei - the two state-sponsored Chinese companies that recently came under fire for intellectual property theft, among other things - should be fierce. He wants the US to crack down on them.But Soros' ultimate vision involves some sort of global agreement that puts tensions to rest. Allow him to explain:"It is possible to dream of something similar to the United Nations Treaty that arose out of the Second World War," Soros said. "This would be the appropriate ending to the current cycle of conflict between the US and China. It would reestablish international cooperation and allow open societies to flourish."Now read:Legendary billionaire Ray Dalio told a crowd at Davos that the next economic meltdown scared him more than anything - here's what he said, and why he's so worried'World power is shifting': A self-made Lebanese billionaire explains why all the best business opportunities are in the East, even as the trade war ragesA $2 trillion strategist unravels why a 'pain trade' that crushed investors over the past year is perfectly primed for a comebackA $1 trillion strategist lays out the looming worst-case scenario of the government shutdown and how investors should safeguard their moneyNOW WATCH: What will happen when Earth's north and south poles flipSee Also:• 'World power is shifting': A self-made Lebanese billionaire explains why all the best business opportunities are in the East, even as the trade war rages• A $2 trillion investment chief at Davos reveals a massive trade-war risk everyone is missing - and shares how his firm is protecting itself• The world's CEOs are getting increasingly nervous about the state of the global economy, a major new survey showsSEE ALSO: Legendary billionaire Ray Dalio told a crowd at Davos that the next economic meltdown scared him more than anything - here's what he said, and why he's so worriedLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

Rep. Smith Introduces Legislation to Counter China's Harmful Political InfluenceTargeted News ServiceMarch 18, 2019 Monday 8:06 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 492 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Chris Smith, R-New Jersey, issued the following news release:Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), Ranking Member of the House Subcommittee on Global Human Rights and International Organizations, reintroduced legislation (HR 1811) on Monday to counter malign political operations in the U.S. conducted by the Chinese government."Beijing's influence operations are sophisticated and threatening. They include efforts to coerce and corrupt U.S. interests, institutions and individuals, while fostering attitudes and outcomes favorable to the Chinese Communist Party," Smith said. "My bill would help ensure that Congress and the American public are fully informed of China's malign goals, and would help identify the key institutions, entities, and individuals that carry out these activities."Smith's legislation requires an unclassified U.S. government interagency report on political influence operations of the Chinese Communist Party within the U.S., in order to examine the scope of the threat from China as well as to establish accountability and transparency.The bill also includes policy statements requiring Confucius Institutes and other Chinese government funded entities to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. These institutes--of which there are approximately 100 in the United States--are educational programs set up at American schools where the Chinese government approves teachers, directors, events, and speakers.A recent GAO report--that Smith requested--found serious concerns about academic censorship at Confucius Institutes of topics that could feature criticism of China, such as the "Three T's" of Taiwan, Tibet, and Tiananmen. Another report on Confucius Institutes by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations also said that contracts between teachers and the Chinese government could be terminated if teachers 'violate Chinese laws,' 'engage in activities detrimental to national interests,' or 'participate in illegal organizations.'"As a recent GAO report shows, when tailored by the Chinese government, programs at universities can be synonymous with academic malware seeking to influence young minds. There are serious and well-founded concerns about academic censorship and self-censorship at these institutes," Smith said.Smith chaired two hearings in 2014 and 2015 on academic freedom and Chinese influence in the U.S., and called for an unclassified government report on Confucius Institutes.Smith's legislation also supports the protection of the Chinese-American community and members of the Chinese, Uyghur, and Tibetan diasporas from being targeted by China's political influence operations."We need to empower Chinese-Americans and visiting Chinese students with the knowledge that coercion and threats from Beijing are an unacceptable intrusion of their civil liberties and will not be tolerated," Smith said.Contact: Matt Hadro, 202/225-3765Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6655093 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 19, 2019End of Document

Another report on Confucius Institutes by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations also said that contracts between teachers and the Chinese government could be terminated if teachers 'violate Chinese laws,' 'engage in activities detrimental to national interests,' or 'participate in illegal organizations.'"As a recent GAO report shows, when tailored by the Chinese government, programs at universities can be synonymous with academic malware seeking to influence young minds. There are serious and well-founded concerns about academic censorship and self-censorship at these institutes," Smith said.Smith chaired two hearings in 2014 and 2015 on academic freedom and Chinese influence in the U.S., and called for an unclassified government report on Confucius Institutes.Smith's legislation also supports the protection of the Chinese-American community and members of the Chinese, Uyghur, and Tibetan diasporas from being targeted by China's political influence operations."We need to empower Chinese-Americans and visiting Chinese students with the knowledge that coercion and threats from Beijing are an unacceptable intrusion of their civil liberties and will not be tolerated," Smith said.Load-Date: March 18, 2019End of Document

MEDIA OUTLET MONITORING UYGHUR PERSECUTION IN CHINA VOWS TO CONTINUE WORK DESPITE BAN, ARRESTSStates News ServiceJanuary 31, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 915 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:The director of an online magazine that monitors religious freedom in China has vowed to continue his organization's work documenting the oppression of Uyghurs in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), despite the arrest and interrogation of dozens of its contributors in recent months.Bitter Winter, a website launched in May 2018 by the Italian research center CESNUR, routinely publishes articles by scholars on the state of religion in China, as well as testimonies from victims of religious persecution, and photos and video documenting human rights violations submitted by citizen journalists from inside the country.In August 2018, China banned Bitter Winter and since then, the organization has said that at least 45 of its contributors have faced arrest and interrogation based on charges of "divulging state secrets" or "involvement in infiltration by foreign forces" for filming incidents of, or gathering news about, the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) persecution of religious freedom and violation of human rights.Some of the reporters, according to Bitter Winter, have been sent to for mandatory indoctrination at political "re-education camps," where authorities are believed to have detained up to 1.1 million Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities accused of harboring "strong religious views" and "politically incorrect" ideas throughout the XUAR since April 2017.At least one contributor, from the XUAR, was arrested at the end of September 2018 after filming one of the camps and producing an investigative report into the camp network. His whereabouts are unknown.Speaking to RFA's Uyghur Service, Italian journalist and Bitter Winter director Marco Respinti said that having contributors on the ground providing content from inside of China is what "makes us different from other publications," but acknowledges that the work is dangerous."We have reporters in Xinjiang sending out pictures and sometimes even videos from inside the camps, but for obvious reasons, we don't disclose their identities," he said, adding that "they do that at the risk of their own lives.""Bitter Winter is very youngit was founded in May [2018]but we already have had huge success. We owe all of this success to our reporters and correspondents who live in China and make us different."Respinti said that religious freedom and human rights "are a big problem in China," but called the situation facing Uyghurs in the XUAR "particularly astonishing to us."He noted that the detainees in re-education camps have been taken into custody because of their faith and because the Chinese government is "trying to completely erase the Uyghur presence" in the XUAR, and said Bitter Winter is devoted to revealing the truth about what is happening in the region.Meanwhile, Respinti said, China's government has gone on the attack against his website.In addition to arrests and detentions of its contributors, Bitter Winter has been the target of repeated hacking attacks since its launch that he believes originated in China."Of course [China's government is] not very happy, and this is good for us because it means that we are doing the right thing," he said."They are not happy with being exposed."But the journalist said that Bitter Winter will continue with its mission of informing the international community about the persecution of all religion in China, with a focus on the Uyghurs, no matter the cost."We say there is hope out there, but of course we cannot think that the problem is over," Respinti said."We're happy if just one Uyghur can find some relief because of the information work that we do daily, but there are still thousands and thousands of them suffering, so we must keep on," he added."Until the last person ... is ill-treated because of his or her faith, we will perform our duty of denouncing the situation. We will never shut up."Camp networkThough Beijing initially denied the existence of re-education camps, Shohrat Zakir, chairman of the XUAR, told China's official Xinhua news agency in October 2018 that the facilities are an effective tool to protect the country from terrorism and provide vocational training for Uyghurs.Reporting by RFA's Uyghur Service and other media organizations, however, has shown that those in the camps are detained against their will and subjected to political indoctrination, routinely face rough treatment at the hands of their overseers, and endure poor diets and unhygienic conditions in the often overcrowded facilities.Adrian Zenz, a lecturer in social research methods at the Germany-based European School of Culture and Theology, has said that some 1.1 million people are or have been detained in the campsequating to 10 to 11 percent of the adult Muslim population of the XUAR.In November 2018, Scott Busby, the deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor at the U.S. Department of State, said there are "at least 800,000 and possibly up to a couple of million" Uyghurs and others detained at re-education camps in the XUAR without charges, citing U.S. intelligence assessments.Citing credible reports, U.S. lawmakers Marco Rubio and Chris Smith, who head the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China, recently called the situation in the XUAR "the largest mass incarceration of a minority population in the world today."Reported by Zulhayat Mamut for RFA's Uyghur Service.

CHINA DENIES 'TIT-FOR-TAT' WARNING TO MANILAStates News ServiceFebruary 28, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 435 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:China denied on Thursday that it had threatened to retaliate against Manila should the government deport Chinese migrants found to be working illegally in the Philippines.The statement came as President Rodrigo Duterte's congressional allies and opponents expressed dismay at his comments earlier this week that were seen as virtually surrendering Manila's right to expel Chinese workers.His spokesman, Salvador Panelo, had claimed that Chinese Ambassador Zhao Jianhua had warned him recently that China would deport Filipinos if the Duterte government expelled its citizens."The Chinese Embassy in the Philippines did not say that Beijing would adopt a 'tit-for-tat' approach," the embassy said in a statement Thursday, emphasizing that it respected Philippine laws and Chinese nationals found to be violating them would be punished."China respects the laws and regulations of the Philippines regarding employment of foreign nationals in the country, and holds that Chinese nationals should not stay or work illegally in foreign countries including the Philippines," the embassy said.The statement said Chinese law-enforcement agencies would also continue to monitor foreign nationals working illegally in China.The controversy arose after the Philippine Department of Public Works and Highways recently disclosed that dozens of Chinese workers were working on at least two construction projects funded by Beijing under the Filipino government's massive infrastructure drive.Duterte added to the debate when he said that Manila risked angering China if the government moved to expel the illegal workers.The Philippine leader is widely seen as pro-Chinese, and has taken steps to ingratiate the country to Beijing in the face of territorial wrangling in the South China Sea.Since becoming president three years ago, Duterte had welcomed an influx of Chinese investments and tourists, and politically veered toward closer military and diplomatic ties to Beijing, away from traditional defense ally the United States.But some of his allies and the country's defense establishment have cautioned against closer ties with China. Of late, there have been concerns that China was moving to gain control of a former American naval base north of Manila fronting the South China Sea.More than 300,000 Filipinos work legally in China and Hong Kong. In the Philippines, about half of the 169,000 work permits given to foreign nationals during the past three years went to Chinese citizens, officials said.Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Load-Date: March 1, 2019End of Document

Australian citizen Yang Heungjun feared detained by ChinaUPIJanuary 23, 2019 Wednesday 4:44 AM ESTCopyright 2019 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 266 wordsByline: DARRYL COOTEDateline: Dec. 31 BodyThe Australian government is investigating the claim that one of its citizens may have been detained by China.Former Chinese diplomat, novelist and outspoken critic of the Chinese government Yang Heungjun has not been heard from since before Jan. 19, when he was supposed to have landed in Shanghai from Guangzhou, the Guardian reported.He was traveling with his wife and children.Friends are worried that he may have been detained by China on security charges, the Washington Post reported.Yang's possible detention follows China having separately detained Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor in December on national security charges, in what is seen as retaliation for Canada having arrested Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou.Wanzhou is facing extradition to the U.S. on suspicion of having violated trade sanctions against Iran, and it has been widely reported that the states is moving ahead with extradition proceedings.Two Friends of Yang told the Washington Post that Yang's wife had told them that she had been questioned in Guangzhou and that Yang had been detained. Before she, too, fell out of contact she sent friends a picture of the Beijing airport without any explanation, singling that she had traveled to the Chinese capital."My judgement is this is linked directly to the Huawei case," said Feng, one of Yang's friends who spoke with the Washington Post.The Australia Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told the Guardian that it was seeking information on an Australian citizen missing in china but due to privacy concerns, it could not give further comment.Load-Date: January 24, 2019End of Document

XINJIANG AUTHORITIES FREE 'MODEL CHINESE' PARENTS OF UYGHUR EXILE FOLLOWING MEDIA INTERVIEWSStates News ServiceMarch 29, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1128 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:The parents of a Uyghur journalist living in Sweden have been released from detention in northwest China's Xinjiang Autonomous Region (XUAR) after she spoke with the media about the persecution they faced at the hands of local authorities, despite having spent their careers as loyal civil servants.In a posting to her Twitter account on Thursday, Zulhumar Isaac wrote that her mother, Zohra Talip, and father, Isaac Payzulla, had returned to their home in the seat of the XUAR's Kumul (in Chinese, Hami) prefecture after spending more than four months in regional political "re-education camps.""Just now I had a video chat with my parents," wrote Isaac, a 31-year-old reporter who moved to Sweden in 2017 after living for 10 years in China's capital Beijing and marrying an ethnic majority Han Chinese man."Papa said he shaved his head because the weather [is] getting too hot. Mama was super pale. But they are at home."The tweet marked an end to months of desperation for Isaacone of many Uyghurs in exile who has worried about the fate of their relatives back home in the XUAR after learning about their detention in the camp network, where up to 1.5 million Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities accused of harboring "strong religious views" and "politically incorrect" ideas have been held since April 2017.News of the release of Isaac's parents came less than a week after she spoke with RFA's Uyghur Service about their detention, despite having lived "ideal" lives serving the Chinese government.Isaac's mother was detained on Nov. 5, 2018, and her father was arrested nearly two weeks later, she said at the time."A Chinese police officer called my aunt and told her to bring money and clothing for them, so she delivered what was asked for," she said."But [my aunt] didn't know where my parents were being detained, or whether or not she could visit them ... The government and the police never gave us a reason for their detention."Isaac said both of her parents had graduated from the Northwestern Nationalities University in Gansu province's capital Lanzhou before working at the Kumul Daily newspaper, followed by the Ethnic and Religious Commission in their hometown, and retiring in 2017."China claims it is fighting terrorism in XUAR and, unfortunately, many people in the West believe such lies," she said."If China was fighting terrorism, why would authorities detain my parents, who had sacrificed their lives working for the Chinese government, and were retirees?"'Model citizens'Isaac told RFA that having a Han Chinese family member and living as "model Chinese citizens" failed to protect her parents from being detained."My father was taken while I was organizing for my Han Chinese in-laws to visit the Chinese government and police officials in our area, to show them that our family has a Han Chinese connection," she said.In an earlier interview with The Diplomat, Isaac had described her family as having "never quite identified as typical Uyghurs, nor followed the cultural practices.""But because of that, we grew up like misfits both ways," she said, recalling how an elementary school classmate was advised by her mother to refrain from talking to Uyghurs.Authorities in the XUAR regularly detain those they accuse of being "two-faced officials"a term applied by the government to ethnic minority cadres who pay lip service to Communist Party rule, but secretly chafe against state policies repressing members of their ethnic group.Reports suggest that authorities are detaining as many Uyghurs as possible in re-education camps and jails regardless of their age, prior service to the Communist Party, or the severity of the accusations against themas part of a bid to satisfy "quotas" ordered by the regional government.Those who fail to meet the detention quotas face official scrutiny and, in some cases, are sent off to the camps themselves.Uyghur sources in exile say cases of "two-faced officials" in the XUAR show that not even those Uyghurs who pledge allegiance to the state are safe from its policies against their ethnic group.For Uyghurs living abroad, speaking out about detained relatives in the XUAR can be a harrowing ordeal because they fear that doing so may lead to further harassment of family members by authorities back home, and possibly worse treatment for those in custody."Some people told me to be quiet about this," Isaac told RFA, when asked about why she had chosen to speak with the media about her parents' situation."But I could no longer live a normal life, because I don't even know if my parents are alive."Camp networkThough Beijing initially denied the existence of re-education camps, Shohrat Zakir, chairman of the XUAR, told China's official Xinhua news agency in October 2018 that the facilities are an effective tool to protect the country from terrorism and provide vocational training for Uyghurs.China recently organized two visits to monitor re-education camps in the XUARone for a small group of foreign journalists, and another for diplomats from non-Western countries, including Russia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan and Thailandduring which officials dismissed claims about mistreatment and poor conditions in the facilities as "slanderous lies."Reporting by RFA's Uyghur Service and other media organizations, however, has shown that those in the camps are detained against their will and subjected to political indoctrination, routinely face rough treatment at the hands of their overseers, and endure poor diets and unhygienic conditions in the often overcrowded facilities.Adrian Zenz, a lecturer in social research methods at the Germany-based European School of Culture and Theology, earlier this month said that some 1.5 million people are or have been detained in the campsequivalent to just under 1 in 6 members of the adult Muslim population of the XUARafter initially putting the number at 1.1 million.Michael Kozak, the head of the State Department's human rights and democracy bureau, in an apparent reference to the policies of Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union, last week said people "haven't seen things like this since the 1930s" and called the internment of more than a million Uyghurs "one of the most serious human rights violations in the world today."In November 2018, Scott Busby, the deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor at the U.S. Department of State, said there are "at least 800,000 and possibly up to a couple of million" Uyghurs and others detained at re-education camps in the XUAR without charges, citing U.S. intelligence assessments.Reported by Adile Ablet for RFA's Uyghur Service.

How bad is China's economic slump? It's impossible to tellCNN WireFebruary 12, 2019 Tuesday 1:59 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 972 wordsByline: Analysis by Daniel Shane, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Companies and executives around the world are desperately trying to gauge the severity of China's economic slowdown. But getting a clear picture is very difficult.Growth in the world's second-biggest economy cooled last year to its lowest level in almost three decades, according to government data. Top global brands including Apple and Caterpillar have blamed weakness in China for their disappointing earnings. The situation could be even bleaker than China's official statistics suggest, according to many analysts."The Chinese published GDP numbers are absolute garbage," said Leland Miller, CEO of advisory firm China Beige Book. "It's certainly the consensus that these numbers are unreliable."His firm gathers data from thousands of companies across different industries in China to come up with its own picture of what's happening, drawing its name from the US Federal Reserve's Beige Book report. Miller said the Chinese economy is "much, much weaker" at the moment than Chinese government figures suggest and things are unlikely to turn around anytime soon. Figuring out the likely length and depth of the slump is important for businesses making decisions on investments and hiring, and for investors working out where to put their money. China is grappling with the fallout from government efforts to crack down on risky lending and the trade war with the United States.Some experts suspect China's National Bureau of Statistics, which reports much of the country's data, is more focused on making the government look good rather than giving an accurate reflection of its economic health.The bureau is a "Communist Party organ first and an honest statistical broker second," Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, wrote in a recent blog post.It's difficult to determine China's true rate of growth, as a lot of government data "don't make sense," according to Scissors, who is also chief economist at China Beige Book. For example, the numbers on the economy's size compared with the average income of Chinese citizens don't tally, he said.Plenty of other analysts resort to their own metrics to get a sense of how the economy is doing. Research firm Capital Economics examines a range of data including sea freight, electricity generation and financial lending to come up with a proxy indicator. Based on that, China's economy may have only grown by around 5% last year rather than the official rate of 6.6%.The slowdown has cast gloom over Chinese businesses. "The economy will get increasingly worse in the coming months," said Wei Bingyu, the owner of an industrial paint factory in Beijing. He blamed the difficulties on the trade war and other issues.A closely watched independent survey that measures the health of China's huge manufacturing sector sank to its lowest level in nearly three years last month. Chinese consumers feeling the squeezeInvestors are scrutinizing the economy for signs of weakness, which have so far included declining industrial profits and falling exports.The behavior of Chinese consumers is a key focus. Spending by Chinese shoppers rose by almost 10% last year, according to official data. But the country's huge car market shrank in 2018 for the first time in around 20 years, and retail sales over the Lunar New Year holiday this month grew at their slowest pace in more than a decade.Official Chinese data is likely "overstating consumption growth," Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, said in a recent note to clients. He estimated that consumer spending in China's big urban areas shrank by about 3% last year, suggesting middle-class shoppers are tightening their belts.That tallies with what some business owners are saying. Zhou Chang, the owner of a gym in central Beijing, told CNN that his customers are spending less.Using a gym "is not quite like eating, clothing, housing or commuting," Zhou said. "Those are must-haves, while bodybuilding is not." As the economy slows, "many gyms have temporarily shut down or gone bankrupt," he added.Is stimulus going where it's needed?The Chinese government says fears over the economic slowdown are overblown. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, Vice President Wang Qishan urged investors to stop freaking out about the economy. "There will be a lot of uncertainties in 2019, but something that is certain is that China's growth will continue and will be sustainable," he said.But Chinese officials have shown signs of concern. They have attempted to boost growth through measures like tax cuts, more infrastructure spending and looser monetary policy. It's still unclear how much the moves will do to halt the slowdown because a lot of the extra funds they free up go to inefficient state-run enterprises rather than private businesses, analysts say.Many private companies in China typically rely on shadow financing, murky forms of lending that are kept off banks' official balance sheets. Regulators have cracked down on those practices in recent years."It is extremely difficult to get financial leverage as a private business," said Guo Yucheng, the owner of a drug manufacturing business in the northern province of Jilin. He recently merged his company with a government-owned one in order to improve his chances of gaining access to financing. He predicted it will take as long as two years for measures like tax cuts to make a real difference for struggling companies."There are so many businesses, like ours, who are trying to just get by every month," Guo said. "Private businesses are going through a long winter." Serenitie Wang, Julia Horowitz, Lily Lee and Eduardo Baptista contributed to this report. TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

China wants soft power but censorship is stifling its film industryCNN WireMarch 21, 2019 Thursday 4:22 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1267 wordsByline: By Eduardo Baptista, CNNDateline: BEIJING (CNN) BodyBEIJING (CNN) --  Beijing-based film director Huang Han has had one of the worst weeks of his life, courtesy of the Chinese government's strict censors.He says his independent, low-budget romance flick, set for an online domestic release in 2019, has been hit by an insoluble problem: how to show the male protagonist smoking without giving the cigarette screen time. It might seem like a bizarre problem but a crackdown on "excessive smoking scenes" is just one of a growing number of restrictions imposed by the Chinese Communist Party on the country's film and television industry."The government's inspection of films has been getting stricter," says Huang, 30, who spoke under a pseudonym to avoid damaging his career. "Only the really famous directors might get a pass. All the rest of us have to follow strict protocol." In 2014, President Xi Jinping called for a stronger national effort to boost China's global popularity in proportion to its economic rise. "We should increase China's soft power, give a good Chinese narrative and better communicate China's message to the world," he said. Last month, China had an unexpected win in this arena, after Netflix announced that it would stream Chinese sci-fi blockbuster "The Wandering Earth," which grossed nearly $700 million at the global box office, in more than 190 countries. But that's a rare case of a Chinese hit at home making it abroad.Unless the Communist Party relaxes its censorship of domestic films, experts say Beijing's dreams of wielding Chinese soft power globally through its film industry could stall.Matthias Niedenführ, media specialist at the University of Tubingen's China Center, says a top-down government-dictated approach is unlikely to produce popular international hits."French film, Korean TV and Japanese anime are all creative products that are the result of a creative environment and bottom-up processes," he says. "The irony is that China desperately wants international recognition."Hip-hop, tattoos and blurred earsThe steady encroachment of censorship has been sapping Chinese filmmakers' creativity for years.Western lifestyles, cleavage, homosexuality and time travel were strongly discouraged in guidelines laid out in 2016. Then in January 2018, China's censorship bureau, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film, and Television (SAPPRFT), launched an attack on the country's burgeoning sub-cultures.In a directive, all state broadcasters were banned from employing any performers who promoted "decadent culture," and the portrayal of hip-hop and tattoos was strongly condemned. In January 2019, Chinese regulators appeared to begin blurring the ears of men who were wearing earrings. Huang says these restrictions have stifled a range of genres that were previously guaranteed money-makers, such as Japanese-style horror movies, his own specialty."Superstitions are not well received during inspection (of a film). An unofficial rule is that ghosts are only allowed to appear if a character is dreaming," he says."Censors now expect films to have a strong educational component, that can provide positive energy for young Chinese.""Positive energy" is a catch-all term, commonly used by Chinese politicians and state media, to encourage an optimistic, pro-government attitude in the country's films and television programs.Film directors seem to be listening -- and falling in line with the government can be lucrative. China's highest-grossing movie in 2018 was "Operation Red Sea," which made $5.7 billion at the domestic box office and told the story of a Chinese naval unit's glorious rescue mission off the coast of Africa. Soft power at home ... but not awayWhile Chinese films are popular with domestic audiences, so are movies from Hollywood.For three weeks in January, "Bumblebee" -- part of the Transformers franchise -- topped the country's box office. In February, the American movie "Alita: Battle Angel" was extremely popular, while this month "Captain Marvel" has been a hit with audiences. The US film industry is successful in China -- likely to become the world's largest cinema market in coming years, according to industry insiders -- even though regulators only allow a limited number of foreign films to be screened each year. China has not enjoyed the same success in Western markets. Italian film director Gianluigi Perrone says that is because while Hollywood films often also carry a patriotic message, it is done with greater subtlety."The 'soft power' in US films has been very subliminal and subtle since the post-WW2 era," says Perrone, who has experienced censorship in China. "The messages in Chinese films have to be so explicit that it's too direct for Western audiences. It overcomes the entertaining part." Consequently, some independent filmmakers who want to create more nuanced films are bypassing the domestic market. Chinese-American director Hao Wu's documentary on China's live streaming phenomenon, "People's Republic of Desire," for example, has been aired outside China, picking up several international awards at prestigious events such as SXSW and the Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival. It has yet to be shown in China, due to the government's disapproval of live streaming after a crackdown in late 2017. But that tactic doesn't always avoid the wrath of the censors.In February, renowned Chinese director Zhang Yimou's film "One Second" was unexpectedly withdrawn from the 69th Berlinale film festival. According to the film's official Weibo account, it was taken off the program at the last minute due to "technical reasons" -- a term that is often code for government censorship. The movie depicts the Cultural Revolution, a sensitive period in Chinese history.Popularity no saviorEven huge popularity is no longer enough to save a director or a seemingly anodyne piece of entertainment from the censor's gaze.The "Story of Yanxi Palace" was watched by more than half a billion Chinese viewers in a single day last August. It has been streamed more than 15 billion times and was the most Googled TV show in 2018. But in January, a state-run newspaper ran an editorial criticizing its "negative influence on society," noting that characters in the period drama set in the court of the Qianlong Emperor were more popular than communist heroes in state propaganda.Shortly after the editorial, several local TV stations unexpectedly canceled rebroadcasts of the show."(Chinese TV) regulators know that with the January shafting of these shows they are slaughtering one of the few cash cows that could bring China soft power," says Niedenführ, of the University of Tubingen. "But Beijing currently clearly prefers domestic social engineering over increased publicity abroad."There is no sign that Beijing will ease its censorship anytime soon. When asked about the shock cancellation of the Berlin premiere of "One Second," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying avoided the question."I know the hottest movie now is 'The Wandering Earth,'" she said, directing viewers to a film with a more pro-China narrative. "I don't know if you have watched or not. I'd recommend it."Today, directors who want to create independent or unconventional films in China must either sterilize their work or look elsewhere for a successful audience, says Huang. It remains to be seen how that will further China's push to increase its soft power abroad."I don't think this new genre of 'positive energy' films can be well received outside the country," Huang says.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Then in January 2018, China's censorship bureau, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film, and Television (SAPPRFT), launched an attack on the country's burgeoning sub-cultures.In a directive, all state broadcasters were banned from employing any performers who promoted "decadent culture," and the portrayal of hip-hop and tattoos was strongly condemned.In January 2019, Chinese regulators appeared to begin blurring the ears of men who were wearing earrings.Huang says these restrictions have stifled a range of genres that were previously guaranteed money-makers, such as Japanese-style horror movies, his own specialty."Superstitions are not well received during inspection (of a film). An unofficial rule is that ghosts are only allowed to appear if a character is dreaming," he says."Censors now expect films to have a strong educational component, that can provide positive energy for young Chinese.""Positive energy" is a catch-all term, commonly used by Chinese politicians and state media, to encourage an optimistic, pro-government attitude in the country's films and television programs.Film directors seem to be listening -- and falling in line with the government can be lucrative.China's highest-grossing movie in 2018 was "Operation Red Sea," which made $5.7 billion at the domestic box office and told the story of a Chinese naval unit's glorious rescue mission off the coast of Africa.Soft power at home ... but not awayWhile Chinese films are popular with domestic audiences, so are movies from Hollywood.For three weeks in January, "Bumblebee" -- part of the Transformers franchise -- topped the country's box office. In February, the American movie "Alita: Battle Angel" was extremely popular, while this month "Captain Marvel" has been a hit with audiences.The US film industry is successful in China -- likely to become the world's largest cinema market in coming years, according to industry insiders -- even though regulators only allow a limited number of foreign films to be screened each year.China has not enjoyed the same success in Western markets. Italian film director Gianluigi Perrone says that is because while Hollywood films often also carry a patriotic message, it is done with greater subtlety."The 'soft power' in US films has been very subliminal and subtle since the post-WW2 era," says Perrone, who has experienced censorship in China. "The messages in Chinese films have to be so explicit that it's too direct for Western audiences. It overcomes the entertaining part."Consequently, some independent filmmakers who want to create more nuanced films are bypassing the domestic market.Chinese-American director Hao Wu's documentary on China's live streaming phenomenon, "People's Republic of Desire," for example, has been aired outside China, picking up several international awards at prestigious events such as SXSW and the Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival. It has yet to be shown in China, due to the government's disapproval of live streaming after a crackdown in late 2017.But that tactic doesn't always avoid the wrath of the censors.In February, renowned Chinese director Zhang Yimou's film "One Second" was unexpectedly withdrawn from the 69th Berlinale film festival.According to the film's official Weibo account, it was taken off the program at the last minute due to "technical reasons" -- a term that is often code for government censorship. The movie depicts the Cultural Revolution, a sensitive period in Chinese history.Popularity no saviorEven huge popularity is no longer enough to save a director or a seemingly anodyne piece of entertainment from the censor's gaze.The "Story of Yanxi Palace" was watched by more than half a billion Chinese viewers in a single day last August. It has been streamed more than 15 billion times and was the most Googled TV show in 2018.But in January, a state-run newspaper ran an editorial criticizing its "negative influence on society," noting that characters in the period drama set in the court of the Qianlong Emperor were more popular than communist heroes in state propaganda.Shortly after the editorial, several local TV stations unexpectedly canceled rebroadcasts of the show."(Chinese TV) regulators know that with the January shafting of these shows they are slaughtering one of the few cash cows that could bring China soft power," says NiedenfÃ¼hr, of the University of Tubingen. "But Beijing currently clearly prefers domestic social engineering over increased publicity abroad."There is no sign that Beijing will ease its censorship anytime soon. When asked about the shock cancellation of the Berlin premiere of "One Second," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying avoided the question."I know the hottest movie now is 'The Wandering Earth,'" she said, directing viewers to a film with a more pro-China narrative. "I don't know if you have watched or not. I'd recommend it."Today, directors who want to create independent or unconventional films in China must either sterilize their work or look elsewhere for a successful audience, says Huang.It remains to be seen how that will further China's push to increase its soft power abroad."I don't think this new genre of 'positive energy' films can be well received outside the country," Huang says.Load-Date: March 22, 2019End of Document

China tells US to stop 'unreasonable crackdown' on HuaweiThe Daily Universe: Brigham Young UniversityJanuary 29, 2019 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD; Pg. 1Length: 1030 wordsBodyChina has called on the United States to 'stop the unreasonable crackdown' on Huawei following the tech giant's indictment on charges of stealing technology, violating trade sanctions and lying to banks. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)China called on the U.S. government on Tuesday to "stop the unreasonable crackdown" on Huawei after the U.S. stepped up pressure on the tech giant by indicting it on charges of stealing technology and violating sanctions on Iran, complicating high-level trade talks between the countries about to begin in Washington.The Chinese government will "firmly defend" its companies, a foreign ministry statement said. It gave no indication whether Beijing might retaliate for the charges against Huawei, China's first global tech brand and the biggest maker of switching gear for phone and internet companies.U.S. pressure on China is set to intensify further when intelligence chiefs brief Congress Tuesday on worldwide threats, which are expected to include Chinese cyberespionage and Huawei.The charges could dim prospects for U.S.-Chinese trade talks due to start Wednesday in Washington. Unless the two sides can forge an accord by March 1, U.S. tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese products are set to rise from 10 percent to 25 percent.Huawei Technologies Ltd., which has spent a decade battling U.S. accusations it is a front for Chinese spying, denied committing any of the violations cited in Monday's indictment.The foreign ministry complained Washington has "mobilized state power" to hurt Chinese companies "in an attempt to strangle fair and just operations.""We strongly urge the United States to stop the unreasonable crackdown on Chinese companies including Huawei," said the statement read on state TV. It said Beijing will defend the "lawful rights and interests of Chinese companies" but gave no details.The charges unsealed Monday by the Justice Department accused Huawei of trying to take a piece of a robot and other technology from a T-Mobile lab that was used to test smartphones. Huawei passed Apple in mid-2018 as the second-biggest global smartphone brand after Samsung.The U.S. charges included no allegation Huawei worked at the Chinese government's direction. But the U.S. government has previously accused China of involvement in cyberspying and theft of industrial secrets. It has charged several Chinese hackers and intelligence officials.Huawei also is charged with using a Hong Kong front company, Skycom, to trade with Iran in violation of U.S. controls. Prosecuters allege Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, lied to banks about those dealings.Meng, the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested Dec. 1 in Vancouver, a development that set off a political firestorm between China and Canada.China detained two Canadians shortly after Meng's arrest in an apparent attempt to pressure Canada to release her. A Chinese court also sentenced a third Canadian to death in a sudden retrial of a drug case, overturning a 15-year prison term handed down earlier."We urge the U.S. to immediately withdraw the arrest warrant against Miss Meng Wanzhou and stop making such kinds of extradition requests," said a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang. "We urge Canada to take seriously China's solemn position, immediately release Ms. Meng Wanzhou and protect her legitimate and legal rights."Huawei, headquartered in the southern city of Shenzhen, near Hong Kong, has rejected the U.S. accusations."The company denies that it or its subsidiary or affiliate have committed any of the asserted violations of U.S. law set forth in each of the indictments," a Huawei statement said.Huawei is "not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng, and believes the U.S. courts will ultimately reach the same conclusion," it said.Meng is out on bail in Vancouver and is due in court Tuesday as she awaits extradition proceedings.Huawei's U.S. market evaporated after a 2012 congressional report said it and Chinese rival ZTE Corp. were security risks and told phone companies to avoid them. But Huawei says the scrutiny has had little impact on its business elsewhere.The company says it serves 45 of the 50 biggest global telecom carriers. It forecasts its 2018 global revenue should exceed $100 billion for the first time despite the tension with Washington.Huawei said U.S. prosecutors rejected a request to discuss the investigation following Meng's arrest. It also noted the allegations in the trade secrets charge were the subject of a U.S. civil lawsuit that already has been settled.The entirely state-controlled Chinese press has portrayed Huawei as the victim of U.S. government efforts to cripple a potential industrial challenger."This is not just the matter of Huawei. It involves the whole nation of China," said Qin Xiaohua, who works in the finance industry in Beijing. "We have to unite no matter as individuals or as an integrated country."While U.S. authorities stress the independence of courts, "ordinary Chinese people all believe it is a deliberate crackdown on Huawei," said Lu Feng, an economist at Peking University. He said Beijing will see a "link to Chinese-U.S. trade relations.""The difference in understanding will bring about complicated problems," said Lu.President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, agreed Dec. 1 to put off further sanctions against each other's exports while they negotiated a new trade pact. The prospect of higher tariffs has rattled financial markets for months.Asked about the possible effect of the Huawei case on trade talks, the foreign ministry spokesman, Geng, said, "as for the China-U.S. trade talks and our position on this, I think the U.S. is also quite clear about that."The Justice Department officials provided details from a 10-count grand jury indictment in Seattle, and a separate 13-count case from prosecutors in New York.The Seattle charges allege that beginning in 2012, Huawei plotted to steal information about T-Mobile's robot, known as "Tappy." It says Huawei engineers secretly took photos of the robot, measured it and tried to steal part of it from T-Mobile's lab, according to prosecutors. T-Mobile declined to comment.Load-Date: January 29, 2019End of Document

Zai Lab Announces Financial Results and Corporate Update for Full Year 2018GlobeNewswireMarch 7, 2019 Thursday 4:30 AM PTCopyright 2019 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: EARNINGS RELEASES AND OPERATING RESULTSLength: 3191 wordsBody-- Zai Lab to Host Conference Call and Webcast Today at 8:30 a.m. EST--SHANGHAI, China, March  07, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zai Lab Limited ("Zai lab" or the Company) (NASDAQ: ZLAB), a China and US-based innovative commercial stage biopharmaceutical company, today announced financial results for the full year 2018 and provided a corporate update."2018 was a year of rapid evolution toward our goal of becoming a fully integrated global biopharma company," said Dr. Samantha Du, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Zai Lab. "We became a commercial-stage company with the marketing approvals and launches of ZEJULA® and Optune® in Hong Kong. In China, niraparib's NDA submission was accepted more than one year ahead of anticipated timeline, and was granted priority review status by the NMPA.  We are very excited to prepare for a potential launch as anticipated in the second half of 2019. Pending the outcome of our clinical trial waiver request with the NMPA, Optune could also be launched in China this year.""Our assets have demonstrated significant momentum both from advances in our clinical trials in China, which are highlighted below, as well as clinical developments announced by our partners, most recently by MacroGenics for the positive results from their pivotal SOPHIA study. Our broad, late stage pipeline has been carefully constructed to address significant unmet medical needs through products with first-in-class and/or best-in-class profile.  We are also building a discovery pipeline that we believe will be synergistic with our clinical portfolio, and we expect to announce one to two IND filings per year starting next year."Recent Pipeline and Product HighlightsZL-2306 (niraparib)• In January 2019, Zai Lab announced that the Center for Drug Evaluation of China's National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has granted priority review status to the New Drug Application (NDA) for niraparib for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with recurrent epithelial, ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal ovarian cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. NMPA acceptance of the NDA was over one year ahead of expectations.  Niraparib was also designated as a "National Science and Technology Major Project" by the Chinese government as part of a key initiative to strengthen local innovation. • In January 2019, Zai Lab announced that it completed patient enrollment of its Phase 3 clinical trial of niraparib, which is in development for second-line maintenance therapy in patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer.  • In October 2018, Zai Lab announced the marketing approval of ZEJULA® (niraparib) in Hong Kong for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive high-grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer. The product was launched in Hong Kong in November 2018. • In September 2018, Zai Lab presented results of its clinical trial that evaluated the Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of niraparib made in China for Chinese ovarian cancer patients. The study demonstrated a comparable PK profile to that generated in the global study conducted by Tesaro (now part of GSK). • In August 2018, Zai Lab dosed its first patient in a Phase 3 registrational trial in China for SCLC (Small-Cell Lung Cancer).  Current enrollment is on schedule. • In June 2018, Zai Lab dosed its first patient in a Phase 3 clinical trial in China for first-line maintenance therapy of patients with platinum-responsive ovarian cancer.  Current enrollment is on schedule.Optune® (TTFields)• In December 2018, Zai Lab launched Optune in Hong Kong and treated its first patient with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. • In September 2018, Zai Lab announced a global strategic development collaboration with Novocure. Zai Lab obtained an exclusive license to develop and commercialize TTFields in greater China and will also support enrollment of Chinese patients to accelerate clinical trial enrollment for additional indications.MacroGenics exclusive collaboration and license agreement• In February 2019, MacroGenics announced positive top-line results from its SOPHIA Phase 3 clinical trial.  Margetuximab demonstrated improved progression-free survival compared to HERCEPTIN® (trastuzumab) when used in combination with chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. We plan to discuss the approval pathway for HER2-positive breast cancer in China with the NMPA. • In November 2018, Zai Lab and MacroGenics entered in to an exclusive collaboration and licensing agreement to develop and commercialize three assets for greater China including: (i) margetuximab, an immune-optimized anti-HER2 antibody; (ii) MGD013, a first-in-class bispecific DART antibody designed to coordinate PD-1 and LAG-3 blockade for the treatment of solid and hematological tumors; and (iii) an undisclosed tri-specific TRIDENT molecule.ZL-2301 (brivanib)• In September 2018, Zai Lab presented interim results of a Phase 2 clinical trial of brivanib in Chinese patients with previously-treated liver cancer at the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology. The study demonstrated evidence of anti-tumor activity with a manageable safety profile.  Zai Lab plans to conduct a combination study with a PD-1 antibody for HCC patients in China.FPA 144 (bemarituzumab)• In October 2018, Zai Lab and Five Prime Therapeutics dosed the first patient in a Phase 3 global registrational trial of bemarituzumab in combination with chemotherapy in patients with previously-untreated advanced gastric cancer. The first global patient was dosed at a participating site in China, which was an industry first. ZL-2401 (omadacycline)• In December 2018, Zai Lab initiated the abbreviated bridging program previously agreed to with the NMPA, which is expected to allow us to significantly accelerate NDA preparation and submission timeline by up to two years. • In October 2018, the U.S. FDA approved NUZYRA„¢ (omadacycline) for the treatment of adults with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute skin and skin structure infections.  The European Medicines Agency also announced acceptance of European Marketing Authorization Application for both oral and intravenous formulations.ETX2514• ETX2514 is expected to initiate global Phase 3 registrational clinical trials for patients with MDR Acinetobacter pneumonia and bloodstream infections in 2019.  In collaboration with Entasis, Zai Lab has been preparing to submit a clinical trial application to initiate patient dosing in the Asia-Pacific portion of the global registrational trial.Recent Corporate Developments• Throughout 2018, Zai Lab continued to demonstrate its positioning as the "gateway to China for innovative assets" by completing four strategic partnerships and adding six assets into its pipeline.  Zai Lab intends to continue to evaluate opportunities that it believes has products or capabilities that are a strategic or commercial fit with Zai Lab's current drug candidates and business. • In February 2019, Immuno-Oncology Pioneer, Lieping Chen, M.D., Ph.D., joined Zai Lab's Scientific Advisory Board (SAB).  Dr. Chen will advise Zai Lab as it continues to progress its internally-developed oncology pipeline. In addition to Dr. Chen, other members of Zai Lab's SAB include Neal Rosen, M.D., Ph.D., Gwen Fyfe, M.D., and Richard Flavell, Ph.D., FRS. • In October 2018, William Lis was appointed to Zai Lab's Board of Directors.  Mr. Lis has over 25 years of biopharmaceutical experience. He served as CEO and a Director of Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc. from 2010 until 2018. Under his leadership, Portola successfully grew from a discovery stage company to a fully integrated R&D and commercial organization.  Prior to Portola, Mr. Lis held executive positions at Scios, Inc. (a Johnson & Johnson company) and Millennium Pharmaceuticals. • In September 2018, Zai Lab appointed industry leader, Tao Fu, as President and Chief Operating Officer and opened an office in San Francisco to serve as its U.S. Headquarters and further strengthen its business development and discovery capabilities. Mr. Fu has been, and continues to be, a member of Zai's Board of Directors since 2017.  • In September 2018, Zai Lab raised gross proceeds of $150 million in a public offering of American Depositary Shares.  • In August 2018, Yongjiang Hei, MD, Ph.D., joined Zai Lab as Chief Medical Officer of Oncology, and brings with him over 20 years of global oncology clinical development experience.  Dr. Hei was the Global Development Leader for numerous oncology drugs at Amgen and also served as the Medical Head for Amgen China.  Dr. Hei also served as the US Medical Director for Roche, and Senior Global Brand Medical Director and Executive Director in Oncology for Novartis. • In August 2018, Kai-Xian Chen, Ph.D., was appointed to Zai Lab's Board of Directors.  Professor Chen is a globally preeminent scientist widely regarded as a pioneer in the field of interdisciplinary healthcare research and also served as a member of the National Committee of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) from 2007 to 2017. • In June 2018, Dr. William Liang was appointed Chief Commercial Officer.  Dr. Liang has over 20 years of experience in the biopharma industry, heading China and regional commercial operations of global companies.  Dr. Liang was instrumental in establishing market-leading oncology and other franchises in China for AstraZeneca and Roche, overseeing commercial success of top selling drugs such as Tagrisso®, Iressa®, Tarceva®, MabThera®, Herceptin®, Avastin® and Pegasys®. • Zai Lab continues to expand its platform, particularly in R&D and commercial teams.  As of March 1, 2019, Zai Lab employed 448 full-time employees, including nearly 60 employees with M.D. or Ph.D. degrees.  Currently, approximately 40% and 43% of the Company's employees are engaged in R&D and commercial activities, respectively.Anticipated 2019 MilestonesZL-2306 (niraparib)• PK study presentation at AACR (American Association for Cancer Research)• Potential China NDA approval and launch• Tesaro (now GSK) to announce top-line PRIMA data in first-line maintenance treatment of ovarian cancer for all comers• Initiate trials in other key indications in China• Complete enrollment of first-line ovarian cancer Phase 3 clinical trialOptune® (TTFields)• Potential China GBM NDA approval and launch• Initiate exploratory trial in China for gastric cancerMargetuximab• Submission of a biologics license application to the U.S. FDA for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer by our partner MacroGenics• Initiate global phase 3 registrational trial in combination with a PD-1 antibody for patients with gastric cancerZL-2301(brivanib)• Initiate Phase 1/2 study in combination with a PD-1 antibody in HCC patients in mainland China and Hong KongETX2514• Initiate global Phase 3 registrational study with EntasisZL-2401 (omadacycline)• NDA preparation and potential submissionFull Year 2018 Financial Results• As of December 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $263.3 million which includes the net proceeds from the follow-on offering in September 2018.  • R&D expenses were $120.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $39.3 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in upfront licensing fees of $46.8 million from four new strategic partnerships in 2018 (including MacroGenics upfront fees of $25.0 million that were expensed in 2018 and paid in January 2019), ongoing and newly initiated late-stage clinical trials, payroll and payroll-related expenses, and expansion of research efforts to support internal programs. • SG&A expenses were $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $12.0 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to the increase in payroll and payroll-related expenses due to increased commercial and administrative headcount as Zai Lab expanded its operations. • For the year ended December 31, 2018, Zai Lab reported a net loss of $139.1 million, or net loss per share attributable to common stockholders of $2.64, compared to a net loss of $50.4 million, or net loss per share attributable to common stockholders of $2.32, for the year ended December 31, 2017. Conference Call and Webcast InformationZai Lab will host a live conference call and webcast today, March 7, 2019 at 8:30 a.m. EST to review its financial results and provide a general business update.The live webcast can be accessed by visiting the Investors section of Zai Lab's website at http://ir.zailaboratory.com.  Please connect at least 15 minutes prior to the live webcast to ensure adequate time for any software download that may be needed to access the webcast.

All Rights ReservedLength: 569 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Isobel Asher Hamilton)Highlight: Huawei has been accused by the US of providing a backdoor for the Chinese government to spy - which it vehemently denies.BodyAP Photo/Vincent Yu• Huawei's US security chief Andy Purdy said in an interview that CEO Ren Zhengfei would shut down the company if asked to spy by "any government."• Huawei has been accused by the US of providing a backdoor for the Chinese government to spy - an allegation the company denies.• Purdy said Huawei wants to talk the US officials to ease their concerns about spying and put in place "proven mechanisms for addressing risk."Huawei would sooner close than be a tool for the Chinese government to spy on the West.Huawei's US security boss said on Wednesday that CEO Ren Zhengfei - a former officer of the People's Liberation Army - would shut the tech giant down if asked to spy by Xi Jinping's regime, or indeed any other government."Mr Ren our founder is committed that he would shut down the company if necessary," Andy Purdy told BBC Radio 4's "Today Programme." "We have not been asked by any government to do anything improper, and if we were asked we would say no regardless of who the government is."He was pressed on the Chinese National Intelligence Law, legislation introduced in 2017 compelling companies to help intelligence services on matters of national security. "It's really amazing the repeated mischaracterization of the law. It does not apply to equipment manufacturers like Huawei. It does not have extra-territorial effect, in other words outside of China," Purdy told the BBC.He characterized the US's mistrust of the company as the result of geopolitical tensions between the US and China.Read more: The Trump administration is warning allies to stay away from a powerful Chinese company - but not everyone's listening"The fact is there's a geopolitical issue that's gonna be with us for decades between the United States and China. The rise of China as an economic and military power is of great concern to the United States, the rise of the fifth domain of the military which is cyberspace," he said.Just Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese hackers targeted some two dozen American universities in an attempt to glean maritime military secrets.Purdy added that Huawei wants to talk to the US government about technical solutions to address its security concerns. "We welcome the opportunity to talk with the US government about proven mechanisms for addressing risk, mechanisms that have satisfied the US government in the past. So we hope that's the route for us to have some real negotiations to come to a resolution," he explained.The US has not only frozen Huawei out of its domestic market, but has been aggressively lobbying allied nations to reject Huawei's 5G network plans.When questioned about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has warned allied countries against using Huawei equipment or else the US will not be able to partner with them, Purdy said he was a "great American," but, "there really is not the kind of threat the Secretary of State is talking about."NOW WATCH: Here's how to use Apple's time-saving app that will make your life easierSee Also:• The Trump administration is warning allies to stay away from a powerful Chinese company - but not everyone's listening• Here's why the US is terrified of one Chinese company controlling the world's 5G networks• Here's every company working on a foldable smartphone right nowSEE ALSO: Huawei's war with America just went up a level, with the Chinese company planning to sue the US governmentLoad-Date: March 6, 2019End of Document

CHINESE FM: HUAWEI CASE IS 'DELIBERATE POLITICAL SUPPRESSION'States News ServiceMarch 8, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 710 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):Marissa MeltonChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday called the legal clash between Chinese company Huawei and the U.S. government "deliberate political suppression," and he vowed to protect the rights of Chinese companies and citizens abroad."It's quite obvious to any fair and unbiased person that the recent action against a particular company and Chinese individual is not just a pure judicial case but deliberate political suppression," Wang said on the sidelines of China's annual parliament session."We have already and will continue to take all necessary steps and resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies and citizens," he said, though he did not elaborate on what those steps would be.Washington has banned U.S. companies from using Huawei technology, warning that doing so could result in security breaches.FILE - Huawei Technologies Co. Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou arrives back at home after a court appearance in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, March 6, 2019.In December, Canadian authorities arrested Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer, on U.S. charges that she violated sanctions against Iran. Her extradition hearing is to begin May 8.Since Meng's arrest, two Canadians have been arrested in China, and a third who was already in Chinese prison for a drug crime has seen his sentence switched from 15 years to death.On Thursday, Huawei announced it had filed a lawsuit in the U.S., arguing that legislation Congress passed last year restricting Huawei business in the United States was "unconstitutional" because it singled out the company for penalties.The United States has also warned other countries that Huawei technology could allow Chinese intelligence agents to infiltrate their networks."This ban is not only unlawful but also harms both Huawei and U.S. consumers," Huawei's rotating chairman, Guo Ping, told reporters Thursday in Shenzhen.No choiceGuo said that Huawei was left with no choice but to take legal action, noting that neither lawmakers nor the government had shown any proof to date to back up concerns the company is a security risk.China expert Dean Cheng of the Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy told VOA's Xu Ning that even though Huawei is not owned by the Chinese government, it would probably cooperate with the government if asked to."Huawei is not a state-owned enterprise," Cheng said, but "broadly speaking, Chinese companies will respond to requests or demands from the Chinese government."FILE - A receptionist stands at the front counter of Huawei's Cyber Security Lab at the Huawei factory in Dongguan, China's Guangdong province, March 6, 2019.In addition, he said, "Huawei coding appears to be often very poor. Whether that's deliberate or not is unclear. But Huawei has also been very, very slow in addressing those issues. So we have a fundamental quality control issue here."Julian Ku, a constitutional law professor and associate dean at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., told VOA's Qiao Zhan that Huawei has a minimal chance of winning, but "not an impossible chance."He said the United States would probably file a motion to dismiss the Huawei case, arguing that Huawei's legal claims "don't have any basis so we don't need to go to trial because no evidence is required to resolve the case." Then, he said, the court would most likely schedule a hearing to consider that argument.U.S. vigilanceOn Thursday, U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Robert Palladino declined to comment on the pending lawsuit, but said the government needs to be vigilant when making procurement decisions."The United States advocates for secure telecom networks and supply chains that are free from suppliers subject to foreign government control or undue influence, which would pose risks of unauthorized access and malicious cyber activity," said Palladino in response to questions posed by VOA during a briefing."We believe that these risks posed by vendors subject to extrajudicial or unchecked compulsion by foreign states that do not share our values need to be weighed rigorously before making procurement decisions on these technologies," he added.Load-Date: March 9, 2019End of Document

Huawei, another chapter of the trade war between China and the US?CE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 8, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1022 wordsBody Almost a year ago, the United States and the People's Republic of China started the trade dispute over tariffs. In this same context, one of the most important conflicts perceived so far in the world of technology and security was unleashed worldwide.  Currently, the Chinese high-tech multinational Huawei is in the eye of the storm of conflict between the two largest economic powers in the world: the United States and the People's Republic of China.  On the one hand, the United States and its partners raise doubts about the potential cybersecurity risks represented by the manufacturer of Chinese origin; On the other hand, the Chinese Government defends its companies and ensures that they are competitive and do not represent any risk.  Until now, the problem has transcended borders and has already been considered by many as a technological 'cold war'.  The edges of the conflict focus on espionage for the use of foreign equipment, the commercial war that both countries maintain, the current international policy and the advent of new technologies, such as 5G.  And although Huawei brings the stone in his shoes since former Chinese Army engineer Ren Zhengfei founded the company in 1987, it was not until early 2018 that the US government, supported by the FBI and the CIA, began to boycott the technological giant, more or less officially, as has been publicly reported.  The conflict took hold at the beginning of this 2019, when the US Government (led by President Donald Trump) accused the Chinese technological giant of banking fraud and espionage, specifically blaming its executive director, Meng Wanzhou, as part of that plot . Meng was arrested in Canada in December 2018, by order of the United States Government. And he is currently on bail and is scheduled to appear at his hearing on May 8 to begin the process of extradition to the United States.  As part of its retaliation, Trump has ordered the blockade of the sale of the Chinese company's products (which it is estimated could also affect firms such as Apple). And recently Huawei responded to the United States with a demand for such restrictions, as it is considered "unconstitutional."  International media such as El Confidencial published that allies of the United States, such as New Zealand and Australia, announced that they will block the arrival of Huawei's 5G networks, while France and the United Kingdom are debating it; but still 'none' has reached the restrictions ordered by Trump. THE DEMAND During a press conference, held on Wednesday, March 6, from Shenzhen, in China, and broadcast live via social media, Huawei's chief legal officer, Song Liuping, said the legal action that was filed against The government of President Trump is to challenge section 889 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of 2019, since they consider that the imposed restrictions go against their business in the United States.  Song Liuping stressed that 'Section 889 is based on numerous false, unproven and unverified propositions'. And in contrast to the premises of the statute, he assured that 'Huawei is not owned by the Chinese government nor is it under its control or influence'.  In addition, he stressed that the Chinese company has an 'excellent' record and strong security mechanisms. To date, the United States' has not released any evidence against it, in this matter.  It transpired that with this action, the Chinese manufacturer seeks a declaratory judgment, that declares unconstitutional the restrictions directed to the Chinese company and a permanent precautionary measure against these restrictions.  For hisOn the other hand, the current president of the Chinese company, Guo Ping, explained that they have been forced to take this legal action because the US Congress has repeatedly failed to present evidence that supports the restrictions imposed on the company's products. It represents.  "This ban is not only illegal, it also blocks Huawei from participating in fair competition, ultimately harming American consumers. We await the verdict of the Court and we trust that it will be beneficial, both for Huawei and for the American people, "he added.  The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court in Plano, Texas.  And according to the claim, section 889 of the NDAA of 2019 not only prohibits all US government agencies from purchasing Huawei equipment and services, but also prevents them from contracting or granting grants or loans to Huawei's customers, without any executive or judicial process. "This violates the clauses relating to the document of proscription and confiscation and due process, in addition to trampling the principles of separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution of the United States, because Congress, while legislating, tries to judge and enforce the law ', Guo stressed.  For its part, the global head of cybersecurity and privacy of the Chinese company, John Suffolk, remarked that "they have integrated security mechanisms in the development and deployment of their products, which has established a benchmark with high standards that few companies they can match. '  He also stressed that "the restrictive measures prevent the company from providing more advanced 5G technologies to American consumers, which will delay the commercial deployment of 5G and the improvement of its services in the United States."  Additionally, he indicated that users in rural and remote regions of the country will be forced to choose between government funding and high quality products and affordable prices, which will make it difficult to update the network, widening the digital divide.  Worse still, he warned, the restrictions imposed on Huawei will stifle competition. Guo assured that if this law is annulled, as it should be, Huawei will have the opportunity to take to its American clients the leading technologies to build the most advanced 5G network.  "Huawei is willing to address the security concerns of the United States government. Lift the NDAA ban will allow the US government to work with Huawei to solve the real problems of cybersecurity, "said Guo Ping. Load-Date: March 8, 2019End of Document

TAIWAN COMPILING 'BLACKLIST' OF CHINESE TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES: REPORTStates News ServiceJanuary 24, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 991 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Authorities in Taiwan are drafting a list of Chinese technology companies that could present security concerns for the government, in the wake of a series of measures excluding Huawei from bidding on the next generation of 5G mobile network infrastructure.The list will seek to limit the use of Chinese-manufactured telecoms equipment by government departments and institutions that could post a security threat, the Nikkei Asian Review cited Taiwan's cybersecurity chief Jyan Hong-wei as saying."We will likely complete and publish a list of Chinese companies that could pose security threats by the end of March, and update the list from time to time," Jyan said. "In that case, all government departments, organizations and government-controlled enterprises could have a clear idea when they are buying new tools."Top candidates for the democratic island's government blacklist are Huawei, ZTE, as well as Dahua Technology and Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, both of which make surveillance cameras and equipment, the report said.Computer-maker Lenovo may also appear on the list of companies that government agencies and state-controlled companies will have to avoid, it said.The move comes after U.S. cybersecurity company FireEye said Beijing likely targeted the democratic island to influence last November's elections in favor of its preferred candidates.However, the list will be made available to the private sector for advisory purposes, to help them make procurement decisions, Jyan said. Taiwan's cabinet, the Executive Yuan, will also release guidelines on the use of electronic devices by government personnel, the report said.Any bans could take in a large proportion of Taiwan's economy via state-owned utilities and telecoms giants, government-funded medical facilities and research institutions.The island's flag-carrier China Airlines will also be on the distribution list, Nikkei Asian Review reported.'Taiwan should be no exception'Taiwan premier Su Tseng-chang told reporters on Thursday that the island needs to focus on national security."Every country in the world is fighting for its national security, and Taiwan should be no exception," Su said. "We also know that that we can mitigate threats to national security that come from the ... use of telecommunications systems.""That's why the government is doing everything it should be doing to ensure that there are no leaks ... and we call on all Taiwanese to be on a state of alert: security should be everything," he said. "Without national security, we have nothing."Kolas Yotaka, spokeswoman for the Executive Yuan, said the move wasn't simply about a ban on Chinese companies, or about targeting Huawei, however."Actually we don't want to ban Chinese companies from Taiwan, but I have to emphasize one more time that there can be no grey areas when it comes to national security," Yotaka said."We also want to remind all departments and agencies under this government that they must take national security considerations into account when procuring hardware or software," she said.Taipei mayor Ko Wen-je said the move could be linked to the current Sino-U.S. trade war. "This is a tough one," Ko said. "But all we have to do is go along with the policy, once the government has made up its mind what it should be."Computer networks expert of Ying-Dar Lin, of Taiwan's state-run Chiao-Tung University, said the island's 23 million residents aren't worried enough about using Huawei equipment, and that key institutions on the island are under constant cyber attack from inside China."China's cyber army is desperate to hack certain figures in government and in high-technology," Lin told RFA. "One group holds political secrets, and the other group holds industrial secrets.""Both groups are under fierce attack on a daily basis, in a silent war in which no bullets fly," he said.Huawei government links clearLin said there is no question that Huawei is closely linked to the Chinese Communist Party regime, despite its protestations that it is a private enterprise."There is no way that Huawei doesn't do what the Chinese government tells it to do," he said. "Ever since the passage of the National Security Law ... they could even be criminally prosecuted if they don't do as they're told."Last week, Taiwan held live-fire military exercises off its coast amid concerns -- fueled by the publication of a Pentagon military analysis in the U.S. --that Beijing could move to annex the island, which has never been ruled by the Chinese Communist Party.The drills after Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen rejected calls from President Xi for the democratic island to move towards "unification" with the People's Republic, saying its people have no wish to give up their sovereignty.In a Jan. 2 "Letter to our Taiwan compatriots," Xi was insistent that China must be "unified."Xi made scant reference to public opinion among the 23 million inhabitants of Taiwan, and said that China would make no promises not to use military force to take the island.But a recent opinion poll found that more than 80 percent of Taiwanese would reject Xi's offer to rule the island via the "one country, two systems" model used for the former colonies of Hong Kong and Macau.Taiwan was ruled as a Japanese colony in the 50 years prior to the end of World War II, but was handed back to the 1911 Republic of China under the Kuomintang (KMT) government as part of Tokyo's post-war reparation deal.The island began a transition to democracy following the death of Chiang Kai-shek's son, President Chiang Ching-kuo, in January 1988 , starting with direct elections to the legislature in the early 1990s and culminating in the first direct election of a president, Lee Teng-hui, in 1996.Reported by Hwang Chun-mei for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Chung Kuang-cheng for the Cantonese Service.

Let's hope it's a good number.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes.MCDOWELL: Ladies, good to see you. I'll see you shortly, Cheryl and Lauren. Good morning, everyone, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It is Friday, January 4th, Jobs Day. Your top stories at 6:00 a.m. Eastern.A rally on Wall Street fueled by stimulus from China and a new round of trade talks. We have gains across the board and they are welcomed this morning, U.S. Futures higher, 294-point gain on the Dow Features right now. You can look at these markets move to the upside, but we are two and a half hours away from the U.S. Jobs Report. We have special live coverage coming up starting at 8:00 a.m. Eastern. We'll be talking about that.Plus China's Central Bank taking action to stimulate that struggling economy. It is cutting reserve ratio on banks, which will make it -- make it easier for them to lend, pump money into the Chinese economy, and you see gains across the board in the U.S. Futures. But this isn't even a complete reversal from the major selloff that we saw yesterday, a 660-point loss on the Dow Jones Industrial Average yesterday. It was Apple that really pulled down all of your markets. Remember, look at the NASDAQ lost more than three percent just in the second trading day of the New Year.It was that big mover, the big shock from Apple that really pulled down the market. The company lost $75 billion in market value just yesterday. That stock you can see premarket action gaining 1.8 percent at the moment. Meantime, looking at the airlines, Delta cutting its sales guidance and that's dragging down the airline sector. Shares sliding 10 percent on Delta yesterday.And here are two key numbers to watch where the Dow and S&P 500 would enter bear market territory. Your Russell 2000, your NASDAQ, and your Dow Transports all in bear market territory, down 20 percent from the recent highs. For the Dow, watch this. Now granted gains this morning, 21,462 and change for blue chip, on the S&P 500, this is critical, 2,344.60 is your bear market level. Could that mean even a lower market if we hit those marks?Checking global market action in Europe, we have gains across the board to report France, Germany, and the FTSE-100 in England, all up more than one percent. A big bounce-back there. And then Asia overnight, markets were mostly higher. The Nikkei finally reopening after a long holiday break, losing more than two percent but yet gains. And Shanghai on the Hang Seng and the KOSPI in South Korea. Investors are eagerly awaiting the December Jobs Report due out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. The expectation is for 177,000 jobs added last month and the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.7 percent. Also watch that wage gain number. Average hourly earnings are expected to gain three percent from a year ago. A little bit lower than in November.And heroes on the hill, a patriotic photo and tweet that shows three combat veterans wounded in the line of duty after being sworn into Congress, and it says, "Five eyes, five arms, four legs, all American," that is going viral. All that and so much more coming up this morning. Joining me FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton, Benchmark Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly, and FOX News Contributor, Richard Fowler. Sir Richard's going to be our Nancy Pelosi whisperer this morning.RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: That's quite a task.MCDOWELL: To talk about the shutdown. We didn't even mention that in the open. That's going to be important also, the Jobs Report clearly. Good to see you. What are you looking at? I mentioned those bear market levels. I'm not trying to bring on bad news.KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK: No, that's --MCDOWELL: But I think the S&P has not closed in bear market territory, that significant many people have told me if it hits the mark, if it falls below more than 20 percent, that's going to be lookout below.K. KELLY: Yes. What's pretty fascinating is on Christmas Eve, I was watching it and we actually almost hit these levels. We actually --MCDOWELL: Right.K. KELLY: -- went down 19.8 percent. We were within two-tenths of a percent away from hitting official bear market territory.MCDOWELL: Right.K. KELLY: Which is an arbitrary number, it's 20 percent down, but everybody is focused on it because we're, you know, 12 years into this bull market, so I think if we hit that number, you kind of get, "OK, we finally hit bear market territory," and then people can alleviate that concern, just like when the Fed finally lifted interest rates for the very first time, we got off zero rate-interest policy, everyone's like, "OK, things -- life's going to go on after this."So, I think -- I hope -- I think we would kiss it and then move on and come back up. Because guess what? Valuations are still great. We're still in expansionary mode. We saw the Ism numbers yesterday, we're still above 50 in those.MCDOWELL: But it -- there is this feeling in the market where even news that's kind of bad is horrible and I think that that was kind of the leg down in the market yesterday was that ISM report.FOWLER: Yes.MCDOWELL: Because it was the lowest in two years. But --DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: And, you know, something that I feel is like still happening as we look at the green on the screens with the Futures, is a lot of the themes from 2018 are still carrying over to this year, meaning we have this possibility at least of this morning of U.S. and China, you know, having high-level talks, right?MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm.BOLTON: In Beijing, in a couple of days from now and so I think that's actually what's driving this kind of positivity, so I feel like that was such a huge theme last year as well whenever it seems like we couldn't agree ti something with China. We saw a lot of downward pressure.MCDOWELL: Good morningBOLTON: And not today, you know, OK, we're going to be talking January 7th, and 8th, and it seems like, OK, everybody feels pretty good again.MCDOWELL: So the government shutdown right now -- but one thing that would be hugely positive for the U.S. economy and the markets is if Nancy Pelosi moves ahead to ratify this new Canada-Mexico trade deal, that the Trump administration negotiated. That's a big worry because she, to quote the Wall Street Journal Editorial which was yesterday, "They -- Nancy Pelosi in 2006 put it in a Bush's trade bills in her drawer somewhere and just moved on.FOWLER: I mean I think it's very interesting to see what Nancy Pelosi does especially given the fact that we -- the White House indicated yesterday that the -- that, you know, because of the pressure in China that there could be more, you know, more consumer pressure, like we saw Apple yesterday coming out saying that, you know, consumer sales are down in China.MCDOWELL: Yes.FOWLER: The White House has said there's likely more consumer pressure happening in China. So for American companies, this is a global market for them. So, we'll see what happens. I think there's going to be some heavy -- there's the heavy weights on Pelosi's shoulders, but there's also heavy weights on the President's shoulders --MCDOWELL: Sure.FOWLER: -- because he made a bargain on this sort of -- I like to call it, you know, risky trade, not even deal, trade stuff is the best way to put it with tariffs and we're going to be tough guy and now the roosters are getting ready to come -- the roosters are coming home to roost and we're getting to see it happen.BOLTON: It's good --MCDOWELL: Well, it's definitely increased volatility, right?FOWLER: Yes.BOLTON: Yes.MCDOWELL: Yes. The -- I'll point out that the Wall Street Journal in the front page has "China's Consumer Woes Reverberate," because I think that retail sales in the country, Kevin, correct me if I'm wrong, they're at like a 15-year low, or something crazy like that.K. KELLY: Yes.MCDOWELL: So, it's not just Apple, it's really the entire economy, but that gives us potential leverage in these trade negotiations, number one, the Journal has an editorial today that the iPhone canary, the iPhone sales point shows the need for a China-U.S. trade deal.K. KELLY: Well, not necessarily because before -- it's just the truth, because Apple was the number four phone producer over in China. The capitulated a couple quarters ago and actually building a data center in China. So I think it's important to note that this isn't just a China story for Apple, it's an overall story for Apple. It's not -- and I think it's important to note, why did Tim Cook do that and capitulate to the Chinese government? He did it because it's anticipated that there's going to be more people in the middle class in China --MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm.K. KELLY: -- than we have citizens here in the United States.MCDOWELL: What --K. KELLY: The middle class is expected to be over 400 million people by 2020.MCDOWELL: One thing to be clear on this editorial in the Journal that I'll point out, it's not that they refute the idea out of the White House, that, "Oh, we now have negotiating leverage over China because China's economy is weakening," it's the fact -- which we heard from Kevin Hassett yesterday, that China's -- our trade negotiations in China's weakness is actually going to be more pain for U.S. businesses. And so it's in our best interest because you see what's happening to the first $1 trillion market cap company in this country.BOLTON: Yes.MCDOWELL: You've seen what's happening because of China's weakness. So the U.S. would --BOLTON: Yes, the Apple's now down below, what, $700 billion market cap?K. KELLY: They lost the market --BOLTON: Yes.K. KELLY: -- cap of Facebook.BOLTON: Yes.K. KELLY: Which is fascinating. So, they hit a trillion dollars and they lost over 420 -- oh, sorry, yes, billion, so they lost over 420 billion --MCDOWELL: Right.K. KELLY: -- which is the market cap of Facebook.MCDOWELL: Since --K. KELLY: Which is unfathomable to think about.MCDOWELL: Since October.FOWLER: And I think it goes -- but it goes far beyond just trade stocks. I think if you take a holistic approach to the economy, this -- our sort of tangle with China has also resulted in some horrible conditions for our farmers, give -- even given the bailout, right? I think dairy farmers are still sort of taking it on the chin, as well as soybean farmers, and pecan farmers, even though they got the bailout, life still isn't great for them because of this -- because of where we are.MCDOWELL: And I've been a critic of the steel and aluminum tariffs. I've been -- I've warned about the impact on American farmers from the very get- go and they have a long -- they have a long view in the White House that it's -- this is an important time to take on China with the theft of intellectual property, just the espionage, the force surrender of technology, but to that point, I think that you could look at what happened in November. It -- to the -- to the Republicans in the House in the -- some of these farm areas and I think that that did have some fallout for the Republicans.BOLTON: Dagen, backing up something you said, too, right? Manufacturing was at a two-year low, we saw that earlier this week for China, which also does show --MCDOWELL: Right.BOLTON: -- their own internals coming under a little bit.MCDOWELL: Let's talk about Apple really quickly and also Delta with the revenue warning. The tech giants -- we've mentioned this, 10 percent decline yesterday, it cut its revenue guidance for the first time in more than 15 years. The tech giant solely blamed the revenue shortfall on weakness in China in part hurt by the trade tensions but, again, a weak Chinese economy, weakening Chinese economy. Apple not the only one taking the plunge, Delta had its worst day in more than six years, cut its revenue forecast, sparking a selloff in the airlines, what does this speak to? Because that was the big question yesterday.And I think people are still debating it, is Apple's problems -- is it about Apple, is it also about China slowdown, is it also about a global slowdown? And you see American companies are not immune to what's going on overseas.BOLTON: I think it's a little bit global slowing down of course. But I do think some specifics to Apple -- I mean I was at the event a couple of months ago in Brooklyn and you actually had somebody from Apple getting up on stage saying, "Well, you can just change out your battery," and I was thinking like, "Hmm, is this person supposed to be saying that?" Meaning that we are all upgrading on a much slower cycle rate so that's part of why Apple -- we heard Tim Cook say --MCDOWELL: Well --BOLTON: -- earlier this week, services, services, services, right? And really trying to sell the company's transition from --MCDOWELL: We --BOLTON: -- hardware to software.MCDOWELL: We both said this on this program, when they just stop disclosing unit sales, that's a --BOLTON: Yes, that was a big sign --MCDOWELL: -- that's a rut ro.K. KELLY: Yes, yes, that's a huge --MCDOWELL: Because what are you hiding?K. KELLY: Yes. Well, that's the whole thing, I mean they're not wanting to give guidance and they're trying to reduce transparency when it comes to their company. And so that's why this is not just a China story when it comes to Apple, so for Tim Cook to say that, because they actually have slowing iPhone sales here in the United States --MCDOWELL: Yes.K. KELLY: -- which is their biggest market. Listen, Apple only commands 20 percent of the operating systems when it comes to mobile cell phones, OK? The rest is on Android. They are very expensive, they increased the price. The average selling price of their units have gone up. And guess what? This is a commoditized product. I can get the same features in any manufacturer.BOLTON: I like what you said about the lack of transparency. We don't know how much they make from iCloud subscriptions. Like there's a lot that's just bundled into this service's chunk and basically us and the analysts have to kind of just guess what's where.MCDOWELL: But to -- we'll get into that. But have a problem that Microsoft -- the reason Microsoft's still in a strong position is because they have a locked in business base, their locked in base of businesses in this country, and, you know what, regulators won't come after you when it's just businesses but you -- because they're a -- essentially a retail company that you can't really aggressively grow your market share and say services in your App Store and music --K. KELLY: The --MCDOWELL: -- because the people in Washington and around the globe will come after you. I want to just talk --K. KELLY: Yes. Yes.MCDOWELL: We'll talk about that.K. KELLY: Yes.MCDOWELL: That's my -- that's my theory. So, the December Jobs Report is out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Here are the exceptions, 177,000 jobs added with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.7 percent. What are you looking for? Tell us something we don't know, Kevin.K. KELLY: Yes, I'm going to go back to what Secretary Mnuchin said, I'm going to be looking at the labor force participation rate. He said they want to get people back into the Jobs Market, not necessarily just seeing where the jobs numbers goes as well as the average hourly. We need that labor force participation rate to tick up. We're still at -- averaging, you know, 20-year lows.MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm. I want to point something out, and this is good news. I think it would be hard to argue against the backdrop. The market is saying one thing, but the backdrop in the economy is healthy. With the December gain, unless there's a major shortfall, we're likely to push U.S. employment in this nation to more than 150 million jobs for the very first time. That's hugely optimistic.FOWLER: Oh, I think it definitely is. And I think the other thing to add to this is that, you know, a couple of days ago, a number of states also increased in minimum wage. I think we're going to wage gains happening across the -- in some states because people are going to be making more money. That means they'll be spending more money.MCDOWELL: And they're making more money organically, too, because in -- at least in November, 3.1 percent average hourly earnings gain in the last year, that's the fastest wage growth in a decade, in almost a decade. We - - that's something that we didn't see during President Obama's recovery. I just want to point that out, not to -- listen, President Obama, the economy started recovering under -- at the very beginning of his term, but again now we're growing at a faster rate by many metrics, point that out.Make sure you stay with us, we will bring you live coverage of the December Jobs Report, we start at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Coming up, the shutdown showdown, Nancy Pelosi gets the gavel once again. President Trump threatens to veto any house package that does not include border wall funding. Well, that's what they passed last night. Hearing date set, ousted Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn will make his first public appearance in court after being detained in a Japanese jail in November. All this as we count down to December Jobs next.MCDOWELL: We have a -- gains across the board, major gains, a 302-point gain on the Dow Futures right now. Reversing about half of yesterday's losses, which were -- the Dow -- the -- really all the markets driven lower by Apple and then that weaker manufacturing report. We'll be watching this. I think the question of the morning as we move ahead to the Jobs Report at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time is, will a good, if not great Jobs Number be bad for the markets? How will the markets react? We'll dig into that as we move on.Meantime, President Trump set to hold a second meeting with congressional leaders today to discuss border wall funding. Cheryl Casone has more. Good morning, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning. And here we go again. And remember, this is after that first meeting he had with them on Wednesday. And you saw it made no progress to the end government shutdown. Well, last night, House Democrats did pass two bills, but it didn't include money for the wall to reopen the government on their first day in power.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: This is not a wall between Mexico and the United States that the President is creating here, it's a wall between reality and his constituents, his supporters. He does not want them to know what he's doing to Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security in his budget.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Well, Vice President Pence spoke to Tucker Carlson last night. HE emphasized the need for a wall.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think the President's made it very clear --TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Yes.PENCE: -- no wall, no deal. We can agree on those facts, come together around solutions, but part of that solution means a wall, it means a barrier in -- along our southern border.CARLSON: Right.(END VIDEOTAPE)CASONE: So then Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says that the Senate will not consider those democratic bills.Well, former Nissan Chairman, Carlos Ghosn, is set to appear in a Tokyo court on Tuesday. This is going to be his first public appearance since his arrest seven weeks ago for allegedly underreporting his income by 44 million. Ghosn has denied any wrongdoing. Now Ghosn reportedly has paid two Middle East acquaintances nearly $50 million with Nissan money. That's some of the charges against him. But, again, all of this is going to be more public next week when we get to hear from him finally for the first time.Well, a late holiday gift for former Toys "R" Us workers, employees who lost their jobs when the retailer liquidated last June begun receiving checks from a $20 million hardship fund that was established by the buyout firms, KKR and Bain Capital. Worker advocacy groups and politicians have been pressuring these firms because Toys "R" Us did not provide severance payments for any of its workers at the time. The worker groups estimate that the 64,000 employees were entitled 75 million in severance based on, Dagen, their years of service. So, you know, you're going to put somebody out of business, maybe do the right thing by those folks who worked hard there for so many years.MCDOWELL: Indeed, Cheryl, thank you so much. And next week, be sure to tune in. Maria's back on Monday and she will be sitting down starting Tuesday at 6:00 a.m., Maria's interview with JP Morgan Chase Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon from the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in san Francisco. So, he cannot only talk health care, but really the state of the world.Coming up, focus on the Federal Reserve. The future of rising interest rates in doubt, market volatility and economic uncertainty may be weighing on the Central Bank's decisions, we take a closer look at the key issues ahead of the Jobs Report.Plus, ready to serve, again, the all-American photo showing three combat veterans after being sworn into Congress and it is going viral. We have that story next.MCDOWELL: Heroes on the hill, there are not three wounded veteran lawmakers in the 116th Congress and a photo goes viral. It comes amid a possible hiring boom for veterans in Washington. Lauren Simonetti has all the details. Good morning, Lauren.SIMONETTI: What a story, what a tweet. Let's show you the picture that the Congressmen from Florida, Brian Mast, tweeted out yesterday first day of the 116th congress. Now he was a bomb disposal expert and lost both of his legs in Afghanistan. He's the guy in the middle. On the left is Representative Jim Baird of Indiana, a Vietnam war veteran, and on the right Dan Crenshaw of Texas, he was actually also a Navy Seal, and in this tweet where he writes, "Five eyes, five arms, four legs, all-American," highlighting what they lost when they served their country. They did not mention the three Purple Hearts and the four Bronze Stars.There are right now 96 lawmakers with military service in Congress, but that's not a lot. The value of someone who served our country, what they know, what they can do. Their demeanor is often understated. It's not being understated at Amazon right now. As you know, they have those two headquarters that they're opening, one in the Washington D.C. area. They're hiring 25,000 jobs. And don't be competing with the likes of Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman for that talent.Amazon has already been training many veterans on cybersecurity so they could work at web services, et cetera, cloud computing, so there's going to be a push for specially a tech savvy veteran with a security clearance who can work at Amazon or these other companies because there was already a skilled shortage of workers, there's going to be an even bigger one now with Amazon coming in.I do want to point out, remember when Jeff Bezos made a political donation or a nonpolitical donation in the sense that he contributed $10 million to a group that helps veterans get elected? He was onto something. This is a company that is doing good things for the country and letting those who have done good things for our country, find gainful employment.MCDOWELL: So this was a story that was in the Wall Street Journal about how these veterans coming out of military service now are in such high demand --SIMONETTI: Uh-hmm.MCDOWELL: -- among all employers. Favorite story of the week hands down. But then also remember, Jeff Bezos came out pushing back on Google, refusing to do business with the Department of Defense here in the United States.SIMONETTI: Right.MCDOWELL: Willing to do whatever it takes really to work with the Chinese government, but not doing business with the -- of -- with our Defense Department. Jeff Bezos, very, very firmly came out and said sometimes you have to push back against pressure --BOLTON: Uh-hmm.MCDOWELL: -- and know and do the right thing, and so he realizes the value of not only supporting our veterans in the private sector, but also supporting our military.SIMONETTI: And our -- and our country and sharing the intelligence, the artificial intelligence, the data that his tech company has with our government. And like you said, something Google wasn't as willing to do.K. KELLY: Well, it's pretty fascinating, too, because we actually had the President of Microsoft here and he was saying we actually do need regulations when it comes to A.I., and --MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm.K. KELLY: -- facial recognition technology and that lends to the credence that the next warfare that's going to be significant in our lifetimes is most likely going to be cyber warfare and so that's why I think you're seeing Jeff Bezos talk about, you know, veterans in congress and in his company to help lead for that defense because that's where the next battleground's going to be.MCDOWELL: Yes. These are the new nuclear weapons.K. KELLY: Yes, exactly.BOLTON: For sure.MCDOWELL: And Richard, I will point out that the Democrats ran a number of veterans --FOWLER: Absolutely.MCDOWELL: -- in elections. And so this was -- this is -- service is not - - it doesn't have a party affiliation.FOWLER: Services by -- no, service is absolutely bipartisan. And I think -- I think you bring up a great point about A.I., because I think as we move into 2019, not only are we a part of how we deal with, you know, our security but A.I. will become part of every lives. I mean not only do we use it to unlock our phones. But people are using it to determine which way the wind blows and how they should plant their crops. So this is a real thing that is affecting real people. So, I'm happy to see Amazon in it. I know Google is doing a lot of work around A.I. as well to make sure that small communities have access to it, too.MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm. Great insight. Lauren, thank you for that report.SIMONETTI: Beautiful story.MCDOWELL: I'm glad we finally got to -- because it was my -- that was my favorite--SIMONETTI: My favorite story of the week.MCDOWELL: Yes. And I --FOWLER: Well deserved.MCDOWELL: No, and I've read a lot of stories this week. I was reading monetary policy research last night because I'm a huge loser. Good to see you later, Simonetti. We'll see you later. Coming up, a deadly crash down in Florida to tell you about, at least seven people were killed after two tractor trailers collided on a highway. The latest there coming up. And another round of trade talks, global stocks gaining ground as China confirms takes talks with the U.S. next week.MCDOWELL: Welcome back, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo, it's jobs Friday, January 4th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.Some green this Friday morning, thank everybody, 312-point gain on the Dow Futures, right now. The bulls are running after that more than 600-point loss on the Blue Chips yesterday, on news that trade talks are on. A U.S. trade representative said to be heading to Beijing, for two days next week, to talk trade.This, as China has cut a key lending rate that is going to pump -- I was reading Charles Payne's Twitter feed this morning that will pump essentially $160 billion into the Chinese economy, looking to rescue an economy that is weakening there and hurting U.S. businesses as well.We have gains across the board here, in the U.S. Yesterday, we had more than almost three percent loss on the Dow, the S&P and the NASDAQ, lost more than three percent in trading, Thursday.In Europe, we have green across the board to tell you about, gains north of one percent, in England, France and Germany. And most of the Asian markets were higher overnight, except for the Nikkei, which fell more than two percent.We are just two hours away from the December jobs report. The expectation is for 177,000 jobs added. The unemployment rate holding steady at 3.7 percent, wages expected to gain three percent in the last year, and we can slightly but still, close to the best levels we've seen in about a decade.A deadly crash to tell you about, in Florida, the fiery accident involving multiple vehicles, including two tractor-trailers has left at least seven people dead, a highway shutdown. We have the latest.Then, a new strategy for game stop, how the videogame retailer is looking to boost sales, amid a possible buyout, plus, Snoop Dogg and Snoop, the dog, the story behind the rapper's appeal to adopt a rescue dog. I love it.Our top story this half hour, market volatility in the New Year, Futures pointing higher after the market took a nosedive yesterday, driving an action today, China confirming another round of trade talks early next week, China's central bank taking action to pump money into the economy.Joining us now is Fixed Income Advisors -- SIT Fixed Income Advisors, Senior Vice President, Portfolio Manager, Bryce Doty, Bryce, what are you watching for today in this jobs report? What will be good --BRYCE DOTY, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, SIT FIXED INCOME ADVISORS: I think it's --MCDOWELL: Yes, like, if we get too much good news, is it going be bad for the market?DOTY: Right. Good news is bad news. I was just going to say. I think you could easily get a jobs number over 200,000, but do you really lie? You have to be careful what you wish for. If it's -- if it's too strong, everyone thinks, oh no, now the feds going to be back on track for raising rates and then the short-lived uptick in stocks will evaporate in a second.So, you almost want a jobs number that's close to expectations with hardly any additional wage gains. I think that there's some real risk that the -- a positive risk that the jobs number will be pretty strong. Now, the impact on the markets, as you say, you know, that could be very counterintuitive, you can have a strong jobs market and see the stock market take a hit.K. KELLY: Bryce, it's pretty fascinating sitting here at the start of 2019, and seeing where the 10-year treasury is, and actually, expectations of where the feds going to go for the rest of the year. So, seeing where we've got a 10-year treasury below 2.75, boggles my mind, especially where we are in the economy.Do you think we're going to get some reprieve in the short term two-year treasuries, because people are starting to go to cash? I think one of the reasons why we're seeing volatility in the market is because you do have alternatives, you're getting high yield that we haven't seen in years from just short-term paper.DOTY: Right. Not only are you getting decent money market returns for the first time, in over a decade, you're also seeing corporate bond yields actually rise. So the 10-year treasury is pretty lousy. I mean, I'd rather be in cash than a 10-year treasury, given that they are almost the same yield at this point. And yet, you can get over four percent in investment rig corporate bond portfolios.So, what do you do as an asset allocator? You know, you've been way underweighted bonds for who knows how long, right? And now, you can actually get a decent money income, all of a sudden, bonds become an asset class again.So you start allocating from stocks to bonds, lower the volatility, you know, that create some disruption in the -- in the stock market, as people start to do that. But I think -- I think it makes sense to do a combination of you know, T-Bills or cash, or something like that, and some corporate bonds, versus just being, you know, 100 percent or 80 percent in stocks, like it seems like people have been for a long time.BOLTON: Bryce, Deirdre here, I'm just curious, how much risk do you think is actually in the corporate bond market, right now, because according to a lot of people that I've been speaking with, and pieces I've been reading, it seems like we are fairly heavily over levered, almost in a way that we haven't been, since something like, 2012.DOTY: Well, the real problem, to me, is that there's -- it feels like there's this huge sucking sound of all of this money coming out of high yield, out of stocks, emerging markets, bank loans, and going into the government bond sector, because there's this massive supply demand void that needs to be filled.You've got the fed, reducing the balance sheet, which means they're eliminating half $1 trillion a year worth of demand for government bonds. At the same time, the treasury department is adding $1 trillion worth of supply years, so it's a huge beast that needs to be fed $125 billion a month.That money has to come from somewhere to fill this void, so that's the risk with corporate bonds. It's not the fault risk that (INAUDIBLE) find, you know, you're not going to see companies fold, but the fact that there's this massive draw of money to fill this $125 billion gap, you know, every single month, it's -- you know, that leaves a mark.MCDOWELL: I suspect if you look at what the Federal Reserve has done, and again, the last message from the fed, even though market expectations have changed in terms of rates being steady next year, if not lower, but the fed was pretty clear that they are on track for two rate hikes next year, and autopilot on the balance sheet reductions of what has been about $50 billion a month.That being said, it looks like the fed is actually acting pre-emptively, and I might be off base here, but to burst some of these bubbles, basically deflate some of these bubbles, you've seen (INAUDIBLE) because we talk --That was an excellent question about the corporate debt, and the debt that corporations have taken on in this country, whether it's even Bitcoin, Kevin, this technology stocks were very bubbly looking in terms of the valuations.And I want to ask you this, Bryce, because Jay Powell is speaking later this morning, Kevin sat down in Atlanta. I mean, that's going to be -- people are going to be on pins and needles ahead of that, even if regardless of what happens in the jobs report.DOTY: Right. And Powell knows that -- you're right, you know, there was a bubble. The corporation is paying two and three percent to borrow money, is way too low, given the risk of any business. So, even in paying 4, 4- 1/2 percent, it's still, you know, attractive.So, Powell understands that things were being propped up and manipulated by central banks, and we need to kind of get away from that, but he's a lose- lose situation, OK? I don't know any Federal Reserve chair that's just going to be popular raising rates or tightening monetary policy, especially with politicians.So, no matter what he says, I think the market is going to criticize him for something because he's delivering, you know, medicine. Medicine is good for the economy, it's good for markets, but people don't like it because it comes with additional volatility, it comes with, you know -- the fact that corporations have to pay higher rate now.MCDOWELL: I'll point --DOTY: They're obviously not happy about that.MCDOWELL: that Powell, the event he's participating in, down in Atlanta, he's going to be in a discussion with individuals, including Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke, so that would be a barn-burner. Again, because it looks like -- it looks like Powell is -- and his fed --Even though Janet Yellen did start hiking short-term interest rates, it looks like that he's trying to do something that Alan Greenspan failed to do, and Ben Bernanke failed to do, and that's like putting out -- putting out a bubble before it gets so large that it puts the financial system at risk. Richard, you have a question for Bryce?FOWLER: Bryce, question for you, so as we're talking about central banks, and with the news that Dagen started the segment with, about the fact that China is putting $116 billion in central banks and knowing that China's looming heavy on the market, does that scare investors?How do investors feel about the fact that the -- does that mean this trade war is going to continue, these negotiations will be nothing if they're sort of bracing for longer-term impacts?DOTY: Right. I think it's a positive thing that they're doing that. I think that trade talks, you know, are progressing. I think that's going to probably end well, but I think the market doesn't seem to care about good news. It always takes the negative side of it right now. You know, that's a sentiment shift from just two or three months ago.So, I think your concern is well-founded, that they'll look at that as like, things must be really bad there, rather than seeing as, oh, this could be good, it'll help the growth, help them rebound a little bit. Everyone's taking the negative side of that, the negative view of that, and I don't necessarily agree with that.But when you see that type of dislocation, I think there's an opportunity, you know, talking about bubbles and going back to where markets are at, I feel a lot better about where the stock market's at, I feel a lot better about where corporate bond yields are, and spreads are, than they used to be.So, in the sense this bursting of the bubble is very helpful and puts us at a better valuation for most assets.FOWLER: Is there anything the White House could say to investors on China, to sort of ease the pressure that's happening on the market?DOTY: Oh my gosh, I mean, the less they say, the better, oh, it's just killing me.MCDOWELL: Bryce, on that note, I'm going to say thank you and goodbye. But I will say I have said that for two years. That -- and I have said it more and more in the last year, that the more of these advisors you put out there who are kind of, like, far afield and saying whatever they want to, when you have one of your trade advisors talking about, the fed just gets out of the way, it's going to be the next leg up in the bull market.Why are you talking about the stock market? Why are talking about tech stocks and the central bank, when you're a trade negotiator? So, anyway, I'll leave it at that. Bryce, thank you so much. Bryce Doty.Coming up, a new strategy for GameStop, how the struggling game retailer hopes to boost sales amid a possible buyout. And a new dog for Snoop Dogg, the rapper warms the internet's heart by offering to adopt a puppy that bears his name.MCDOWELL: It is a big turnaround from that steep, steep selloff that we saw yesterday, the Dow Futures are up 317 points. 8:30 a.m. Eastern is when we get the jobs report for the month of December. What will that do? What will impact be there?But we have a turnaround in stocks, again, maybe some hope about trade negotiations with China, stimulus coming out of China, as it is pumping money into the financial system there, we'll be covering the developments as we move forward, but it was one rough day in the markets yesterday, to say the least, driven by Apple and that disappointing report on U.S. manufacturing. Several people killed in a fiery crash on a Florida highway. Cheryl Casone has details. Cheryl?CASONE: Yes, Dagen. Several children were among seven people killed in that fiery crash. This happened near Gainesville. Several people, also taken to the hospital, some in critical condition. Two tractor-trailers and two passenger cars were involved in this wreck. 50 gallons of diesel spilled out onto the highway, that ignited a huge fire. Investigators are treating this crash as a homicide but they haven't said why they're doing that. They are working at this point to identify the victims.Well, GameStop is looking for ways to stay in the retail game. The company is restructuring its business as it searches for its fifth CEO in just over a year. And two private equity firms, Sycamore Partners and Apollo Global Management are said to be preparing bids for GameStop. Sales have not moved above the 9-billion mark over the last two years. GameStop shares are down 28 percent from just one year ago. So, a rough stop for GameStop, as you can see there.Well, this, Dagen, is going to hurt you. It hurts me. This heartbreaking video shows a dog being abandoned in England. You can see the dog, named Snoop, tried to get back into his owner's car when he realizes what's happening to him. This video caught the attention of another, Snoop, though, there's a good side of the story, folks. Rapper Snoop Dogg says this dog is welcome at his place in Los Angeles. He told the Daily Star there's always room for another dog in Casa de Snoop, if he really needed a home, he has got one with us. Now, that was a Staffordshire bull terrier that you saw in the video. That dog should have no trouble finding a home. Many other people are now offering to adopt this dog. The RSPCA, we should say, is investigating who in the world abandoned Snoop before, of course, Snoop gets a new home. It's just heartbreaking.MCDOWELL: You got chocked -- you were getting choked up, aren't you?CASONE: I think it's just horrible that people can be so cruel to an innocent animal. I think it's horrible.MCDOWELL: And it's up to all of us to, basically, shame those who are so deeply evil and rescue animals, as many as you can fit in your apartment or your home.K. KELLY: Can I quickly just say on the GameStop situation? It's pretty fascinating that you're seeing two private equity firms coming in and buying them. One reasons why is because there isn't a Netflix for game streaming that's really taking precedence.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Twitch. Amazon's Twitch?K. KELLY: So, GameStop -- Twitch, but that's like a subscription where you're paying to download the games. So, it's fascinating because GameStop is the blockbuster of video games, right? So, it's pretty fascinating to see where that's happened, fifth CEO, that's reminiscent of Barnes & Noble. We definitely have certainly a retail revolution in the way we're consuming content and purchasing goods --FOWLER: Kevin, I have one word for you, it's called Amazon.MCDOWELL: Thank you so much. Before we go to break, adopt a dog. Rescue a dog. Cheryl is going yes. Coming up, new year, new you with healthy eating. We talk to three healthy snack business owners who can help you stick to your 2019 resolutions. Plus, weighing in on the job market, this jobs Friday.MCDOWELL: New year, new year with healthy eating. Our next guests are appealing to you 2019 resolutions with some with some healthy eats. Joining us now is Prommus CEO, Anthony Brahimsha; Krave and Smashmallow Founder Jon Sebastiani; and SnackNation Co-Founder and CEO Sean Kelly. Today's jobs report, we got to like all this pump from off air. Let's start with what each company is working on. Sean, just described the environment right now in terms of this country and maybe -- because again, how we're eating and how we change the way we're eating is positive but again, the economic backdrop is critical.SEAN KELLY, FOUNDER, SNACKNATION: It absolutely is. I mean, I think at the end of the day, people want the same great classics, the same great taste just with more functional and better ingredients that will help them perform better in the real world. So, you have everything from hot trends like plant-based foods.MCDOWELL: I think that's going to be one of the biggest trends in the new year being a vegan myself and really focused on that kind of eating. I think that, that -- I mean, you've seen it in, Jon, even fast foods, in fast food restaurants.JON SEBASTIANI, FOUNDER, KRAVE AND SMASHMALLOW: Yes, absolutely. I mean, this brand, one of them, Zupa Noma, is a vegetable-based product that I'm drinking here for breakfast.MCDOWELL: I won't drink out of it. I might -- I have a little bronchitis. No, no, I'm just looking at it. Continue.SEBASTIANI: No, vegan diets, in fact, I think -- we're going to see more of as a (INAUDIBLE) diet where we're really including paleo and vegetarian together.MCDOWELL: And that the opportunity is not only -- what kind of to the individual and to the consumer but is also how to integrate that food in restaurants. And even, you know, mom and even Mom and Pop restaurants, for example. But Anthony to you, talk about your business and just the backdrop in terms of our economy right now.ANTHONY BRAHIMSHA, CEO, PROMMUS: Absolutely. So, Prommus is the first ever high-protein, low calorie, clean label hummus. So, essentially, we have two times more protein than any other hummus on the shelf. We're a hundred percent clear label, so all of our products are high pressure pasteurized. So, no heat touches our product and no artificial preservatives.MCDOWELL: And talk about we're getting into store chains and getting into not just grocery stores but convenience stores. Where is the opportunity there and how does that part of our economy look?BRAHIMSHA: So, I think right now -- I mean, the biggest thing is disrupting a category and that's what the buyers and retailers want to see. They want see disruption in a category that is stale in a sense that everybody is doing the same exact thing. With Prommus, we're the first one to disrupt the category in the sense of functionality and nutrition. We're the first-ever high-protein hummus in regards to all the other brands out there; they're disrupting in the sense of flavors and, you know, artificial flavors such as sriracha hummus or (INAUDIBLE) hummus but our brand, our product is a 100 percent authentic from the foundational story, all the way up to the nutritional value.MCDOWELL: Sean, is there any category you think is -- that look saturated right now in terms of this direction in healthy eating? Because there any one potential weak spot going into the new year?S. KELLY: Well, I think the nice thing is that there's no weak spots in terms of snacks as a whole, right? So, yes, there are certainly categories where when one winner emerges, right, you could point to jerky and then a lot of other players, Jon, you know so something -- you know so much of jerky -- he founded Krave jerky, but -- we love the guys at (INAUDIBLE) jerky, doing a great job. But there's a lot of jerky players coming in. So, I don't know if I'd be one to rush into meat jerky, right now, because of the people at Krave, because of field trip.But you have that also, people being so innovative to meet consumer demands and those tastes. So, you have verky now -- vegan jerkies. Right, so the mushroom jerkies, is another thing. So, I think that the nice thing is that no matter if there is category saturation, that you can still innovate. And the interesting thing about the economy, even though I think the economy is going to have a nice rebound -- we're in an interesting time right now -- snacks go through the roof when people spend a little bit less in restaurants, they buy more snacks and more convenience items.MCDOWELL: Jon, where is the innovation? Where are you innovating? Because you talked about the -- you know, the Krave jerky.SEBASTIANI: Yes, we're innovating everywhere but in the theme of snacks, we're really focusing on two areas right now. One is permissible indulgence, so everybody in America still likes to have their sweets. Now, we have a brand called smashmallow that's actually bringing in a very delightful, flavor-forward product that's just far less guilty if you want to have a sweet treat. Secondly --MCDOWELL: The only problem is like me, I -- you will eat -- still eat too much of it. And that's like, why did I just gain 10 pounds in the last six months? And it is adding -- it's adding all these things to your diet.SEBASTIANI: You are seeing a trend of smaller bites in balls that used to be in a 250-calorie bar. You're now seeing products like verb, like good day, that are actually packaging these indulgences into smaller items.MCDOWELL: But Sean, this is me. It's like, it doesn't matter about the size. It's like, oh, I just ate 40 of them. Finish your though real quick.SEBASTIANI: So, yes, in January, you know, obviously, much of America right now is entering some form of some diet, and I personally am doing the whole 30 diet right now and we have a new brand that we're launching in January called puckish, which is really (INAUDIBLE) the hard-boiled egg. The hard-boiled egg sourced from a free-range, organic chickens. This is capturing a very portable protein snack. And we think about snacking -- I think consumers this year are going to demand more freshness.MCDOWELL: Anthony Brahimsha, Jon Sebastiani and Sean Kelly, please come back as we move into the new year. Gentlemen, great to see you. Jobs, 90 minutes until we get the December jobs report. More when we come back.MCDOWELL: Good morning. I'm Dagen --Load-Date: January 4, 2019End of Document

Apple 'won't have a model' in China in five to ten years, Ian Bremmer predictsCNN WireFebruary 7, 2019 Thursday 4:00 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 356 wordsByline: By Matt Egan, CNN BusinessDateline: GRAND CAYMAN (CNN Business) BodyGRAND CAYMAN (CNN Business) --  Apple's business model in China will probably clash with the desires of Beijing's authoritarian government, Ian Bremmer predicted on Thursday."I think that within five to 10 years max, Apple doesn't have a model in China," Bremmer said during a presentation at the Cayman Alternative Investment Summit. Bremmer is the president and founder of consulting firm Eurasia Group.Apple relies on China for a chunk of its revenue. China is such an important market for Apple that the company issued a rare sales warning last month because of slowing growth and rising trade tensions there. But Bremmer argues that Apple is the antithesis of what Beijing wants. "Apple is really good at high-end consumer products that have secure data. Why would China want you to have that?" Bremmer asked. "That's completely opposed to the Chinese model."China's government relies on heavy-handed censorship to prevent dissent in its society. Alphabet's Google recently came under fire for reportedly building a censored search engine to get back into the Chinese market. After facing a backlash inside and outside Google, CEO Sudar Pichai told Congress late last year there are no plans to launch in China. "They are going to ensure that Apple doesn't have a model in China," Bremmer said. He didn't specify how exactly China's government would pressure Apple's business. Bremmer struck a more optimistic tone on the US-China trade war. He predicted that the United States would not levy any more tariffs on China on when the ceasefire expires on March 1. "A deal is coming," Bremmer said, noting that neither government wants to deal with the market and economic fallout. "That's the way globalization is supposed to work."But Bremmer sees a prolonged confrontation between the United States and China on the technology front. He predicted a battle for supremacy in crucial cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning and 5G. "We're heading toward a cold war. And I don't know which one is going to win," Bremmer said. TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.Load-Date: February 8, 2019End of Document

China and Taiwan clash in Lunar New Year military propaganda videosCNN WireFebruary 6, 2019 Wednesday 7:10 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 443 wordsByline: By Ben Westcott and Nanlin Fang, CNNDateline: HONG KONG (CNN) BodyHONG KONG (CNN) --  Beijing and Taipei have marked the Lunar New Year holiday by releasing competing videos of military grandstanding, in the latest rhetorical clash between the two governments.China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) published a video on Sunday showing famous sights and scenery from across the island of Taiwan juxtaposed against images of PLA jets and bombers soaring through the sky.The propaganda video was titled "My Fighting Eagles Fly Around Taiwan." The background lyrics called for China's "brothers and sisters" to "gently ... return."In response, the self-governed island's military released a dramatic video of soldiers, tanks and explosions on Sunday, overlaid with the message that Taiwan's army was "on standby 24/7.""Many men and women serving in the armed forces will miss New Year's Eve dinners with their families, but they will not be absent from standing guard to protect the country," Taiwan's military posted on their official Facebook.Tensions between Beijing and Taipei have been steadily increasing since 2016. The Chinese government has been placing greater military and economic pressure on Taiwan, which Beijing regards as part of its sovereign territory despite over 70 years of separation. In January, Chinese President Xi Jinping warned Taiwan that independence was "a dead end" and called for "peaceful reunification."Beijing's video and the rapid response from Taipei are particularly unusual given the current Lunar New Year holiday on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, during which governments are largely closed as people take time off to celebrate with family and friends.Since the beginning of January, articles in Chinese state-run media outlets have repeatedly highlighted military recruiting efforts and the expanding global role of the PLA.On January 25, at a meeting of the country's powerful Politburo decision-making body, Xi stressed that the Communist Party needed to strengthen communication across a range of fronts."The work of news and public opinion is facing new challenges as profound changes have taken place in the ecology of public opinion, the media landscape and the means of communication," state-run Xinhua quoted Xi as saying.Military analyst Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain, said China had been ramping up its military propaganda targeted at Taiwan's citizens, as well as a wider domestic and international audience."It is trying to convince them they cannot match China's military power, that defeat is inevitable and no one, not even the United States, will come to their aid," Schuster said.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Continue reading Huawei is suing the US for government ban on equipmentHuawei is suing the United States over policies banning the use of the company s equipment by the government. It s the latest escalation in a continuing battle over Huawei s position in the US.The suit alleges that policies passed by Congress last year as part of a defense spending package unconstitutionally singled out Huawei for punishment. When Congress passed the legislation, it included provisions blocking Chinese-made telecommunications equipment from being used in federal networks, effectively also preventing major government contractors from using Huawei equipment. The measure specifically named Huawei and ZTE, as well as some other Chinese companies.The company says that the measure breached a legal standard against making a  bill of attainder,  in which the government makes policy punitively directed at a small group. The suit also accuses the government of infringing on the company s due process rights.Accuses the US of passing a  bill of attainder Huawei executives announced the suit during a press conference in Shenzen. The company s rotating chairman Guo Ping said in a statement at the conference that, after failing to mollify the concerns of US lawmakers,  we are left with no choice but to challenge the law in court.  As they have in the past, Huawei executives argued at the press conference that a ban on Huawei is not only unnecessary, but that America will be left behind in the buildout of next-generation 5G networks.US officials have repeatedly branded Huawei as a potential security threat, arguing that the company could be used by the Chinese government as a tool for spying. Huawei has consistently denied that possibility, saying that the US has failed to produce evidence of its concerns. The measures preventing government equipment use have been one of the clearest actions against the company in the US.In recent years, Kaspersky Lab, a cybersecurity company based in Russia, was also roiled by allegations of potential espionage. The company filed a suit similar to Huawei s, but has not been successful. Huawei, which is asking a court to rule that the US s current policy is unconstitutional, will likely need to differentiate itself from that case.The largest provider of telecommunications equipment in the world, Huawei has faced scrutiny from lawmakers and intelligence officials over its operations, seemingly without end. As it battles policy measures, the US is also seeking the extradition from Canada of the company s chief financial officer, who has been accused of violating sanctions against Iran. The company, which has denied wrongdoing, has also been charged in the US with stealing trade secrets from T-Mobile. The Trump administration, meanwhile, has reportedly been considering an order that would further restrict the sale of Huawei s products, and the US has been pressing allied countries to drop the company s equipment.Tags: See Website:https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/6/18249974/huawei-lawsuit-china-sales-policy-government-security-spyingContact Information:Colin LecherTags:           Wire,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: March 10, 2019End of Document

Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, issued the following news release:Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford confirmed that Google's work in China is directly benefitting the Chinese military when responding to a line of questioning from Senator Hawley during today's Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.

Hoover receives pushback at panel on Chinese influence on U.S. institutionsThe Stanford Daily: Stanford UniversityFebruary 15, 2019 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1034 wordsBodyThe authors of a November 2018 report by the Hoover Institution that called for "constructive vigilance" against Chinese influence on U.S. institutions faced an oftentimes critical, predominantly Chinese audience in a panel discussion on their findings, which ranged from Chinese propaganda in U.S. media to illicit technology transfer.Amid rising U.S.-China tensions and increased university precautions against Chinese cyber-security threats, the event and its heated question-and-answer session revealed the heightened concerns of policy-makers regarding China's coercive influence in U.S. institutions, as well as escalating fears among segments of the Chinese-American community of a new wave of xenophobia and mistrust of their communities."I think we need to begin by saying we're no longer in a period where [China is] a rising superpower," said panelist Larry Diamond, a political science professor and Hoover fellow. "We now have a world of two superpowers, and we have a China with global ambitions ... This is a deeply authoritarian regime that is becoming more ideologically and intolerantly authoritarian than it was even five, seven, 10 years ago."Calling China's suppression of Tibetan autonomy a "cultural genocide" and warning of its "fusion of Party and State with high technology" in creating an "Orwellian surveillance state," Diamond argued that the United States needs to take immediate measures to strengthen itself.It was against this framing that the event's other panelists articulated the particular actions the Chinese Communist Party is taking against a variety of American institutions. Elizabeth Economy, a C.V. Starr Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, discussed CCP influence in U.S. think tanks and universities. John Pomfret, a Washington Post journalist, spoke of CCP media influence, and Kyle Hutzler, a Stanford MBA student and Hoover report co-author, explained government influence in U.S. corporations.Pomfret spoke of how the CCP believed members of the Chinese diaspora "belong to China ... and should support China and the goals of the Chinese Communist Party," while Hulitzer's description of the efforts of Chinese corporations and venture capital firms to acquire intellectual property for national security purposes hold direct implications for Stanford. A recent U.S. Trade Representative report accused the university of partnering with venture capital firm Digital Horizon Capital, which has direct links to Chinese government programs aiming to transfer foreign technology back into China.After the event, audience members immediately pushed back on the panelists' call for "constructive vigilance," arguing that the report inflated the China threat and could trigger unwarranted anti-Chinese sentiments."What it says is that we should not stereotype, although it says that there may be reason to do so," said Buck Gee M.S. '72 in reference to the report's framing of the China threat.Gee, a former Silicon Valley executive and member of the controversial Committee of 100, a leadership organization for Chinese Americans, later told The Daily that though he did not dispute the report's view of the issues, it has been interpreted by many as "stereotyping Chinese-Americans as potential spies."Audience member Wayne Lin, owner of the popular Chinese-language news and entertainment website Wenxuecheng, came to the event to "clear his name" after alleging that the report incorrectly stated that his company signed deals to run news from media outlets accused of promoting CCP propaganda, and falsely rumored that "the purchase of the website was subsidized by $1 million from the CCP Propaganda Department." Lin told The Daily that such statements were "totally wrong," that the author of that portion of the report apologized to him and that the panel "responded in positive ways" to his suggestions.Aware of these audience sentiments, panel members continuously denounced any potential scapegoating or targeting of the Chinese-American community, many citing their personal connections to Chinese family members and friends."We are united in feeling that the distinction of America and what will be our asset in both the legitimate and more challenging dimensions of the global era of competition that is upon us is our diversity, and if we don't embrace that and appreciate that and defend that, not only will be betray our ideals, but we will not be as effective as we should be," Diamond said.Pomfret echoed similar sentiments, remarking his view of the importance of acknowledging the "very difficult history that Chinese-Americans have had in the United States." Schell also warned that vigilance should not translate into "overzealous" monitoring of Chinese-American communities.One Chinese-American audience member adamantly voiced her support for the report, telling the panel that the report was "very reasonable" and "very balanced.""It says very clearly it's not about racial profiling," she said. "I'm Chinese-American; I have no issue with [the report]."Other took a more cautious approach."I would think that people need to look into the fundamental data [of the report] so maybe we can make a more fair and objective view on this," said Chao Gu J.D. '14. "It's too early to say whether we agree with it or not, but we need to look into the basis."Yet despite strong differences in opinion, the panelists were praised for their openness to conducting an evolving dialogue on the matter."Something I appreciated was that all the panelists [were] really trying to make an effort to have even private conversations and understand normal people who have their own views on this report," said James Noh '22.Contact Berber Jin at fjin16 'at' stanford.edu.While you're here...We're a student-run organization committed to providing hands-on experience in journalism, digital media and business for the next generation of reporters.

NEW YORK TIMES: TRUMP TOUTS PROGRESS WITH CHINA, BUT PRESSURE GROWS FOR A TOUGH DEALUS Fed NewsFebruary 25, 2019 Monday 2:47 PM  ESTCopyright 2019 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 1741 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, Feb. 25 -- Rep. Lloyd Doggett issued the following news:President Trump's decision to back off his threat to raise tariffs on Chinese goods carries substantial political risk as the president faces increased pressure from Republicans, Democrats and some of his own advisers to win the kind of tough concessions that Beijing has long resisted.Citing "substantial progress" in talks between the United States and China, Mr. Trump on Sunday evening halted plans to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods at the end of this week. On Monday, the president predicted that President Xi Jinping of China would soon join him at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump's Florida resort, for a "signing summit.""We're getting very, very close," Mr. Trump said at a gathering of governors at the White House.Mr. Trump's optimism has cheered Wall Street and business lobbyists, who have been pushing for a quick end to the trade war. But Democrats and even some Republicans are not so sanguine.Top Democrats, in an effort to outflank Mr. Trump on China, are warning loudly that the Chinese may simply be dangling false promises in hopes of getting the president to end a trade war that is hurting American farmers and damaging the Chinese economy. Some Republicans fear that Mr. Trump may settle for a deal that simply reduces the trade deficit between the two countries and potentially offers relief to a Chinese telecommunication giant, Huawei, which is facing criminal charges in the United States."It's become a real concern that Democrats could use this against him in the 2020 election," Michael Pillsbury, director of Chinese strategy at the Hudson Institute and a White House adviser, said of the dangers of Mr. Trump cutting a modest trade deal with China.Mr. Trump has positioned his monthslong trade fight with China as necessary to win "the biggest deal" in history. China has agreed to make some changes to its trading relationship with America, including purchasing more soybeans and natural gas and preventing currency manipulation. The government has also committed to opening up financial services, insurance and car markets, changes the Chinese have previously discussed.But many of the biggest sticking points still remain, including China's state subsidization of companies, which gives Chinese firms a competitive advantage. Beijing also still appears to be falling short of the administration's demands to stop what it says is a pattern of cybertheft and to end a requirement that American companies hand over valuable intellectual property as a condition of doing business there, people familiar with the negotiations said.The Chinese are touting a clause in their investment law that would crack down on such transfers of technologies and offering up tougher regulations surrounding patents and copyrights, but some administration officials are skeptical that these changes will go far enough.The Chinese embassy released a statement through China's state news agency, Xinhua, on Monday saying talks over the weekend were focused "on the text of an agreement" and that the two sides would continue to push toward an agreement."The Chinese delegation said that substantial progress was made on such specific issues as technology transfer, protection of intellectual property rights, non-tariff barriers, service industry, agriculture and exchange rates," the statement said.Top Democrats have focused on Mr. Trump's desire to reduce the bilateral trade deficit with China and are prepared to call any agreement that is based primarily on purchases of American soybeans, liquid natural gas and other farm products a failure."At the heart of our economic challenges with China is its shirking of market economics, so it is troubling that Donald Trump may settle for a government commitment to buy U.S. agriculture as a means to let China off the hook," said Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon.Democrats will have their first formal opportunity to confront the Trump administration directly on its China trade policy on Wednesday when Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, testifies before the House Ways and Means Committee. Mr. Lighthizer, a longtime China hard-liner and the administration's top negotiator, is expected to face tough questioning from Democrats seeking assurances Mr. Trump will not accept a watered-down deal and declare victory."With so many losses, Trump needs a win and any win will suffice - even one that is just Chinese promises of future purchases without meaningful, structural reform," said Representative Lloyd Doggett, a Texas Democrat who sits on the Ways and Means Committee.Mr. Trump has already started to signal his political concerns publicly. During a news conference at the White House this month, the president suggested that he would invite Democratic leaders to participate in negotiations with China so that they would not be able to undercut whatever agreement he reaches."Any deal I make with China, Schumer is going to stand up and say, 'Oh, it should've been better,' " Mr. Trump said, referring to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader. "That's called politics."An aide to Mr. Schumer said that no invitation has been offered.Last week, Mr. Trump even embraced Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on trade. The president said that Mr. Sanders, who is making his second presidential run as a Democrat, tends to agree with him on the issue and that Mr. Sanders is "tough on trade."While Mr. Sanders has praised some of Mr. Trump's moves on trade, he has also been critical of his negotiating approach in some cases, and has opposed the Trump administration's steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada, Mexico and Europe.Mr. Pillsbury said that Mr. Trump's campaign advisers have been gathering opposition research files on potential 2020 rivals and carefully taking note of what certain people, such as Senator Sherrod Brown, the Ohio Democrat who is considering a run, have been saying about China.Mr. Brown was one of three top Democrats - along with Mr. Schumer and Mr. Wyden - who sent a letter to Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, this month urging the administration to "stay aggressive" and ensure that China commits to verifiable, enforceable reforms. The letter was sent following reports that Mr. Mnuchin wanted to scale back Chinese tariffs in advance of a deal."I will wait to judge the outcome of the trade talks until I know what's been agreed to," Mr. Brown said in a statement. "But it's imperative that the White House secures an enforceable deal that includes long-term structural reforms to stop China's unfair trade practices and ensures American workers can compete on a level playing field."Officials from both countries have continued to be vague about the details of the progress, leading to speculation that China is just repackaging old promises as new concessions. China experts and business lobbyists say that the Chinese government has been carefully watching the shifting political dynamics in the United States, along with Mr. Trump's ongoing legal turmoil, as it determines how to navigate the trade war in an environment with Democrats controlling more power in Washington.In some cases, newly empowered Democrats have become an asset to the administration's China hawks, Mr. Lighthizer and Peter Navarro, who have been pressing Mr. Trump not to cut a modest deal and roll back tariffs to please Wall Street.Mr. Schumer has long been critical of China's trade practices that have been harmful to the rural parts of New York State and he has been a vocal critic of China's history of currency manipulation. Speaker Nancy Pelosi's return as the leader of the House of Representatives was also met with wariness in China. She has for years been outspoken about China's human rights record and has met on multiple occasions with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader vilified by China.Because of that long history, Mr. Trump's advisers fear that Democrats in Congress will have more credibility when criticizing Mr. Trump's eventual China agreement even if it does not require congressional approval."The Democrats are going to use this against him," said Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council. "As we go into the election cycle, it is natural and part of our national tradition that one side criticizes the other for China."Mr. Allen noted that political protest in the United States over China goes back to the country's inception, with the Boston Tea Party triggered by anger over imports of Chinese tea and that the anti-China sentiment tends to bubble up every four years. In 2012, Senator Harry Reid, then the Democratic majority leader, called for U.S. Olympic uniforms to be burned when it emerged that they were made in China.There are also signs that Mr. Trump could face backlash from his own party if he is too conciliatory. During his meeting with a Chinese delegation in the Oval Office on Friday, Mr. Trump raised eyebrows among Republicans when he suggested that relief for Huawei, which has been charged with stealing intellectual property and impeding an investigation into the telecom company's attempt to evade economic sanctions on Iran, could be part of the trade deal.Following Mr. Trump's comment, Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, wrote in a post on Twitter that Huawei is a "serious national security threat" and a "Trojan Horse" for the Chinese Communist Party. And Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, dismissed a tweet by Sonny Perdue, the agriculture secretary, for touting China's commitment to buy an extra 10 million metric tons of soybeans and said that any deal that allows China to keep "stealing trade secrets" will not be a success.The blowback from both directions may leave Mr. Trump little choice but to keep the threat of tariffs alive so that he can continue to claim he's being tough on China, analysts said. In a January interview with The New York Times, Mr. Trump acknowledged that some of the $250 billion worth of tariffs could be made permanent.On Monday, as Mr. Trump headed to Hanoi for a meeting with North Korean Leader Kim Jung Un, he tweeted "Relationship between our two Countries is very strong. I have therefore agreed to delay U.S. tariff hikes. Let's see what happens?"

It unveiled an expensive, new foldable phone that made headlines and turned attention to a product that's not facing any global controversy.The United States government also dispatched a delegation to lobby its case, which it has pressed with allies across the world in recent weeks."The global nature of data flows and interconnectedness means that threats to U.S. networks have a direct bearing on the security of our allies, just as threats to our allies networks have a direct bearing on the security of the United States," said Robert Strayer, the top U.S. diplomat for cybersecurity policy."To this end the United States is asking other governments and the private sector to consider the threat posed by Huawei and other Chinese information technology companies."Strayer did not detail specific security threats Huawei poses, despite being asked by reporters to do so in a news briefing on the show's sidelines.The U.S. campaign took a symbolic hit after the United Arab Emirates, a key ally in the Middle East, said it would use Huawei in its networks. And European allies are balking at banning the company outright.Strayer denied Washington was retaliating as part of a broader trade war between the U.S. and China, saying the motivation was based on security concerns partly related to Chinese laws requiring companies to comply with intelligence requests.Strayer called Huawei "duplicitous and deceitful," pointing out that U.S prosecutors have charged the company with intellectual property theft and allege its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, committed fraud by misleading banks about Huawei's business dealings in Iran.However, it's far from clear that telecom executives in Europe and other regions are buying Washington's argument, with leaders of some of the biggest mobile operators calling for fact-based security assessments.The U.S. is "fighting an uphill battle" against the telecom industry, said Paul Triolo, head of geotechnology at the Eurasia Group consultancy. "They don't have a smoking gun here," so they're trying to build a stronger case around the company's behavior and issues with the Chinese government, he said.Guo, one of three Huawei executives who take turns as chairman, said the telecom industry needs unified standards and clear regulations. He rejected the U.S. allegations."We don't do bad things. Here, let me say this as clear as possible.

US INVESTIGATORS ACCUSE HUAWEI OF FRAUD, TRYING TO STEAL SECRETSStates News ServiceJanuary 29, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1114 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Authorities in the United States on Tuesday indicted China's flagship telecoms giant Huawei on charges of fraud, attempted theft of trade secrets, and obstruction of justice, as investigators formally placed an extradition request for the company's chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou.Prosecutors in Brooklyn, New York charged Huawei, two of its affiliates, and Meng with charges related to bank fraud and money laundering, the Department of Justice said in a news release.They were also accused of violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) governing sanctions with Iran. Huawei was also charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice related to a grand jury investigation of its activities in the Eastern District of New York."Huawei and its Chief Financial Officer broke U.S. law and have engaged in a fraudulent financial scheme that is detrimental to the security of the United States," Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement."They willfully conducted millions of dollars in transactions that were in direct violation of the Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations, and such behavior will not be tolerated," Nielsen said.Wilbur Ross of the U.S. Department of Commerce said the administration of President Donald Trump was "tougher" on those who violate export controls than any previous administration, while FBI Director Christopher Wray said Huawei was accused of showing "blatant disregard" for U.S. law and international business practices."Companies like Huawei pose a dual threat to both our economic and national security," Wray said. "We will not tolerate businesses that violate our laws, obstruct justice, or jeopardize national and economic well-being."Acting U.S. Attorney General Matthew G. Whitaker called on China to "hold its citizens and Chinese companies accountable for complying with the law."The DOJ said Huawei had hidden behind a linked company, Skycom, to mask its operations in Iran and accused Meng of repeatedly lying to Huawei's banking partners about the relationship with Skycom, which they described as a "partner.""Huawei orchestrated the 2007 sale [of Skycom] to appear as an arm's length transaction between two unrelated parties, when in fact Huawei actually controlled the company that purchased Skycom," it said, summarizing the indictment.Trade secrets stolenMeanwhile, a separate indictment unsealed in Washington state after being returned by a grand jury on Jan. 16 accused Huawei of trying to steal trade secrets from T-Mobile USA.It cited an internal offer of bonuses to Huawei employees who succeeded in stealing confidential information from other companies, the Department of Justice said in a statement on its website."Today we are announcing that we are bringing criminal charges against telecommunications giant Huawei and its associates for nearly two dozen alleged crimes," Acting Attorney General Matthew G. Whitaker said."The charges unsealed today clearly allege that Huawei intentionally conspired to steal the intellectual property of an American company in an attempt to undermine the free and fair global marketplace," FBI Director Christopher Wray said."Huawei continually disregarded the laws of the United States in the hopes of gaining an unfair economic advantage," Wray said. "The FBI will not tolerate corrupt businesses that violate the laws that allow American companies and the United States to thrive."Some of the allegations revolve around a robot named "Tappy" developed by T-Mobile to test its new phones.Huawei engineers violated confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with T-Mobile by secretly taking photos of "Tappy," taking measurements of parts of the robot, and in one instance, stealing a piece of the robot so that the Huawei engineers in China could try to replicate it, according to the indictment.Huawei then produced a report falsely claiming that the theft was the work of rogue actors within the company, giving rise to the "obstruction of justice" charge, it said.It said email evidence showed that a "conspiracy to steal secrets from T-Mobile [that] was a company-wide effort."'Dissatisfied, opposed'In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the Chinese government was "deeply dissatisfied and resolutely opposed" to the accusations."The U.S. is using its national power to discredit and suppress specific Chinese companies in an attempt to stifle their legitimate operations," Geng told a regular news briefing on Tuesday.He said the moves were the result of "political motivation and maneuvering.""We strongly urge the U.S. to stop the unreasonable suppression of Chinese companies including Huawei, and to treat Chinese enterprises fairly and objectively."He repeated Beijing's call for Meng's immediate release.June Teufel Dreyer, political science professor at the University of Miami, said the Huawei indictments were unlikely to be the last of their kind aimed at Chinese technology companies."It's not just the U.S.: other countries including the U.K., Germany, and Australia are very concerned about the security threat from Huawei and other Chinese companies," Dreyer told RFA."Western countries are now making rules and decisions that will limit the use of Huawei and ZTE products," she said in comments translated from an interview with RFA's Mandarin Service.Canadians heldAt least 13 Canadians were detained in China after Chinese officials vowed to retaliate for the arrest of Meng, who is wanted for questioning by investigators in the U.S. over alleged bank fraud linked to the breach of sanctions against Iran.While at least eight have since been released, a court in the northeastern city of Dalian on Dec. 29 handed down the death penalty to Canadian national Robert Schellenberg, who was originally sentenced to 15 years in prison for drug smuggling last November.Former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and consultant Michael Spavor remain in detention on suspicion of "endangering national security."The indictments come after national security researchers at George Mason University published a report warning that Huawei should be regarded as a potential security threat as governments around the world begin tendering for next-generation 5G mobile network infrastructure, given a 2017 Chinese law requiring Chinese companies and citizens to comply with spying requests from the government.Huawei has repeatedly insisted that it is a private company with no ties to the state.Reported by Wen Yuqing for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Xi Wang for the Mandarin Service.

Cornyn, Baldwin, Crapo, Brown Bill Will Protect Rail and Bus Manufacturing From China ThreatTargeted News ServiceMarch 14, 2019 Thursday 7:36 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 751 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, issued the following news release:* * *- China's "Made in 2025" initiative targets dominance in rail and bus manufacturing.- Bill prevents federal transit funds from being used to purchase Chinese rail and bus assets.* * *U.S. Senators John Cornyn (R-TX) and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) today introduced the Transit Infrastructure Vehicle Security Act, which would prevent federal funds from being used by transit agencies to purchase rail cars or buses manufactured by Chinese government owned, controlled, or subsidized companies. Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee Chairman, Senator Mike Crapo (R-ID), and Ranking Member, Sherrod Brown (D-OH), are original cosponsors of the legislation."China poses a clear and present danger to our national security and has already infiltrated our rail and bus manufacturing industries," Sen. Cornyn said. "The threat to our national security through the exploitation of our transportation and infrastructure sectors is one we should take seriously. This legislation will help safeguard against this threat, and I'm thankful for the support of my colleagues.""China has made clear its intent to dismantle U.S. railcar manufacturing in its 'Made in China 2025' plan--our economic and national security demands that we address Chinese attempts to dominate industries that build our nation's critical infrastructure," said Sen. Baldwin. "That's why I'm joining my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to introduce legislation to hold China accountable because we need to do all we can to support American workers and American-made products.""This strong bipartisan bill protects federal dollars from being spent on Chinese buses and railcars, and improves cybersecurity in public transportation," said Sen. Brown. "Federal dollars should not support Chinese state-controlled enterprises that want to undermine U.S. manufacturers and overtake our supply chain that supports rail and bus manufacturing."Background:The Chinese government continues to use a range of state subsidies and predatory practices to support its market ascension in certain sectors of the United States' economy. Two of these sectors, rail manufacturing and bus manufacturing, are included as part of China's "Made in China 2025" initiative, a plan targeting global dominance in areas that the Chinese government considers most strategic to its global aims.Chinese state-owned and state-supported enterprises have used subsidized "bargain prices" well-below competitive market price to win contracts throughout the United States. A number of large, metropolitan areas have recently awarded rail rolling stock procurements to a Chinese state-owned enterprise. There are a number of threats these procurements pose including impeding economic competitiveness and overtaking the supply chains that support United States public transportation agencies. Chinese state-owned and state-supported enterprises have increased security vulnerabilities and create new risks for rolling stock procurements.Specifically, the Transit Infrastructure Vehicle Security Act would prevent federal transit funds from being used by transit agencies to procure Chinese rail assets and ensure transit agencies develop and execute a cybersecurity plan.- Limitation on Certain Rolling Stock Procurements: This legislation prevents federal transit dollars from being used to award a contract or subcontract for the procurement of passenger rail cars or transit buses to Chinese state-owned, controlled or subsidized enterprises. The bill would create a certification process for transit agencies to ensure their funds are not being used to purchase rolling stock from a covered manufacturer. A narrow exception would be made for transportation agencies with a pre-existing contract or subcontract with a covered rail rolling stock manufacturer executed prior to the date of enactment.- Cybersecurity Certification: Given the level of technology and growing complexity of rail rolling stock assets, it is important that proper cybersecurity standards are in place. This legislation would require any transit operator that operates rail transit service to develop and execute a plan for identifying and reducing cybersecurity risks. Recipients of federal transit assistance would be required to review best practices and to identify any hardware and software components of new rolling stock assets that should undergo third-party testing.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6653769 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 16, 2019End of Document

An 'atheist' empire? Trump aides rally evangelicals in China fightPolitico.comJanuary 2, 2019 Wednesday 7:22 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1517 wordsHighlight: Religious freedom is a growing theme of President Donald Trump's confrontation with Beijing, and it's resonating with Christian leaders.BodyVice President Mike Pence infuriated Beijing when he gave a speech in October warning that China had become a dangerous rival to the United States. While he focused on familiar issues such as China's trade policies and cyber espionage, Pence also denounced the country's "avowedly atheist Communist Party." Citing a crackdown on organized religion in the country, Pence noted that Chinese authorities "are tearing down crosses, burning Bibles and imprisoning believers." "For China's Christians," Pence said, "these are desperate times." Pence's remarks, which also addressed the repression of Chinese Buddhists and Muslims, illustrated how religious freedom is a growing theme of President Donald Trump's confrontation with Beijing, which some foreign policy insiders warn could develop into a new Cold War. It is a subject that resonates in the U.S. heartland, some Christian leaders say - parts of which, including rural areas, are disproportionately at risk of fallout from Trump's trade fight with the Asian giant. The issue has gained new resonance with Beijing's arrest this month of a prominent Christian pastor and more than 100 members of his congregation. The arrests have drawn close coverage from evangelical outlets such as Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN), whose website published an open letter by the jailed pastor, Wang Yi, declaring his "anger and disgust at the persecution of the church by this Communist regime." Days after the arrests, Trump's ambassador for international religious freedom, former Republican Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback, decried the crackdown and said that in the weeks since Pence's speech, religious freedom concerns "have only grown." While China's religious persecution draws less media attention than issues like soybean tariffs and cyber espionage, it is closely tracked by conservative Christian activists and outlets like CBN, where a typical headline recently reported: "Chinese Government Destroys Christian Church, Bills Pastor for Demolition." In September, Providence Magazine, which covers U.S. foreign policy from a Christian perspective, wrote that in 2018 China's religious repression has reached "a sustained intensity not seen since the Cultural Revolution." The Trump administration has repeatedly criticized China on such grounds. In a report on international religious freedom released earlier this year, the State Department noted that throughout China there were reports of "deaths in detention of religious adherents as well as reports the government physically abused, detained, arrested, tortured, sentenced to prison, or harassed adherents of both registered and unregistered religious groups for activities related to their religious beliefs and practices." Religious activists note that Pence, Brownback, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other top Trump aides are people of faith with genuine concerns about religious freedom. But even they acknowledge the subject happens to be a potent political message for religious conservatives and may help rally them behind Trump's confrontational China policy. Some religious leaders even hear an echo of history: Cold War-era denunciations of "godless" Soviet communism by past U.S. presidents, notably Ronald Reagan "In the great heartland of America, where there tend to be higher levels of people who care about faith, reminding people that a regime - whether then the Soviet Union or today's communist China - rejects God and has an official policy of atheism is helpful in getting them to understand why our government is taking certain actions in the foreign policy area," said Gary Bauer, a longtime conservative Christian leader whom Trump appointed to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom. "Evil empire" was the famous label then-President Reagan applied to the Soviet Union in 1983. Less remembered is the fact that Reagan was addressing the National Association of Evangelicals. Reagan vowed at the time that the Soviets "must be made to understand: ... We will never abandon our belief in God." Trump himself rarely addresses religious freedom or human rights, and when it comes to China he focuses mainly on Beijing's trade practices. But his administration - backed by an evangelical base that stood for Trump in 2016 and continues to support him enthusiastically - has strongly emphasized international religious freedom. Earlier this year, for instance, the State Department hosted a first-ever gathering of foreign ministers devoted to the subject. (China was not invited and was targeted in a joint statement signed by a handful of countries, including the U.S.) "This administration is putting this in the matrix of all of our policy," said Tony Perkins, another prominent Christian conservative who serves on the religious freedom commission and is close to the White House. "It's more than just the throwaway line." Pompeo, a former Republican congressman from Kansas, has also assailed Beijing for religious persecution, including at a September speech at the Values Voter Summit in Washington, an event affiliated with the Perkins-led Family Research Council. During an appearance which some critics called inappropriately political, Pompeo decried "an intense new government crackdown on Christians in China, which includes heinous actions like closing churches, burning Bibles, and ordering followers to sign papers renouncing their faith." Like Pence, Pompeo also dwelled on the plight of China's Muslim population, particularly ethnic Uighurs from the Chinese province of Xinjiang. A State Department official recently testified before lawmakers that up to 2 million Muslims are now confined to special camps in China. "Their religious beliefs are decimated," Pompeo told Values Voter Summit attendees. The Chinese government, which often casts Uighur Muslims as potential terrorists, says the camps are designed to teach vocational and life skills. But the State Department official, Scott Busby, said the goal appears to be "forcing detainees to renounce Islam and embrace the Chinese Communist Party." While evangelical groups active in Washington tend to focus primarily on the persecution of Christians in China and elsewhere, some make sure to point out that they care about religious freedom for all faith groups, including Muslims. In a past interview with POLITICO, Brownback stressed that he also wants to protect people's right to have "no religion at all."The Trump administration may unveil a set of human rights-related sanctions targeting officials in a range of countries in the coming weeks. Some China observers are hopeful the list will include Chen Quanguo, a top Communist Party official said to have orchestrated the anti-Muslim crackdown and to have had a role in repressing Tibetan Buddhists. "It's a critical moment," said Bob Fu, a U.S.-based pastor and founder of ChinaAid, a group that advocates for religious freedom in China. Brownback did not offer comment for this story, and a spokesman for Pompeo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A White House spokesperson said of Pence that "religious freedom throughout the world is a top priority for the vice president and the administration as a whole." Bauer predicted that evangelicals and other voters in the U.S. heartland will continue to support Trump even if he expands his trade war with China. The administration, cognizant of the potential pain for its supporters, has taken some steps to cushion the blow, such as offering farming subsidies.By retaliating against particular U.S. industries, such as soybean farmers, China is trying to pressure the administration. "I think China will fail in this effort and support for the Trump-Pence policies will remain strong," Bauer said. When it comes to pleasing the religious right, the Trump administration has been willing to make some dicey moves. This past summer, to the shock of the foreign policy establishment, Trump imposed economic sanctions on two Cabinet officials in Turkey - an important U.S. ally and fellow NATO member - due to the questionable imprisonment of an American pastor, Andrew Brunson. Brunson, whose cause was championed by evangelicals, was eventually freed and the sanctions lifted. How far the administration will push Beijing on religious freedom could come down to the president himself and what China is willing to do to assuage his concerns on trade. Trump, after all, has been willing to drop talk of human rights issues when it seems he's making progress on other fronts - that's what has happened in his dealings with North Korea. The Chinese in particular are highly sensitive to their global image, and, like the Soviet Union, China cannot be ignored. "If this tariff business gets really bad and the economy goes down, I wouldn't be surprised if [Trump officials] ramp up the 'evil empire' language," said a Senate Democratic aide. "It inoculates them from their base." But "if you start using the 'evil empire' language," the aide added, "it's harder to make up and kiss and be friends."Article originally published on POLITICO MagazineLoad-Date: January 3, 2019End of Document

State Dept. believes US legal residents are being held in Chinese detention campsCNN.comMarch 28, 2019 Thursday 7:09 AM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 639 wordsByline: By Michelle Kosinski and Jennifer Hansler, CNNBodyState Department sources say they know American residents -- either US citizens or people with legal status in the United States -- are being held in detention camps in Xinjiang, China.When asked if there were many, one of the sources said, "No, a few."They were unable to disclose more details due to privacy concerns, for the time being.At a State Department briefing Thursday, Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback said he had a new, unconfirmed report about a man in California whose father, a legal US resident, had not been heard from since returning to Xinjiang."He had legal status being here, traveled back to Xinjiang after being here with his son in California. And then has not been heard from since. And he's deeply concerned about whether, what his treatment is. He has a number of chronic illnesses, he's a 75-year-old man and an intellectual," Brownback said.The 2018 State Department Human Rights report estimated that China "arbitrarily detained 800,000 to possibly more than two million Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, and other Muslims in internment camps designed to erase religious and ethnic identities.""International media, human rights organizations, and former detainees reported security officials in the camps abused, tortured, and killed some detainees," the report noted."And it's not just the camps anymore. Entire villages are being encased and people limited on their movement in and out, of the villages in that region that's occurring as well. The situation continues and in some cases appears to be escalating, not de-escalating," Brownback said Thursday.Former detainees say they were forced to endure intensive brainwashing sessions, including close studies of Communist Party propaganda. The Chinese government has defended these camps as a means of fighting what they claim is a rising tide of extremism in Xinjiang.The Chinese government claims that the camps are "vocational and educational training centers for counter-terrorism and de-radicalization purposes."Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang hit back Friday, saying Beijing "is firmly opposed to the US attempt to use the Xinjiang issue to interfere in China's internal affairs.""As we have stated repeatedly, the overall situation is stable in China's Xinjiang region, which has seen a favorable trend in economic development," he said.He said he has no information regarding Americans being held in camps in Xinjiang and expressed "firm opposition" to Brownback's remarks.Brownback said he raised the issue a few weeks ago with Chinese officials at the UN, who first denied anything was happening and then said they were "vocational training camps.""To which I said, 'I get and have lists of names, hundreds of names that are sent to me, that can't find their relatives,'" he said."We are advocating strongly against these actions that the Chinese government is doing and continues to do," Brownback said.The State Department on Thursday night reiterated its travel advisory for US citizens going to China, warning specifically of "extra security measures in the Xinjiang Uigher Autonomous Region.""We are committed to providing all possible consular assistance to US citizens in need abroad," a State Department spokesman said. "However, China does not recognize dual nationality. This means that China may prevent the US Embassy from providing consular services in some cases, and US-Chinese citizens and US citizens of Chinese heritage may be subject to additional scrutiny and harassment."Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who this week met with Uyghur refugee Mihrigul Tursun and several other members of the Uyghur community, has denounced the human rights violations in China."This is one of the worst human rights countries that we've seen since the 1930s," he said in a mid-March interview.Load-Date: March 30, 2019End of Document

Trump Says He Won't Deliver State of the Union Address Until Shutdown Is Over; Microsoft's Bing Search Engine Reportedly Blocked In China; Turkish and Russian Leaders Met Wednesday to Discuss Syria; U.K.'s Exit from the E.U.; Blair on May's E.U. DealMORNINGS WITH MARIA MORNINGS WITH MARIA 8:00 AM ESTJanuary 24, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; DomesticLength: 7832 wordsByline: Maria Bartiromo, Dagen McDowell, Cheryl Casone, Jonathan NovackGuests: Lindsey Bell, Antonio Guterres, Stacey Cunningham, Jens Stoltenberg, Tony BlairBodyANNOUNCER: Live from Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic Forum. Here's Maria Bartiromo with a special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA.MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good Thursday morning, everyone. Welcome back. Thanks so much for joining us live from Switzerland this week. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, January 24th, your top stories 8:00 a.m. right on the button on the East Coast, markets are raging higher this morning. Take a look at futures indicating a gain start of this trading of 20 points on the Dow Industrials, up three points on the S&P and the NASDAQ right now up about 30 points, one half of one percent.The market is extending big gains yesterday across the board. In fact, at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial average up 171 points yesterday, big rally three quarters of one percent higher. The S&P was up a quarter of a percent at five points higher and the NASDAQ at the close yesterday up just a fraction. Global markets this morning are mostly higher. In Europe this morning, take a look at the indices after we just report you the news that the European Central Bank is leaving interest rates unchanged as expected.ECB President Mario Draghi set to hold a news conference later this hour. We will let you know what are the headlines come out of that. In Asia overnight, markets were fractionally moving as you can see here although mostly higher across the board with the exception of Japan. Earnings certainly in focus this morning, the airline stocks taking off on strong results. Take a look. Southwest Airlines up better than five percent as is American Airlines five and a quarter of a percent higher, JetBlue up three and three quarters of a percent.The State of the Union is now on hold, President Trump has delayed his address until after the government reopens, what that means for the shutdown showdown now in its 34th day of a partial government shutdown. Microsoft Bing has been blocked in China. It's the very latest move by Beijing to sensor the internet. Microsoft President Brad Smith weighed in on the news last hour with me in a Fox Business exclusive.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRAD SMITH, PRESIDENT, MICROSOFT: People in China cannot access Bing. This is not the first time it happened. It happens periodically, you know, we operate in China but pursuant to some global principles as cloud the global network initiative in terms of, you know, how we manage censorship demands in the like. There are times when there are disagreements. There are times when there are difficult negotiations with the Chinese government and we're still waiting to find out what this situation is about. (END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Microsoft shares this morning are edging higher at 106.30. Renault has replaced Carlos Ghosn, the details on the French automaker's choice as Ghosn remains in a Japanese prison now 60 plus days. All of those stories coming up this Thursday morning. And joining me in New York, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, CFRA Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell. Ladies, no surprise about the ECB given the fact that what are they going to do in a slow economy raise interest rates, Dagen?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Right, exactly. And starting today with the rate that's still negative, many people are thinking that the ECB is going to be forced to keep rates at a negative level well into 2020 if not later. It looks like a lot of the central banks were surprised by the slowing growth story. Certainly, the ECB kind of caught off guard by how slow and sluggish the economy in Europe has been.But this really speaks to central banks around the world that the world governments, individuals, and corporations cannot handle much higher interest rates than we've already seen. And they're very close and we saw this with the Federal Reserve to making a big mistake that sends one major economy if not more into a recession.BARTIROMO: That's right. Yes. Meanwhile, the earnings have been largely better than expected this morning, Lindsey.LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Yes. Today has been a good day for earnings. I'm really interested though to see what some of the industrial companies are going to see say. Yesterday, we got United Technologies. It was a good report and they're the makers of Otis Elevators and Pratt & Whitney engines and they raised guidance. They said they're not seeing a slowdown in business investment or in China, so I want to see if that continues throughout the industrial sphere.BARTIROMO: All right. We will keep following that. We'll got a whole host of earnings out today and this week. Of course, joining the conversation this morning, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is with me this morning, along with the President of the New York Stock Exchange, Stacey Cunningham, and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big hour coming up. And we kick it off right here, United Nations leaders on the ground here in Davos, Switzerland.Officials say there's a growing need for business leaders to give input in order to help solve some global important issues. Joining me right now and first on Fox interview is U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Secretary-general, it's good to have you on the program this morning.ANTONIO GUTERRES, SECRETARY-GENERAL, UNITED NATIONS: It's a pleasure to be here.BARTIROMO: Tell us what kind of issues you would like the business community to get involved in?GUTERRES: I think that the business community is vital today because governments alone cannot solve the dramatic combination of problems that we face from the economic slowdown to the problems of climate change, the problems of inequality. I truly believe more and more that we need a solid partnership between governments and the private sector, between international organizations, and the private sector, the business community in order not only to do things, but also to strategize, to discuss, to define policies, and to make sure that the policies that defined at political level can be easily implemented by businesses because one thing is true.We will never achieve these sustainable development goals. We'll never bring more equality (INAUDIBLE) we'll never have a successful globalization if the private sector does not take the leads and if the private investment is not the engine of the global growth.BARTIROMO: Of course. Six years general, tell me in your view, what is the primary role of the United Nations today?GUTERRES: Well, the primary role is always to preserve or try to preserve peace and security. I mean my most important moment the last months was to be in Stockholm to make sure that there would be an opportunity for peace in Yemen. So that is the most important role of the United Nations. Then another area in which the United Nations today as I believe completely repressible is humanitarian aid. United Nations represents more than half of the global humanitarian aid.Just to give you an idea last year, we helped 100 million people in 40 countries mobilizing $15 billion. As we speak today, the World Food Programme that supports annually 90,000 people. It has four truck -- 40 -- 40,000 trucks moving, 92 planes moving, and 20 ships moving just to bring food to people in the most remote areas of the world where famine is again with the risk of progressing. Humanitarian aid is something in which I believe the U.N. excels.Then the other areas in which the U.N. has a key role to play is to bring together countries to discuss central issues of the international community, the issues of global development and to make sure that the developments benefits all that globalization and technologically progress does not leave people behind, the questions of climate change, the questions of the forcing (INAUDIBLE) revolution technologies revolution and the fault of these to be force for goods and not an increase of risk as we see day in many aspects namely in the dark web for instance.So it's to try to bring together countries in order to take profits of the enormous potential that the existing (INAUDIBLE) for that potential to translate and benefits for the people of the world.BARTIROMO: Do you feel a need to modernize the United Nations today? What kind of changes would you like to see given the new issues that the world faces?GUTERRES: Yes. We are doing a very big reform in the secretariat of the United Nations, a reform that is basically simplifying procedures, decentralizing decisions. I have written letter to 200 leaders of the United Nations around the world given them authority to deal with budgetary issues, with the stuff issues, with procurement in order to bring decisions closer to the people that benefit from those decisions.And we established a new system of transparency and accountability to make sure that taxpayers in all countries of the world (INAUDIBLE) can see that we really produce value for money and these reform is (INAUDIBLE) crucial to make us more effective and more cost efficient.BARTIROMO: Sure. Let bring you to some of the news of the day and of course this is the crisis in Venezuela that we want to get your take in protests and clashes breaking out after opposition leader, Juan Guaido declares himself interim president challenging current leader Nicolas Maduro. The Trump administration backing Guaido's leadership plans. Maduro says he's cutting off diplomatic ties after that decision.Vice president in the U.S. Mike Pence weighed in on the situation on "TRISH REAGAN PRIMETIME" last night. Listen to what the Vice President of the United States had to say.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: But the real work lies ahead and the United States is going to continue to bring the full weight of our economic and diplomatic pressure into a freedom and democracy and fair elections are restored for the people of Venezuela.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Your reaction.GUTERRES: Well, we are extremely worried that the situation in Venezuela (INAUDIBLE) gets absolutely central to about violence. It's absolutely central to have restraint, special restraint from the point of view of the forces of police forces and other security forces. And it's absolutely central (INAUDIBLE) conditions for a dialogue to be possible in order to -- the worst thing we could have will be a civil in Venezuela. We need to avoid it at all costs and create conditions for the establishment of a normal democracy in Venezuela.BARTIROMO: This was part of your speech today in Davos, right? You talked about dialogue, do you think dialogue is possible?GUTERRES: Dialogue is in all situations in the world our role. I mean the Secretary-General of the United Nations has no power. I don't recognize governments. I don't recognize countries. The only -- the only power I follow the instructions (INAUDIBLE) the only power I have is good office and good office that only good if the parties accept those good offices to establish some dialogue. And then, fortunately, many parts of the world we see that dialogue is not possible and we see situations becoming more and more dramatic and people suffering and it's the suffering of people that of course is what is anymore.BARTIROMO: What is the most important issue facing the world today from your standpoint?GUTERRES: From my standpoint, the most dramatic situation is that we have a proliferation of conflicts, conflicts are becoming more and more interlinked and linked to a threat of global terrorism, and the response to this conflict has been fragmented. We have the Security Council largely paralyzed because the divides among the biggest powers. We have some times others -- when (INAUDIBLE) become unclear small actors get involved in the situations in different points of the world and complicate things.We absolutely need and we are trying to do it at all cost (INAUDIBLE) in diplomacy for peace and to bring those that (INAUDIBLE) on the situations of conflict to explain that these wars that we witness are wars nobody wins. There are no military solutions. The solutions must be solving the root causes of the conflict and making sure that peace prevails.BARTIROMO: Were you happy that the United States president said he wanted to withdraw the troops out of Syria?GUTERRES: What I truly believe is that the engagement of the United States in international affairs is a very important element in order for global problems to be solved. I'm a strong supporter of American engagement. I don't want to pronounce myself on this or that military decision. That's up for the U.S. to decide. But the engagement of the U.S. in world affairs is very important component for the solution of global problems.BARTIROMO: Secretary-general, it's very good to have you on the program today.GUTERRES: It's a pleasure. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for your insights Antonio Guterres joining us there. Coming up, it is day 34 of the government shutdown. The heated battle of a border funding forcing President Trump to delay the State of the Union address. We've got the very latest after this. And then Bing was blocked. Microsoft search engine taken down in China. More of my exclusive interview with Microsoft President Brad Smith. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Microsoft search engine Bing has been blocked in China. Cheryl Casone with the details in New York now. Cheryl, what a story.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: It really is, Maria. And it wasn't immediately clear why the search engine has become unavailable. Bing accounts for only about two percent of China's search engine market overall. But if this is permanent, its banishment is further going to tighten Beijing's grip on the internet there and it comes as tensions increase between the U.S. and China over trade and technology. Short time ago, Microsoft President Brad Smith spoke about this with Maria in Davos.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SMITH: People in China cannot access Bing. This is not the first time it has happened. It happens periodically, you know, we operate in China pursuant to some global principles has called the global network initiative in terms of, you know, how we manage censorship demands in the like times. There are times when there are disagreements. There are times when there are difficult negotiations with the Chinese government and we're still waiting to find out what the situation is about.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: All right. Well, Bing is not only search engine in trouble in China. Even the market leader Baidu has come under fire from the government there. There is a premarket board of Microsoft up fractionally. Well, Renault has named its replacement for former chairman and CEO Carlos Ghosn. As expected, Jean-Dominique Senard has been named Chairman of the Board. Renault also naming executive Thierry Bollore as its new CEO.Carlos Ghosn formally filled both of those jobs. He resigned last night. And, of course, he remains in a Tokyo jail. Well, President Trump has delayed his State of the Union address saying he will give the address after the shutdown is over. Here's what he tweeted late last night, I'm not looking for alternative venue for the SOTU address because there is no venue that can compete with the history, tradition, and importance of the House Chamber.I'll look forward to giving a great State of the Union address in the near future. Well, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi responded of course in a tweet saying, Mr. President, I hope by saying your future you mean you will support the House pass package to #EndTheShutdown that that Senate will vote on tomorrow. Please accept this proposal, so we can reopen government, repay our federal workers, and then negotiate our differences. Vice President Pence was on "TRISH REGAN PRIMETIME". He strongly criticized the Dems.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PENCE: I have to tell you for Speaker Pelosi to reject the president's proposal before he gave his speech should tell the American people everything they need to know about that the posture that Democrats have taken in Washington, D.C. The American people deserve better, 800,000 federal employees deserve better. We need to secure our border.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Well, according to a new Fox poll, approval of President Trump's job performance stands at 43 percent, approval of congress much lower 18 percent, and 56 percent for the president should deliver the State of the Union speech as usual, 33 percent of voters think he should skip it. All right. Real quick to some earnings news, folks, American Airlines posting an adjusted profit $1.04 per share. That is a beat revenue coming in 10.9 billion, a slight miss there.Shares of the company are trading right now substantially higher in the premarket up almost six percent, Maria. We continue to get all the earnings coming in in here New York. But for now, back to you in Davos.BARTIROMO: All right. Cheryl, thanks so much. We are watching for a big slate of IPOs in 2019. The New York Stock Exchange President Stacey Cunningham will join me next live with her outlook on the public markets in 2019, volatility and regulation. Then praising the president, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defending the administration's stance on NATO. I will be joined by NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg here live. Don't miss it. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are coming to you live this week from the World Economic Forum here in Davos, Switzerland. Volatility, a key theme for the markets in 2019 and certainly at the end of last year. A wild end to last year. Well, the wild moves could be hard for investors to stomach. It means big business. My next guest joining me right now is the President of the New York Stock Exchange, Stacey Cunningham. Stacey, it's great to see you.STACEY CUNNINGHAM, PRESIDENT, NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE: Hi, Maria. It's great to see you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Davos is always an interesting experience. So many different voices in the mix and a lot of conversation centering about the -- around that volatility we saw last year. What was the impact to your business?CUNNINGHAM: Well I mean, you know, like you mentioned that it's not all downside obviously when the markets are more volatile is what more trading activity and that's part -- that's part of what we do too. But we certainly would like to see markets go up and very often when it's volatile markets are going down even though the volumes pick up. And the other downside is that companies that are looking to go public typically delay their plans when volatility picks up.I do think we're in a somewhat unique time period because it's been a 10- year bull market. Some of those companies that may have said, well, hey, let's wait and see are actually now have more of a sense of urgency in as they're preparing to go public should we get the government reopened and let them -- let them pick their path.BARTIROMO: I think that's a really good point because they could sit on it and say, OK, you know what, we were planning on the first quarter maybe (INAUDIBLE) just second or third quarter or they might say as soon as the government opens and the SEC is ready, we want to get our deal out as soon as possible.CUNNINGHAM: Yes. I mean I think there's a little bit of uncertainty as to what the economic outlook is going to be long-term. So they want to be ready. I mean that's certainly the message that I hear when I talked to CEOs considering bringing their companies public. They want to know that they've done all the work that they need to do. Now, that the shutdown impact set a little bit and the volatility impacts it a little bit.But, you know, some of the companies that are somewhat uniquely positioned are -- if a company wanted to choose the path that Spotify took and go with a direct listing instead of an IPO, they're actually not raising capital in that -- in that paths to the public markets. So it's actually less relevant to them if there's more volatility in the market.BARTIROMO: Yes. So you've got a big slate on the horizon? I mean we're talking about Uber. We're talking about Lyft, Pinterest, Slack, maybe Palantir, are you expecting some of those companies to land at the NYSE?CUNNINGHAM: Yes. Well, I certainly -- I certainly would expect that and, you know, there are 160 companies that are on file with the SEC to IPO in 2019 and I --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: 160 is a big number.CUNNINGHAM: Yes. It's a big number. I think there is a good pipeline and certainly last year was a really great time to go public. It's a little bit more volatile now but there are still great market conditions and importantly companies with a strong business and strong financials can go public really in any market conditions. And so that's what we're seeing. A lot of the companies that are waiting to go public or that have waited to go public already so big. They can -- they can stomach a little bit of volatility.BARTIROMO: What are you seeing out of China because China was such an important piece of business for the New York Stock Exchange? Chinese companies coming public in New York for a while, but now with this spat between the U.S. and China, has that impacted listings?CUNNINGHAM: We have not seen an impact listings and if you look last year about a third of our IPO proceeds came from companies outside of the U.S. and China led the charge on that. And we haven't yet seen companies think about not coming to the U.S. yet. I mean we welcomed (INAUDIBLE) music entertainment in December. And, you know, they had pushed their timeline because of the volatility in the market. They're originally slated to come out in October and they waited until December, but they're performing just fine.So I don't think we've seen an impact. It's hard to say if things don't get resolved relatively soon if that will change.BARTIROMO: Yes. Tell me about Back, a transforming cryptocurrency, new exchange, long awaited platform enabling consumers to buy, sell, spend, and store digital assets. Great idea. It's seeking to become the first of its kind on Wall Street owned by the New York Stock Exchange, right?CUNNINGHAM: Yes. Intercontinental Exchange launched back in -- our parent company in --(CROSSTALK)CUNNINGHAM: Yes. Owned by ICE in conjunction with Starbucks, Microsoft, BCG, and we've put together a platform that we think, you know, will do all those things you just said buy, sell, store, spend digital assets. And there's a unique demand for consumers to be able to actually use Bitcoin. So it starts -- it starts with a Bitcoin daily future that we've, you know, we're dependent on CFTC approval. So we're waiting for the government to reopen before launches is waiting for that. But we're excited about the prospects there.BARTIROMO: And Kelly Loeffler, the CEO, another power woman in its 226 years of the New York Stock Exchange you made history by becoming the first female president of the New York Stock Exchange, how is that going from on the floor, a colleague of some of the traders and brokers there, a woman in the leadership position in this male dominated business?CUNNINGHAM: Well, you know, the New York Stock Exchange is such a storied institution and when we look at our mission it's really been the same for so long. We're here to help money, help companies raise money so they can go out and change the world and create opportunities for investors along the way. So being able to be part of that every day and meet with companies who are literally changing the world every day is that it -- you really couldn't ask for a better job.BARTIROMO: Yes. Congratulations, Stacey.CUNNINGHAM: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Great to have you on the program.CUNNINGHAM: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much.CUNNINGHAM: It's always great to be here.BARTIROMO: Good to see you. Stacey Cunningham, President of the NYSE. Coming up, reaffirming American support, House lawmakers aiming to prevent Trump from withdrawing from NATO and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was calling the move silly. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is here weighing in next. And then Britain bracing for no deal. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair will join me with his forecast for an agreement on Brexit. Stay with us right here.JONATHAN NOVACK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back to another Tennis Channel Court Report for FOX Business. I'm Jonathan Novack.

It is Thursday, January 24th, thanks so much for joining us, everybody. Your top stories right now 8:32 a.m. on the East Coast. Breaking news, weekly jobless claims just hitting the tape, 199,000 versus an estimate of 220,000, that's better-than-expected. Markets looking at gains this morning. Take a look. We're off the highs of the morning, nonetheless expecting a gain of about 20 points after the start of trading. Fractional gain upwards, S&P is also up a fraction, as is the NASDAQ up one-half of one percent, 31 points higher on NASDAQ. Extending a big rally yesterday.In Europe this morning, European Indices mostly higher, take a look at where we stand in Europe after we know that the ECB announced this morning that it is leaving interest rates unchanged. The FT-100 is down 11, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up 35, three-quarters of a percent, and the DAX Index in Germany up 26, one quarter of one percent. Asian markets closed mostly higher overnight, with the exception of Japan, which squeaked out a fractional loss, the other majors up fractionally.Earnings certainly the focus of markets this morning. McCormick getting hit this morning after reporting disappointing earnings. The company expects 2019 profits to be below expectations. As you can see, McKesson shares are down a fraction. American Airlines shares higher this morning after the company beat estimates. That stock is up six percent. All the airlines are doing well on better-than-expected earnings. We're also hearing from heavy hitters' Intel in Starbucks later this morning. We will have those numbers for as soon as they're out.Meanwhile, back on the U.S., it is shutdown showdown day 34. President Trump delaying his State of the Union Address until the shutdown is over. A new FOX News poll shows that 56 percent of voters think the President should deliver the address as usual. Perhaps in the senate, another venue. We are watching markets this morning, earnings season in full swing. Lindsey Bell is in New York, tracking everything. And Lindsey, your take on what we've heard this morning.BELL: It's been a good morning for earnings for sure. That American Airlines number was very impressive. They cut guidance going into the earnings season just a week or so ago. They beat estimates today, and they raised guidance for next year. They're looking for 40 percent earnings growth in 2019. So this slowdown in the economy we're seeing, the airlines are not.BARTIROMO: We -- the airlines -- we saw some good numbers obviously as you just said, but the shutdown would impact things at some point, right? What do you -- what do you make of the guidance?BELL: Yes. I was surprised to see the guidance that was so robust. American Airlines expects to be taking some share from their competitors with regards to the shutdown. We've heard some of these CEO's talk about the dollar impact that they will have in the coming quarter, but you're seeing the planes get out there, the FAA, even though it's been shut down and the regulatory area there hasn't been as impacted as we thought it would be, so, you know, I think once the government gets reopened, it'll be positive for the airlines.BARTIROMO: Yes. And let me just point out that -- I mentioned McCormick earlier. We had McKesson up there, that was the wrong one, but McCormick is down 11 percent on that profit guidance that we saw. Dagen, I'm not sure what you think about this shutdown, but, you know, and the -- and the State of the Union, but there's a lot of people. Now we see it's a majority that want the President to go ahead with the State of the Union Address. We know that Rand Paul and some others have said, "Just do it in the Senate Chamber."MCDOWELL: That would be a possibility, but I think that this is the President taking the high road, and shining a spotlight on Nancy Pelosi's intransigent and unwillingness to even come to the table and have a debate or even negotiate what he's put on the table for the Dreamers, that three- year protection in addition to the $5.7 billion in barrier and border security funding. We're going have two votes today in the Senate, one on Democrats' plan to reopen the government until February the 8th, and then the President's plan that the Republicans will put forward.People are hoping that this -- it'll be interesting to see if the Democrats get any Republicans in their vote if the Republicans can pull any Democrats over to their side, and if somehow this breaks an impasse and you have cooler heads in the Senate sitting down to really talk about opening the government, and doing what is right in terms of security, and doing what is right for the American people.BARTIROMO: All right. We're going to take a short break right Here. When we come back, I agree with you, Dagen, I think that's, as usual, spot on analysis in terms of this shutdown. Markets have turned lower. Futures now indicating a decline at the start of trading of about 30 points, that's fractional move, S&P 500 down 1/3-4 point. The NASDAQ is up but off of the highs. Let's take a short break, and when we come back, we will speak to the Secretary General of NATO back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Reaffirming American support, Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, calling a move by House lawmakers silly, referring to a bill that they passed preventing President Trump from pulling the United States out of NATO. Secretary Pompeo defending the administration's position last night on FOX News with Martha MacCallum. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: This administration has done more good for NATO than the previous several administrations combined. The increased resources available for Secretary General Stoltenberg and for NATO partners around the world, are significantly greater, approaching now $100 billion greater than they would have been absent the pressure President Trump put on.(END VIDEO CLIP)JENS STOLTENBERG, SECRETARY GENERAL, NATO: Maria.BARTIROMO: I'll ask your reaction.STOLTENBERG: Uh-hmm.BARTIROMO: And joining us right now is NATO General Secretary, Jens Stoltenberg. Good to see you, Secretary General. Thank you so for being here.STOLTENBERG: Thank you so much for having me.BARTIROMO: Your reaction to Mike Pompeo.STOLTENBERG: Well, he is right, that over the last four years of -- from 2016 to 2020, at the end of next year, European allies and Canada will add hundred billion more for defense. So the very clear message from President Trump is having an impact. I welcome that, because we need fair burden sharing in NATO.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.STOLTENBERG: And, therefore, those allies who are spending too little have to increase their defense spending and that's exactly what I was taught to do. They still have a long way to go, but it is encouraging to see that they are now moving in the right direction, and at the Summit, the NATO Summit in July, when Trump was in Brussels, meeting all the other heads of certain governments, we made decisions to provide plans for how to increase, and now we see the results. Hundred billion more by the end of next year.BARTIROMO: Are the -- are the countries or the members now up to the two percent target or they've got way long to go to get to the two percent?STOLTENBERG: It varies. Some allies have reached the two percent target. We have more allies now reaching that guideline than we had about many, many years. That's -- some allies still have a way to go. We have a planning horizon to 2024, and the majority of NATO allies have pledged to be there at two percent, but I think what really matters is the money, it's the money on table and what we see now is that, you know, hundred billion more over four years, from 2016 to 2020, that helps. If you expand that time period to 2024, which is our planning period, then it's $350 billion U.S. So, this helps, this is significant, and, of course, it is also necessary because we have had not -- we need fair burden share in the alliance.BARTIROMO: Right.STOLTENBERG: This alliance is about protecting it, and so that is good for Europe, but it's also good for United States for the United States have 28 friends and allies which stand together with them. It's something China doesn't have, Russia doesn't have it, and the only time we invoked Article V was after the 9/11 attack on the United States and hundreds of thousands of European Soldiers, Canadian Soldiers, have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the U.S. Soldiers in Afghanistan.BARTIROMO: The -- President Trump has also said that he suggested maybe they should go to four percent. Would you like to see the members go even higher than two percent, perhaps closer to four percent of their GDP on defense funding?STOLTENBERG: I focus now on the goal of reaching the guidelines we have agreed, and I focus now on making sure that that happens, and the good news is that they have really started to step up. We have turned corner and hundred billion over four years makes a difference and $350 million by -- billion U.S. by 2024, is also a big difference.BARTIROMO: Well, the President in the United States has also criticized Germany for paying Russia. In that tweet, when he was complaining about the two percent target, he said, "What good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy, why are there only five out of 29 countries that have met their commitment? The U.S. is paying for Europe's protection, then losses billions on trade. First your reaction to Europe paying Russia because of that Russian energy. I mean does that not make Europe so much more vulnerable to Russian aggression?STOLTENBERG: We are -- NATO is an alliance of 29 allies from both sides of the -- of the Atlantic with different political parties and government, different history, different culture, and some are neighbors of Russia, some are not. So, there are differences, there are disagreements, also for instance on energy issues, but the strength of NATO is that despite those differences, for instance on this pipeline from Russia, we have always been able to unite the NATO around our core task and that is what we protect and defend each other, one for all, and all for one.Again, this is good for Europe, but it's also good for United States. I know that United States, you are now really focused on the size of China, and China is big --BARTIROMO: Yes.STOLTENBERG: -- economically, technologically, but also increasing the -- when it comes to military capacities, but if you add Europe then to United States, NATO, then we are close to one billion people, we are 50 percent of the world's economic might --BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.STOLTENBERG: -- and 50 percent of the world's military might. So, compared -- if you compared China with the whole of NATO, then actually we are big. So NATO is good also for United States.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean you make a very good point, but I mean the issue on Germany and Russia, you're going to be meeting with the Russians. Tomorrow?STOLTENBERG: Yes.BARTIROMO: OK. So should Germany rethink the dependence on Russia and look for other sources of energy from a NATO ally like the United States?STOLTENBERG: We welcome that NATO allies try to diversify their sources of energy supplies. Tomorrow, we will meet Russia to discuss another very important issue.BARTIROMO: Let's hear it.STOLTENBERG: And that is the INF Treaty and this is treaty which banned the whole category weapons, intermediate range weapons. Russia and this treaty has been in place since 1987. Russia has now started to violate this treaty to deploy new capable missiles, mobile missiles, hard to detect, very short warning time. Meaning that they reduced the threshold for any potential use of nuclear weapons. So, this is very serious, it's breaking down one of the most important arms control agreements we have, and there, we will -- we will meet Russia tomorrow, and call on them once again to come back into compliance with this treaty, because it's not good for none of us that we have a new arms race and especially not when it comes nuclear-capable missiles.BARTIROMO: And if they don't? I mean where is the accountability?STOLTENBERG: First of all, we --BARTIROMO: Who will hold Russia accountable?STOLTENBERG: The treaty has specific mechanisms for verification, for inspection. The problem is that Russia is not living up to those compliances or those recommendations. So therefore, we -- the United States has stated that if Russia does not come back into compliance, the United States will, in the beginning of February, start the process of withdrawing from the treaty. We have all-star military commanders to look into the consequences and how we should respond. This is a very serious issue, so we will respond in a measured way and in a -- in a defensive way, but we have to make sure that NATO maintains credible deterrence and defense also in the world without the INF Treaty where Russia is deploying these new missiles.BARTIROMO: A moment ago, you said that you were happy with the Trump administration pushing back in terms of the commitment to the two percent target in terms of the pressure that the President has been voicing. Do you believe that all members are still committed to Article V, this commitment to come to a member's aid should they need it?STOLTENBERG: Yes. And that's because this --BARTIROMO: If they're attacked?STOLTENBERG: Yes, because (INAUDIBLE) so well for 70 years. No NATO ally has been attacked with military means since the alliance was established. And the whole idea that we stand together in attack with one ally, triggered a response from the whole alliance (INAUDIBLE) all allies, one for all, all for one. The main purpose of that is to prevent the war because if all or as long as all adversaries know that all allies will respond if one ally is attacked --BARTIROMO: Yes.STOLTENBERG: -- than the one that's attacking us.BARTIROMO: What --STOLTENBERG: That the main purpose to prevent conflict, to prevent attack.BARTIROMO: Describe the situation right now in Syria, Turkish President Erdogan meeting with Vladimir Putin yesterday, talking about security in Northern Syria. Your reaction to this development now given turkey's importance to NATO.STOLTENBERG: Turkey is an important ally in at least in the fight against terrorism. We have to remember that not many years ago, back in 2014-'15, ISIS Daesh controlled a big territory in Syria and Iraq, threatening Baghdad, a territory as big as United Kingdom, eight million people, and they really affect. Then because of the efforts of the Global Coalition led by the United States, NATO allies, NATO being part of that coalition since 2016, we have been able to take that territory away from ISIS. They hardly control any territory anymore.And this enormous progress in the fight against terrorism has only been possible because of Turk bordering Iraq, and bordering Syria playing such a key role, provide the infrastructure, bases, airfields, which we have used in the fight against ISIS.BARTIROMO: Are you that the happy President of the U.S. wants to pull troops out of Syria.STOLTENBERG: I'm happy that U.S. has played such a key role in defeating - - a leading role in defeating ISIS in so many places in Iraq and Syria. We need to continue to fight ISIS, and we need to make sure that Turkey and U.S. talked together to coordinate their efforts (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: How worried are you about China and its new prominence, whether it be China's moves, not just build islands on the South China Sea, but also put military bases there across the world as far as -- as far as Djibouti.STOLTENBERG: As we see, China is a rising power, economically, militarily, and also with advance technologies. And for me, this is yet another example -- a reason for maintaining NATO --BARTIROMO: Yes.STOLTENBERG: -- as a strong alliance because, again, compared to U.S., or China, U.S., well then China --BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are coming to you live from the World Economic Forum here in Davos, Switzerland. The global economy, a main focus here of course. We are also watching the U.K.'s exit from the European Union. Where does that stand? The British Parliament is now getting closer to a plan that could delay the exit. Joining me right now is Former British Prime Minister, Tony Blair. Mr. Prime Minister, it's good to see you again.TONY BLAIR, FORMER BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. So what we know so far, how do you think this plays out?BLAIR: I think it's really difficult to tell. I think the options are, we fall out without any deal at all, which I think is very unlikely. Alternatively, we go back and agree to the Prime Minister's plan. I think that's unlikely too. Or we go to a fresh referendum, which at the moment does not have the majority, but maybe where we end up.BARTIROMO: If she, Theresa May, needs to have a plan in terms of trade and not have a hard exit, how can she do that when all of these countries are represented by the E.U.?BLAIR: Because the real difficulty that she has is the problem with the deal that she's presenting to the British Parliament is that it doesn't resolve the central question of Britain's future relationship, trading relationship with E.U.BARTIROMO: Right.BLAIR: And basically we've got a choice, we can stay close to Europe to minimize the economic damage and falling out of the trading system we've been in for over four decades, but if we do that and we are obliged to stay bound by Europe's rules, then it's a kind of pointless Brexit. You know, why have you done it? Because whole purpose of Brexit, of you support it, is to get rid of these rules.On the other hand, if we decide right we're going to break free of this trading system and we're going to set our own rules, then you've got a painful period of economic adjustment. So, this is the pointless versus painful dilemma the government's in. And the plan that the Prime Minister presented the parliament really doesn't resolve that question, and that's the central problem with it. So I think one possibility by the way is the parliament then decides it wants one or other of those two things, a close relationship or a distant relationship.But right now, I don't think there's a majority for anything in parliament and so that's why I think when you take into account 30 months of negotiation, all of this mess, parliament can't agree, the Prime Minister's obviously in huge difficulty, frankly the Cabinet don't agree, no circumstances, I think the logical thing is you got to say to the people who made the original decision the referendum, OK, given all this, do you want to -- do you want to carry on or do you want to remain in the E.U.?BARTIROMO: Why hasn't she been able to articulate more clarity? I mean this certainty -- you've got Dyson announcing its relocating out of the U.K. to Singapore. Companies like Sony, Panasonic, saying they're moving out of the U.K., you know, businesses cannot operate if they don't have certainty. Why has she been so iffy about all of this?BLAIR: Because I think the problem is that her party is fundamentally in disagreement and that -- and that's the difficulty because one part of her party essentially really wants to stay in the European Union, and the other part really want to break free. And some people say, "Well let's -- maybe we do a compromise where, as I say, we stay close to Europe's rules," but then the bit of the conservative party doesn't favor breaks, it doesn't want that either.So the central problem the Prime Minister's got is that this fundamental division in her party, and indeed in the country to be fair, and it's very hard to resolve it.BARTIROMO: Where are the most important trade situations that she needs to lock up, putting the E.U. aside, I mean are there other trade negotiations that she should be thinking about in terms of ensuring that she has a plan with them?BLAIR: Yes, you -- I mean you can -- you can certainly explore other trading options, but the problem is that virtually, 60 percent of our trade is governed by the E.U. Trading System, and by the way, we haven't mentioned this but there's a whole dimension of problem which is around border in Ireland between Northern Ireland, that's part of the U.K. --BARTIROMO: That's right.BLAIR: And the Republic of Ireland is obviously an independent country within the EU. Now the U.K. and the republic of Ireland have always been either out of Europe together and then they joined on the same day together in May -- I think it was May 1973. So, this is also a problem because you've got to resolve that somehow because you don't want to close the border in -- along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Otherwise, you're going to cause real problems on the Island of Ireland and to the peace process that we spent such a long time negotiating.So, look, the -- it's -- the truthful answer is there is no easy answer to any of this, and, you know, in the end, we are in a big mess. I mean I think I want to emphasize to an American audience in particular, whatever happens, we will come out of this at a certain point. It's going to be very messy whatever we do. But, you know, Britain will remain a strong --BARTIROMO: Yes.BLAIR: -- capable country with a strong economy and we'll remain a good partner.BARTIROMO: Yes. Very quickly on China, are you worried about some of the issues around China, from espionage to the theft of I.P., to the force transfer of technology and the trade issues?BLAIR: Yes.Load-Date: January 24, 2019End of Document

GRITTY TRADE NEGOTIATIONSStates News ServiceMarch 3, 2019 SundayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 990 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Campaign for Americas Future:It took grit to get this far. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer explained that to Congress last week.So, he said, no one in the administration is backing down now.They've managed to confront Beijing, a trade renegade, and do it with a powerful tool that previous negotiators lacked tariffs. They launched the penalties last spring with charges on all imported steel and aluminum, then increased the pain with levies specifically on $50 billion in Chinese imports in July, followed by duties on $200 billion in Chinese imports in September.China retaliated, particularly with tariffs on agricultural goods. Some American businesses, farmers and workers suffered. And they complained. But the tariffs brought China to the table to discuss its violations abuses that have damaged American industries and destroyed millions of American jobs for nearly two decades.Lighthizer told Congress last week he doesn't have a deal yet, but he's made progress. None of it would be possible, he said, without the leverage of the tariffs and the grit of the administration to stick with them through tough times.In the Congressional hearing, U.S. Rep. John R. Lewis, a Democrat representing Georgia, described devastation caused by China's trade law defiance."There is no way to compete in a race to the bottom," Lewis said, "I grew up in Alabama, in rural Alabama. I watched American jobs disappear throughout my life and career. In my home state, many manufacturing workers continue to struggle to find good livable-wage jobs. Many of those businesses moved overseas in search of cheap labor and lower environmental protections."Members of the union I lead, the United Steelworkers (USW), have experienced this pain. Beijing and local Chinese governments illegally subsidize industries, so that when they export products, they're artificially cheap, which depresses prices worldwide. That bankrupts U.S., Canadian and European manufacturers that operate on free market principles.This is particularly true in steel and aluminum, where China's government subsidies ramped up production quickly since the turn of the century. China, which produced little aluminum in 2001, became the world's largest producer by 2011, and then increased that output by 50 percent as of 2015.The excess metal that China dumped on the international market at bargain-basement prices a decline of 30 percent between 2011 and 2015 shuttered 18 of 23 U.S. smelters.Those were good, family-supporting USW jobs, in an industry vital to national security. Now they're gone forever.In addition to subsidies, Beijing forces U.S. companies that want to operate there to transfer intellectual property, while at the same time engaging in cyber theft of corporate trade secrets. The U.S. attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania has charged five Chinese military officers with economic espionage for hacking into U.S. aluminum and steel company computers."China plays by its own rules," Rep. Lewis said. "We need a level playing field, and we do not have it."That is what Lighthizer is trying to get. He promised he would not accept the easy "soybean solution" but would instead continue pressing for the more elusive structural change.The administration could just swallow a promise from China to buy a bunch more U.S. agricultural products, like soybeans. That would solve two problems. One is that China retaliated by placing high tariffs on U.S. agricultural goods, so if China bought more soybeans, farmers would get relief. The other is that if China bought more soybeans, the trade deficit might decline.The U.S. trade deficit with China has ballooned since Beijing gained entrance to the World Trade Organization in 2001. Despite all the tariffs last year, the deficit in goods rose 10 percent to $79.5 billion, as U.S. exports to China fell 0.3 percent and imports from China rose 3.2 percent.Previous U.S. trade negotiators have been lulled by promises from China, only to watch them go unfulfilled. Lighthizer refuses to fall for that ploy again. And more soybeans does not resolve the serious underlying structural trade problems like deliberate commodity overproduction, technology theft and currency manipulation."Technology will determine who rules the future," Lighthizer told Congress last week. "We are negotiating provisions that will, if enforced, restate and make more specific commitments against cyber theft, physical theft and using investments to get technology."At this point, he said, there are 27 or 28 pages regarding intellectual property protection. And, he said, negotiators have spent a great deal of time creating enforceable standards to prevent currency manipulation, which China uses to lower the prices of its exports and increase those of imports.Several lawmakers told Lighthizer that their constituents, particularly farmers, are suffering because of China's retaliatory tariffs. U.S. Rep. Ron Kind of Wisconsin said family farms there are being hammered and, as a result, filing a record number of bankruptcies. U.S. Rep. Jodey Arrington of Texas said these are desperate times for farmers and ranchers in his district, with agricultural income declining at the steepest rate since the Great Depression and suicides skyrocketing.Lighthizer made it clear he understood the urgency of reaching a settlement so that farmers get tariff relief. But, he said, after talking to business groups, agricultural representatives, labor unions and members of Congress, he felt obligated to produce an agreement that was specific, measureable and enforceable on all levels of Chinese government.In addition, he said, it must be a deal that enables the United States to unilaterally counteract violations that China refuses to resolve. Otherwise, all the pain suffered by American farmers and ranchers and the tenaciousness of the administration will be for nothing.Load-Date: March 4, 2019End of Document

How China will help fuel the revolution in autonomous vehiclesMcKinsey & CompanyJanuary 25, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 McKinsey & Company, Inc All Rights ReservedLength: 3661 wordsByline: McKinsey & CompanyHighlight: If the driverless-car phenomenon takes off in China, the payoff could be in the trillions of dollars.Body Link to Image Self-driving cars could steer China's automotive industry into the passing lane. From driverless taxis to automated cargo trucks, autonomous vehicles (AVs) will change the nature of on-road driving and, in the process, revolutionize the automotive and mobility industries. Within this mix of opportunity and uncertainty, we believe AV players (from components vendors to mobility service providers) could earn trillions in revenues in China.Fundamentally transforming mobilityMcKinsey research suggests autonomous vehicles could, at some point, take over most of the automotive market in China. For instance, industry respondents to our survey indicate passenger vehicles used for mobility services such as "robo-taxis" will see a peak adoption rate of 62 percent, followed by private premium vehicles (51 percent) and private mass-market cars (38 percent). Mobility services will lead due to the autonomous vehicle's expected increased utilization (close to 24/7 operation) and lower labor costs (no drivers). The same rationale puts city buses at 69 percent adoption and commercial vehicles (CVs) at 67 percent.Autonomous vehicles will likely shift a substantial share of the mobility market value away from products (that is, buying vehicles) and toward services (that is, paying for transportation per mile). This "mobility-as-a-service" (MaaS) transformation suggests dramatic changes ahead for vehicle sales volumes, business models, and the capabilities companies will need to thrive in this new environment. In China, we believe fully autonomous vehicles (SAE Level 4 and above) will see mass deployment in nine or ten years.These shifts will change the rules of the game across the entire mobility space, as software and data become fundamental differentiators when building and operating cars. As such, the mobility sector will become ground zero for            a convergence of industries that include automotive, transportation, software, hardware, and data services.Today's automakers focus on selling new cars, transportation companies on providing services, and technology players on supplying hardware and software to automakers. In the future, new business models might emerge. Technology players could buy vehicles from automakers to provide services direct to consumers. Alternatively, automakers might vertically integrate in services and software development (as leading players are already doing today). Players in these sectors must reconcile their differences in product life cycles (for example, three to four years for automotive, weeks to months for software) and business models (for instance, products versus services) to compete and cooperate effectively with each other.Clearly, many companies already have active autonomous vehicle strategies, including technology players such as Baidu, Tencent, and Waymo and automakers such as GM, SAIC Motor, and Tesla. However, given the industry's dynamic, fast-moving nature, players need to refresh their strategies constantly.Understanding how China fits inChina has the potential to become the world's largest market for autonomous vehicles. In our base forecast, such vehicles could account for as much as 66 percent of the passenger-kilometers traveled in 2040 (Exhibit 1), generating market revenue of $1.1 trillion from mobility services and $0.9 trillion from sales of autonomous vehicles by that year. In unit terms, that means autonomous vehicles will make up just over 40 percent of new vehicle sales in 2040, and 12 percent of the vehicle installed base.Exhibit Link to Image Autonomous vehicles could solve major infrastructure problemsIn 2009, China passed the United States to become the world's largest and most important automotive market, going on to consume nearly 30 million light vehicles in 2018, almost 70 percent more than the United States. This continued explosive growth is overtaxing the country's automotive-related infrastructure, driving increased traffic congestion and pollution. Beijingers spend an average of 1.3 hours every day commuting-more than three times as much as the average US commuter. Autonomous vehicles will offer a potential solution to some of these infrastructure challenges. In the realm of shared mobility, they could reduce the number of vehicles on the road and free former drivers to work or relax en route. If powered by green electricity or hydrogen, they could also help reduce local vehicle emissions.However, a complex environment could slow initial uptake of AVsIn the short term, given China's complex traffic environment, autonomous vehicles must adapt to road conditions and aggressive driving behaviors, which could slow adoption. However, a review of traffic severity worldwide reveals China's problem as one of degree, not kind. Western cities from downtown New York to Rome have similarly dense populations and levels of mixed traffic.Consequently, the technology solution in China for autonomous driving will not differ much from those in other nations. Required computing platforms will likely conform because existing platforms feature enough "buffer" capacity to handle the more complex computing tasks required to analyze objects on Chinese roads. Sensor configurations would probably not change from region to region because current setups can cover all critical directions across very different driving use cases.What is different in China involves the country's highly complicated signage, with traffic lights and road signs not yet fully standardized. Likewise, right-of-way issues resulting from the failure of Chinese drivers to follow road rules strictly add a major element of uncertainty to programing and "training" requirements for autonomous vehicles. Consequently, the need to optimize AV decision algorithms for Chinese roads could take more effort and training, which could add roughly two to three years to the adoption timeline compared with the United States. As such, the first applications of autonomous vehicles in constrained environments might begin in the next five years, but mass adoption will likely occur only after 2027, as it will require the technology to address the majority of conditions of urban and suburban driving (Exhibit 2).Exhibit Link to Image While the core algorithm for the operation of autonomous vehicles is largely the same on a global basis, operating in China will require additional data and testing. For example, developers need to collect and input local traffic data to resolve the issue of unique and ununified road signage. They must also optimize motion planning through road testing so the algorithm can learn to deal with issues caused by the relentless driving styles of some Chinese motorists.Still, longer-term prospects appear promisingIn the long term, China will likely emerge as the world's largest market for autonomous vehicles. In fact, the Chinese automotive market is already adopting MaaS at a rapid rate. For example, cars sold to provide mobility services today represent about 10 percent of China's total cars sales, and the country's mobility-services market has grown at double-digit rates over the past several years (Exhibit 3). This familiarization should translate into strong demand for mobility via autonomous vehicles in the long term.Exhibit Link to Image Reaching an adoption inflection pointWe developed a proprietary sizing model to forecast China's market for autonomous vehicles. The model takes a use-case approach, which analyzes the developments required for a specific category of autonomous vehicle, such as robo-taxis or automated trucks, to succeed in the marketplace. We surveyed more than 40 industry experts across the AV ecosystem and received feedback and advice from an external advisory board that included AV experts and executives from automakers, Tier-1 suppliers, technology companies, and mobility service providers. We learned the experts believe technology, rather than regulation, will likely hold back the adoption of autonomous vehicles. We chose two commercialization speeds: fast adoption and slow breakthroughs. Based on that analysis, we believe 2025-30 will represent an inflection point for adoption of autonomous vehicles, with the broad timespan dependent on the usage model and city-level driver economics.Exhibit 4 shows the cost crossover analysis for a fully battery-electric vehicle used for mobility services as a robo-taxi. The major cost drivers include the vehicle's depreciation, the driver's cost, maintenance, insurance, and electricity (fuel). They do not include operational or management fees for running a mobility service fleet. The replacement of human drivers in autonomous vehicles will occur gradually due to safety and regulation considerations.Exhibit Link to Image The cost of the total AV system (including sensors, computing platform, and software) should decrease rapidly after the technology matures beyond 2023, to approximately $8,000 in 2025. Once autonomous vehicles reach the crossover point, adoption will accelerate.This inflection point is when, based on the functional robustness and cost curves of AV technologies, self-driven transport will reach economic parity with human-driven transport. In other words, the total cost per kilometer of an autonomous vehicle will roughly match that of a traditional car with driver. After this inflection point, demand for autonomous vehicles should rise steadily, depending on how the market develops. As this occurs, the potential for new players to seize control of the automotive value chain grows.Industry profit pools to flow toward services and softwareThe advent of autonomous vehicles will expand the mobility profit pool in the Chinese autonomous vehicle industry by at least $60 billion compared with today's value. Car sales will remain a large share of the profit pool in the overall value chain, at $50 billion to $60 billion. However, mobility services profits will grow to become 25 to 30 percent of the total profit pool (including vehicles, components, mobility services, and fleet management) and could exceed those of car sales, especially if the MaaS market were less competitive (for example, if government cooperated with mobility players). On the other hand, AV technology and system integration will produce $15 billion to $20 billion in profits, representing 50 to 60 percent of the total auto-components profit pool.Profit pools will depend on the competitive environment. In one scenario, robo-taxis will be operating via local public/private joint ventures. In this case, MaaS could make up $50 billion to $55 billion-over a quarter of the $195 billion profit pool in China. In another scenario, if robo-taxis were operating in a much more competitive free-market environment, the mobility services segment would shrink significantly to $15 billion to $20 billion. Whichever case prevails, the larger point is that autonomous vehicles could create substantial value for the industry and thus have a major impact on profit pools.Shaping a Chinese AV revolutionThe market for autonomous vehicles in China will offer huge opportunities to players willing to shoulder the risks involved, from local Chinese automakers to multinational companies to tech giants and mobility businesses. To capture these opportunities, players can either develop a differentiating service connection to the end customers or control key parts of the AV technology. Identifying which elements of the technology hold long-term strategic value and their evolution over time will enable players to locate the high-value "soul" of the autonomous-driving machine.Tech stacks will complement value chainsThe emerging AV ecosystem differs from traditional automotive approaches because it focuses on the technology stack-a concept used in the high technology and computing industries (Exhibit 5).Exhibit Link to Image The core elements of the technology stack include the sensors, the computing platform, software (including object detection and analysis as well as motion planning), system integration and validation, mapping, and location-based services (LBS). As such, it represents the core of an automobile's autonomous drive system. That makes it a critical part of the vehicle to "own" for automakers, suppliers, technology companies, and others. It seems likely that the important elements of the stack will evolve over time, thus requiring companies in the segment to monitor and assess the potential disruptions linked to subsequent technology innovations as they occur.Each tech stack layer has different critical success factors. For example, the sensor layer requires robust reliability and safety elements, as well as strong mass-production and production management capabilities to achieve necessary economies of scale. The algorithm and software layers require agile development skills and fast iteration capabilities to enable companies to work through training data to improve performance on a consistent basis. System integration and validation requires outstanding reliability and safety, and strong mass-production capabilities.Building a Chinese tech stackOf key interest to industry players is to what extent the Chinese stack will differ from that used in the rest of the world. The end state of this stack remains highly uncertain, as it depends on the competitiveness of different players and the regulatory environment. However, early indicators suggest that both global and locally developed solutions will emerge across the stack.Economics will provide much of the answer here. Hardware components are most likely to benefit from the scale economics of global solutions. Sensors, cameras, lidar, and the computing platform require the same capabilities in China as in the rest of the world (and therefore benefit greatly from the scale impact of global solutions). Mapping, LBS, and data-cloud solutions will likely require heavy localization.Some elements of a typical autonomous vehicle's technology stack-LBS and data cloud, for example-currently face so-called "negative restrictions" (for example, limitations on foreign-company involvement) by the government. Our research suggests local players alone will have access to most location-based services, leaving foreign companies and joint ventures at a disadvantage. The same appears to hold true for China's data cloud. That leaves the other five parts of the tech stack-the mobility services interface, the motion planning algorithm, connectivity functions, the central processing and graphics processing units, and sensors-currently open to foreign participation.Surveys and interviews with experts in the automotive, mobility, and technology industries suggest Chinese players are at least two to three years behind international companies in the critical capabilities required for delivering the AV stack (Exhibit 6). In some cases, such as the computing platform and AV system integration, the Chinese automakers are more than ten years behind.Exhibit Link to Image The Chinese government strongly supports local AV technology development, as shown by the establishment of multiple AV test zones, including Jiading in Shanghai and Xiong'an outside of Beijing. Initially positive, such support can help local players develop capabilities. Over time, however, the increasing drive toward localization could restrict competition in the sector (for example, hampering outsider abilities to operate locally or access local technology).The venture-capital community and major internet players are investing heavily in China to close the global/local gap. Over the last five years, AV and component companies have received $7 billion in funding. Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent have all invested in the sector by participating in funding rounds (for example, Baidu and Tencent with NIO, and Alibaba with Xpeng) and establishing partnerships (for instance, Alibaba with SAIC, Tencent with several OEMs, and Baidu with a wide range of players across the value chain as part of its Apollo ecosystem).The large amounts of available capital noted above and the active involvement of the government will both actively help to shape the competitive landscape for autonomous vehicles in China. At the same time, to succeed, China's AV industry must integrate itself deeply with global ecosystems to avoid reinventing the wheel.This type of integration will be imperative for Chinese players of all kinds because high-level AV technology requirements are fundamentally similar and thus transferable across markets and regions. Additionally, international players often have considerable advantages regarding some elements of the AV technology stack due to their global reach and expertise. As with any new technology, efforts to standardize as many elements of self-driving technology as possible could pay immense dividends down the road, especially for underresourced local players in China.Identifying winners and also-ransWinning the AV race will require industry incumbents to step out of their comfort zones and fully engage with a variety of players across the value chain and throughout the technology stack. Technology giants and other outsiders must also adopt new strategies to make sure their technology offerings become core parts of any standardized autonomous vehicle solutions. Additionally, players might need to move into new segments of the value chain (for example, mobility). As a result, winning will require cooperation between local and multinational companies and along the value chain.Several alliance models exist both across the AV technology stack (Exhibit 7) and between multinational and local players (Exhibit 8).Exhibit Link to Image Exhibit Link to Image Preparing now for tomorrow's self-driving realitiesFor automakers, high-tech companies, and mobility services providers competing in China, the AV phenomenon may seem a decade or two away, but deferring positioning strategies can rob players of both influence and degrees of freedom.Winning this game will require companies to evaluate their entry strategies carefully, balancing the high risk involved against the potential value of becoming a leader in the largest long-term market for autonomous vehicles in the world. In China as well as globally, autonomy and MaaS present a challenging landscape for investors due to the technological uncertainty and lack of proven business models. Companies making large-scale bets on conventional driving technologies (which will generate the bulk of market volume for at least the next half-decade) need to balance their investments in the old and the new at the same time.We have a few suggestions for players developing their AV strategy:• Decide where to play. Make a clear decision regarding what parts of the AV tech stack make the most sense for your company, both in terms of control points and differentiation. Establish a business model compatible with the identified source of differentiation.• Develop a road map to access the tech stack. Identify the link between your source of differentiation and the technology road map you need to deliver. Estimate the company's capability gaps and the investments required to decide whether to develop the technology in-house or acquire the needed capabilities.• Choose the right alliance and ecosystem.Determine your ecosystem and alliance strategy; no single player can deliver all the needed technology in the AV tech stack. At the same time, the AV value chain will differ from traditional ones. We believe going it alone is not an option. Instead, be ready to forge new partnerships and alliances as needed.• Build organizational agility. Cultivate strategic and organizational agility so you can update your strategy and tactics to anticipate changes in market dynamics and react quickly to competitor or partner moves.Beyond these four suggestions, multinational companies should consider creating a China-specific strategy with the flexibility to adapt their global models for China. That means developing the capacity to understand, respond to, influence, and shape what's going on in the country-and to develop tech-stack solutions in response. Multinational players today are uniquely aware of both the opportunity in China and the uncertainties regarding the competitive dynamics and localization requirements. That said, building a "global plus local" strategy and execution engine will not be a trivial exercise.Likewise, local players should assess what specific parts of the AV tech stack it makes sense for them to own versus those they should access through partnerships with multinational players (at the cost of partially giving away value and control). Today, most local automakers depend primarily on tech-stack components provided by global companies, and thus have only limited investments in the core technologies and integration capabilities. Such a strategy can work for fast followers, but to play a disruptive role, companies will need to control their own tech stacks.Getting startedWhile an autonomous vehicle can drive itself, firing up a company's AV strategy for China is more of a hands-on proposition. In addition to sorting through the traditional "where to play" and "how to play" questions, leaders need to make an unblinking assessment of the risks involved-both in being an industry leader and in waiting for others to lead the way. While such decisions are challenging under any circumstances, this one involves a trillion-dollar bet in China, home of the world's largest and most dynamic car market. With stakes this high, players will need much more than luck to gain a winning position.About the authorsLuca Pizzuto is a consultant in McKinsey's Chicago office, Christopher Thomas is a partner in the Beijing office, Arthur Wang is a partner in the Hong Kong office, and Ting Wu is a partner in the Shenzhen office.McKinsey InsightsFor more of McKinsey's latest thinking, install our app for iPad or            Android.Load-Date: February 20, 2020End of Document

FORMER TIBETAN POLITICAL PRISONER SENTENCED TO 18 YEARS FOR PROTEST; WIFE GIVEN 2 YEARS FOR FILMING VIDEOStates News ServiceMarch 15, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1217 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: DHARAMSALA, India BodyThe following information was released by the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD):The Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD) expresses deep concerns over the condition and whereabouts of a former political prisoner and his wife who had been secretly sentenced to 18 years and two years respectively in Sog (Ch: Suo) County, Nagchu (Ch: Naqu) Prefecture, Tibet Autonomous Region, the Tibetan province of Kham.Information received by TCHRD indicates that Lodoe Gyatso, 57, and his wife Gakyi had been sentenced in secret sometime in 2018 after Gyatso was arbitrarily detained in front of the Potala Palace in Lhasa for staging a peaceful solo protest against Chinese government.As reported earlier by TCHRD, prior to the protest on 28 January 2018, Gyatso had recorded a video announcing his 'campaign for world peace' and the solo protest that was filmed by Gakyi. The video made its way to the outside world through social media platforms and was circulated widely by exile Tibetans.The information about the couple's secret sentencing became available to sources inside Tibet sometime in November 2018 although the exact date and charges remain unknown. Family members and relatives have no information about their current place of detention or their condition.Based on available information, it can be confirmed that Gyatso has been held in secret, incommunicado detention since January 2018. The exact date for Gakyi's detention cannot be immediately confirmed although she too was detained incommunicado and subsequently imprisoned for two years.Punished for Political ActivismGyatso has a long record of speaking truth to power inside and outside prison. Known for his extraordinary courage in taking on the powers-that-be, he had his initial 15-year 'intentional homicide' sentence extended to 21 years after he led a large-scale prisoners' protest against Chinese rule in Tibet while still imprisoned in the notorious Drapchi prison. In May 2016, three years after his release from prison, he was detained for protesting the expulsion of monks and nuns from religious institutions located in Tibetan areas outside TAR. In 2015, he had openly criticised the local Chinese authorities for forcing Tibetans to perform songs and dances on the founding day of the People's Liberation Army wearing tiger and leopard fur-trimmed chupa (traditional Tibetan dress). In the 1.38-minute video that he shot with Gakyi's help, he was seen wearing a simple white and black Chupa defiantly praising His Holiness the Dalai Lama's vision of making Tibet a 'zone of peace' and the 'Middle Way Approach' of resolving the Tibet issue. He goes on to talk about the importance of Buddhist principles of interdependence and non-violence before announcing the launch of his 'campaign for world peace'.TCHRD believes that Gyatso and Gakyi were unfairly punished for making and sharing the aforementioned video and the protest that followed later in front of the Potala Palace. The right to freedom of opinion and freedom of expression are enshrined in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and guaranteed in Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and many other human rights treaties such as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women that China has ratified. These treaties protect all forms of expression including "political discourse, commentary on one's own and on public affairs, canvassing, discussion of human rights, journalism, cultural and artistic expression, teaching and religious discourse". Article 19 (1) of the ICCPR protects the right to hold any forms of opinion "including, but not limited to, opinions of a political, scientific, historic, moral or religious nature." In particular the right to freedom of opinion cannot be made subject to lawful derogation even in times of emergency."The Chinese authorities must release Lodoe Gyatso and Gakyi from arbitrary detention immediately and unconditionally. They must disclose truthful information about the events that led to their illegal imprisonment and hold accountable officials guilty of subjecting Gyatso and Gakyi to arbitrary arrests and detention, torture and other cruel and degrading treatment, and unfair sentencing," said Tsering Tsomo, executive director of TCHRD. "The blanket of secrecy surrounding this case is shocking and deeply distressing when a peaceful activist is given such a heavy sentence simply for expressing his opinion."BackgroundLodoe Gyatso is a native of Sogkhar village in Tsadhog Township, Sog County. He is known locally for his strong sense of political convictions and deep pride in his identity and culture. His family consists of his wife, mother, five sisters, and one younger brother. Before he was imprisoned, he used to be a dance artist and a three-time weight lifting champion in his hometown.On 20 April 1994, the Nagchu Intermediate People's Court sentenced Gyatso to 15 years in prison for killing a driver named Gayoel in legitimate self-defense. On 17 January 1993, Gayoel had killed Gyatso's sister Lharik in a car accident following which Gyatso sued Gayoel for murder. The court decided the case in favor of Gayoel who was known to be pro-Chinese and passed the verdict of 'not guilty'. Later in the same year, the two men met in the village market and a fight broke out between the two. After Gayoel missed two shots to kill Gyatso, the latter stabbed Gayoel in self-defence. Gayoel died later in a hospital.While serving his 15-yr sentence in Drapchi prison, Gyatso led a protest on 4 March 1995 against the Chinese authorities by holding a demonstration along the blocks of the prison compound. Along with other prisoners, he shouted slogans such as "Tibet is independent!" "China should leave Tibet!" "Long live His Holiness the Dalai Lama" "Six million Tibetans are united!" At the same time, he distributed handwritten pamphlets and hung posters that had political messages and prayers for the Dalai Lama. Consequently, he was tortured and interrogated for over a month but he refused to confess following which he was put on a starvation diet as punishment. Subsequently, prison officials and 're-education through labor committee' officials requested the procuratorate to execute Gyatso. In April 1995, while the Intermediate People's Court was awaiting the approval of the TAR Higher People's Court, the news of Gyatso's impending execution was smuggled out by fellow inmates and attracted international attraction. On 18 May 1995, the UN Special Rapporteur on Extra-Judicial, Summary and Arbitrary Executions transmitted an urgent appeal to the Chinese government. The Chinese government responded that there was no "execution sentence" but added that "while in prison, [Gyatso] did not attempt to change his ways but engaged in subversive and separatist activities" due to which his initial 15-yr sentence was extended by additional six years and stripped of political rights for three years. On 2 May 2013, Gyatso was released after completing his sentence at Drapchi prison and later at Chushur prison near Lhasa.Load-Date: March 15, 2019End of Document

Chinese groups have carried out cyberespionage against Mexico: MandiantCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 26, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 729 wordsBody Cyberespionage groups linked to the Chinese state have shown activity in Mexico. APT40 (Periscope), TEMP.Toucan, Conference Crew, APT20 (Twivy), Team 338, APT10 (MenuPass), APT15 (Social Network), APT27, TEMP.Hex and TEMP.Tick are some of the groups of Chinese cyber espionage that could have carried out cyber espionage in Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala, only within the Latin American region, according to Mandiant's special report M-Trends 2019.  While the report is not specific to Mexico, which are the sectors that have been harmed by these cyber-espionage activities, Julian Dana, director of Mandiant for Latin America, said that it is the government and industries with which the Chinese State does business with which point these attacks. "Those industries in which they do business are those that are going to enter," said the specialist.  "Mexico is not the priority for them at the moment, but in the future they want to know what the relations with the country will be like," he added. The academic, aerospace, banking, chemical, construction, defense, electoral, engineering, energy, high technology, and several other sectors are the focus of Chinese cyberespionage efforts in more than 20 countries of all countries. continents  According to the document, APT groups are nation-state actors that are generally focused on cyber-espionage activities. "Whenever there is a commercial relationship, China wants to take advantage and the APT groups look for strategic advantages, what will they do on the other side? Why?" Said Julian Dana, Mandiant's Latin America director.  Mandiant is owned by FireEye. It is a vulnerability analysis and prevention company that in October 2018 revealed details about a group of attackers called APT38 that, according to the company, "is responsible for committing financial crimes on behalf of the North Korean regime" by stealing of 1,100 million dollars from financial institutions through the SWIFT system in 11 countries, including Chile and Bangladesh. This attack was also aimed at the National Bank of Foreign Trade ( Bancomext ) in Mexico, although the dispersion of the stolen economic resources was prevented.  The specialist said that this is exacerbated in Latin America and specifically, in Mexico, because the level of maturity in cybersecurity is low and the ability to detect an attack of this type is very limited.  Long dance with China  Mandiant has a long history of analyzing and fighting cyber-espionage groups that are linked to the Chinese government. In 2013, he presented a report with the activities of APT1, a technically very advanced group, which several years ago was engaged in spying on the activities of various industries and governments around the world.  In 2015, Presidents Barack Obama and Xi-Jinping established an agreement for China to desist from subtracting protected information in the United States, which caused the cyberespionage activities of the eastern country to be reduced. This did not happen in other countries, where the cyberespionage activity of the Asian giant remained, according to Dana.  In 2018, cyber espionage by groups located in China was once again a trend. "The activity that is believed to be linked to state-backed operators now seems to be relatively focused on maintaining strategic intelligence and focusing on geopolitical developments," he says.document.  "China's cyber-espionage is lately very focused on everything that is related to the One Belt, One Road, the new Silk Road, because they are going to invest a lot in roads, energy and China as long as they have commercial relations with countries. to look for extra information, "said the specialist.  The One Belt, One Road is an initiative of the Chinese government to establish two new commercial corridors, one by land and one by sea, which will connect the Asian giant with its neighbors: the countries of Central Asia, the Middle East and even Europe. According to the World Economic Forum, China has already committed 1 trillion dollars in the project, which reaches a market of more than 3,000 million people and is a key axis in its vision of globalization.  The report indicates that there are even campaigns that monitor the elections and follow the regional power changes that could affect Chinese investments and expansion activity related to the Belt and Road.  [email protected] Load-Date: March 26, 2019End of Document

URGE YOUR MP TO GET THE UK WORKING WITH CHINA TO END TRADE IN BIG CATS!States News ServiceMarch 19, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 904 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: LONDON BodyThe following information was released by the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA):When the Chinese Government banned its domestic ivory trade in 2017, conservationists around the world celebrated a major win for elephants and it's long overdue for such a lifeline to be thrown to the world's imperilled big cats.If you live in the UK, we ask you to call on your local MP to join our campaigners at an event in Parliament on 2 April 2019 to explore how the UK can work with China to become big cat conservation champions.Tigers, leopards, snow leopards, clouded leopards, lions and jaguars continue to be killed to meet demand for their parts and products, largely from Chinese consumers, and there is an urgent need for the Chinese Government to tackle demand.A crucial step is to ban the sale and use of products containing big cat parts, including from captive-bred big cats a simple move which would send a strong message to consumers and see China heralded as a big cat conservation champion.Portrait of five-month-old Bengal tiger, India (c) Elliott Neep / www.elliottneep.comFewer than 4,000 wild tigers survive worldwide, and populations across much of their range are crashing in the face of a poaching crisis in the past decade, tiger populations have become functionally extinct in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. Malaysia recently announced it has fewer than 200 tigers left, a decline from an estimated 500 in 2010, while Myanmar confirmed it has just 22 left.Despite this situation, in October last year China's State Council revoked a 25-year ban on the use of farmed tiger bone and rhino horn in traditional medicine, a move greeted with overwhelming opposition from Chinese social media users and which was condemned internationally as a potential death knell for tigers.Implementation of the new policy has been delayed but it has not been reversed or superseded.Leopards are Asia's most traded big cat since 2000, for every tiger seized from illegal trade, between three and five leopards have been seized. International commercial trade in leopards and their parts has been banned since 1975 and China's own leopard population has fallen to just a few hundred.Shockingly, trade in products containing leopard bone is still legal in China. Just last year, the sale of 1.23 tonnes of leopard bone to a company that produces a leopard bone wine was permitted by the Government. This product is just one of at least 38 sold in China as containing leopard.On 2 April 2019, our campaigners will be speaking at an event in the UK Parliament, hosted by the All Party Parliamentary China Group, to discuss how the UK can work with China to end trade in big cats.We will be joined by Indian conservationist and author Prerna Bindra to give her perspective from the home of more than half the world's remaining wild tigers. The countries where tigers still survive are calling for the closure of domestic markets for tiger parts and an end to tiger farming the UK should be supporting these calls and working with China to ensure a future for big cats.Make your voice heard in the call to end big cat trade please email your MP to ask them to join the event at 3pm on 2 April in Room O, Portcullis House; your MP should RSVP to Ms Saki Reid. Find out who your MP is and how to contact them via the UK Parliament website.If you would like more information, please email aronwhite[at]eia-international.org.SpeakersDebbie Banks is Our Tigers and Wildlife Crime Campaign Leader and directs our campaign and investigation activities on tigers.

Disappearance of Australian Author Yang Hengjun Terrifying Sign of China's Repression of WritersTargeted News ServiceJanuary 23, 2019 Wednesday 8:31 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 405 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyPEN America issued the following news release:The disappearance of Australian author Yang Hengjun during a trip to mainland China is a terrifying sign of the Chinese government's willingness to disappear writers who criticize them, regardless of nationality, PEN America said today.Yang Hengjun, an Australian citizen and author, was reportedly seized on Saturday, January 19 during a visit to China, as he attempted to board a flight from Guangzhuo to Shanghai. Yang was reportedly interrogated for 12 hours before disappearing into undisclosed state custody. Yang's wife was reported with him, but was released after the interrogation, although it is unclear if she is allowed to leave the country.Yang, who is originally from China, became an Australian citizen in 2000 and has spent the last two years in New York City as a visiting scholar at Columbia University. While Yang has previously been critical of the Chinese government, he has reportedly tamped down such criticism in recent years. A novelist and blogger, Yang is known for his spy thriller "Fatal Weakness" trilogy as well as his online writings on politics and society."It's obvious that Yang would not have been seized if it weren't for his previous critical writings," said Summer Lopez, PEN America Senior Director of Free Expression Programs. "Yang's seizure is yet another indicator that the Chinese government's repression of free expression extends not only to its own citizens but to citizens of other countries. PEN America joins those calling on China to immediately release Yang Hengjun and to allow him freedom to travel."Other foreign citizens that the Chinese government has seized include Chinese-born Swedish poet and publisher Gui Minhai, who was kidnapped in Thailand by Chinese security agents in October 2015. More than three years later, Gui remains in state custody, despite reports of poor health. Last month, Chinese authorities arrested two Canadian citizens in the midst of an ongoing Chinese-Canada dispute stemming from Canadian police action against prominent Chinese businesswoman Meng Wanzhou. Some commentators have concluded that Yang Hengjun's seizure may be related to this ongoing dispute, as an escalation of a tactic of "hostage diplomacy" to grant additional leverage in international negotiations.Contact: Anoosh Gasparian, external relations manager, agasparian@pen.orgCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6584908 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: January 24, 2019End of Document

China says new law will bar demands for technology handoverAssociated Press Financial WireMarch 6, 2019 Wednesday 5:56 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 545 wordsByline: By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - China will bar government authorities from demanding overseas companies hand over technology secrets in exchange for market share, a top economic official said Wednesday, addressing a key complaint at the heart of the China-U.S. trade dispute.The provision is contained in a foreign investment law to be debated at the current annual session of the National People's Congress, Ning Jizhe, vice chairman of the Cabinet's economic planning agency told reporters at a news conference.The law will "clarify the system for advancement and protection of foreign investment," Ning said. The legal system will ensure that foreign businesses "cannot be required to transfer technology by administrative means, providing a more encompassing and beneficial legal guarantee," he said.The rubber-stamp legislature is expected to pass the law during its 11-day session, although the central government routinely says it has little control over commercial agreements between Chinese and foreign firms.Ning's statement came a day after Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced a robust annual economic growth target and promised in a speech to the congress' opening session that foreign companies will be "treated as equals" with their Chinese competitors.Accusations that China demands the disclosure of technology secrets are a key stumbling point in the U.S.-China trade dispute that has significantly disrupted commerce between the world's two largest economies, affecting farmers, liquor exporters and China's key manufacturing industries.Li on Tuesday set this year's economic growth target at 6 to 6.5 percent. Such a growth rate, if achieved, would be among the world's strongest. Yet it would be slightly below last year's 6.6 percent growth in China and would mark a new three-decade low.China's emergence as a competitor in smartphones, telecom equipment, solar power and other technologies has increased the range of products available to consumers and helped to drive down prices. But it rattles Washington and other governments that worry Chinese competition is a threat to their industries and employment.Such concerns underscore a standoff between the U.S. and China over Huawei Technologies, the world's biggest maker of telecom infrastructure for new high-speed 5G networks. Washington has been pushing hard to exclude the Chinese company from building the backbone of the future internet.News reports say Washington and Beijing might be close to an agreement to end the trade battle and avoid further tariff hikes, although no firm agreements have been announced on the core of the dispute: U.S. pressure on Beijing to roll back its plans for state-led creation of global competitors in robotics and other technology.Last year, the U.S. levied import taxes of 25 percent on $50 billion of Chinese imports. It followed in September with 10 percent duties on an additional $200 billion. All told, the U.S. tariffs covered roughly half of what the U.S. buys from China.Washington, Europe and other trading partners say China's policies violate its market-opening obligations and give an unfair advantage to domestic firms. Some American officials worry they might erode U.S. industrial leadership.___Associated Press writer Joe McDonald contributed to this report.Load-Date: March 7, 2019End of Document

But it rattles Washington and other governments that worry Chinese competition is a threat to their industries and employment.Such concerns underscore a standoff between the U.S. and China over Huawei Technologies, the world's biggest maker of telecom infrastructure for new high-speed 5G networks. Washington has been pushing hard to exclude the Chinese company from building the backbone of the future internet.News reports say Washington and Beijing might be close to an agreement to end the trade battle and avoid further tariff hikes, although no firm agreements have been announced on the core of the dispute: U.S. pressure on Beijing to roll back its plans for state-led creation of global competitors in robotics and other technology.Last year, the U.S. levied import taxes of 25 percent on $50 billion of Chinese imports. It followed in September with 10 percent duties on an additional $200 billion. All told, the U.S. tariffs covered roughly half of what the U.S. buys from China.Washington, Europe and other trading partners say China's policies violate its market-opening obligations and give an unfair advantage to domestic firms. Some American officials worry they might erode U.S. industrial leadership.___Associated Press writer Joe McDonald contributed to this report.Load-Date: March 7, 2019End of Document

Continue reading China banned millions of people with poor social credit from transportation in 2018China banned people from buying plane or train tickets 23 million times last year because their social credit scores were too low, according to the Associated Press, which obtained a copy of a government report.The government rolled out the travel ban on people with low social credit scores last May. According to a report from China s National Public Credit Information Center from last week, people have been blocked 17.5 million times from purchasing airplane tickets, and 5.5 million times from buying high-speed train tickets. These people had become  discredited  for unspecified behavioral crimes. That s up from only 6.15 million citizens being blocked from taking flights as of 2017, according to China s supreme court.The Chinese government plans to create a file for each citizen by 2020As part of the system, the Chinese government also employs a public blacklist of those who have been found guilty of crimes in court and punishes them partly by limiting their ability to buy plane and train tickets.Social credit scores are also supposed to help prevent annoying behavior on public transport, such as one case where a passenger who took up another person s reserved seat and refused to get up. The video of the passenger refusing to budge went viral, with Chinese users calling for more punishment for people who act this way.The Chinese government has independent policies in place to monitor individuals and punish bad behavior. Your social ranking in the government s eyes might be lowered if you evade taxes, scam other people, make fake ads, or take up extra seats on the train. Currently, whenever a person passes by a checkpoint, like when crossing into another city, or entering and leaving China, they re asked for fingerprints and identification already.Once the files are successfully collected, the hope is that authorities will be able to search for them based on fingerprints and other biometrics. By 2020, China aims to have a file on every Chinese citizen that includes all the data collected on their behavior, according to publicly available government documents translated here.Tags: See Website:https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/1/18246297/china-transportation-people-banned-poor-social-credit-planes-trains-2018Contact Information:Shannon LiaoTags:           Wire,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: March 4, 2019End of Document

Chinese student sentenced to a year in prison for taking photos of naval baseCNN.comFebruary 6, 2019 Wednesday 11:44 AM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: USLength: 568 wordsByline: By Marlena Baldacci and Brad Lendon, CNNBodyA 20-year-old Chinese student was sentenced to a year in federal prison after he pleaded guilty to illegally taking pictures at a key US defense intelligence facility in Florida.A federal judge in Key West gave Zhao Qianli the maximum sentence after his guilty plea on Tuesday of one count of photographing defense installations.Zhao's attorney, Hongwei Shang, declined comment to CNN when reached by phone Wednesday evening.According to court documents, Zhao entered the Joint Interagency Task Force South military property, located on Naval Air Station Key West, on September 26 without permission "by circumnavigating the installation's primary fence line, and entering the military property from the beach."Upon clearing the base's main fence line, Zhao went directly to an area that contains a range of satellite dishes and antennas called "the Farm," court documents say.Zhao took videos and multiple photographs of the equipment in the Farm, the court said."The primary installation fence line contained multiple signs that stated the Farm area was a 'RESTRICTED AREA' and the 'KEEP OUT'" as did a secondary fence line around the Farm, the documents say.The court documents give no specific indication whether Zhao was attempting to commit espionage.A US Navy video calls the Key West facility "one of the leading intelligence fusion centers in the world."It tracks more than 1,000 suspect targets a day, the Navy says, turning intelligence images into virtual reality programs.The center monitors more than 42 million square miles of the Earth's surface to detect threats to US security, including narcotics shipments from the Americas, according to the video.Personnel from all five branches of the US military plus representatives from 13 other nations work at the facility.Zhao was in the United States to study musicology as part of a summer exchange program from North University of China, according to CNN affiliate WFOR.US alleges Chinese influence campaignWord of Zhao's sentence comes as US officials claim China is engaged in a persistent, aggressive effort against American businesses and government agencies.Both countries are holding trade talks aimed at mitigating long-running US concerns over Beijing's trade practices. But in the past six months tensions between the two countries have spread to military, political and diplomatic arenas.US officials, analysts and experts told CNN in a report last week that Beijing was working to undermine American industries, steal American secrets and eventually diminish American influence in the world so that the Chinese government can advance its own agenda.The Chinese government has repeatedly said it is acting in good faith in its interactions with the US. "I do not know where this strong sense of insecurity comes from," Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on January 30."China has been consistently advocating the establishment of a new security concept of sustainability and cooperation."Roughly 350,000 people from China study in the US every year, experts say.Current and former intelligence officials told CNN that they all remain tethered to the Chinese government in some way, even if the vast majority aren't sent to the US to spy."There is no comparison to the breadth and scope of the Chinese threat facing America today, as they actively seek to supplant the US globally," Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida told CNN.Load-Date: February 8, 2019End of Document

CHINESE ENVOY OFFERED ROHINGYA MONEY TO RETURN TO MYANMAR: SOURCESStates News ServiceMarch 5, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 779 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A Chinese government delegation met Rohingya Muslims in Bangladesh, promising each refugee up to U.S. $6,000 if they returned to Rakhine state in Myanmar, a Bangladeshi official and refugee leaders said Tuesday. Sun Gouxiang, China's special envoy for Asian Affairs, met with 15 men and 14 women at the Kutupalong refugee camp in Cox's Bazar on March 3, according to Syed Ullah, secretary-general of the Arakan Rohingya Society for Peace and Human Rights (ARSPH), an NGO. "They asked us whether we would go back if they gave us five thousand to six thousand dollars," Ullah told BenarNews. "We rejected their proposal and asserted that we will in no way return if we are not given citizenship with Rohingya identity and our other demands are not met," he said. A Bangladeshi official who attended the meeting confirmed to BenarNews, on condition of anonymity, that the Chinese delegation had offered up to U.S. $6,000 to help the refugees rebuild their homes in Rakhine state. The Chinese embassy in Dhaka did not respond to a BenarNews email seeking comment. The United Nations estimates that some 730,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh at the height of a brutal crackdown launched by the Myanmar military in response to attacks by Rohingya insurgents on security posts in August 2017. "At least 200,000 new houses must be constructed for repatriation of the refugees who have been living in Bangladesh. It would be very difficult to construct so many houses," the Bangladeshi official told BenarNews. "Chinese government offered them the money, so that each Rohingya family can build their own houses when they go back," he said. But, he said, it would be impossible for the refugees to build their own homes, as most of them have lost the men in their households as a result of the military crackdown that the United States and the United Nations have condemned as ethnic cleansing. Myanmar has denied the allegations. Delwar Hossain, an official in charge of the Southeast Asia desk at Bangladesh's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told BenarNews that his office arranged the meeting between the Chinese delegation and the refugees. "They discussed the demands of the Rohingya people," Hossain said. During his visit to Cox's Bazar, the Chinese envoy was accompanied by two officials from the Chinese embassy in Myanmar, a diplomat from its embassy in Dhaka, and two foreign ministry officials from Beijing, another Bangladeshi official, Alauddin Vuian, told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service. The delegation met with Rohingya leaders and Mohammad Abul Kalam, Bangladesh's refugee relief and repatriation commissioner, foreign ministry sources said. A short video clip of that meeting, seen by BenarNews, shows Chinese officials talking to Rohingya leaders, some of whom hand documents to the visitors. A Rohingya leader told the Chinese delegation that the refugees would "never accept any repatriation without international security, full citizenship with Rohingya identity and justice," Syed Ullah said. Muhib Ullah, another ARSPH official, provided more details about the meeting in an interview with BenarNews. "First of all, they wanted to know whether all of us were Rohingya and we would go back," he said. "We told them that we would go just now if they accept our demands. Otherwise, we will not go." "If Myanmar grants citizenship, we will return jumping," Ullah said. Munshi Fayez, Bangladesh's former ambassador to Beijing, told BenarNews that China's move to start talking to Rohingya refugees about possible repatriation was apparently aimed at protecting Myanmar, its regional ally, from international pressure, and at gaining a foothold on the economic benefits of the return of the refugees. "Myanmar has created such a situation that China in future may not be able to protect them from international pressure," Fayez said. "So, they try to mediate the Rohingya repatriation to save (China's) international image." At the same time, he said, China was seeking a solution to the Rohingya issue for their economic interests. "China wants to create an economic zone in Rakhine," Fayez said. "If the Rohingya issue remained unresolved, they cannot create an economic zone." The Chinese envoy flew out of the country from Dhaka on Tuesday, Bangladeshi foreign ministry sources told BenarNews. Before travelling to Bangladesh, Sun Gouxiang visited several villages in Rakhine state and met with Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi in the capital Naypyidaw on Feb. 27, according to the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar. Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Load-Date: March 6, 2019End of Document

Top US general says Google 'is indirectly benefiting the Chinese military'CNN WireMarch 14, 2019 Thursday 9:04 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 510 wordsByline: By Ryan Browne, CNNDateline: (CNN) Body (CNN) --  America's top general said Thursday that Google's work in China "is indirectly benefiting the Chinese military.""The work that Google is doing in China is indirectly benefiting the Chinese military and I've been very public on this issue as well," Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said while testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee."We watch with great concern when industry partners work in China knowing that there is that indirect benefit and frankly indirect may be not a full characterization of the way it really is, it's more of a direct benefit to the Chinese military," Dunford added.Dunford has long questioned why US-based tech firms have resisted working with the Department of Defense while simultaneously doing business with geopolitical competitors like China.CNN previously reported that Google intended to end its cooperation with the Pentagon on several projects, including the Project Maven program which used artificial intelligence to enhance military drone operations following complaints from employees.The company also recently dropped a bid for a Pentagon cloud storage contract, citing concerns that working with the Defense Department could conflict with its principles."The way I described it to our industry partners is: look we're the good guys and the values that we represent and the system we represent is the one that will allow and has allowed you to thrive," Dunford said Thursday.Google has "a lack of willingness to support DoD programs," acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan also told the committee on Thursday.He said that China often uses civilian technology to bolster its military forces."The technology that is developed in the civil world, transfers to the military world, it's a direct pipeline," Shanahan said.A spokesperson for Google declined to address Dunford's comments that the company's work was benefiting the Chinese military but told CNN that despite its exiting several Pentagon projects, Google does continue to work with the Department of Defense in some areas."We deeply respect the US military and we are working with them to solve problems in areas like cybersecurity, logistics, transportation and planning," the spokesperson said.Google's lack of willingness to work with the Pentagon while simultaneously doing business with China was slammed by Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri."We are in a struggle with the Chinese government over whether or not they're going to become a regional and maybe global hegemon with values very different from ours, certainly values that do not favor freedom in the world," Hawley said."We have an American company that does not want to do work with our defense department which is one thing, but they're happy to help the Chinese, at least the Chinese government that is, the Chinese military, at least indirectly, I think that's just extraordinary," he added.CNN's Donie O'Sullivan contributed to this report.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Tencent Poised for Stock Price Gains After Key Government ApprovalRealMoneyJanuary 25, 2019 Friday 1:30 PM EDTCopyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 753 wordsByline: Alex Frew McMillanHighlight: Tencent, one of the two largest Chinese video game makers, is set to rise after winning a license from the Chinese government to roll out new games.BodyTencent Holdings  has been held ransom by the Chinese government, which froze the approval of new video games in China for nine months. Its shares were hit with a savage selloff well before tech in general tumbled. But the freeze has thawed.So too has Tencent's share price. Its recent run-up echoes the start of its 2017 tear, when it doubled and then some, at its peak posting a 155% gain. Watch, in other words, for greater gains again.Tencent and its rival NetEase  , the two largest Chinese video game makers, have both just won their first licenses for new games after that government-enforced hiatus. Both companies had missed out on the first three rounds of game approvals since the authorities relaxed their stance and began giving new titles the thumbs up in December.Tencent and NetEase rely on video games as their largest revenue generators. So it is with huge relief the company and investors greet clearance for Tencent's self-developed games, Wood Joints and Hand Fan, while NetEase can now market its "massively multiplayer online role-playing game," War Spring and Autumn.The two Tencent games are based on Chinese culture, and functional: players get to design furniture, or Chinese fans. It's more exciting for Tencent that the massively multiplayer game Perfect World Mobile was also approved, Jefferies analyst Karen Chan said in an industry note.The martial arts online game was developed by Perfect World, and literally made that company's name a decade ago. This new mobile version is exclusively licensed to Tencent. It also offers great potential for monetization.The other key point is the government is likely to intensify the game-granting action after its sudden cessation of licensing. It looks like 2,000 to 3,000 games will now be approved this year, with a raft of new releases likely after the Lunar New Year, which falls on Feb. 5, 2019.There's a backlog of 7,000 to 8,000 games from all makers awaiting. Tencent should see meaningful feedthrough in results in the second part of this year. The key risk to Tencent now would be if its games start showing a short lifecycle, Chan noted, while for NetEase it's the pace of licensing and any macro slowdown in China that might mess things up, earnings-wise.Tencent's WeChat social-messaging app (the "Chinese WhatsApp") is ubiquitous in China, used not just for chat but also for, well, basically everything, particularly mobile payments and ordering goods. The company, which competitors say copies anything worth copying, has expanded into cloud storage, movie making, digital payments, artificial intelligence and self-driving cars.But it's gaming that gave it its start, and gaming that matters most. As it became clear Chinese authorities were not approving new games, Tencent's stock slid 44.3% between March and October last year.Investors are once again seeing cents in Tencent. The game maker's shares have rallied since their Oct. 30 low, and after Friday's 4.1% gain have risen another 32.2%. But in terms of market cap, Tencent remains around three-quarters of its previous size.At US$417 billion in market capitalization, Shenzhen-based Tencent is once again Asia's biggest company. It has overtaken Hangzhou-based Alibaba Group Holding  , at US$404 billion in market value. Both are just behind the US$419 billion value of Facebook  , ranking the trio Nos. 6, 7 and 8 among the world's biggest corporations.Alibaba and Tencent both posted massive gains in 2017, and at that time the two swapped size back and forth. But the regulatory hassles only hit Tencent, with the Chinese authorities worried about the violent content in some games, and more so about the immense amount of time many minors are spending playing games in China.Tencent is now requiring age verification for its blockbuster Honour of Kings. It also says it will start using facial recognition to detect minors using its games. Another major reason why China stopped approving games had nothing to do with content and was entirely procedural: there was a reshuffling of departments and their scope.Tencent has run ahead of the tech rout in the West by one quarter, and began its rally one quarter earlier, too. It seems very likely that Alibaba's shares will now stage a rebound, with the FANG stocks showing renewed resilience in the new year.Alibaba appears to have turned a corner with its Dec. 20 low of US$135 per share, and has risen 15.4% to US$156. If it and Tencent continue their upward progress, they're very valuable parts of a portfolio.Load-Date: January 26, 2019End of Document

The size of China's economic crisis is an unsolved mysteryCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 12, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 966 wordsBody HONG KONG (CNN) - Businesses and executives around the world are trying to measure the severity of China's economic recession with despair, but it's hard to get a clear picture.  , according to government information.  Big brands such as Apple and Caterpillar have blamed the decline in their profits to the weakness of the market in China.  The situation could be even worse than government statistics suggest, according to analysts.  "China's published GDP figures are completely garbage, no doubt the consensus is that these figures are unreliable," said Leland Miller, CEO of the China Beige Book consultancy.  Your company collects information from thousands of companies across various industries in China to get their own analysis of what happens, so their name has to do with the Federal Reserve Beige Book report.  Miller says the Chinese economy is "much, much weaker" at this time than the Chinese government's figures suggest and probably will not improve soon.  Businesses need to know the depth and likely duration of the crisis to make investment and hiring decisions and for investors to determine where to put their money. China deals with the consequences of the government's efforts to suppress risky loans and trade war with the United States.  Experts suspect that China's National Bureau of Statistics, which reports most of the country's information, is more focused on making the government look good than on providing information that adequately reflects the health of its economy.  The office is "a first Communist Party body and an honest statistics mediator in second place," said Derek Scissors, a resident researcher at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington in a blog post.  It is difficult to determine China's actual growth rate, since much of the information issued by the government "makes no sense", according to Scissors, who is also chief economist of China Beige Book.  For example, the figures on the size of the economy, compared to the average income of Chinese citizens does not match, he said.  Other analysts use their own measurements to get an idea of the health of the Chinese economy.  The research company Capital Economics examines a range of data that includes maritime cargo transport, electricity generation and financial loans to arrive at an indirect indicator. By this, they claim that the Chinese economy could have grown by only 5% last year, instead of the 6.6% that the official rate affirms.  The slowdown has overshadowed Chinese businesses.  "The economy will get worse and worse in the coming months," said Wei Bingyu, owner of an industrial paint factory in Beijing.  It blames commercial war and other problems for the current difficulties.  A closely watched independent survey measuring the health of China's huge manufacturing sector claims that it sank to its lowest level in nearly three years last month.  Chinese consumers feel the pressure  Investors analyze the economy to find signs of weakness, which until now include the decline in industrial profit margins and the fall in exports.  The behavior of Chinese consumers is a key point. Spending by Chinese buyers increased by almost 10% last year, according to official information.  But the country's huge car market was reduced in 2018 for the first time in nearly 20 years, and retail sales of the holidayof the Lunar New Year that took place this month grew at the slowest pace of more than a decade.  Official Chinese information is probably "exaggerating growth in consumption," said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China's senior economist at Capital Economics, in a recent note to his clients.  He estimates that consumer spending in China's large urban areas was reduced by 3% last year, suggesting that middle-class shoppers are reducing their spending. This corresponds to what some business owners have said.  Zhou Chang, owner of a gym in downtown Beijing told CNN that his clients are spending less.  Using a gym "is not the same as eating, dressing, renting a house or being transported. Those are basic, while bodybuilding does not, "said Zhou.  As the economy slows down, "many gyms have closed temporarily or have gone bankrupt," he added.  Have the stimuli reached the necessary places?  Vice President Wang Qishan urged investors to stop worrying about the economy.  "There will be a lot of uncertainty in 2019, but one thing that is certain is that China's growth will remain and will be sustainable," he said in a speech presented at the World Economic Fund in Davos last month.  But Chinese officials have shown signs of concern. They have tried to boost growth through measures such as tax cuts, increased spending on infrastructure and looser monetary policies.  It is not yet clear how much these decisions will help to stop the crisis since much of the capital that is released is destined for inefficient state companies, instead of private businesses, according to analysts.  Many private companies in China depend on shadow financing for shady forms of loans that stay away from banks' official financial balances. Regulators have put pressure on these practices in recent years.  "It is extremely difficult to obtain financial support as a private business," said Guo Yucheng, owner of a drug manufacturing business in Jilin province in northern China.  He recently merged his company with a state company to improve his chances of obtaining financing.  He predicted that it would take up to two years for measures such as tax cuts to make a real difference for companies in difficulty.  "There are too many businesses, like ours, that are only trying to get by each month, and private businesses are going through a difficult winter," Guo said.  Serenitie Wang, Julia Horowitz, Lily Lee and Eduardo Baptista contributed to this report. Load-Date: February 12, 2019End of Document

Amazon CEO and Washington Post donor Jeff Bezos made a cameo in Roger Goodell's box as he comes under fire for the paper's big game ad amid layoffs in the industry.All those stories coming up this Monday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, PwC partner Mitch Roschelle, and the President of Maslansky and Partners, Lee Carter. Great to see you this morning.LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: Great to be here.MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC CHARITABLE FOUNDATION: Super Bowl Monday.BARTIROMO: Yes.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I mentioned last hour who is Charles Haley tied for five Super Bowl wins with Tom Brady until tom Brady's win last night. I wish more people paid respect to Charles on the broadcast last night just to kind of tip of the hat to a man won two Super Bowls with the San Francisco 49ers and three with the Dallas Cowboys from Gladys, Virginia. But Charles Haley did show respect with humor.He tweeted last night about nine hours ago. Congratulations to Tom Brady and the Patriots, records are made to be broken and who knows, maybe I have one more in me.BARTIROMO: Great.MCDOWELL: No, no. He is 55. He's already retired. God bless him but so respect to Tom Brady and Charles Haley.BARTIROMO: Very good. All right. The fight over border wall funding is looming meanwhile, the President is getting ready to deliver his State of the Union Address tomorrow night. Blake Burman is at the White House with more details on what we can expect. Blake, good morning to you.BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you as well. The President is scheduled here at the White House today is clear probably giving him some time to prepare for tomorrow's State of the Union. The White House says that speech from the President will hit on five different themes at the top of the list having a safe and legal immigration system as they put it, protecting American workers on trade deals like China and NAFTA along with rebuilding America's infrastructure, lowering costs for healthcare and prescription drugs and protecting national security.The speech delayed a week of course due to record long government shutdown as the President fought Democrats for new border wall money and did not get that funding. The President over the weekend continued to say he could declare national emergency on the southern border if the deal is not hammered out by February 15th. But he also kept in play the possibility that the government could shut down again.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Well, I don't -- I don't think anything off the table. I don't like to take things off the table.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: Meantime, the Pentagon announced yesterday that it would be sending some 3700 troops down to the southern border to assist with Customs and Border Protection. That brings the total number to north of 4300. And Maria, the President also said in that interview yesterday that we will probably find out if the State of the Union more information about his meeting with Kim Jong-un. Maria?BARTIROMO: All right. Lots to come tomorrow night. Blake, thank you. Blake Burman is at White House. Let's bring in former senior adviser to President George W. Bush and Fox News Contributor Karl Rove for his reaction. Good to see you, Karl.KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning. How are you?BARTIROMO: Hey. Did you watch the Super Bowl?ROVE: I watched about five minutes of it but I got to tell you -- I got to tell you, Dagen McDowell, I'll put -- Adam Levine this morning crying after hearing what Dagen said about his performance --BARTIROMO: Oh, she gave brutal.ROVE: Yes. Brutal, brutal. I don't think we can look for any kind of relationship to be blooming between the two of them. I mean, I don't know exactly.MCDOWELL: He will run for office eventually, Karl, I know we can lambaste him some more. I'm just kidding.ROVE: There we go.BARTIROMO: Karl, let me -- let me --ROVE: Well, that guy -- those tattoos, that just looked painful about the process of putting all of those tattoos.BARTIROMO: It's a lot of tattoos. Even from -- those of us who like tattoos, that was a lot of tattoos. Look, let's talk about this, the President says just in that sound bite a moment ago, I don't want to take anything off the table. I mean, he does know that if the government shuts down, people are going to blame them both.ROVE: Well, they're going to blame them both but they'll blame him more.BARTIROMO: Right.ROVE: I thought it was -- I thought it was interesting, they blamed him more but they also blamed the Democrats and there is a good reason for that. Look, this is the kind of controversy that should be easily solved. You know, we're talking about one-tenth of one percent of the Federal budget is what he asked for for the border wall. The idea that the border wall doesn't work or that is amoral is ridiculous.I do think the President has an opportunity here. Notice how many Democrats have been talking in recent days about we want to hear what experts have to say this morning we had, you know, somebody from the Democrats talking on our companion in network about evidence-based wall. Well, the President ought to just in my opinion turn and say look, I've been talking about the wall but I want to show you the people who have been talking to me about it, here are the experts inside the Department of Homeland Security who've been advising me on where we need to repair the wall and where we need to extend the wall.I want you to listen to them. Put me inside for a moment, listen to the experts and they will tell you what we need to do.BARTIROMO: Yes. You're right. And not only that but there seems to be a movement within the Democratic Party to just get something done and whether it means money for a physical barrier as well as other things like drones and technology, et cetera, there is a movement that they are breaking with Nancy Pelosi because they know this is just a political fight.ROVE: Yes. Look, you've got 32 Democrats who occupy seats that were won by Donald Trump in 2016. And of course, those kinds of members are sitting there saying I'm not going home and say abolish ICE, I'm not going to go home and say, walls don't work, I'm not going home and say we don't need to worry about the southern border because I've got a district people where people are concerned about those kind of things.BARTIROMO: That's exactly right.ROVE: This is not AOC in a gentrified district in Brooklyn, in Queens and the Bronx. I've got a district in the Middle America and I go to worry about this thing.BARTIROMO: Yes. Like Michigan and Ohio.ROVE: Right.CARTER: But Karl -- this is Lee, I'm -- one of the things I'm really curious about, I know that the polling says that more people blame the President than they do the Democrats but it's 60 percent blame Trump and then 50 percent still blame the Democrats for where we are. At the same time, the President's polling numbers on one thing has increased since this and that's that he will fight for what he believes in.ROVE: Right.CARTER: So people are going to say that he means what he says, says what he means and that's something that got him in the office in the first place because he seemed like a different politicians. Do you think in any way this might help him?ROVE: Well, look, there are -- there are -- there are minor advantages coming out of this but overall it has depressed his numbers. The only good news really for the administration is is that Nancy Pelosi's unfavorable have risen more rapidly than his. And he is -- she is less popular than he is. The problem is she's not going to be running against him next year, it's going to be a fresh face from the Democrats. The question is, how far left are they going to be?Shutdowns are never good for the person who caused them particularly if they say, I'm willing to take the blame for it and that's what the President did on this one. But look, we got an answer available here. The pressure is on. If the President steps back a little bit and makes it less about him and more about here, the experts that I'm listening to. If you don't want to believe me, OK, fine.But I want you to listen to the woman who is charge of our border security in the human region. I want you to be in-charge of the person -- listen to the person who in charge of border security in the San Diego region. And if possible find a way to gently say, you know what, if you really believe that walls are immoral go ahead and put a bill forward in the House to take up that 63 miles of fence we got in San Diego County.See how many cosponsors you get, see how many votes you get because it's just simply flat wrong. There are places along the border wall are needed, there are lots of places where they're not needed but there are places where walls are needed.ROSCHELLE: Karl, Mitch Roschelle. The -- this prior shutdown ended when I guess over weekend it happened on a Friday, I was a victim of it, the FAA sort of come to a grinding halt and they realized that, you know, this country was going to slowly come to grinding halt if we didn't get the government open again. But if we go to another shutdown, the pain point is going to be higher, right?And so at what point does the shutdown not become a negotiating tool because the pain on every day Americans and on commerce becomes very high.ROVE: Well, look, I think we're there. I think the President is in a place where he can't say no, no, I'm -- I've taken a shutdown off the table but they -- he better have because it hurt him. And look, the President of the United States is facing reelection in 2020 and if there's one thing that the American people want, they want their government to work. And the idea of all this politics and all this sort of back and forth in Washington resulting in the government, one quarter of the government coming to a dead halt.It's just something that people at some point, the people who will decide the 2020 election like I say, you know what, I want somebody who's going to make it work. And the President can get those people, he got them last time but he cannot continue to sort of, you know, test them by saying I think it's a useful thing to shut down the government. They don't think so.BARTIROMO: That's right. Let's talk 2020 for a second. The Democratic field growing bigger, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker now the latest to throw his hat in the ring, you've got Howard Schultz on the Independent path. What's your take on how this is all shaking out?ROVE: Well, look, it's very early and what's interesting to me, I'm going to be watching a couple things. First of all, I'm watching the social media because I think social media is going to make it possible for people to win, support, raise money and stay in the race longer than traditionally they would have been able to because, look, Robert Francis O'Rourke making his trip around the country. We all mocked him for it but on the other hand he's got a devoted set of millions of followers who tune in to his Instagram account or his Facebook or social media and watch him.He's got his own T.V. channel, T.V. Robert Francis O'Rourke, R4 is what it's called. So, you know, you could -- you know, all of these people, debates started June, we are five months away from starting to have debates. And of course we're getting people into the end of the race right now and it's interesting to see how different each one of them is doing it. Kamala Harris did I think, you know, she announced on social media but then she had a more traditional rally with 20,000 plus people cramming downtown Oakland.So, it's going to be interesting to see how they play out but at the end of the day this is going to be a long process, a long process.MCDOWELL: Well -- and Karl, really quickly. This is the issue for the Democrats, they have got to get governor Ralph Northam out of the way because that -- those medical school yearbook photos, racist, his handling of the situation, he is doing nothing but undermining the Democratic Party right now.ROVE: Yes. it's interesting though that the Democrats are so focused on that and not really focused on him saying, yes, after the child is born we will make it comfortable and then the doctor and the mother will have a discussion about whether or not they're going to kill the newly born infant. I mean, that was just jaw-dropping last week. This guy has had three weird news conferences in less than 10 days.First one on abortion and the other two on his yearbook picture and whether or not he blackfaced during in a Michael Jackson competition in San Antonio, Texas. So, I mean, this is weird.BARTIROMO: I think he was ready to do the moonwalk yesterday.ROSCHELLE: Oh yes. He was --(CROSSTALK)ROVE: Yes. There are lot of Democrats who want him to moonwalk out. That's right. Sort of out, there he goes.BARTIROMO: You know, it's not funny but it's quite bizarre.MCDOWELL: Well, and backwards of Lieutenant Governor Fairfax in the state, they have no love for Governor Ralph Northam because there were accusations that Fairfax was kept off a lot of the mailers by Northam. So, supporters of the Lieutenant Governor who would step into the governor's shoes if he resigned. There is no love there.BARTIROMO: Well, they're upset. He wasn't treated right.MCDOWELL: Right.BARTIROMO: Yes.ROVE: Yes. It's going to be interesting. There are going to be long-term consequences but the shortest term consequence is going to be that the strong Democratic governor is not going to be there in Virginia this fall when they have these critical elections for the general assembly on the state Senate where the Republicans hold control in each House by one vote. So it's going to be interesting to see the practical impact of that.BARTIROMO: So, are you saying that the debates start this June?ROVE: This June, this June.BARTIROMO: Wow.ROVE: And Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee says we're not going to have a kitty debate with the lesser candidates like maybe Congressman Delaney and an adult debate with the major candidates like Senator Warren and Senator Spartacus and Senator Harris. So it's going to be interesting to see how you get 10 or 12 or 14, 15 people on the stage.BARTIROMO: The debates of the primaries start in June. Just within the Democratic Party. Got it. OK. Karl, great stuff. Thanks so much.ROVE: You bet. Thank you.BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon, Karl. Karl Rove joining us. Coming up. Eye on earnings. Big names like Alphabet, Snap, Twitter, General Motors, Disney all set to report earnings this week. What you need to know about earnings for the fourth quarter coming up. And then spotted at the Super Bowl, Amazon CEO and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos making a cameo in Roger Goodell's box yesterday as he comes under fire for the paper's big game ad amid lay-offs in the industry. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Right in the middle of another busy earnings period, we've got a busy week this week. We've got Google parent Alphabet reporting after the bell tonight and then a whole host of companies coming out this week. Deirdre Bolton on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange looking at -- what would you expect. Hey, Deirdre.DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Hey, Maria. Well, one of the things that we're going to be looking at behind the numbers for Alphabet, Google is really the strength of YouTube. So, a lot of analysts are saying they've never really broken this before but certainly one of the metrics we're going to be looking for after the close. But, Maria, you mentioned a huge week for media, so I'm going down the list.Of course, Alphabet Google as today, Twitter is on Thursday, Disney is on Tuesday, so a lot of names to watch. interestingly enough, I know you guys have been talking about the Super Bowl this morning but Netflix viewing last night down more than 30 percent. I think even down more than 35 percent while the game was on. Interesting little tidbit there. We're also watching Facebook, so not an earnings-related context but Facebook is basically outlining some changes that it is going to be doing to try to control hate speech.They have partnered with the government of France. I just want to bring one line from the release from Facebook, says we have this recent initiative with French regulators to reduce hate speech. We are establishing an independent body which people can use to appeal Facebook decisions, involving potentially offensive content. And as we know, Maria, this has really been a very complicated for Facebook trying to figure out are we a media company, are we a tech company, how do we police some things such as hate speech.So the company outlining at least what it hopes today as we know that stock over the past 52 weeks down around 13 percent. You compare that to the S&P 500 more or less five percent drop in that time. Maria?BARTIROMO: No, you're right. I mean, they've got to speak out about this. This is -- the calls against this is louder and louder every week.BOLTON: That's right. That's right. And now they face fines if they don't comply with Europe GDPR as well, and it's fits in to basically all of these tech companies trying to get along, stay out of trouble at the very least, Maria.BARTIROMO: Deirdre, thank you. We'll check that. Deirdre Bolton on the York Stock Exchange this morning. Coming up. The fate of the U.S.-China trade talks as Huawei charges overshadow a potential deal. What's at stake coming up. And then a post-game celebration that's sparking some rumors this morning. Why Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski have fans raising their eyebrows after their video went viral. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are an hour away from opening of trading this morning. Futures indicating -- really searching for direction. Now all the major indices are lower by a fraction, this after a mixed move on Friday, the Dow and the S&P 500 notched up their 6th week in a row of gains last week. Joining us right now is adviser investments chief investment officer, Jim Lowell. Jim, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.JIM LOWELL, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, ADVISER INVESTMENTS: Absolutely. Good to be here.BARTIROMO: What kind of a 2019 are you expecting for the stock market?LOWELL: Well, we're not going to let --BARTIROMO: A million dollar question, right?LOWELL: Yes. Right. We're not going to let our near-term risk guards down any time soon but we're also not going to take our long-term growth gloves off. The fundamentals continue to support the case for slow growth, not no growth here in the U.S. economy. We don't like to bet against the U.S. consumer, we don't like to bet against the Fed that clearly is interested in safeguarding our economy despite all the known crosscurrents that it's contending with.So we think this is a marketplace that is absolutely perfectly pitched for expert stock selection. We definitely be cautious about buying whole baskets of whole markets here in the established foreign markets and the emerging markets.BARTIROMO: It's about the Fed, right? I mean, the Fed told us that now they're on watch, I mean, they o pivoted. Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari took a positive view on the economy yesterday at a town hall in Minnesota, he said, I think we still have room to run in the U.S. economy. The U.S. economy is fundamentally healthy but we know that had dovish comments from Fed Chief Jay Powell last week and we know that they're considering everything.They may not do any rate hikes this year and they may also back up on that unwind. So that's good news for the market or is it bad news because it indicates a slowing economy?LOWELL: I think it's essentially good news. What the Fed is doing is saying that there is virtually no inflation and if there is a spike in inflation, they're certainly capable of being able to fend it off, even if they don't raise rates again, I think broadcasting a pause gave the market, gave investors the confidence they needed to be able to see through the fear factors into the fundamental issues.Whether it is very low inflation, whether it's economic data continuing to be supportive here especially in terms of growth or even earnings while we're seeing slowing growth in terms of rates of growth. It's still not no earnings growth and many companies are finding especially those catering to consumers finding interesting ways to profit more.ROSCHELLE: Jim, Mitch Roschelle. Earlier, Dagen and I were talking about the phenomenon where year-to-date in 2019, we're seeing the stock market rally and the bond market rally at the same time. Is that a cause for concern or is this the way money flows are patterning out for the first, you know, few weeks of the year?LOWELL: Well, it's a really good question. We definitely follow velocity, momentum of money and we too were surprised to see both asset classes effectively being rewarded one and at the same time. That's it. From an investment management standpoint, I will absolutely almost always have those two oars in the water and hope they help grow a little bit straighter, a little bit faster. For the month of January, they clearly did that said, we don't expect the remaining months of the year to repeat what was a remarkably positive bullish pattern in January.MCDOWELL: But which part of that though, Jim? Stocks or both?LOWELL: I think both. I think it's going to be difficult to be able to fend off some of the issues that are coming down the pike. Fairly quickly we know we could double dip into another partial government shutdown. We know that the stage, the political theater here in the U.S. continues to cast to pull over. Investor confidence hasn't gone so over consumer confidence, at least not yet but we definitely think that inside of any capitalization range here in the U.S. certainly in the mid small caps in Europe and some select emerging markets.There are bargains to be had and profits to be made but it's not going to come as easily as it did we don't think as it did in January.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Jim, good to see you this morning. Thanks so much.LOWELL: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Jim Lowell joining us. Coming up. Trade turmoil. President Trump signals optimism on U.S.-China trade talks but Huawei charges may be posing a threat. What you need to know when will we see a deal? Plus, the fate of Sears. What's in-store for the troubled retailer. It's facing bankruptcy court and a hearing on that today. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Monday, February 4th, your top stories right now 8:31 a.m. on the East Coast. Markets are searching for direction this morning. Check out, on this Super Bowl Monday, Futures indicating a decline at the start of trading now, fractional moves up and down throughout the morning today. Now, we're expecting the Dow to be down about four points at open, the NASDAQ down 4-1/2.In Europe this morning, mixed story, London is up, but the markets in Paris and Germany are lower FT-100 up 13 points, CAC Quarante in Paris down 32, two-thirds of one percent lower in Paris. The Dax Index in Germany down a quarter percent, 31 points lower. Asian markets mostly closed overnight for the Lunar Holiday New Year in China. Japan was up a fraction.Facebook, opening up. The social media giant addressing its many issues in an online post this morning. We're taking a look and breaking it down. The future of Sears on deck; bankruptcy hearings begin today for beleaguered retailer. What will remain for the company's roughly 45,000 employees?Then, the Super Bowl for the record books: The Patriots beat Rams, for their sixth championship victory. Amazon CEO, Washington Post owner, Jeff Bezos, making a cameo in Roger Goodell box as he comes under fire for the paper's big game ad amid lay-offs in the industry. All those stories coming up.But first, our top story this half an hour: China trade and privacy concerns. The March 1st deadline rapidly approaching as Chinese telecom company, Huawei, charges loom overhead. The U.S. Justice Department announcing criminal charges against the Chinese technology giant last week. Joining me right now is Herbold Group Managing Director and former Chief Operating Officer at Microsoft, Bob Herbold. Great to see you, Bob. Thanks so much for joining us.ROBERT HERBOLD, MANAGING DIRECTOR, THE HERBOLD GROUP: Hi, Maria.BARTIROMO: Can you characterize, really, the malfeasance that we're talking about? We speak with a lot of technology and telecom companies and they say right out that, you know, they've had trade secret stolen from Chinese companies like Huawei, like ZTE. I know that Microsoft operating system is used in China, by 90 percent of companies and yet only about one percent actually pay for it.HERBOLD: Yes, it is true. And I think that with the U.S. federal prosecutors becoming involved and opening a case against them, we're going to see more details. And I think the general public is beginning to understand that this is a serious problem. And when they learn about the detailed examples where you see T-Mobile getting ripped off in terms of some their secret technology to test products and the like, I think it's really going to bring the issue home. And Huawei is going to have a huge trust problem and it's going to rub off on China in general, because Huawei is the truly the gem of what they produce to date in terms of global entries.BARTIROMO: Yes, I think this is a really important point that you're making. You know, we had your former colleague, Steve Ballmer, on the show, a couple of months ago -- and he said: "The theft that Chinese companies do of foreign businesses like American technology, cost Microsoft $10 billion a year in profits." I mean, how -- is that a fair -- is that a fair number?HERBOLD: It is a fair number, and the reason why these companies love being in China including Microsoft is that, it's a huge population that has developed quickly in terms of middle-income households. So, it's like growing, you know, two new United States from a consumer standpoint. So, companies have had to be there. With all of that action, on the other hand, I think that the world is about to learn in detail some of these practices and it's a huge issue for the Chinese government that I don't know that they really recognize it, because here they are Huawei, the leader in patents, while on the other hand they violate patents like crazy. So, they simply operate with a different mentality, and it isn't going to work, and I think the rest of the globe is about to unveil some of these practices, in a lot of detail, and people are going to be really surprised.BARTIROMO: Well, this is a really important point that you're making, because if China wants to be on the global stage, in terms of its sophisticated technology in telecom, it needs to convince the rest of the world that we can trust their technology. And with all this espionage going on, you know, they're going cross the world telling African countries: oh, we'll take care of your telecom infrastructure; we've got your back, Poland, on your telecom infrastructure, then we learn that they are spying on some of these trade secrets.HERBOLD: You know, it's not just the spying. The trade part protecting patents is vital to industry -- and that's what spawns, you know, the growth. And, you know, this is a -- this is a trade issue, and if we make the mistake of simply talking about soybeans, in regard to this trade pact that is coming, we're making a huge mistake. Because the trust issue that's going to emerge because of this behavior has to be fixed and it needs to be addressed.BARTIROMO: Well, this is exactly the point. You are absolutely right, because right now, the talk is are we going to do a deal with China where China will buy more soybean, buy more grain and we just leave the I.P. theft and the forced transfer of technology on cutting room floor? A deal without some commitment to stopping theft, isn't that critical? Because look, at the end of the day, isn't it true that they're already winning? I mean, even if they stop stealing I.P. tomorrow, Bob, isn't it true that they are already winning in terms of investing in patents innovation, after all the theft that's gone on over decades?HERBOLD: There's no doubt about it. Not only are they investing; the talent issue is core. Most of the Chinese kids that are getting educated here in our first-class universities are now going back. And so consequently, we can't compete without global talent at that level. It's - - and if you looked at Silicon Valley over the last seven, eight years, 45 percent of the founders of new companies are foreigners. So, we are highly dependent on high-end talent in regard to our economy, and we better realize that. The immigration mess, you know, ignores this issue, and it's pivotal.BARTIROMO: You're right, and so does education. Where are our educators making sure that engineering, and A.I., and robotics are in our schools from a young age? I mean, what's going on with your education policy that -- you look at the lead educators in the world, it's all China. And by the way, you look at the leading banks in the world, the top five are Chinese. So, this is such a big story; we're going to certainly keep on it but we'll see what that deal looks like in terms of the U.S. and China.Bob, I got to switch gears and ask you about social media and privacy in general. Facebook is now celebrating its 15th-year birthday today. This comes as the social media giant has been under fire for privacy concerns of its own over the past few years. One of the reasons China is beating us in all of this, is because of data; who has all the data? Facebook, Google, Apple? What's your take on this?HERBOLD: These companies have two core problems that could ruin them, actually. First of all, they have to realize, they're in the privacy business and if they start, they have to start asking people up front: hey, do you want to participate in this or not; instead of hiding it. And the second thing is: they are media outlets. They talk about eliminating hate speech and having hordes of people that comb through all these posts to see what's good and bad. It's -- they're going to be overwhelmed. They won't accept the fact that they're a media outlet and they're not a technology company.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a great point. All right, now to artificial intelligence. On "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" over on Fox News yesterday, I spoke with the former president of Google China. This is Kai-Fu Lee. He wrote a book on A.I. I want to get your take what industries will change as a result of A.I., but here's what he said about jobs going away. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LEE: A lot of jobs are going to change. Almost all the jobs will change. A.I. is not human intelligence, it's not magic; it's just a tool that can, in one domain, take a lot of data and make very smart decisions, better than people. So, the more the routine job, the more A.I. will take over. So routine white-collar jobs like, customer service, telemarketing, and loan officers, and tellers, and jobs like that will be the first to be challenged. Then, repetitive blue-collar jobs like dishwasher, assembly line workers, and a little bit later, drivers also will be challenged, so altogether, it's going to be large number of jobs that will be displaceable by A.I. in next 15 years.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: This is fascinating stuff. 15 years, Bob, how do you see it?HERBOLD: Well, I think he's right. The low-hanging fruit is what we will really pay for artificial intelligence. You hear so many stories, where in fact, we're going to duplicate human mind and the like -- no, that's not where the real impact is. He is correct, that it's the standard kind of jobs that require minimal kinds of training and skills that can be picked up by technology and integrated so that they're being carried out without humans.And it's going to be, you know, quite significant -- and in fact, it is already significant but it will continue to grow. And you know, we talk about bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. and the like, it's not going to be like the old days. Manufacturing is going to change, it is changing very significantly and to a certain extent, we're wasting time talking about traditional jobs coming back to America because traditional jobs are disappearing.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, we're going to keep talking about this, Bob, we so appreciate your insights on the subject, thank you.HERBOLD: Sure, thanks.BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon. Bob Herbold joining us there. Coming up, the all-stars of the Super Bowl and it was not just the Patriots. Stuart Varney tells who the real winners were, that's up next. And then, a moment from Tom Brady's postgame celebration, featuring Rob Gronkowski. We'll tell you why it's raising some eyebrows this morning right here. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, the star of last night's Super Bowl may not have even played in the game. Joining us now, the host of "VARNEY & COMPANY," Stuart Varney, to talk more about that. Hi, Stu!STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Maria, I know you want to talk about profits and the market, and China trade, and all the rest of it, but I want to talk about Gladys Knight, OK? A lot of people declined to sing the National Anthem at last night's Super Bowl, but Gladys Knight accepted the invitation, and I thought stole the show. She's 74 years old and she performed absolutely magnificently. She said she did it to unify people and I think it worked.By the way, on our show, last Friday, we had a professional gambler who was placing bets on the length of the national anthem. There was a line, 107 seconds. If it went below 107 seconds, or whether it went over 107 seconds, our guy was betting that it went over. Well, it did go over. It was more like 120 seconds of really good singing of our great national anthem. And Gladys Knight in my opinion was the star of the show. And when she done, I went to bed.BARTIROMO: I agree. That was the best part of the show.VARNEY: Yes, that's it. And besides, I really can't stay up that late, and I didn't need to because I'm told it was a very boring game.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, that's what we are hearing this morning. But, you know, some people just expected them to win, and like, you know, they won, so good for them.VARNEY: Yes, good for them. I love The Patriots, by the way. I've got family in Massachusetts. And you don't, OK. We'll leave that alone.BARTIROMO: I'm happy for them they won, they deserve it. They are -- they keep winning. And it's my friend, Dagen, here who is not happy about this at all.VARNEY: Maria, you are fair and balanced.BARTIROMO: Thank you.MCDOWELL: How much butt smooching does Tom Brady need? He's got six Super Bowl rings and a hot wife.BARTIROMO: Oh, come on.MCDOWELL: Go home.BARTIROMO: Quit your crying. They won. They deserved it.MCDOWELL: I'm not crying. I'm crying for The Saints that got robbed.BARTIROMO: Well, that's true.MCDOWELL: I'm crying for the Kansas City Chiefs who should have been in the big show, because they would have put on a great game. These two, the offense has never showed up. Neither the Rams nor the Patriots.VARNEY: Dagen, I'm surprised at you. Can't you join in the general unity around congratulating Gladys Knight on a spectacular performance?MCDOWELL: No, no. I agree with that. That was before the -- that was before the coin toss, wasn't it?VARNEY: I think you better get back to discussing profits and the economy and the markets.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: We know you'll have more in 10 minutes, Stu. We'll see you then.VARNEY: You will.BARTIROMO: A quiet, quiet morning this morning. "VARNEY & COMPANY" begins top of the hour 9:00 a.m. Eastern. Don't forget, half of Asia is closed for the New Year, the Chinese New Year. So, it is a quiet morning this morning. We are expecting a mixed opening for the broader averages. Coming up though, future of Sears on deck. We are breaking down what's at stake for the troubled retailer. It's preparing for bankruptcy and the hearing is today. Plus this, spotted at the Super Bowl, Amazon CEO and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos was there making a cameo in Roger Goodell's box. He's coming under fire for the paper's big game ad amid lay-offs in his business. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Legendary fund manager Bill Gross announcing he's retiring. Lauren Simonetti with the details there. Lauren?LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hi, Maria. Janus Henderson Investors announcing that 74-year-old Bill Gross will retire on March 1st. Gross co-founded PIMCO, the world's largest bond fund manager and he joined Janus in 2014. He now plans to focus on managing his personal assets as well as a private charitable foundation.A last ditch effort to save Sears takes place today in bankruptcy court. Chairman Eddie Lampert is trying to buy the retailers' remaining assets which include 425 stores. It's the only chance to save up to 45,000 jobs and keep the 133-year-old retailer in business. But Lampert's rescue bid, it's opposed by creditors who want the company shut down and liquidated.The New England Patriots taking down the L.A. Rams to win Super Bowl LIII. It was the 6th Super Bowl win for Tom Brady. He posted this video with Rob Gronkowski possibly hinting at Gronk's return next season. Gronk looks like he's weighing the option before smiling and a nod of his head. Maybe he's not yet ready to retire as many have speculated, but basically, he's put together with duct tape at this point.Well, The Washington Post under fire by the company's union for the expensive ad it ran during last night's Super Bowl.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When our nation is threatened, there is someone to gather the facts. To bring you the story no matter the cost.(END VIDEO CLIP)SIMONETTI: But a union leader at the post criticized the cost of this ad, tweeting, "The Post is now paying, say, 5 million for 30 seconds, to tout journalistic freedom during one of the glitziest, and given the NFL's knee- taking protests and concussions more controversial sports events in our country." Washington Post owner and Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos was seen at the game last night in Roger Goodell's box.Adam Levine's Half Time performance has gotten a lot of attention especially his wardrobe malfunction, the tank top he wore has sparked a flurry of memes that compared to a coach pillow. One person wrote, "My 12 year old coach wore it better." Ouch. And then, take a look at this. Someone found the same pattern on their curtains. That's like exactly the same pattern. Look at that. 13 minutes of your favorite, Dagen, Adam Levine.BARTIROMO: Wow. Wow. When he took off his shirt, I was like, whoa, I mean, I wasn't expecting that. Were you?MCDOWELL: No.ROSCHELLE: Now, we're focusing back on the shirt and the fact that he wasn't wearing the shirt. I think that's an upgrade from focusing on the shirt.CARTER: I mean, it's something to talk about. Otherwise, we'd be talking about other things. So .BARTIROMO: That's true. Well, then that was the point. Then, he did a good job.CARTER: I guess. That's what you want them to be talking about, right?BARTIROMO: Some of the songs were good. Some of the songs were good. Come on, admit it.MCDOWELL: They do not have the performance cred to hold a Super Bowl Half Time Show to headline it. They just don't. The Foo Fighters were down there playing. They should have just called it audible at the last minute, and said, we know you're going to stink, Adam Levine. Let's get Dave Grohl and crew out here. Because they can tear a house down.BARTIROMO: How about -- was it -- bigboy?CARTER: Oh, boy. Oh, boy. That fur coat.BARTIROMO: With the fur coat, right?CARTER: That was something to behold.BARTIROMO: That was wild.CARTER: I was like, did they get my grandma's fur coat out and have it --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: That was a look.(LAUGHTER)MCDOWELL: Girl, you want to get me talking about fur, really?BARTIROMO: No.CARTER: No. No. Sorry. Backing it up. Back it up.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: And why would you wear a fur coat on the -- on the Super Bowl?MCDOWELL: I have -- I wouldn't wear one in private.BARTIROMO: You wouldn't wear one anyway, neither would I.MCDOWELL: No.CARTER: I'm tone deaf.BARTIROMO: Still ahead, final thoughts from this all-star panel right here. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Great show, you guys.CARTER: Great show.MCDOWELL: Always, love you.BARTIROMO: Have a great day. Love you back. Go seize the day, everybody. Thanks for joining us. We'll see you again tomorrow. "VARNEY & COMPANY" begins right now.Load-Date: February 4, 2019End of Document

Cornyn, Baldwin, Crapo, Brown Bill Will Protect Rail and Bus Manufacturing From China ThreatTargeted News ServiceMarch 15, 2019 Friday 7:23 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 749 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, issued the following news release:***- China's "Made in 2025" initiative targets dominance in rail and bus manufacturing. Bill prevents federal transit funds from being used to purchase Chinese rail and bus assets.***U.S. Senators John Cornyn (R-TX) and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) today introduced the Transit Infrastructure Vehicle Security Act, which would prevent federal funds from being used by transit agencies to purchase rail cars or buses manufactured by Chinese owned, controlled, or subsidized companies. Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee Chairman, Senator Mike Crapo (R-ID), and Ranking Member, Sherrod Brown (D-OH), are original cosponsors of the legislation."China poses a clear and present danger to our national security and has already infiltrated our rail and bus manufacturing industries," Sen. Cornyn said. "The threat to our national security through the exploitation of our transportation and infrastructure sectors is one we should take seriously. This legislation will help safeguard against this threat, and I'm thankful for the support of my colleagues.""China has made clear its intent to dismantle U.S. railcar manufacturing in its 'Made in China 2025' plan--our economic and national security demands that we address Chinese attempts to dominate industries that build our nation's critical infrastructure," said Sen. Baldwin. "That's why I'm joining my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to introduce legislation to hold China accountable because we need to do all we can to support American workers and American-made products.""This strong bipartisan bill protects federal dollars from being spent on Chinese buses and railcars, and improves cybersecurity in public transportation," said Sen. Brown. "Federal dollars should not support Chinese state-controlled enterprises that want to undermine U.S. manufacturers and overtake our supply chain that supports rail and bus manufacturing."Background:The Chinese government continues to use a range of state subsidies and predatory practices to support its market ascension in certain sectors of the United States' economy. Two of these sectors, rail manufacturing and bus manufacturing, are included as part of China's "Made in China 2025" initiative, a plan targeting global dominance in areas that the Chinese government considers most strategic to its global aims.Chinese state-owned and state-supported enterprises have used subsidized "bargain prices" well-below competitive market price to win contracts throughout the United States. A number of large, metropolitan areas have recently awarded rail rolling stock procurements to a Chinese state-owned enterprise. There are a number of threats these procurements pose including impeding economic competitiveness and overtaking the supply chains that support United States public transportation agencies. Chinese state-owned and state-supported enterprises have increased security vulnerabilities and create new risks for rolling stock procurements.Specifically, the Transit Infrastructure Vehicle Security Act would prevent federal transit funds from being used by transit agencies to procure Chinese rail assets and ensure transit agencies develop and execute a cybersecurity plan.* Limitation on Certain Rolling Stock Procurements: This legislation prevents federal transit dollars from being used to award a contract or subcontract for the procurement of passenger rail cars or transit buses to Chinese state-owned, controlled or subsidized enterprises. The bill would create a certification process for transit agencies to ensure their funds are not being used to purchase rolling stock from a covered manufacturer. A narrow exception would be made for transportation agencies with a pre-existing contract or subcontract with a covered rail rolling stock manufacturer executed prior to the date of enactment.* Cybersecurity Certification: Given the level of technology and growing complexity of rail rolling stock assets, it is important that proper cybersecurity standards are in place. This legislation would require any transit operator that operates rail transit service to develop and execute a plan for identifying and reducing cybersecurity risks. Recipients of federal transit assistance would be required to review best practices and to identify any hardware and software components of new rolling stock assets that should undergo third-party testing.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6652305 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 16, 2019End of Document

Renault To Replace Carlos Ghosn As CEO, Chair; Google Is Fined $57 Million Under Europe's Data Privacy Law; World Economic Forum; Leaders Absent from Davos; Henry Schein CEO on Health Care in AmericaMORNINGS WITH MARIA MORNINGS WITH MARIA 12:00 AM ESTJanuary 22, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; DomesticLength: 7313 wordsByline: Maria Bartiromo, Dagen McDowell, Cheryl Casone, Dani Klupenger, Stuart VarneyGuests: Lindsey Bell, Glenn Youngkin, Scott Minerd, David Abney, Stanley BergmanBodyANNOUNCER: Live from Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic Forum, here is Maria Bartiromo with a special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA.MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back. And good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us live this morning from Davos, Switzerland. I'm Maria Bartiromo and we are happy you are with us. It is Tuesday, January 22nd. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Markets are open after the long holiday weekend. Back open this morning at about an hour and half.We are expecting a decline at the start of trading this morning. The Dow Industrials set to open down about 15 points, two-thirds of one percent. The S&P 500 is also down two-thirds of a percent. And the NASDAQ with a decline of 52 points, down three quarters of one percent. Global markets are also lower. European Indices down across the board. FT-100 down 31, CAC quarante down 26 and the DAX Index in Germany down 57 at last check.Asia overnight declines across the board, worst performer China. Shanghai Composite down better than one percent on some economic data once again shower a weaker than expected showing in the economy in China. Meanwhile, back in the U.S., we are now in day 32 of the shutdown showdown. President Trump holding firm in his position to secure a border wall funding. The stalemate preventing him from coming here for the World Economic Forum as well as his cabinet. He's not alone uncertainty across Europe forcing many leaders to stay home as you can see there.Well, Renault coming up with a replacement plan. The automaker set to unveil a succession plan for Carlos Ghosn who remains in a Japanese jail. Google is under fire this morning. The technology giant find by Europe under its new privacy law. How much it's paying up coming up. All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me in New York, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell and CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey bell. Good morning, ladies.LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Good morning.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria Bartiromo. You had some incredible guest starting at with the panel this morning from Davos but Kevin Hassett you had on from the White House and one thing that stuck out to me was he was talking about fourth quarter growth and how it's going to likely come in at three percent, three percent plus for last year, but investors don't care.That's looking at the last quarter. They care about the shutdown that's going on in Washington and Lindsey was talking about this is not the kind of like restrain how the economy is not going to bounce back maybe later on like you would after a hurricane. This is money as Lindsey -- we were talking about privately, this is money that's not going to get spent.BELL: Yes. This is now the fifth week of this shutdown. This is going on for so long. You're just losing consumer spending on things like meals out just discretionary spending and that's really going to hit GDP especially in the first quarter and you might get some of that with the payback in the second quarter but you're not going to get all of that.BARTIROMO: Yes. I think that's really good point because there is no disposable income to do that, go out to dinner and go spend money on entertainment which of course has been a big driver of growth.BELL: Absolutely, and I think that especially when you think about the numbers here in U.S., you are entering a slower growth period from a profitability standpoint for U.S. companies. You're also seeing a slowdown. Sure. I know Hassett pointing to industrial production which was a strong number, it's a leading indicator here but the weakness in the stock market and consumer confidence and business and confidence does stand out and it's just a matter of time before that confidence turns into spending at corporations and within the consumer.BARTIROMO: Well, yes. The uncertainty is real and when you have uncertainty typically people sit on their hands, they sit on cash as do companies and that global growth story is our focus this morning right now as we look at the markets lower as the partial government shutdown enters day 32. We're expecting the Dow Industrials to open down about 140 points today. The S&P down 15 and the NASDAQ down 47.Earlier today during my penal here at World Economic Forum, Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio weighed in on the growth and implications for monetary policy importantly.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RAY DALIO, FOUNDER, BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES: The question really is when the monetary policy is denominated one's own currency. These are all cycles. The cycle like in China, they -- I agree, it's one of those cycles people pay attention to but they have the power, the datas in their currency. They can handle that cycle. But there is a weakening there. There is a slow uncertainty, a substandard growth rate in Europe and in the United States, there will be a significant slowing in that particularly period which should warrant an easier monetary policy.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And he said that he's not expecting the Federal Reserve and h doesn't think the Federal Reserve should raise interest rates at all in 2019 given the backdrop. Joining me right now is the co-CEO Carlyle Group, Glenn Youngkin is with us here. Glenn, it's good to see you again.GLENN YOUNGKIN, CO-CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, THE CARLYLE GROUP: Good morning. I guess -- I guess good afternoon.BARTIROMO: Good afternoon here in Europe. That's for sure. Look, you own what? Invested in 250 companies, you've two $212 billion in assets under management, you've got 70 billion of that already in the ground companies that you already own already. So tell us what you're seeing from this incredible vantage point from these 250 companies that you own. Are they slowing down?YOUNGKIN: Yes. I think global growth is absolutely slowing, but it's not stalling and I think this is where the market is being a little bit schizophrenic. What we see throughout the globe today is growth, but not at the pace we saw last year. The biggest change I think is in China. And in the fourth quarter and we've seen the data, our company data would suggest that China slowed a little bit even more than what was suggested in the official data in the fourth quarter.Although we did see some recovery in December. China is dealing with something very new which is a consumer-driven slowdown in growth and one of the great recognitions is that China which used to be this big export economy is really driven by this giant consumer class that's been created over the last 20 years. And that consumer class is nervous. They're nervous for all the same reasons that other people in the world are nervous and that's reflecting itself from the Chinese economy.BARTIROMO: I think this is such an important point that you made because for those of us who have studied China, we know China as the export behemoth of the world. That's why the air stinks in terms of the air quality by the way because they are producing products for the world and they've got factories spewing out pollution. And one of the issues is turning that economy and this is like turning a huge cruise ship from an export economy to a consumer-led economy and they're doing it.YOUNGKIN: They are doing it. Although now they're having to deal with all the same things that the U.S. deals with which is consumer confidence. And when you have a trade war and everybody has access to headlines today over the internet, the consumer can get worried. And in the fourth quarter the consumer in China was worried.BARTIROMO: You've been a big investor in energy I know that. Tell us where you see growth in the world. Where are your most important investments right now?YOUNGKIN: Yes. The latest data coming out of the global oil industry and particularly the forecasters for demand. The demand is in fact increasing and the reason why demand is increasing generally is the globe is still growing. And that puts a larger demand on overall energy usage. We still see a tremendous opportunity in natural gas around the world. It is the transition fuel of the future.And while we also see great growth opportunities in renewable fuels around the world particularly wind and solar. Natural gas will be the transition fuel for a long time. And so right now with equities beaten down and capital actually not going into the traditional energy industry, we see some great value.BARTIROMO: Are there values in retail? Another area of your investment. What are you seeing on retail?YOUNGKIN: Well, retail, we own -- we own a number of very successful retail players. And the key to -- the key to great retail today is innovation, digital offense. And in fact doing it differently than it's been done historically. And so who can -- who can truly displace their traditional way retail was done and that's -- those are the companies we've been investing in.BARTIROMO: Are you waiting, sitting on cash for a bit now as you assess the performance of your portfolio now that you have already invested in or are you poised to put new money to work? Or with these uncertainties, government shutdown included, would you be poised to sit on cash?YOUNGKIN: Yes. So, remember Maria when we are entrusted with capital, we have five and six years to invest it. So there is no pressure at all. And over the last four years, we set a goal to raise a hundred billion dollars, we'll finished it up this year in 2019. And that capital is ready to be invested where there's no pressure. And so in a year where we expect the economy to in fact define itself and we're a little bit more favorable I think than it's fashionable to be.BARTIROMO: They're bullish on the U.S. economy.YOUNGKIN: Yes. Well, the United States economy is in really good shape. Listen, it could change if we don't see some progress on trade with China and the government shutdown because those have the real ability to turn people's optimism into pessimism, but the underpinnings for the U.S. economy are quite good. Now, as I said, the big challenge of course is markets are volatile.And so that creates buying opportunities for us when we see a company that we think we'd like to buy today but it's a bit overvalued and all of a sudden the opportunity present itself.BARTIROMO: Was there an impact so far of the government shutdown -- do you expect this government shutdown to have a real impact?YOUNGKIN: In the grand scheme of things, no. I do think that -- again, we're blessed we get to own companies for four, five, six, seven years, sometimes 10 years we can stay invested in a company. And so it happens over 30-day period or a 60-day period. It really isn't going to impact the outcome. We do actually see all of the topics that were discussed earlier. So particularly in Washington where I live where a lot of these Federal workers that are furloughed or working without pay live, we're seeing the economy impacted.But we're very hopeful that the pressure is buildings. We've got another pay cycle coming where these workers are going to miss another paycheck. And you can see the temperature turning up between the White House and Congress.BARTIROMO: So is there any reason to believe this shutdown could end this week?YOUNGKIN: I don't believe it's going to end this week.BARTIROMO: You don't?YOUNGKIN: But I'm here and the latest that I heard last week was they felt like they were not a week away.BARTIROMO: Real quick because this came up in a panel. I thought it was a very interesting that Dr. Fang (ph) who is the regulator who runs the financial services industry in China said that the U.S. bond market has been a very good place to invest. And they're not looking to lower that, their investment in U.S. bonds. But you've got to sort of question what China is going to do with all the securities it owns of the U.S.'s debt at a time when the U.S. has to continue selling more debt and that we're having this trade spat.YOUNGKIN: That's all true.BARTIROMO: Do you worry about that?YOUNGKIN: That's all true. But first, just remember, you and I can invest in an overnight money market fund that will earn two percent or we can go buy the German 10-bundes bond for 30 basis points. So the Chinese government is smart. And that's a pretty easy trade which is I'm going to put capital in dollars where I can get a return or I can earn nothing in the next -- the next most liquid securities which are euro based.And so this is also driven a lot by just basic economics. The returns in U.S. debt are more attractive than the returns of other places.BARTIROMO: Would you put more money in Europe right now given the issues?YOUNGKIN: Well, we believe that Europe right now is really going through its toughest patch and it has everything to do with confidence again. So two big factors, big export economy, their export -- they're the leading exporter to a factor of two to one to United States to emerging markets and you have China -- you have China's growth slowing.BARTIROMO: India, Brazil?YOUNGKIN: And so -- yes. So it's not terribly surprising that Germany had a tough fourth quarter. Couple that with Brexit and the Italian issues and the confidence in Europe has really slowed when you saw the GDP numbers. With that said we're long-term bullish on Europe. The quality of the companies. the ability to grow companies outside Europe and expand them around the world and the values that you can pay today in Europe are pretty attractive.BARTIROMO: Glenn, it's great to have you on the program.YOUNGKIN: All right. Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us, Glenn Youngkin. He's the CEO -- co-CEO of the Carlyle Group. Coming up. Google is under fire. The technology giant fined by European regulators under its new privacy law. How much Google will pay up next? And then a leadership shakeup. Renault's board of directors announcing plan to replace ousted Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn this Thursday. The very latest there coming up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Now this, French automaker Renault reportedly naming a successor to Carlos Ghosn. Cheryl Casone with the details now in New York. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, Maria. Well, Renault's Chairman and CEO Carlos Ghosn remains behind bars. The Wall Street Journal is now reporting this morning that Renault is going to replace him with its deputy CEO Thierry Bollore on Thursday. Michelin CEO Jean-Dominique Senard will reportedly will take over the chairmanship of the company at the same time.Now, by removing Ghosn, Renault is going to look to continue it's two- decade alliance with Nissan Motors. Ghosn who's also as you know the former chairman of Nissan has been detained since November 19th on multiple charges in Japan including underreporting his pay. he remains in a Tokyo jail this morning and denies all allegations.Well, the European Union has imposed a record fine on Google regulators -- excuse me, on Google. Regulators alleging that Google didn't go far enough to get consent from users to gather data for targeted advertising. This is the biggest penalty imposed the European privacy law. Now Google still needs to fix the problem. If they don't, regulators have the nuclear option of ordering them to stop transferring data completely out of E.U.Big story here. Here's Alphabet, that's the parent company of Google and stock is slightly lower over the past year. All right. We're getting a lot more earnings in this morning, folks. Travelers has just reported an adjusted profit of 2.13 per share, that did beat estimates. The insurer posting revenues 7.8 billion. They topped expectations there on revenue as well. That stock has dropped 10 percent in the last 12 months but certainly a stock to watch in the premarket today. It's getting some positive news.And then Halliburton has estimates for its quarterly profit after higher demands for oil filled services in its international markets, not domestic. The company posted adjusted profit 41 cents per share. Revenue coming in, 5.94 million. Also that beat the street's estimates. Stock slightly lower as you can see in the premarket down more than -11/4 percent. They did report a slowdown in North America. That is their largest market by sales we should say. And those are your headlines and a lot of earnings news crossing the tape, Maria. Back to you in, Davos.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl. Thanks so much. And we're looking at a lower opening for the broader averages. We're focused on the Federal Reserve next. We'll take a look what's at stake as global growth concerns away on the markets. We've got chief investment officer of Guggenheim Partners up next. Scott Minerd is here. Then I'll sit down with the CEO of UPS, David Abney. Get his take on his company's plans for growth as well as what the transportation sector tell us about the economy today. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets were under selling pressure this morning. Take a look at futures indicating a decline at the start of trading about 150 points on the Dow Jones Industrial average. A little less than that. We are certainly off lows off of the lows of the morning down 145 on the Dow, down 16 on the S&P and down 49 on the NASDAQ. Some concerns over global growths this morning slowing down after a long holiday weekend of course, markets closed yesterday for the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday.Going into the New Year, monetary policy a big focused. Here is Bridgewater Associates Ray Dalio and UBS Chairman Axel Weber a few minutes ago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DALIO: What scares the most longer term is that we have limitations to monetary policy which is our most valuable tool. We have important limitations to the effectiveness of that. At the same time as we have greater political and social antagonism. So the next downturn in the economy worries me the most.AXEL WEBER, CHAIRMAN, UBS: If you look at monetary policy easing which is -- if you look at the room to maneuver the only central bank that has any room to maneuver is actually the Federal Reserve. If you look at traditional policy movies by the Fed, they lower rates, very frequently and relatively large steps of 50 basis points. The Fed can do a number of interest rate steps down if need be.So I'm not worried about room to maneuver short term but as Ray also said, given that we've had so long rates for long the market hasn't really priced in much higher rates if anything the Fed has come towards neutral, they're not quite that neutral but they're close to it. And so going back down is an emergency measure they can take.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now to talk more about that is Guggenheim Partners Chief Investment Officer Scott Minerd. And Scott, it is always a pleasure to see you.SCOTT MINERD, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, GUGGENHEIM PARTNERS: It's great to be here.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. I want to talk about this because we were having a conversation about this earlier, myself along with Dagen McDowell and Lindsey Bell who were in New York and we're going to get to them momentarily. The Fed having kept rates at such rock-bottom levels zero percent for so long did not give us any wiggle room, if in fact we were to see a downturn.OK. So the Fed raised rates a couple times but you don't have a lot of moves should the face-- Fed have to be forced to ease? And Ray Dalio thinks they're going to have to cut rates at some point.MINERD: Well, I agree with Ray. I mean, well, we might get another rate hike or two in here, maybe three. The reality is we're very close to the zero bound. And if we did get into a recession history shows us it takes about 5-1/2 percentage points of rate reduction to get the economy going. Well, Maria, the only answer is go back and do more quantitative easing.BARTIROMO: Oh god. Having said that you said earlier that you - you're getting more bullish as you're here in Davos. Tell me about that.MINERD: Well, I mean, it's interesting. Last year I was here, stocks were making new highs, everybody was very bullish and we all know that by February what a mess we were in. And, you know, I've come to view this as sort of a contra indicator. The tone here is very negative, kind of dour.(CROSSTALK)MINERD: It is. And, you know, yet, I look at earnings are higher today than they were a year ago. P.E. multiples are lower and stocks are lower. So what's wrong? I mean, I think that ultimately, you know, now that the Federal Reserve has awaken to the fact that, you know, we might be having some pressure with the Fed on hold, you know, with China cutting rates again, reducing reserve requirements. You know, I think we're going to reignite the bull.BARTIROMO: So you would be -- you would be buying stocks here?MINERD: I think so. It's, you know, I think in the next six to nine months you will be happy you bought them here.BARTIROMO: Dagen, jump in here. You heard Scott.MCDOWELLL: Hey, Scott. It's Dagen. But it seems like the market has been unnerved by -- not only the Federal Reserve in recent history but by higher longer term interest rates as a response of what the Federal Reserve might do. How much of a -- on the 10-year yield, what can market bear because again we got close to that 3-1/4 percent mark on the 10-year and the market -- the stock market, the bottom fell out of it.So is that -- do you use that as a buy signal for stocks or sell signal for stocks? What can we handle as nation in a market?MINERD: Dagen, it's been too long since I talked to you. You know, I think, that long-term rates, I've always been of the opinion that somewhere around 3-1/4, that was it. We don't really have a lot of room to above that. And, you know, when you look at where short-term rates are today, our work shows that if you get short term rates up to around three percent, given how much debt we have on corporate balance sheets that we will start to see some serious cash flow issues in some of these companies that have taken on a lot of leverage.So I don't think we have much upside risk at all for rates at this point and given that, I think that's why the Fed should be patient in terms of raising rates because it doesn't want to slow this economy too quickly or we're going to be dealing with the issues that Ray was talking about.BARTIROMO: So where is the best place to allocate capital for you right now?MINERD: Well, I mean, short term if you're a trader. I like equities. That's a great place to be. If you are a long-term investor I think it's a great time to go to quality and looking at a lot of high quality sort of 10-year sort of bonds because as Dagen was saying we don't really have a lot of room to the upside in rates. And being able to lock in something close to three percent is probably a pretty good play for people that are investors over next five to 10 years.BARTIROMO: Yes. If you could lock in three percent over the short term, why not? That would take money away from equities.MINERD: Well, and that's why I think, Maria, what we were seeing is that interest rates are rising. Suddenly I had people telling me how great it was to own short-term investments in treasury securities and I thought to myself, boy, this is creating a lot of competition from retail for equities.BARTIROMO: Exactly. Scott, it's great to have you on the show.MINERD: It's always great --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. Scott Minerd, the CIO at Guggenheim. Quick break and then the big business of shipping. What shipping tells us. Amazon could be delivering some competition to UPS. I'll be talking with the CEO of UPS, David Abney is here.Then healthcare in America. Henry Schein CEO Stanley Bergman joins me to talk about drug pricing and shake-ups within the sector. Back in a moment. A lot to come. First though, a special update from the Tennis Channel.DANI KLUPENGER, TENNIS CHANNEL COURT REPORTER: Welcome back to another Tennis Channel Court Report for Fox Business. I'm Dani Klupenger. Danielle Collins' dream run at the Australian Open continues on day nine in Melbourne.The American fought back from a set down against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova to punch her ticket into her first major semifinal. Collins headed down under without a main draw victory at the slams.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DANIELLE COLLINS, AMERICAN TENNIS PLAYER: Yes. My first time playing on Rod Laver and I didn't even practice on here before, so this was quite the experience and I absolutely love it. All the Australian fans have really made me feel at home here and it's just an incredible atmosphere to play in. So thank you so much to everybody that came out and supported me today.(END VIDEO CLIP)KLUPENGER: And don't forget Tennis Channel's live coverage of the Australian Open continues, Tuesday at 6:00 p.m. Eastern. I'm Dani Klupenger.ANNOUNCER: Here again is Maria Bartiromo with the special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA live from Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic Forum.BARTIROMO: Welcome back from Switzerland. Thanks so much for joining us, it is Tuesday, January 22nd. Your top stories right now 8:32 a.m. on the East Coast.Markets once again opening today after a long holiday weekend. Markets were closed yesterday and we are beginning on the downside. Markets are expected to be lower at the start of trading this morning. Dow Industrials right now showing a decline of 145 points on futures, S&P 500 down 17, NASDAQ down 50 points, that three quarters of one percent. European indices are lower across the board. They are off of their lows, but still nonetheless down 35 points on the FT-100, down 19 points on the CAC Quarante in Paris, and down 46 points on the DAX Index in Germany. Asian markets closed lower across the board. The worst performer was China, Shanghai Composite down better than one percent on some weak economic data coming out of China last week.Back in the U.S., it is day 32 of the shutdown showdown, the standoff over the border wall funding, keeping President Trump from attending the World Economic Forum in Davos. The State of the Union still unclear. It is scheduled for one week from today, but now FOX News is reporting that one senior congressional official says they are standing by to stand by. We'll see. We'll get news on the State of the Union.The top leaders in business are here focusing on the key issues facing the world, including growth. My panel this morning opened up the conference. Global economic risk was what the subject was. Bridgewater Associates Founder, Ray Dalio, talked about how he saw growth in the United States and in the -- and in Europe as well.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DALIO: There is a weakening there, there is a slow -- a slowing, certainly a substandard growth rate in Europe. And in the United States, there will be a significant slowing in that particular period which should warrant an easier monetary policy.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: He is expecting that the Fed will have not a lot of room to raise interest rates at all this year, and perhaps at some point this year or next, the Fed will have to lower interest rates. We'll have implements more from this morning "Panel" coming up this morning.But first our top story this half an hour. Increasing efficiency, UPS developing a new super hub, that's a new strategy, to meet global shipping demand. The company implementing artificial intelligence across the United States to streamline output. Joining me right now is the CEO of UPS, David Abney. And David, it is good to have you on the program.A new super hub, that's a new strategy, to meet global shipping demand. The company implementing artificial intelligence across United States to streamline output. Joining me right now is the CEO of UPS, David Abney. And Dagen, it is good to have you on the program.DAVID ABNEY, CEO, UPS: Thank you. Glad to be here.BARTIROMO: And when we talk about this hub, you are truly facilitating a new day for small and medium sized businesses. Tell us about that.ABNEY: Yes. This sub is really signed to expedite into -- enable these small and midsized businesses to where -- with today's technology, they can really compete with markets all over the world, prior to the -- to go back a while, they couldn't do that, and so this hub is just part of the start, but it's our focus on small and midsized businesses, it is providing alternatives to these customers to where they can compete we the large --BARTIROMO: NO, it's interesting because, you know, a small and midsized company may not have the funds, or the economic backdrop to have a warehouse tell us how.ABNEY: Right.BARTIROMO: So, tell me how that works in a practical way.ABNEY: You know, that is a perfect example. More and more the competition is having to deal with being able to deliver to their consumers within two days. That's much easier for larger companies that have distribution centers all over the U.S. or throughout the world. It was almost impossible for small and midsized we just introduced a product that's called where to go. And it really is -- we're all broker between people that have warehouse space all across country or the world.And then these smaller companies that need to store inventories so they can compete and it has gotten off to a great start. And we just think that's part of what we're doing to this segment.BARTIROMO: Well, shipping is such an integral part of the economy. It is an indicator in terms of where things are, so what would you say in terms of this global slowdown that everyone is talking about now? Are we slowing down in U.S.?ABNEY: I think we have to be very careful. I think sometimes people can start to build bad news on top of bad news. Really, you know, I'll just give you an example of the peak season that we just finished through December, retail is being estimated across the market to have increased 5.6 percent. That doesn't really sound like a slowdown to me. All in line retail, 17, 18 percent.BARTIROMO: Wow. That's a good number.ABNEY: So again, healthy, healthy numbers. And we think the U.S. economy has held up reasonably strong. Internationally, there are headwinds, of course, and trade-related issues, but still, when you hear news that there's a slowdown, there's talk about one or two-tenths of a percent, so it's really not the kind of news that some people are taking it much further.BARTIROMO: It sounds like you are pretty pleased with fourth quarter shipping numbers and what you saw in retail.ABNEY: You know, from a market standpoint, we absolutely were that we saw that kind of growth. In our network, we have our earnings called next week and I'll talk being about our specific numbers.BARTIROMO: Of course.ABNEY: What I can tell you though is we just had outstanding service levels during this peak, equal to what we were able to do in the regular part of the year and we were able to answer our customer's needs, so from a service standpoint, just absolutely fantastic peak.BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, Amazon is influenced, continues to grow. The online giant ramping up its own transpacific shipping service reportedly sending nearly five million cartons of consumer goods from China to the United States over the past year. What's your assessment of that?ABNEY: You know, I really can't tell you exactly amazon's volume from any part of the country over, I can tell you that there are good customer of ours we work close together. But people can associate Amazon with e- commerce and e-commerce is a lot more than just Amazon. You have the other big retailers, but it's really those just hundreds of thousands of small and midsized etailers that has allowed us to really be the e-commerce vendor of choice, and we will continue to do that through our product portfolio and through our technology.BARTIROMO: Well, congratulations for that. Let me -- let me ask you about that because the real market has become so bifurcated, right? I mean you see some areas, like the mall areas, not doing so well. But then those etailers you talk about are actually seeing double-digit increases in terms of volume. What's behind that? Is this just consumer preferences in terms of how to shop and how to buy?ABNEY: You know, I believe this is going to continue to increase e- commerce and it's just so convenient for many people using their mobile device, to just order whatever they are interested in getting, and that is why we're putting such an emphasis. And so when we talk e-commerce, let me give you a couple of stats from a European small and midsized businesses. Only five percent export. And you would think it should be much higher than from the U.S., one percent of small and midsized businesses, export, that's why trade agreements are so important they would benefit small and midsized. And it's also why technology and technology that we can provide them will be helpful to increase their export.BARTIROMO: So what you're saying is there's a tremendous on the horizon for these companies. If that's the think of volume you're talking about, you're saying perhaps -- these numbers will go up.ABNEY: I do believe that there's be much higher for the small retailers and that's why these -- when we talk about trade agreements, then just the most recent one, the U.S., Mexico, Canada, agreement, the larger companies know how to export, you know, from country to the other. The real benefit in this U.S., was these small and midsized companies, and when NAFTA was originally negotiated, there was no ecommerce. So, people didn't refer to it inside. And this agreement has got specific -- got a specific chapter around that.BARTIROMO: Yes.ABNEY: So, it's a step in the right direction.BARTIROMO: Even the unions were happy with the USMCA actually. You're right.ABNEY: Yes, there were -- I think there were a lot of people now, just like anything else. You're not going to make everyone happy, of course.BARTIROMO: Right. Sure.ABNEY: But I think, especially when you compare to the downside which would have been no agreement, this is a big step, and we look forward to seeing it ratified in all three countries.BARTIROMO: Has the government shutdown impacted your business at all just yet?ABNEY: You know, it has not had any directs operational impact, our clines aren't being affected or anything like that, we do have empathy, of course, for the people that aren't -- are being paid and we hope this gets resolved pretty quickly. I can tell you though we haven't seen an economic impact but longer it continues, you have to wonder because of number of people ---BARTIROMO: Sure.ABNEY: -- that aren't getting paid.BARTIROMO: Sure. Of course. David, it's great to have on you program.ABNEY: All right. Take care.BARTIROMO: We'll be watching the developments. David Abney is the CEO of UPS. Coming up, the ripple effect of that shutdown. We are seeing the impact in a Davos. Varney will weigh in on that.Then healthcare in American, we're taking a look at the big factors impacting the industry this year with the CEO of Henry Schein. He'll weigh in. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are coming to you live from Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic Forum this week. Notably absent from this conference, President Trump, and other world leaders. Joining me now, the host of "VARNEY & CO." Stuart Varney to weigh in. Good morning, Stu.STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. It's not like last year, this year -- let's see now. President Macron's not there, Prime Minister May is not there, President Trump is not there, President Xi is not there, they're all dealing with domestic problems so I wonder if Davos this year can a address the major issues of the day as they tried to do last year. Like Brexit for example, like trade around the world like the slowing grow -- global economy.If the principles are not there, can much progress be made in dealing with these issues? From a distance, it seems like you're kind of hamstrung. What do you say?BARTIROMO: Well, there are a lot of other people here that are talking about it, for example this morning on my panel, we had the regulator who is in charge with the -- in charge of the financial services industry in China. So while it wasn't exactly the commentary that you would have gotten from President Xi, I did get commentary from him in terms of whether or not China is opening its markets to foreigners and how he would assess the slowdown in China.VARNEY: Good.BARTIROMO: And, you know, even though the economic data that came out of China yesterday was weaker than you would have liked to see, it was pretty much in line with lowered expectations, so --VARNEY: Hmm.BARTIROMO: -- you're right, a lot of gloom and doom, my last guest, Stu, said that gloom and doom is getting him bullish.VARNEY: Yes.BARTIROMO: He thinks it's a contrary indicator.VARNEY: Yes. Because if you turn just a couple of issues around, even mildly so, you're finished with gloom and doom expansion here we come. I think you'll be there to cover that, Maria. That's a fact.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much.VARNEY: Certainly.BARTIROMO: Thank you. And I know you'll have a lot more than that --VARNEY: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- in about 10 minutes. We'll see you at the top of the hour, Stu. "VARNEY & CO." begins every day at 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Join Stuart and his fantastic panel right after the show.First though we're live in Davos and we've got more on my panel discussion from this morning, highlighting global growth concerns and what's next. We're also taking a look at the impact of health care. Henry Schein CEO, Stanley Bergman, is here weighing in on his outlook for the New Year. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back to the World Economic Forum here in Davos, Switzerland. One key issue business and global leaders are watching closely, health care, 18 percent of the economy in the U.S. particularly pricing. My next guest is at the helm of the world's largest provider of health care products, and services through office-based practitioners. Joining me right now and a first on FOX Business interview is the CEO of Henry Schein, Stanley Bergman. And Stanley, it's good to have you back on the program.STANLEY BERGMAN, CEO, HENRY SCHEIN: It's good to be here with you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Well, the year started off with a lot of activity. You spun off your veterinarian business, Bristol-Myers Squibb announces it's acquiring Celgene, $74 billion deal there, a couple of other deals, what's going on in health care in terms of all of this consolidation?BERGMAN: Well, in our area, we are focused on wellness and prevention. As you said, 18 percent of the GDP spent on health care, we can reduce that cost through wellness and prevention, making sure that people see doctors regularly, have the appropriate tests, and we can reduce pulmonary, cardiac, cancer, diabetes, are OK challenges, and we can end up with a healthier population. I think we're going to see the whole movement consolidation health care drive wellness and prevention.BARTIROMO: And I think this movement really started after the -- after the mapping of genome because 20 years ago, when we did mapping of the genome, we started to understand better --BERGMAN: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- eating poorly, no exercise --BERGMAN: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- will cause diabetes, will perhaps cause a heart attack.BERGMAN: Yes.BARTIROMO: Smoking perhaps will cause cancer. We --BERGMAN: Well, we know that they're facts.BARTIROMO: They're facts. Right.BERGMAN: So now we need to make sure that the population understands that, and we need to take care of the patients outside of the hospital.BARTIROMO: So what's the most important thing in terms of wellness and living a long life? Tell us.BERGMAN: You just got to drink less, stop smoking, and eat less, and exercise.BARTIROMO: Very simple.BERGMAN: And go and see your doctor, your nurse, regularly and make sure that ailments -- as ailments merge, have prevention right there and then.BARTIROMO: And we're living longer, too.BERGMAN: Yes.BARTIROMO: What's the age now?BERGMAN: Well, the average -- the fastest growing cohort (INAUDIBLE) so we're going to be challenged with mental health issues.BARTIROMO: Right.BERGMAN: But a lot of this can be dealt with through prevention and wellness, and that's the business we are focused on.BARTIROMO: Technology is also enabling us.BERGMAN: Technology is remarkable, the opportunities. So now need to make sure that we harness technology in the doctor's office and have the dentist visited regularly and use that technology to make sure that we live a healthier longer life.BARTIROMO: Tell me some of the more exciting things. One idea is this idea that they have a mobile stroke unit where you have a stroke, you -- obviously you have to get to the person as soon as possible, they can actually care for you right there in the unit.BERGMAN: Yes.BARTIROMO: What else is out there in terms of technology that is enabling this wellness?BERGMAN: Lots and lots of opportunity in telemedicine. So, we have a unit today where you can visit with a doctor or a nurse through T.V. through video, and have your vital signs taken, the doctor can read it, and your medical condition dealt with right there and then. The opportunities for technology are enormous and dental care, you scan the mouth now, and all sorts of data can be put into a computer all the way leading towards the fabrication of a crown or a bridge (INAUDIBLE) the opportunities are amazing.BARTIROMO: Fantastic. Look, this is one of my favorite subjects, the marriage of technology and health care, got to have you back to talk more about it. Thanks so much.BERGMAN: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: It's good to see you, Stanley.BERGMAN: Thank you. Thanks for (INAUDIBLE)BERGMAN: Stanley Bergman is the CEO of Henry Schein. Stay with us. Highlights from my panel discussion in Davos this morning. Back in moment.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DALIO: I think we are in the later stages of the short-term debt cycle. Meaning maybe within the seventh or eighth inning of that and that there was an inappropriate mistake in desire to tighten monetary policy at a level that was after than the capital markets could handle.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: That was Bridgewater Associates Founder, Ray Dalio, on my panel earlier here in Davos. Dagen, your reaction to that because it wasn't just raising interest rates, it was also selling and unwinding the balance sheet.MCDOWELL: Right. And Ray pointed out in your one-on-one interview with him that in a year or so, the Federal Reserve might need to ease even whether it's through cutting rates, but he meant specifically mentioned through the balance sheet and Ray sees an economy that is slowing even in this country that could be growing at zero to two percent in not a very long time. I think that that is incredibly significant, something that investors will be paying attention to today.BARTIROMO: Yes, I agree with you.BELL: Well, and the Fed also has --BARTIROMO: And he was also the first person to say back in November, when it really wasn't well known in the market, that he didn't think the Federal Reserve was going to be able to raise rates very much and now that's, of course, the --MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm.BARTIROMO: -- general thinking, Lindsey.BELL: Yes, the Fed has created a lot of volatility in this market. So -- and you've seen how well they have reacted to the Fed Chair, Jerome Powell, being much more flexible and patient and willing to consider the balance sheet even with regards to stimulating the economy.BARTIROMO: Well, I love being with you both, ladies. All right. We'll do it again tomorrow.MCDOWELL: Yes, ma'am.BARTIROMO: Great to see you.MCDOWELL: Stay warm.BARTIROMO: Dagen McDowell, Lindsey Bell, thanks so much for joining us.

China-US dispute reaches chip territoryCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 23, 2019 SaturdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 693 wordsBody The negotiators from the United States and China are trying to resolve a dispute between rivals in the semiconductor sector, Micron Technology and Fujian Jinhua, as part of a broader trade agreement between the two largest economies in the world, according to people with information from the talks.  The people added that a resolution of several allegations and counter-accusations involving Micron and Fujian Jinhua was a "confidence building" measure that the two sides want to include in a memorandum of understanding, which could open the way for an agreement final for the ongoing trade war between the US and China.  Deputy Prime Minister Liu He, China's chief negotiator, and US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, must conclude the third round of trade negotiations face to face in almost the same number of weeks in Washington, after which Liu will meet with the American president Donald Trump.  People with information from the negotiations said that specific agreements on trade disputes could help Trump sell a broader trade agreement that could be light on the difficult structural reforms of the Chinese economy and a strict enforcement mechanism, Liu's team said. He has resisted both.  Speaking to reporters after meetings with Chinese officials in Beijing, top executives of the US Chamber of Commerce, the business lobby group, said they expect the talks to go beyond March 1, but without the increase in the tariffs with which it was threatened.  Myron Brilliant, head of international affairs for the Chamber, said; "Our working hypothesis is that both will pass the deadline, since the two presidents will need to meet and formalize the work agreement."  But he added: "We will not see any new tariffs or tariffs that go from 10 to 25 percent."  Brilliant said that one of Beijing's main areas of resistance has been to soften its approach of forcing foreign companies to deliver their technology as a price to do business in China.  Other measures to build trust that are under discussion include the easing of Chinese restrictions on imports of US polysilicon, a component of solar panels, which Beijing implemented in retaliation for US tariffs on imported solar cells.  They also imply final approval by China's central bank so that Visa and MasterCard can offer their payment services in the country after a wait of almost 20 years.  In a tweet on Thursday, Trump also said he could be willing to reduce the pressure his government exerts on Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications group, which could similarly help pave the way for a trade agreement.  People with information from the talks said Chinese officials requested that the dispute between Washington and Beijing over the company be resolved in a "parallel way" to the trade negotiations.  President Xi Jinping is seeking the release of Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's finance director and the daughter of company founder Ren Zhengfei, who is in Canada awaiting possible extradition to the US on charges of alleged bank fraud related to the sanctions against Iran.  In response, the Chinese government arrested two Canadian citizens on national security charges.  The long-running dispute between Micron, based in Idaho, and Fujian Jinhua, based in Fujian province, is regularly cited by US officials as an example of the alleged failure of the Chinese government toprotect the technologies of foreign investors and other types of intellectual property.  At a meeting of the Oval Office late last month between Trump and Liu, Lighthizer said the two negotiating teams focused on "the most important issues," including the "forcible transfer of technology, the protection of intellectual property." ... and the application, the application, the application. "  Prohibit exports  The US Department of Commerce banned US exports and technology transfers to Fujian Jinhua, in a move that could force the company to halt production next month. In another case, the US Department of Justice filed criminal charges against Fujian Jinhua for allegedly conspiring with UMC of Taiwan to steal Micron's technology. Fujian Jinhua, UMC and the Chinese government forcefully deny the charges. Load-Date: February 23, 2019End of Document

Canada allows extradition case against Huawei CFO to proceedAssociated Press Financial WireMarch 2, 2019 Saturday 4:12 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 609 wordsByline: By ROB GILLIES, Associated PressDateline: TORONTO BodyTORONTO (AP) - Canada said it will allow a U.S. extradition request for an executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei to face charges over possible dealings with Iran to proceed.The Department of Justice said Friday officials made the decision after a diligent review of the case against Meng Wangzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies Ltd., the biggest global maker of network equipment for phone and internet companies. A department statement stressed that Canada was following its laws.Meng's Dec. 1 arrest at the Vancouver airport set off a diplomatic furor and strained Canadian relations with China. Beijing has accused Washington of a politically motivated attempt to hurt a potential competitor to U.S. technology vendors.Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, is accused of lying to banks about the company's dealings with Iran in violation of U.S. trade sanctions. She is free on bail in Vancouver and is due in court Wednesday, when a date for an extradition hearing will be set. The decision to proceed is a formality and allows a judge to hear arguments on whether to grant the U.S. request.A decision to extradite ultimately must be approved by Canada's justice minister."There is sufficient evidence to be put before an extradition judge for decision," the statement said.The Chinese government on Saturday criticized the decision as a "serious violation" of Meng's rights and called on Washington to withdraw its extradition request."The U.S. and Canada have abused their bilateral extradition agreement," said a Foreign Ministry statement.China detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor on Dec. 10 in an apparent attempt to pressure Canada to release Meng.A Chinese court also sentenced a Canadian to death in a sudden retrial, overturning a 15-year prison term handed down earlier.

The boom in Chinese investment in the US has fadedCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 16, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 619 wordsBody NEW YORK (CNN) - The rise of Chinese investment in the United States has almost vanished.  China's foreign direct investment in the United States fell 83% in 2018, according to a report published Monday by the law firm Baker McKenzie.  Chinese companies are not only drastically reducing their investments, but have embarked on a record wave of sales of real estate, hotel and entertainment businesses.  Including those sales, net Chinese foreign direct investment in North America turned negative in 2018 for an amount of 5,500 million dollars, according to Baker McKenzie. Another $ 12 billion in Chinese assets worldwide are expected to be sold this year, according to the report.  The evaporation of Chinese money in the United States reflects Beijing's self-imposed restrictions on investments outside the country. However, the trend worsened because Washington has been tightening foreign investment reviews. The trade war between the United States and China has also contributed.  "The Chinese tied their hands to themselves not to invest abroad," said Scott Kennedy, director of the China Business and Political Economy Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "With the arrival of the Trump government, the United States put a 'Not for sale' sign on the door."  After spending a lot on US real estate, transportation and infrastructure, China's investment in these sectors has "largely disappeared," according to Baker McKenzie's report.  China has withdrawn from other major markets: foreign direct investment across Europe fell 70% in 2018, for example. But the United States has experienced the greatest decline.  Some large economies, including France, Germany, Spain and Sweden, experienced an increase in China's investment, Baker McKenzie said.  Canada also opposed the trend, with an increase in Chinese investment of 80% to 2,700 million dollars last year. Including disinvestments, Canada actually enjoyed more Chinese investment than the United States in 2018, Baker McKenzie said.  Chinese investment in the United States reached a peak of 45.6 billion in 2016, a year in which the insurer giant HNA squandered a 25% stake in Hilton and Anbang Insurance acquired a series of high-end hotels.  But foreign direct investment was reduced to 29 billion dollars in 2017, when China imposed restrictions on outgoing investments in an attempt to curb capital outflows. Investment in the United States was later reduced to only $ 4.8 billion last year in the midst of Washington's crackdown on China; a "great fall," Kennedy said.  Meanwhile, US officials are examining Chinese investment more intensively.  The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has rejected several high-profile transactions, including Broadcom's bid for 117 billion dollars by Qualcomm. Last year, President Donald Trump signed a law that expands the power of the CFIUS to block agreements abroad for reasons of national security.  At the same time, some of the most voracious US asset buyers in China have suffered pressure from Beijing.  For example, early last year, China took control of Anbang, the insurance giant that in 2014 completed a $ 1.50m purchase of the iconic Waldorf Astoria. The Chinese government later injected almost 10 billion dollars in Anbang.  Similarly, HNA, a conglomerate that emerged from an airline, has made a streakof epic shopping in recent years. The Chinese company bought parts of everything from Deutsche Bank to Hilton. But since then, HNA has acted to get rid of business in response to the crackdown on overseas purchases by Beijing and concerns about the huge debt of the insurance company.  "HNA saw its wings cut off massively," Kennedy said. Load-Date: January 16, 2019End of Document

THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH PUBLISHES A SIGNED ARTICLE BY AMBASSADOR LIU XIAOMING ENTITLED DON'T LISTEN TO THE SCAREMONGERS HUAWEI IS NOT A SECURITY THREAT TO BRITAINStates News ServiceJanuary 28, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 804 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:From Chinese Embassy in UKOn 27 January 2019, the Sunday Telegraph and its website published a signed article by Ambassador Liu Xiaoming entitled Don't listen to the scaremongers Huawei is not a security threat to Britain. The full text is as follows: Recently, it seems it is all the rage for Western governments and media to call Chinese companies a "security threat". This has caused needless anxiety and even led to a ban in some countries on companies such as the Chinese telecommunications business Huawei. However, such accusations are groundless and misleading. If left unchecked, they could disrupt market rules, undermine company confidence, poison business cooperation, and cause uncertainties and instabilities in the world economy. As China's Ambassador to the UK, I know that the best argument against the allegation of security threat is Huawei's success in this country. It is, first of all, a classic case of win-win cooperation. Huawei UK has made an important contribution to the economic and social progress of its host country over the past five years by bringing 2 billion to Britain through investment and procurement and creating 7,500 jobs, making a name for itself as a provider of high-quality products and services. In the process of its cooperation with British partners, the company itself has expanded its global reach and adapted to international standards. Second, Huawei has much to contribute to the long-term development of the UK's telecommunications industry. Since 2001, Huawei has aligned its investment in the UK with the tech development plan of the British government, and, thanks to its smartphones and telecommunications equipment, has boosted the development of the UK's tech industry. The UK owes its economic and social vitality to a profound tradition of openness and inclusiveness. I hope and believe that it will remain committed to this tradition, and reject regression, seclusion, confrontation and a "Cold War" mentality. This will ensure that China's cooperation with Britain is always in the forefront of our working together with Western countries, and will also help the UK secure a competitive edge in the new round of technological revolution. Third, Huawei is a supporter of the UK's future economic growth. Having pledged a further 3 billion to investment and procurement in the UK in the coming five years, Huawei will continue to play an active role in IT application in this country - a vote of confidence in the economic prospects of the UK as it leaves the EU. To make this vote count, the UK must remain committed to openness and cooperation and provide a fair and non-discriminatory business environment for Huawei and other Chinese enterprises. Fourth, Huawei does not pose any threat to the UK. On the contrary, it has made relentless efforts in providing global solutions to maintaining cyber security. It has taken the initiative in establishing the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre in the UK, and engaged in active cooperation with British institutions to improve the relevant technology. Indeed, a senior executive in the British telecommunications industry recently spoke highly of the security of the 5G technology of Huawei from a professional perspective. The Chinese Government has never supported cyber theft by any company, nor is anyone authorised by law or regulation to force enterprises to install back doors. Huawei itself has a sound record in cyber security: over the past 30 years, there has never been any evidence showing that Huawei has ever done anything to undermine the national security of any country. The fact is that Huawei acts strictly in line with the laws and regulations of the UK and delivers what customers want. How to respond to the hyped allegation against Huawei is not an economic question but a political one. It is a question of "to be, or not to be". To answer the question, I believe the UK has to decide whether it wants to see China's development as an opportunity or a threat. To make the right choice, the UK needs to pursue independent policy based on its national interests, instead of drifting along with others. Staying open and inclusive is the key to maintaining UK's global influence. Clinging to an outdated Cold War mentality and taking "national security" as an excuse for discrimination against foreign companies will not only bring harm to others but also backfire. Globalisation is an irreversible trend. China has resolved to embrace the world and engage in open cooperation. I expect the UK to carry on with its historic spirit of openness and make the wise choice that serves its interests, joining hands with China to deliver more benefits to the peoples of both countries.Load-Date: February 1, 2019End of Document

UC advises staff traveling in China against use of WeChat and WhatsAppDaily Bruin: University of California - Los AngelesJanuary 23, 2019 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 646 wordsBodyThe University of California distributed a warning to staff in January advising against the use of communication platforms such as WeChat and WhatsApp for those traveling in China.The UC received the advisory notice from WorldAware, a risk management company the UC consults with, said Myla Edmond, director of marketing and communications for the UC Education Abroad Program.Students at UC Davis and UC Berkeley received the email regarding the travel warning earlier this month, according to CNN.Edmond added the UC distributed the recommendation to staff, but never intended for it to be sent to students."UC staff shared that recommendation with other UC staff as an information item, but never as a recommendation nor as a message for our students," Edmond said.The U.S. Department of State issued a travel warning Jan. 3, advising travelers to exercise increased caution when in China. The alert level is currently a two on a four-point scale.Edmond said the UC decided not to forward the recommendation against using the communication platforms to students because the alert level was not high enough to warrant such a reaction."The Department of State's alert level has not increased and so we haven't changed any of our processes," Edmond said. "We continue to monitor that but we haven't changed anything."WorldAware sent the recommendation to the UC following the alert issued by the Department of State.Peter Reiher, an adjunct professor of computer science, said he believes most forms of digital communication are susceptible to serious breaches of privacy and travelers should therefore assume that any online activity can be divulged.Reiher added China demands a certain degree of access to whatever data is being passed through legal applications such as WeChat and WhatsApp."The Chinese are very, very sophisticated at cyber espionage," Reiher said. "It would be safest to assume that anything that you bring into China on a computer or a smartphone ... is going to be available to (the Chinese government)."A member of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association at UCLA, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation for speaking publicly about the Chinese government, said these applications are China's primary platforms for messaging and social media."WeChat is such an important social aspect in Chinese people's lives," the CSSA member said. "Almost everyone in China uses WeChat to communicate with family and friends."The CSSA member said because these social platforms are so integrated into their daily lives, most Chinese people are not worried that the government might be monitoring their communications."Personally, I am not too concerned with it. I know there (have) been rumors that the government is ... stalking everyone ... monitoring everyone's record," the CSSA member said. "But... I haven't seen any concrete evidence on that, so personally I am not concerned with it."Reiher said travelers should avoid being critical of their host countries while traveling due to possible cultural and political differences."Doing things like talking about democracy movements in China, or about various kinds of religious groups that the Chinese do not approve of, or whether Tibet should be independent ... while you are in China is certainly a hazardous thing to do," Reiher added.Edmond said while the recommendation was not intended to be distributed to students, they should still research and be mindful of the possible risks they face when communicating in China.Reiher added travelers should keep in mind that behavior that is permissible in their home countries might not be acceptable in other countries."Anybody who is an international traveler - in particular, an international student - is a guest of the country in question and ... should respect the laws, ... culture and customs of that country," Reiher said.Load-Date: January 23, 2019End of Document

Top US general says Google 'is indirectly benefiting the Chinese military'CNN WireMarch 14, 2019 Thursday 6:08 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 429 wordsByline: By Ryan Browne, CNNDateline: (CNN) Body (CNN) --  America's top general said Thursday that Google's work in China "is indirectly benefiting the Chinese military.""The work that Google is doing in China is indirectly benefiting the Chinese military and I've been very public on this issue as well," Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said while testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee."We watch with great concern when industry partners work in China knowing that there is that indirect benefit and frankly indirect may be not a full characterization of the way it really is, it's more of a direct benefit to the Chinese military," Dunford added.Dunford has long questioned why US-based tech firms have resisted working with the Department of Defense while simultaneously doing business with geopolitical competitors like China.CNN previously reported that Google intended to end its cooperation with the Pentagon on several projects, including the Project Maven program which used artificial intelligence to enhance military drone operations following complaints from employees.The company also recently dropped a bid for a Pentagon cloud storage contract, citing concerns that working with the Defense Department could conflict with its principles."The way I described it to our industry partners is: look we're the good guys and the values that we represent and the system we represent is the one that will allow and has allowed you to thrive," Dunford said Thursday.Google has "a lack of willingness to support DoD programs," acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan also told the committee on Thursday.He said that China often uses civilian technology to bolster its military forces."The technology that is developed in the civil world, transfers to the military world, it's a direct pipeline," Shanahan said.Google's lack of willingness to work with the Pentagon while simultaneously doing business with China was slammed by Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri."We are in a struggle with the Chinese government over whether or not they're going to become a regional and maybe global hegemon with values very different from ours, certainly values that do not favor freedom in the world," Hawley said."We have an American company that does not want to do work with our defense department which is one thing, but they're happy to help the Chinese, at least the Chinese government that is, the Chinese military, at least indirectly, I think that's just extraordinary," he added.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Huawei just massively dunked on the US and said it has 'no evidence, nothing' of Chinese spyingBusiness Insider USFebruary 26, 2019 Tuesday 04:49 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 669 wordsByline: sghosh@businessinsider.com,  (Shona Ghosh)Highlight: Huawei's chairman Guo Ping said the US had no evidence of spying.BodyReuters• Huawei chairman Guo Ping lashed out at the US, saying it had "no evidence, nothing" that the firm spies on behalf of the Chinese government.• Speaking at Mobile World Congress, Guo said Huawei had never planted backdoors in its equipment, nor would it allow third parties to meddle with its kit.• MWC has become a battleground between the US and Huawei, with US cyber officials also in attendance and likely to be lobbying against the Chinese firm.• Guo also criticised a new, wide-reaching American law that allows the US government to demand data stored with Amazon, Microsoft, or other cloud providers.Huawei just stepped up its war of words with the US at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, as it tries to convince international governments and mobile operators that it doesn't spy on people for the Chinese government.Huawei chairman Guo Ping gave a keynote at the conference on Tuesday, most of which was spent pitching Huawei's 5G technologies. But he closed the speech by lashing out at the US."Huawei has a strong track record in security in three decades," he said. "33 billion people around the world. The US security accusations of our 5G has no evidence, nothing."Read more: Here's a close-up look at Huawei's $2,600 folding phone, the Mate XGuo went a step further to criticise the US Cloud Act, an American law passed in 2018 that forces Amazon, Microsoft, and other cloud providers to hand over data on customers when requested by the government. It applies no matter where the data is hosted, and could give the US access to huge amounts of data on European citizens - something that has alarmed the EU, according to Bloomberg."The irony is that the US Cloud Act... allows their entities to access data across borders. So for best technology and greater security, choose Huawei. Please choose Huawei," Guo said.During his speech, Guo showed a slide with the statement: "Huawei has not and will never plant backdoors."Shona Ghosh/Business Insider"Let me say this as clearly as possible," Guo said. "Huawei has not and we will never plant backdoors and we will never allow anyone to do so on our equipment. We take this responsibility very seriously. Carriers are responsible for the secure operations of their own networks. Carriers can prevent outside attacks."Guo also referenced President Donald Trump's remarks about 5G, stating that the US did need faster networks.Guo's comments come as the US government tries to lobby its allies to reconsider allowing Huawei equipment into their next-generation 5G networks. The fear is that Huawei's kit is compromised, and might allow the Chinese government to spy on people. There are also jitters about putting so much of the Western world's critical mobile infrastructure into Chinese hands.American lobbying efforts appear to be extending to Mobile World Congress, the biggest annual gathering of mobile operators and equipment providers in the world. America's top cyber defence official, Robert Strayer, is at the conference and has previously made a strong case against Huawei."A country that uses data in the way China has - to surveil its citizens, to set up credit scores and to imprison more than 1 million people for their ethnic and religious background - should give us pause about the way that country might use data in the future," Strayer said earlier this month, according to The Washington Post. "It would be naive to think that country, [given] the influence it has over its companies, would act in ways that would treat our citizens better than it treats its own citizens."NOW WATCH: Netflix copycats are changing the streaming game and making viewers pay the priceSee Also:• Goldman Sachs is right: Samsung's folding phone may be a genuine threat to Apple's iPhone• Here's a close-up look at Huawei's $2,600 folding phone, the Mate X• Nokia's new $700 smartphone has an insane 5 cameras, blowing up the 2019 trend for 3 lensesSEE ALSO: Nokia's new $700 smartphone has an insane 5 cameras, blowing up the 2019 trend for 3 lensesLoad-Date: February 26, 2019End of Document

China condemns human rights portal founder to 5 years in prisonCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 29, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 358 wordsBody A Chinese court today sentenced activist Liu Feiyue, founder of a human rights news website, to five years in prison, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said.  In a statement sent to the media, the NGO called on the authorities of the Asian country to annul the sentence - which declares him guilty of "subversion against the State", an accusation frequently used by the Chinese government against activists and dissidents - and free Liu "without conditions".  Liu founded the Civil Rights & Livelihood Watch (CRLW) website in 2006 and was arrested at the end of 2016 at his home in Suizhou, and was then accused of "receiving help from abroad" in activities to "incite subversion".  Apart from the articles he posted on his website, Liu produced annual reports on human rights violations in China from 2014 until he was arrested.  "Pursuing the editor of a human rights website shows how scared the Chinese government is of independent reporting on abuses from within China," lamented HRW's China researcher Wang Yaqiu, who considers the ruling "a judicial parody." that seeks to scare others who can follow in their footsteps. "  "Liu Feiyue and others have given voice to many people who have been abused by the Chinese authorities. This type of process shows that the Chinese government still has a lot to hide when it comes to human rights violations, "Wang added.  Also, the document denounced that the process against Liu "has been affected by the denial of his right to legal assistance and other infractions of the established processes"; In fact, the authorities eventually withdrew the license of one of Liu's lawyers, Weng Donghai.  The prosecution had accused the activist of "attacking the current political system", "defame the Chinese government" and "disseminating information harmful to the power of the State and the socialist system."  In March 2018, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) released a statement in which it claimed to fear the lives of a dozen journalists and bloggers imprisoned in China, including Liu.  The China entry condemns the founder of the portal on human rights to 5 years in prison and was first published in La Tercera. Load-Date: January 29, 2019End of Document

THE DAILY TELEGRAPH PUBLISHES A SIGNED ARTICLE BY AMBASSADOR LIU XIAOMING ENTITLED DIALOGUE AND CO-OPERATION ARE THE ONLY WAY TO CYBER SECURITYStates News ServiceJanuary 22, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 741 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:From Chinese Embassy in UK2019/01/22On 21 January 2019, the Daily Telegraph and its website published a signed article by Ambassador Liu Xiaoming entitled Dialogue and co-operation are the only way to cyber security. The full text is as follows:As one of the greatest inventions in the 20th century, the internet has brought profound changes to our way of thinking, working and living. At the same time, it is prone to security risks and challenges. Wiretapping, attacks and terrorism in cyberspace have become global problems that call for global solutions. This means countries must work together instead of accusing one country for all the problems as some countries recently did against China, not to mention how groundless the allegations are and how absurd the claim of "China threat" to cyber security is. Such actions poison the environment for international cooperation on cyber security and are unfair to China.China is a victim of cyber attack. With 802 million internet users, including 788 million mobile surfers, and a $3.95 trillion (3.1 trillion) digital economy, which accounts for 32.9pc of its GDP, China is an easy target. In 2017 alone, China suffered close to $60 billion in economic loss due to cyber security problems where 93.5pc of ransomware attacks in China were launched overseas. Being a victim itself and believing in Confucius' teaching that "you do not do unto others what you would not have them do unto you", China resolves to do more to underline rather than undermine cyber security.And we have already taken concrete safeguarding actions. Cyberspace is not a lawless land. No country would tolerate fraud, cheating, stealing, terrorism or incitement of religious extremism.The Chinese Government has no part in stealing commercial secrets, nor do we in any way encourage or support any individual or company to do so. On the contrary, China has been opposing and cracking down on all forms of cyber theft all along.In recent years, China has strengthened rule of law in cyberspace and kept improving the relevant laws and regulations: The Cyber Security Law and The National Cyberspace Security Strategy were issued in 2016; The first internet court was established in Hangzhou in 2017, followed by the second and third in Beijing and Guangzhou respectively in 2018; By October 30, 2018, the internet court in Hangzhou had heard 14,233 cases of online financial fraud and breach of internet-related IPR, and closed 11,794 cases. This marked a significant step forward in China's legal system on cyber security.On cyber security, countries of the world face the same challenge and therefore find common interests in the improvement of cyber governance. To this end, they should opt for dialogue and cooperation as the only right choice. China advocates common progress, win-win results and joint governance based on mutual trust and cooperation. As a responsible big country, China has been actively pushing for bilateral and multilateral cooperation on cyber security, engaging with the US, the UK and the EU through dialogue mechanisms, and sharing China's wisdom at the UN and the G20 on improving international cooperation in cyberspace. Moreover, China has hosted five sessions of the World Internet Conference since 2014 to promote international cooperation on cyber security and cyber governance.All these show that the accusations against China on cyber security are unfair, groundless and the opposite of the fact. People of the world need not be reminded who has conducted massive cyber wiretapping against foreign governments - even allies, who has engaged in organised cyber theft against the business institutions and the public of other countries, who is actually undermining cyber security. Those who are launching a smear campaign against China will only shoot themselves in the foot.A Chinese adage goes, "Nothing is more beneficial than stability and more detrimental than chaos." As I told a Chatham House conference on cyber security, China chooses peace over war, security over turbulence, openness over closeness and cooperation over confrontation. Looking ahead, China stands ready to enhance dialogue and cooperation with the international community, including the UK, to safeguard cyber security and build a more just and reasonable global governance system in the cyberspace.Load-Date: January 23, 2019End of Document

China says new law will bar demands for technology handoverAssociated Press Financial WireMarch 6, 2019 Wednesday 3:57 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 511 wordsDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - China will bar government authorities from demanding overseas companies hand over technology secrets in exchange for market share, a top economic official said Wednesday, addressing a key complaint at the heart of the current China-U.S. trade dispute.The provision is contained in a foreign investment law to be debated at the current annual session of the National People's Congress, Ning Jizhe, vice chairman of the Cabinet's economic planning agency told reporters at a news conference.The law will "clarify the system for advancement and protection of foreign investment," Ning said. The legal system will ensure that foreign businesses "cannot be required to transfer technology by administrative means, providing a more encompassing and beneficial legal guarantee," he said.Ning's statement came a day after Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced a robust annual economic growth target and promised in a speech to the congress' opening session that foreign companies will be "treated as equals" with their Chinese competitors.Accusations that China demands the disclosure of technology secrets are a key stumbling point in the U.S.-China trade dispute that has significantly disrupted commerce between the world's two largest economies, affecting farmers, liquor exporters and China's key manufacturing industries.Li on Tuesday set this year's economic growth target at 6 to 6.5 percent. Such a growth rate, if achieved, would be among the world's strongest. Yet it would be slightly below last year's 6.6 percent growth in China and would mark a new three-decade low.China's emergence as a competitor in smartphones, telecom equipment, solar power and other technologies has increased the range of products available to consumers and helped to drive down prices. But it rattles Washington and other governments that worry Chinese competition is a threat to their industries and employment.Such concerns underscore a standoff between the U.S. and China over Huawei Technologies, the world's biggest maker of telecom infrastructure for new high-speed 5G networks. Washington has been pushing hard to exclude the Chinese company from building the backbone of the future internet.News reports say Washington and Beijing might be close to an agreement to end the trade battle and avoid further tariff hikes, although no firm agreements have been announced on the core of the dispute: U.S. pressure on Beijing to roll back its plans for state-led creation of global competitors in robotics and other technology.Last year, the U.S. levied import taxes of 25 percent on $50 billion of Chinese imports. It followed in September with 10 percent duties on an additional $200 billion. All told, the U.S. tariffs covered roughly half of what the U.S. buys from China.Washington, Europe and other trading partners say China's policies violate its market-opening obligations and give an unfair advantage to domestic firms. Some American officials worry they might erode U.S. industrial leadership.___Associated Press writer Joe McDonald contributed to this report.Load-Date: March 6, 2019End of Document

Interdisciplinary panel discusses China's 'Past, Present and Future'The Brown Daily Herald: Brown UniversityMarch 18, 2019 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: UNIVERSITY-NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 892 wordsBodyOn Monday night, University professors came together to examine China through four distinct lenses: space exploration, environmental science, politics and history.The panel, titled "The Rise of China: Past, Present and Future," featured James Head, professor of geological sciences, Rebecca Nedostup, associate professor of history, Edward Steinfeld, director of the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs and dean's professor of China studies and Tongzhang Zheng, professor of epidemiology.While moderating the panel, Provost Richard Locke P'18 spoke about the event's inclusion in the University's "Building on Distinction" lecture series, which allows faculty members to discuss their research and highlights the University's work."Building on Distinction" underscores the University's distinctive teaching approach, which "combines intellectual rigor with interdisciplinary inquiry," Locke said, adding that the panel was also "emblematic" of this approach by featuring four professors from different fields.To begin the conversation, Head, who joined the conference via video, spoke about China's progress in space exploration. Space projects are a way of demonstrating national power, boosting pride and prestige, enhancing national security and asserting international leadership as well as national legitimacy, Head said. With the support of a multitude of other institutes, the Chinese National Space Agency oversees the country's space program, he added. "One of the keystones (of China's space exploration) is the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program," which recently landed a significant project on the far-side of the moon, Head added. In the end, Head summarized the importance of China's space endeavors by quoting President Xi Jinping, who said "there is no end to space exploration."Steinfeld then presented on the sociopolitical change China has experienced since the Chinese Communist Party took over. He started his talk by reflecting on his personal experiences in China; when living in the country 30 years ago, Steinfeld said it was unimaginable to predict the emergence of advanced social media apps, the extensive use of smartphones and online payment platforms.Steinfeld also highlighted the recent rise of strong-man politics following Xi's abolishment of term limits and the incarceration of ethnic Uighurs in Xinjiang. But, despite the enormous transformation, Steinfeld remarked that "authoritarianism is not definitional of China."Since the student protests that took place during the May Fourth movement of 1919, China has undergone "unbelievable experimentations" and a self-aware process of change, Steinfeld said. After going through periods of Maoist spiritual utopia and radical market revolution, China has entered a period of showcasing its national identity. At the same time, China now experiences heavy-handed state suppression of civil society.Following Steinfeld's remarks, Nedostup spoke about the displacement of Chinese people during the Second Japanese War and Chinese Civil War period. During these times, roughly a quarter of the entire Chinese population was displaced, Nedostup said. However, "this is something we don't usually hear about in the global history of refugees," she added.Nedostup attributed this "lost history" to "two silences" - the silence found within historical writings on refugees as well as the personal silence of displaced families. She pointed to photographs of wooden boats as evidence confirming China's refugee history; the photos showed wooden boats carrying the coffins of displaced individuals, returning their bodies from the wartime capital of Chongqing to their homes in other cities such as Shanghai and Beijing. Among the few historical records were newspaper ads for these boat trips, showing the significance of reburial in Chinese culture.Zheng concluded the panel by talking about the environmental repercussions of China's rapid economic development. China's GDP increased significantly from 1979 to 2009, but during this period, the government paid little attention to public health and damage to the environment, Zheng said. During this period, heavy metals and other chemicals polluted more than 60 million acres of farmland to the point where they could not be used for farming anymore, he added. Besides causing environmental degradation, China's unchecked industrial development also greatly damaged public health - every year, there are 400 million cardiovascular disease or stroke patients in the country, he added. But, since 2009, the Chinese government has sought to improve the environmental conditions in the country. Investments in renewable energy and electric cars have grown significantly in the past decade, and the government is also trying to restore forests, Zheng said.After their presentations, the four professors answered questions from Provost Locke, as well as from the audience. Andrew Steinberg '22 thought the panel "explored a lot of interesting ideas of China's past and future." Steinberg was especially intrigued by the panel's mention of scientific collaboration between U.S. and Chinese researchers despite the prevalence of rhetoric labelling "China as an adversary." Xinyue (Jennifer) Xu '20 praised the panel but commented that it could benefit from including some experts not affiliated with the University.Load-Date: March 19, 2019End of Document

Good morning, everyone, thanks for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Friday, February 1st. Your top stories right now, just before 6:00 a.m. on the east coast. The busiest week of earnings season wraps up today. On tap, Dow components: Merck, Exxon Mobil, and Chevron. Amazon, the stock to watch after the close last night. Of course, the technology giant under pressure this morning as revenue guidance comes in light of expectations. Investors are anticipating the big jobs report today. The expectation, 165,000 new jobs added to the economy last month with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.9 percent. We're taking a look at what it means for the economy, the fallout from the government shutdown as well.Two days and counting until the big game, we are taking you live to Atlanta this morning for a preview of Super Bowl LIII, with NBA great Shaq O'Neil. Plus, we are just ending the best month for markets in 30 years, coming up. MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: All right. We kick off the new month for markets with this, Futures are mixed this morning, take a look, Dow Industrials up about 29 points right here. The Dow and S&P 500 seeing their best January gains in 30 years for the month. The numbers were very strong, earnings season, of course, one of the big highlights, rolling on. But Amazon reported last night posting a third straight record profit. However, the company's revenue guidance for the first quarter missed expectations and that is weighing on the stock this morning. We'll take a look at Amazon momentarily. And as you can see, the numbers there, $5.68 a share versus $6.04. The stock down right now 4-1/2 percent.Joining me right now, CFRA Research Media and Entertainment Analyst, Tuna Amobi. Tuna, it's great to see you again.TUNA AMOBI, MEDIA & ENTERTAINMENT ANALYST, CFRA RESEARCH: As always, Maria.BARTIROMO: Your reaction to the Amazon quarter.AMOBI: So, you know, I thought that there were a number of positive takeaways here, right? You know, the operating income number actually topped the guidance that the company provided. The one kind of blip in the quarter was revenue number as you alluded to, right? So, I think that is actually, in a way, due to the law of large numbers. It's kind of finally catching up. But I think the main story here as I think about Amazon is the kind of the favorable mix shift from traditional lower margin businesses to actually businesses that are now going to be incremental to the overall margin. So, think about cloud computing, think about, you know, the shift to third-party sellers, and also the growing advertising business. So, all of this, I think, bode well for future profitability.BARTIROMO: So, what drove things in the quarter, and how would you characterize the holiday season in terms of the nuts and bolts of the business, delivery and retail?AMOBI: Sure. So, I think we know that the holiday season actually came in fairly strong overall across the industry. Amazon has been gaining share. And all of the data points that we saw coming into this quarter for the holiday season, I think really set the company up for what I believe was a monster holiday season. All of the hardware devices, the Echo, Alexa, the Fire Stick were flying off the shelves. But there is no doubt that the core e-commerce business has been slowing and we saw that again this past quarter. So, overall, I think the fundamentals of the business remain intact. The favorite metric that the company looks at, trailing 12-month operating free cash flow, now hitting a run rate of almost $20 billion, almost double year-over-year.BARTIROMO: Wow. That slowing, is that a function of a slowing global economy, or is that a function of just Amazon and the law of large numbers as you said? Does growth become tougher from here?AMOBI: It does, from a top-line perspective, there is no doubt. If you're talking about the core e-commerce business, both in the U.S. and international. But I think Amazon Web services, which is only 10 percent of the overall revenue growth, is going to maintain a trajectory we think of at least 45 percent to 50 percent growth for the next few years. Now, almost hitting a $30-billion run rate business. So that's --BARTIROMO: And that's the cloud business?AMOBI: That's the cloud business.BARTIROMO: AWS. Yes?AMOBI: Correct.BARTIROMO: OK. What company surprised you? Broaden it out for us. Take a look at the quarter in general in terms of earnings growth. Any company surprise you so far this earnings season?AMOBI: You know, I think, you know, a lot of the big media companies are yet to report. We know that FAANG names have been navigating a lot of the, you know, privacy issues. Facebook was a really good positive surprise. I think kind of set the tone of what to expect here. So, I think the core FAANG story essentially remains intact. The media -- the core media business as we look to the next few weeks when the big ones start to report, frankly, I think there's really not much to be too excited about here. The core businesses are facing some secular pressures, but all the companies are really repositioning themselves for this new paradigm shift of direct-to-consumer shift, and that's going to be the key here, which companies can favorably make that transition.BARTIROMO: We're just coming off of the best month in 30 years for the markets. Would you put new money to work right here?AMOBI: Well, you know, Maria, as you know, there is -- it's debatable, the chances of recession. This is a sector universe that is really kind of cyclical, and if the odds of a recession increased dramatically, then all bets are off. Having said that, I think there's still some fundamental, you know, things that make us quite optimistic as we look over the next 12 months.BARTIROMO: Within media?AMOBI: Within media and in fact, within the technology, TMT sector.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Tuna, great to see you.AMOBI: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. Tuna Amobi joining us there. Meanwhile, the record-setting polar vortex blasting the United States with the lowest temperatures in decades. The impact hitting businesses across the country. Dagen McDowell, good morning to you. What's your take?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. First, we want to mention the devastating loss for many people because of this record cold snap across much of the Midwest. This polar vortex killed at least 15 people in the Midwest and in the east coast. But it's also businesses that we point out on the Fox Business Network that are trying to recover as the temperatures finally start to rise. Automakers were forced to close factories because of these record-low temperatures. Airlines canceling thousands of flights. And the gas utilities were urging customers in the last couple of days to lower their thermostats, 65 degrees, because of this surge in demand for natural gas and heat.There was an explosion and a fire at a natural gas facility operated by Consumers Energy Corporation on Wednesday morning that forced many auto plants to shut their operations. General Motors are the major automaker seems to be the hardest hit there. At one point, it had to halt production at 13 different plants. And then, we talked about the airlines were forced to cancel thousands of flights, particularly in the Chicago area. Chicago O'Hare International. One of the big problems was getting the fuel out of the underground fueling system because it wasn't working because of the cold. And literally, planes were landing at Chicago's O'Hare with extra fuel on-board.But we should point out that the temperatures are rising. And this will shock you, so Chicago's low temperature was about negative 20 degrees. That does not include the windchill factor. Temperatures this weekend are expected to hit 50. That is a turnaround of 70 degrees in Chicago. But I think the people there are certainly thankful for that.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's an incredible range. I mean, we were negative and now you're talking about 50 degrees. That's -- and even in New York as well, it's going to get a lot warmer.MCDOWELL: Well, I wanted to point this out. As a -- you know, as a news network, we always focus on weather incidents that are -- that quite frankly make great pictures, you know, hurricanes, big storms. But this was devastating to many people, to many businesses, and I just -- I felt like it was important for us to cover it. The damage, the fallout, the more than 15 -- at least 15 deaths that we know about, and the recovery.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, when Janice first said we're going to be talking about this for decades, I thought, what, really? And you know what? It's incredible when you look across the country, particularly obviously the Midwest I should say.MCDOWELL: Because we -- you know, we're not just east coast people. We do think about all Americans across the country and what they're going through and how they're suffering or rejoicing. And so, there's been suffering the last few days and certainly rejoicing now that higher temperatures are on the way.BARTIROMO: Dagen, let me switch gears and talk to you about markets for a moment, because we're looking at a mixed opening this morning. Obviously, oil is part of the story as well, but we're coming off of a January, that's the best January for these markets in 30 years. I guess part of this is the valuation story, right, because markets got crushed in December.MCDOWELL: Right. Absolutely. So, markets plummeted and as in November and December, it was the worst year for the markets since 2008. But what happened was because interest rates fell so dramatically from about 3-1/4 percent on the 10-year, that as those interest rates fell, that automatically made stocks look more attractive because that's how you value them. So, you weren't going to buy -- you weren't going to buy the 10-year when it was, you know, 2.6 percent but stocks began to look attractive. And I think that that's has bared itself out in the results that we've been getting so far this quarter. Amazon a little bit mixed but, again, that's a what-have-you-done-for-me-lately story, with the incredible run in that company. But the earnings have looked really good, and it was largely the bank stocks in the month of January that pushed those markets higher.BARTIROMO: Yes. And don't forget the jobs numbers, we've got that out in about two hours. We've got our special coverage, coming up. And I know we will be all hands-on-deck, Dagen.Meanwhile, there's this, Deutsche Bank posting its first annual profit in four years. Lauren Simonetti with that story now. Lauren, good morning to you.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. Deutsche Bank reporting a profit of $391 million for 2018 despite a loss that came in the fourth quarter. Revenue slid two percent despite the improved results for last year. Deutsche Bank is playing down speculation about the bank merging with its smaller rival, Commerce Bank. Taking a look at shares of Deutsche, they are lower by three percent in premarket trading, $8.62.Well, Facebook and Twitter have removed thousands of fake accounts with ties to Russia, Iran, and Venezuela. The phony accounts are accused of spreading pro-Iranian government messaging, posting nearly a quarter -- posting nearly a million tweets about U.S. politics and showing support for disputed Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Nearly two million people followed the bogus accounts on Facebook alone. Shares of Facebook down 20 percent over the last year. Twitter, those shares up about 25 percent.Well, if you've been thinking about quitting Facebook, here's a possible incentive for you to do so, it might be good for your emotional well-being. There's a new study from Stanford University. It says, users who quit this site are more happy. They found that a small bump in users' daily moods and life satisfaction. And for the average Facebook user, an extra hour a day of downtime. That makes sense, if you're not on Facebook, it opens up a world of opportunities for you to do other things.BARTIROMO: All right. Thanks so much, Cheryl. Coming up, trade talks underway, President Trump feeling positive he says that the U.S. and China can come to an agreement on trade and tariffs. Hear what he has to say, next. Different story when it comes to Congress.Up next, cola truce, Pepsi creating a celebratory cheers in front of Atlanta's Coca-Cola's museum ahead of Super Bowl LIII. We will give in to the big game spirit, coming up with Shaq O'Neil. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We've got a big show this morning. Coming up, Texas Congressman and House Financial Services Committee Member, Congressman Roger Williams is here. The legendary Super Bowl-winning quarterback, the great Joe Theismann is here, along with Pittsburgh Steelers defensive end and Walter Payton Man of the Year nominee Camerican Heyward is here. Our all-star panel as well for the jobs panel, it begins at 8:00 a.m. Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big show. Joining the conversation right now this morning, Benchmark Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly, is here. And Team Rubicon CEO, Jake Wood. Great to have you.JAKE WOOD, CEO, TEAM RUBICON: Yes, thanks for having us.BARTIROMO: Good morning.WOOD: Good morning.KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK: Love it. It's been -- it's been a crazy time in the markets. I mean, think about how January's kicked off and just seeing with the reporting season coming and everyone was worried about a recession but we've seen the best January. Now, I'd like to go back to last January. We had a great January last year as well. If you guys don't recall. Then we had volmageddon which was in February where the markets really tanked. So, you know, I think everybody needs to taper expectations here, especially going forward because of the multiple expansion. And we've seen a lot of not quality stocks do well and quality stocks not do well.BARTIROMO: Yes, especially since we're coming off of the best January in 30 years.KELLY: Yes.BARTIROMO: I mean, at this point, markets have been so strong in January, because of the comeback.KELLY: Yes. In defense, it has done better. So, I was joking around because if you look at defensive stocks like real estate investment trusts, like, if we look at the industrial sector, they were up 14 percent in January alone. And so, that doesn't necessarily make sense. So, you're seeing a rotation still happen.BARTIROMO: Jake, well, I'm really glad you're on the program this morning. You've got a lot to talk about. You are a veteran, you are a philanthropist. Tell us what you're doing right now.WOOD: Yes. So, the organization I run, Team Rubicon, we are responding to disasters around the world and here in the U.S. Our teams are still on the ground after Hurricane Michael in Florida. We're actually looking at doing some really interesting work with the Venezuelan crisis, where we're going to be sending some teams down to establish internet Wi-Fi access points in Colombia where over a million people have sought refuge to escape the conflict there.BARTIROMO: We've got a lot to talk about with that. So, thank you for that. And that's why we are happy you are here this morning. We're going to kick it off right now with U.S.-China trade in focus. The President is meeting with China's Vice Premier Liu He in the Oval Office. The President sounding optimistic about getting a deal done and making sure it's a good one. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This isn't going to be a small deal with China. It's either going to be a very big deal or it's going to be a deal that we'll just postpone for a little while. But we've been dealing with China, we've had a great relationship. I have a great relationship with President Xi. The relationship of my people to Chinese representatives has been very good.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Yes, and I was interested in seeing the President's tweet yesterday, Dagen, because it's exactly what we were speaking about yesterday when he said, look, China wants to open up its markets to financial services, but what's more? Because it doesn't really hit his manufacturing base. And that's really where the Chinese are. They want to open up to financial services but what else?MCDOWELL: Right. Well, we know that China -- and the details are kind of all over the place, he's agreed to buy 5 million tons more U.S. soybeans. Liu He, who you mentioned, said it was daily, but then somebody in the, I think -- they had to clarify that China has agreed to buy an additional 5 million metric tons of soybeans, but not daily with no time specified. And so, the central issues are the things that you've been talking about literally for years on the business network, and that is the theft of intellectual property. This is something that you brought up with every CEO that you've interviewed for such a long time. The espionage, the forced surrender of technology, and burdens put on U.S. businesses, even if they aren't trying to do business in China. This is a -- this is a heavy lift for the United States and for China. It has to be about more than just reducing our trade deficits with China. And that's going to be the -- what we're looking for.BARTIROMO: Let's not forget, when we had Steve Ballmer on, former President of Microsoft, he actually put a number to it. He said that the theft coming out of China costs Microsoft $10 billion a year in profits. An enormous number because 90 percent of the companies in China use the Microsoft's operating profit -- I'm sorry, the operating system, but only one percent actually pay for the Microsoft operating system.KELLY: Right. And the Chinese government has told Microsoft that, hey, like don't pursue this and we'll let our market still be open to you. When we saw during this trade war, they actually -- China shut down Microsoft's Bing search program for a few hours. So, we didn't know what was happening and Microsoft wasn't getting any read-through. So, they are -- they are actually using -- the Chinese government is actually using their power to influence American companies.BARTIROMO: Yes, but don't forget what Dagen just mentioned, they can promise that they're going to buy all of these tons of soybeans and everything else, but let's see if they actually follow through on it. That's another worry because they told us they would buy a certain amount of beef, and they didn't follow through on it.WOOD: Well, let's not forget about the national security angle here, too. I mean, the theft of things like stealth technology, A.I., I mean, there's a -- there's a real threat to our capability, projecting overseas with what they're doing there as well.BARTIROMO: Yes, the military issues, because A.I. is being used in the military.WOOD: A.I., stealth technology, we're seeing them come on board with their first aircraft carrier, things like that. They're stealing all of that from our defense contracts. We have to worry about that.BARTIROMO: You're right. And we've mentioned a number of times what they're doing is they are setting up military bases across the world. You know, setting up islands in the South China Sea and then setting up military bases there.MCDOWELL: It's interesting though how this administration with the crackdown on Huawei as one example. And Secretary Mnuchin told you this earlier in the week that these are -- that they've really tried to separate these issues with the Department of Justice dealing with Huawei. You have the Defense Department dealing with the threatening behavior of China in terms of defense. And then, you have Robert Lighthizer trying to negotiate trade and the President himself.BARTIROMO: I don't know how you separate it. I really don't.KELLY: Well, actually, you don't because you're brining up a salient point. We've seen -- this isn't just an American issue. We've actually seen our European allies come with us to the World Trade Organization and talk about this. And so, that's why you've seen actually the world coalesce or ...BARTIROMO: Just what happened in Poland. Big story in The Journal a week ago that, you know, China said to Poland, we will deal with your infrastructure, telecom we'll set it all up. And now, we recognize that actually they've been tapping into the infrastructure and the telecom intelligence.MCDOWELL: But at the negotiating table, it does, say, a Lighthizer look at his counterpart and say, I don't have anything to do with that in terms of, say, the crackdown on Huawei.BARTIROMO: That's true.MCDOWELL: So, the department -- that is the Department of Justice, I don't have anything to do with it. I'm here to talk to you about this, this, and this. So again, that's posturing.BARTIROMO: All right. We've got the jobs number coming out, big jobs coverage, coming up, the January Jobs Report is coming out at 8:00 a.m. -- 8:30, rather. We are all hands on deck at 8:00 a.m. as we identify where the jobs are, and what we're expecting. The estimate 165,000 for the month of January.KELLY: Yes, 165,000.BARTIROMO: All right. And we've got some good ADP numbers earlier in the week. Quick break before all of that. And then, the battle for the border wall, President Trump says he is willing to move on without Congress if they do not fund this border. Then former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz weighing in from his hometown on this battle. Back in a minute, right here.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Headlines across America this morning. Now this, the Dallas Morning News has a story about a Texas lawyer suing Apple over the FaceTime bug that allegedly allows eavesdropping on testimony. The lawyer claims the bug was used to listen in on sworn testimony in a deposition. The suit says that the bug is unreasonably dangerous to consumers. We've been talking a lot about that this week. And in South Dakota, the Argus Leader writes: "Governor Kristi Noem signs Constitutional Carry into law." Beginning on July 1, South Dakotans will be able to carry concealed handguns without a permit.Over to San Francisco Chronicle: "Warnings on soda advertising on hold as appeals court blocks court ordinance" is the headline. This ordinance would require the labels on sugary drinks to warn of increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay. After the 11 to zero ruling, the case is going back to district court.All right. We'll take a short break. It is Jobs Friday this morning. We are bringing you the numbers in about two hours from now. We've got plenty of energy sector earnings out this morning. All of the names that you want to hear about and the numbers when they hit the tape. We'll tell you how they impact markets. Plus, the New York Knicks trade away one of their star players to the Dallas Mavericks. But the real mystery is who they get in return. More on sports on the way, right here.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Jobs Friday this morning, February 1st. Your top stories just before 6:30 a.m. on the east coast. Earnings in focus once again, some of the big names reporting today include Honeywell hitting the tape any moment now, Exxon Mobil, Chevron also reporting this morning. We got a pretty good window into how the oil sector did today and a couple days next week as well. We'll break it all down for you.Investors are also waiting on the January Jobs Report out in just two hours from now. Here are the expectations: 165,000 jobs expected have been added to the economy in the month of January. The unemployment rate expected to stay steady at 3.9 percent. Keep it here for a special "JOBS IN AMERICA" coverage later this morning, where we identify where the jobs are, particularly the high-paying jobs, what jobs are going away. All that, coming up.Ahead of the release, markets looking like this, mixed story this morning. Dow Industrials up 31 points on the heels of a strong January. A fractional gain this morning on the Dow but the S&P is down a fraction as is the NASDAQ, down about one-half of one percent, 30 points lower on NASDAQ. This, after the markets finished mostly higher yesterday. The Dow down fractionally, 15 points lower. The S&P was up 23 points at the close yesterday, and the NASDAQ was up 98, and as you've been saying, the whole month of January, the best month for the S&P and the NASDAQ, in 30 years.European indices this morning, look like this, take a look at the numbers, the FT-100 up 38 points, one-half of one percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris up six points, fractional move there, and a fractional move lower in Germany, DAX Index down eight points.Asian markets overnight, also a mixed story, as you see, no real big moves except China, Shanghai Composite up one and a third percent.We are on countdown mode to the big game, the Super Bowl, Sunday, as Atlanta prepares for the big game. We will take you there, with a special guest, Shaquille O'Neal, joining Cheryl, who's on the ground.Knocking the Knicks, the downtrodden team trading away one of its superstars, leaving fans scratching their heads, details coming up, there.But our top story this half an hour, border wall funding showdown, that continues this morning. President Trump said yesterday, he is prepared to move without Congress, to build that wall in the southern border, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is dismissing the President and standing firm that no deal will include any money for any wall.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: There's not going to be any wall money in the -- in the legislation.TRUMP: If there's no wall, it doesn't work. She's just playing games. So, if there's no wall, it doesn't work. And we're building the wall right now, I mean, a lot of people don't know that, but we have a lot of wall under construction.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Even potential 2020 hopeful and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, weighed in on the border battle earlier this week. He was in Arizona.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HOWARD SCHULTZ, FORMER CEO OF STARBUCKS: I think border security is a significant issue, especially for a state like Arizona. But we have the world's greatest, most innovative tech companies in America.If I sat down with them, and I know most of them, and I said let's create the most creative, innovative plan, leveraging technology, to do everything we can to prevent bad people from coming across the border, we could do that. America was not based on building walls. America was based on building bridges.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining us right now to talk more about that is Washington Examiner Commentary Writer Tiana Lowe, Tiana, good to see you this morning, thanks so much. So, where do you see this going? Obviously, the Dems are not giving in, nor is the President. He may very well call a national emergency.TIANA LOWE, COMMENTARY WRITER, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: So, if he does actually wind up calling a national emergency, unfortunately, this does take pressure off of Congress to do their jobs. Instead what Trump needs to be doing is sticking to the messaging that he started two weeks ago, in which he said I am the one who's willing to compromise.I am offering a long term legal and constitutional solution to DACA recipients and TPS holders, and making it clear he is the one willing to be reasonable, willing to issue what is effectively a blank check to the Democrats, tell them to fulfill a key campaign promise, so he can follow-up on his, rather than unilaterally taking action.KELLY: Tiana, isn't the biggest problem here, for the Republicans, is the President, that President Trump would be setting by doing this, because you know, if the White House does change hands, they could be worried that a Democrat comes in and uses the same constitutional authority.LOWE: I mean, the new Democratic Party has made it abundantly clear that they're now the party of late-term abortions, the party of wealth taxes, I mean, and the precedent that this would set would be dangerous and it's even more scary if the courts do not blockade this, because then, if Democrats do win in 2020 or in 2024, who knows what they would try to pass with this power.BARTIROMO: Yes. Let's talk about taxing the wealthy for a moment, because Senator Bernie Sanders introduced a bill that would drastically increase estate taxes for individuals with estates worth over $3.5 million.This coming as 2020 hopeful Elizabeth Warren and New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have proposed major tax increases on the wealthy. Dagen, does any of this have any shot of taking place, of actually materializing these pie-in-the-sky proposals?MCDOWELL: So, let's break them down quickly. AOC, Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez, highest tax rate on income taxes, she wants at 70 percent for income over $10 million. That has -- that's based in, at least, reality, reality that's ugly, it goes back to, literally, the 1960s.BARTIROMO: The top rate is 37 percent. She wants to go to 70 percent.MCDOWELL: And it was not north of 90 before --WOOD: That's one income over $10 million.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: That was before John F. Kennedy and then LBJ actually lowered taxes, those big Democrats. But what Bernie Sanders is doing by tweaking the estate tax is in some way, what Elizabeth Warren is trying to do, and that is confiscating wealth.At least, Bernie Sanders is operating off of the existing tax system in this country. Elizabeth Warren is literally trying to promote something that is communist.BARTIROMO: Yes. It's confiscation.MCDOWELL: There would be unconstitutional that would never fly. So, why does it hurt her to throw out this crazy idea about taking -- basically, confiscating money from Americans who've earned it? It doesn't hurt her because she'd throw it out and she knows it will never go anywhere.BARTIROMO: Yes. You know what I think what has really struck me yesterday, is when she started to -- she was, sort of, back against the wall having to compare capitalism to socialism. And she said in a radio interview, I like capitalism, it's just that we can't have capitalism with all the cheating.And I'm thinking, where's the cheating? She's been a senator for how many years. She was running the Consumer Protection Agency. She was basically legislating. So, who's -- if there's cheating, I mean, is it her fault?KELLY: And she didn't find the cheating because the Wells Fargo scandal.BARTIROMO: The Wells Fargo, exactly. The L.A. Times had to break it.KELLY: Bingo.BARTIROMO: Yes.WOOD: One of the big wins over the last couple of years has been bringing back all of these offshore money and finally taking some of the revenue off of that. So that was, I mean, that was a big win at the last tax overhaul, am I correct?MCDOWELL: Yes. With Elizabeth Warren, again, like, is it cheating that Howard Schultz grew up in a housing project in Canarsie, and worked his way up to build one of the greatest American success stories --BARTIROMO: I totally agree.MCDOWELL: -- in the --in the last, literally, century. This is a brand that you -- that resonates with people, which is very hard to do with a modern-day corporation.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: And both her and AOC and all these Democrats who were in deep fear of this man, can't find anything nice to say about him.BARTIROMO: Tiana, what about that? Jump in here, because how is it possible that the left believes that this is a winning idea to confiscate people's wealth or punish people for working hard their whole lives and actually gaining some success?LOWE: Because they are living in an economic delusional where you tax something that's not even a cash flow, someone's just existing assets, and that will lead them to either offshore their money or leave the country entirely. We're already seeing this happen in France, and to a lesser extents within the U.S. We're seeing people leave states like California and people leave states like New York.BARTIROMO: Yes.LOWE: And the most insane thing is that these taxes won't even fund these progressive pet projects that people want. Medicare-for-all is valued at $32.6 trillion in the first decade, and the Green New Deal is $49 trillion in the first decade. Elizabeth Warren's wealth tax could only accrue under $3 trillion in the first decade, and then, exponentially less after that.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: Will you just stop talking about this wealth tax, like it's going to happen, because it's poppycock. It's just fiction --BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: -- basically be, as left as she could possibly be --BARTIROMO: But you know what else --MCDOWELL: -- without joining the communist party.BARTIROMO: You know what else is fiction, though? Getting rid of fossil fuels within 12 years, I mean, does that mean we're getting rid of airplanes? Are we getting rid of cars? I mean --MCDOWELL: Here's the --BARTIROMO: Pie-in-the-sky ideas.MCDOWELL: Here's the tweet from Ben Shapiro. Oh, OK, all the Democrats had to do was not seem crazy to potentially beat President Trump. But now, they are the party of infanticide, which is a story of this week, of taking away your gasoline-powered vehicle, of confiscating your wealth, of confiscating your guns, oh, and Kamala Harris, ending private health insurance in this country.So, this has been a trip and we are not even in the actual election year, a trip on a big bus to crazy down.BARTIROMO: Do people understand it, do you think?(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Yes, they understand this is campaign talk.MCDOWELL: You tell people that you are going to lose your health insurance through your employer --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: And you're going to have to buy whatever the government serves up cold.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: Then, you are alienating voters in this country.WOOD: I think Howard Schultz is a really interesting candidate.BARTIROMO: Yes, he is.WOOD: There's a lot of these really progressive issues, healthcare, education, you know, free education for all. He was able to accomplish through Starbucks, right? He built a company that offered universal healthcare to all of its employees, including hourly employees, part-time employees, offered education benefits to employees, I mean, that's really interesting private-sectors.BARTIROMO: Yes, and he's also identified that middle road, like I've said a hundred times. Most people are hanging out in the middle. You might lean to the right on some issues and lean to the left on others, but very few people have these monolithic ideas that you agree with, one side on everything.So, he has definitely identified a path. We'll see. Tiana, thank you so much for weighing in, this morning, good to see you.LOWE: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Tiana Lowe. Meanwhile, Intel has named Bob Swan its permanent CEO, Lauren Simonetti with details there and headlines, Lauren?SIMONETTI: I sure do, Maria. He was the company's Chief Financial Officer before being elevated to interim CEO in June. That is a pretty rare move, as only about seven percent of sitting CEOs in the S&P 500 and Fortune 500 are promoted from CFO. Let's take a look at shares of Intel, down about one percent from a year ago.There will be super tight security at Super Bowl 53, Sunday. F-16 fighter jets will patrol the skies above Mercedes Benz Stadium in Atlanta, enforcing a 30-mile restrictive flight zone. It's all part of a massive security operation, involving thousands of police and other law enforcement officials.Well, Pepsi is an official sponsor of this year's big game, but it's the home of rival, Coca-Cola. So, Pepsi appearing to call for a truce by putting up a life-sized statue of its founder, Caleb Bradham, clicking glasses with Coca-Cola founder, John Pemberton, outside the world of Coca- Cola museum.Coca-Cola says it welcomed the statue with a Coke and a smile. But when the statue was removed, Pepsi followed up with this tweet, using Coke's own together is beautiful slogan. It writes, Hey, Coca-Cola, we swung by but it looks like you weren't into having us over today. That doesn't feel very together is beautiful. Get it?A major trade in the NBA, still sending shockwaves across the league, the New York Knicks, sending their star, Kristaps Porzingis, to the Dallas Mavericks, in a 7-player deal, the swap raised some eyebrows because the Knicks didn't get a star in return.Part of their package includes Dennis Smith Jr. and two future draft picks. Porzingis and his agent brother, met with the Knicks executives yesterday, to express concern about the teams losing. Hours later, the star was packing for Dallas, and the Knicks, as you might know, own the worst record in the NBA. Yes.BARTIROMO: All right, thank you, Lauren. Coming up, Shaq's fun house, our own Cheryl Casone takes a tour with basketball great and Super Bowl 53 in Atlanta, we're going to take you there, then, giving back, how our panelist, Jake Woods' Team Rubicon is traveling the globe to aid in disaster relief, wait until you hear this, stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Since 2010, Team Rubicon has travelled the globe to help disaster relief. The organization's volunteers are primarily comprised of U.S. military service veterans who use their special skills to help those in need. Team Rubicon CEO, Jake Wood, is with us this morning as -- on our panel. And Jake, it's great to have you here this morning. Tell us about Team Rubicon and what inspired you to create it?WOOD: Yes. It seems Rubicon is an incredible organization. We have 100,000 volunteers here in the United States. And what we're primarily doing is taking skills and experiences that our military veterans have, you know, that our taxpayers have given them over the last, you know, two decades of war. And we're trying to repurpose those skills to help people in need. So, we're deploying all around the world, and all around the United States helping communities devasted by disasters and the humanitarian crises -- like the conflict in Venezuela right now.MCDOWELL: What has been the most -- you know, hardest in terms of disasters that you've tried to affect?WOOD: You know, we have responded to some of the most complex environments in the world over the last decade, whether it's the Haiti earthquake, Hurricane Harvey -- you know, these are complex situations that have left communities devastated. You know, we're still rebuilding homes in Houston, we rebuilt 500 homes in Puerto Rico. You know, that disaster in Puerto Rico was the perfect storm of bureaucracy and impact, and failure for people to act and make the right, tough decisions in the face of that type of uncertainty.KELLY: And you're a perfect example of private enterprise, right? I mean, so your not-for-profit --WOOD: Nonprofit, philanthropically-funded; we actually don't really take any money from the government and, you know, we're able to do the work through generous supporters, a lot of corporate supporters. So, you know, it allows us the flexibility to move in and make decisions very quickly without some of that red tape that other organizations might have.MCDOWELL: On that note, in terms of your structure, how do you get aid quickly to those most in need? How do you make those assessments in a disaster situation?WOOD: We have incredibly high trained volunteers. You know, they both have -- their leadership experience and the technical experience from their time in the military, but we also have provided them with a system and the necessary tools, and then we empower them to go and move into these communities. And quickly, the aids with the local officials, and begin to get work, you know, citizens very, very quickly.BARTIROMO: And Farmers Insurance announced it's going to be committing $1 million to Team Rubicon to support disaster --WOOD: That's right. Jeff Daley, their CEO, and all the Farmers Insurance, they've been tremendous partners of ours over the years. You know, it helps that Jeff Daley is fellow Wisconsin badger, so --MCDOWELL: Do you have enough money? How much more money do you need annually?WOOD: Do we have enough money? That's a tricky question. Our budget is funded for this year, but you know, we're always looking to grow. The reality is, there's a massive unmet need here. There are communities that are being impacted all across the country. And typically, these rural communities in Middle America that are most adversely impacted, because they often don't get the federal declarations for the long-term recovery components. So, it's really important that private philanthropy fill in those gaps. So, can we do more if we had more? Absolutely.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a great story. Thank you for what you're doing. Jake, we're happy you're here today. As you've been talking, Merck reported earnings, it has beat better than expected revenue at 10.9 -- well, revenue looks in line but the earnings per share is better than estimates at $1.40 versus $1.30. We'll check Merck's shares when we come right back. A quick break and then a basketball player to a football fan. We're counting down to the Super Bowl with the one and only Shaquille O'Neal. We are live in Atlanta right after this with Cheryl. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Well, the Super Bowl is just two days away. Our very own Cheryl Casone is celebrating in Atlanta with Shaq for one giant extravaganza. Cheryl, good morning.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. He is 7'1", so he is a giant; a towering figure of the NBA, a four-time NBA champion and really one of the nicest guys in basketball. Shaquille O'Neal, though, thought that although Super Bowl parties that his dad went to, and your dad went to, we're kind of well, boring. So, he decided to put on his own version of fun this year at the Super Bowl.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)SHAQUILLE O'NEAL, PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL PLAYER: Welcome to Shaq's Clubhouse.CASONE: Welcome to Shaq's Clubhouse.O'NEAL: This could be the VIP area.CASONE: You got a VIP area. What kind of VIP do you expect here?O'NEAL: Everybody -- NFL, NBA, actors, actresses. The stage -- there's going to be a lot of people on stage. TSL, (INAUDIBLE), Tupee, (INAUDIBLE), myself.CASONE: I hear you're going to be deejaying, and performing with Cirque du Soleil. And you've been practicing, right? Where have you been practicing with Cirque du Soleil?O'NEAL: I'm not telling. There could people on stage playing sports, swords swallows. People hanging from ceilings, and all that good stuff.CASONE: I know that Shaquille O'Neal, the basketball player. Talk about Shaquille O'Neal, the deejay.O'NEAL: It's all like a game 7 situation. People pay money to come see me perform. And I do the best that I can do and hope that they really like it.CASONE: So, there's more to this place. I think we should go -- let's go play some games; I want to actually have some fun with Shaquille.O'NEAL: Don't get mad when you get your feelings hurt, because I'm very competitive.CASONE: All right.O'NEAL: Oh, almost.CASONE: That's 10 points.O'NEAL: I'm either going to tie you or beat you.CASONE: All right. Shaquille, I got to tell you, thank you for the tour of the funhouse. Super Bowl weekend, Super Bowl LIII in Atlanta. Final thoughts?O'NEAL: To all the folks, I hope there's a very competitive game. I hope you're going to have fun, whatever party you root into and this is my favorite person. Thank you very much.(END VIDEOTAPE)CASONE: All right. And just to clarify for all of the MORNINGS WITH MARIA viewers, I wanted ski ball, everybody. I want to make that clear. He thought he had it on me, but he didn't. All right, I want to show a few of the things that you can buy here at the NFL shop and, of course, online, if you want to participate in the Super Bowl. They've got this sparkly fun house -- which of course, they got the Cowboys one. You know me, Maria, of course, I did. This is $1495. This purse right here, $30.00. You can get this shirt right here. These run about $40.00 as well.Of course, all of my New York friends that are broadcasting to this morning, of course, the Giants teddy bear. I had to show you that right here. And of course, let's look at that, $29.00, and you've the Alyssa Milano sweatshirt, this is $70.00. And then, of course, the Michael Vick - - this is one of the most expensive things. It's a leather hat. Michael Vick actually debuting a limited-edition leather hat, $110 for these, Maria. So, anyway, there's all kinds of things to spend your money on at the Super Bowl or if you just want to run around and play sports with some of the greatest names on the NBA and the NFL. You can do that too. I tried to do both when I'm here.BARTIROMO: You did a lot.KELLY: Cheryl, it's Kevin Kelly, here's the real question: did Shaquille O'Neal get on the mechanical bull? I saw you ride that alone, but I want to know how many seconds he lasted?CASONE: He tells me -- and I need to Google this. He says, oh no, I was on for nine minutes when I was in San Antonio. I mean, I don't know if I believe it, but you know --WOOD: The reality is, Shaq's legs probably would've hang over down to the ground.KELLY: The real thing is, the mechanical bull won't shack, I guess, right? I mean, that's the opposite.BARTIROMO: That was crazy that you thought on that mechanical bull.CASONE: You know, Maria, it's hard. And you know, of course, being Texas, I tried to represent a look all southern, but the truth is, I didn't do so great on that. I got to tell you.BARTIROMO: You did great.

How Trump Can Challenge ChinaAtlantic OnlineJanuary 1, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1019 wordsByline: Reihan SalamBodyPresident Donald Trump has good reason to denounce China's tolerance of intellectual-property theft and various other trade abuses, as even his harshest critics will acknowledge. And there are tentative signs that U.S. negotiators are securing concessions from Beijing on market access for U.S. firms and the protection of their intellectual property. But a face-saving deal along these lines won't really change China's behavior. To do that, Trump ought to play against type by championing the interests of ordinary Chinese workers. That would pressure the Chinese party-state right where it is most vulnerable-and drive home the point that our quarrel is not with the Chinese people, but with the Chinese party-state.Having witnessed the Arab Spring, and the speed with which the self-immolation of a Tunisian street vendor sparked a massive wave of protests, the Chinese Communist Party's elite chose to strengthen its strict censorship regime and to elevate Xi Jinping, who had long argued that the party-state could reap the benefits of a growing digital economy while tightening the grip of its digital police state, to the role of paramount leader.The keystone of these efforts is China's Great Firewall. It is, from one vantage point, an extraordinary triumph. At the very same time Chinese entrepreneurs have come to dominate global e-commerce and mobile payments, and as the number of billion-dollar tech start-ups in China approaches the number in the United States, the Chinese party-state has managed to stringently limit the discussion of politically sensitive ideas and events in digital media. In doing so, it has limited the spread of terrorist attacks and peaceful political dissent, both of which have a viral quality.But now, as China experiences a growth slowdown-one that is already causing serious ructions among middle-class investors, many of whom have been devastated by            the collapse of its lightly regulated peer-to-peer lending platforms, and low-skilled migrant workers, who've been hit by the offshoring of low-wage manufacturing employment to lower-cost locales elsewhere in Asia-the Firewall, and the party-state it shields from criticism, face a test.China's social-media censors must anticipate which stories might fuel opposition, which could come from workers organizing wildcat strikes, the Marxist Maoists of the campus left, or the increasingly vocal nationalist right. Or perhaps it could come from salaried professionals in big cities            bristling at the prospect of finally having to pay income taxes. Sooner or later, even the most sophisticated censorship regime will buckle. The only question is when. And that is why American policy makers ought to adopt a new approach to China.Consider that the party-state has been particularly keen to police conversations about Donald Trump's trade war and its own agonized response. For the most part, this has been reported as            a reflection of Beijing's desire to preserve its room for maneuver. If public anger over U.S. tariffs were to boil over, it would become much harder for the party-state to offer concessions to the Americans.There is another possibility, however, which is that at least some Chinese citizens are cheering on Trump's hard-line approach, as the            pro-democracy activist Chen Guangcheng recently suggested in The Washington Post: "It might seem counterintuitive to many Americans that people in China would call for more tariffs, as though welcoming economic damage at home. But most ordinary Chinese people don't see it that way. They commonly believe tariffs will hurt the Communist Party far more than regular people, since it's the party that manipulates trade to line its pockets and prop up the economy."Yet it is striking that Trump has done virtually nothing to encourage this line of thinking, despite the fact that doing so would surely redound to his, and more importantly, the world's, benefit. To Trump, all that seems to matter is narrowing the bilateral trade deficit between the U.S. and China. In this regard, he is sure to be disappointed. Even if the bilateral trade deficit between the two countries were to shrink, overall trade balances are driven by how people in different countries choose to save and spend.One of the central facts about the Chinese economy, as Matthew C. Klein of Barron's            has observed, is that Chinese workers receive only a small fraction of what they produce, thanks to a tax system that leaves the urban rich untouched while soaking the poor, a rigged financial system, and labor-market rules that strip workers of bargaining power. The result, according to Klein, is that "China may be the workshop of the world, but the Chinese people cannot afford to buy what they produce. Instead, foreigners buy Chinese goods with money stolen from Chinese households by the Chinese government."Workers in the United States and other market democracies also bear the consequences, as artificially inexpensive Chinese imports "come at the price of lost jobs and rising debt." The surest way to ease tensions between China and the United States over the long run is therefore to allow low- and middle-income Chinese workers to keep more of what they earn. Though this wouldn't guarantee a lower bilateral trade deficit, boosting Chinese household consumption would almost certainly boost China's consumption of imports, including U.S. imports. The interests of Chinese workers and U.S. workers aren't at odds. They are perfectly aligned. It is the Chinese party-state that profits from the suppression of household consumption, and that channels vast resources to party members and politically connected industrialists, not the Chinese people.That is the vulnerability that Trump can now exploit. Imagine if the president gave one major public address to that effect, ideally on Chinese soil. And if this all sounds too out of character for a man who has shown little appetite for such moralistic crusading, substitute one of the many Democrats looking to make a mark in the race for the party's presidential nomination. The social-media censors would find themselves awfully busy.Load-Date: January 2, 2019End of Document

The Chinese investment boom in America is overCNN WireJanuary 14, 2019 Monday 8:26 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 623 wordsByline: By Matt Egan, CNN BusinessDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  The Chinese investment boom into America has almost completely vanished.Foreign direct investment from China into the United States plummeted by 83% in 2018, according to a report released Monday by law firm Baker McKenzie.Not only are Chinese firms drastically scaling back investments, but they've embarked on a record-setting wave of sales of real estate, hospitality and entertainment businesses. Including those sales, net Chinese foreign direct investment into North America turned negative in 2018 to the tune of $5.5 billion, according to Baker McKenzie. Another $12 billion of Chinese assets around the world are expected to be sold this year, the report said. The evaporation of Chinese money in the United States reflects self-imposed restrictions by Beijing on investments outside the country. The trend was exacerbated, though, because Washington has been tightening foreign investment reviews. The US-China trade war is also a contributor. "The Chinese put handcuffs on themselves on investing abroad," said Scott Kennedy, director of the Project on Chinese Business and Political Economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "With the arrival of the Trump administration, the United States put a not-for-sale sign on the door."After spending heavily on American real estate, transportation and infrastructure, Chinese investment in these sectors has "largely disappeared," the Baker McKenzie report found.China has retreated from other major markets --- foreign direct investment into as a whole Europe tumbled by 70% in 2018, for example. But the United States has experienced the sharpest decline.Some large economies, including France, Germany, Spain and Sweden, experienced an increase of investment from China, Baker McKenzie said.Canada also bucked the trend, with Chinese investment spiking by 80% to $2.7 billion last year. Including divestitures, Canada actually enjoyed more Chinese investment than the United States in 2018, Baker McKenzie said. Chinese investment into the United States peaked at $45.6 billion in 2016, a year that saw insurance giant HNA splurge on a 25% stake in Hilton and Anbang Insurance acquire a string of high-end hotels. But foreign direct investment slowed to $29 billion in 2017, when China imposed restrictions on outbound investments in a bid to stem capital outflows. Investment in the United States then shrank to just $4.8 billion last year amid Washington's crackdown on China --- a "huge drop," Kennedy said. In the meantime, US officials are scrutinizing Chinese investment with more intensity. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has rejected several high-profile transactions, including Broadcom's (AVGO) $117 billion bid for Qualcomm (QCOM). Last year, President Donald Trump signed legislation expanding the power of CFIUS to block foreign deals for national security purposes. At the same time, some of China's most voracious buyers of American assets have come under pressure from Beijing. For example, early last year Beijing seized control of Anbang, the insurance giant that in 2014 completed a $1.95 billion purchase of the iconic Waldorf Astoria. The Chinese government later pumped nearly $10 billion into Anbang. Likewise, HNA, a conglomerate that grew out of an airline, has gone on an epic buying spree in recent years. The Chinese company purchased chunks of everything from Deutsche Bank (DB) to Hilton. But HNA has since moved to unload businesses in response to Beijing's crackdown on foreign purchases and concerns about the insurance company's massive debt. "HNA had its wings massively clipped," said Kennedy. TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

China's chief trade negotiator will visit the US at the end of JanuaryCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 18, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 436 wordsBody Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, the country's chief trade negotiator with the United States, will hold further talks in Washington on January 30 and 31, the official said.  The end-January visit will take place one month before the expiration of the current truce in the Sino-US trade dispute, at the end of which Trump threatens to impose new tariffs on the Chinese product, reported AFP.  Liu He will meet with US leaders to contain the trade frictions and "work together to go beyond the consensus" achieved by Presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump during their meeting on December 1, the spokesman of the Ministry of Commerce told reporters , Gao Feng.  Negotiators of lower rank met in early January in Beijing.  However, the announcement by the press that Chinese telecom giant Huawei could have new problems in the United States could complicate Liu He's visit.  US justice is conducting an investigation into suspicions of technology theft by the company, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.  Federal prosecutors suspect that Huawei stole technology secrets from US firms that work with the group, the newspaper said.  The Huawei case  The arrest in Canada at the beginning of December, at the request of the United States, of Meng Wanzhou, the financial director and daughter of the founder of Huawei, provoked the wrath of the Chinese government.  "Everyone understands the real American intentions, which is to use all possible state mechanisms to repress and slander Chinese high-tech companies," said Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry on Thursday.  Two Canadians were arrested in China after Meng's arrest and another was sentenced to death for drug trafficking, decisions interpreted as reprisals by observers.  Huawei has been targeted by Washington for years for its alleged links with the Chinese government.  Liu He will travel to the United States at the invitation of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce representative Robert Lighthizer, said Gao Feng.  While waiting for an agreement, Trump agreed to suspend until March 2 an increase in import tariffs from 10% to 25% on a series of Chinese products that represent 200,000 million dollars annually.  In addition to a chronic trade imbalance, the White House reproaches the Chinese government for the difficulty of accessing the Chinese market and "unfair" business practices, particularly the violation of intellectual property rights and the obligation of technology transfers.  The entry The main Chinese trade negotiator will visit the US at the end of January was first published in Diario La República. Load-Date: January 18, 2019End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 26 of 345CHINESE TECH GIANT HUAWEI TAKES US GOVERNMENT TO COURT  Page 28 of 345ADDRESS AT THE RECEPTION IN HONOUR OF ISA OFFICIALS BY H.E.
