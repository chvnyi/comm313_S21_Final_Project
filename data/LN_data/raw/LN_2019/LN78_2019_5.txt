Global Wet Chemicals Market for Electronics & Semiconductor Applications - Growth, Trends, Analysis & Forecasts (2019-2024) - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireJuly 23, 2019 Tuesday 9:29 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 1244 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Wet Chemicals Market for Electronics & Semiconductor Applications - Growth, Trends, and Forecast (2019 - 2024)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The wet chemicals market for electronics and semiconductor applications is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.36% during the forecast period of 2019-2024.Rising demand from modern technology industries and surging demand for hydrogen peroxide from the semiconductor industry are expected to drive the growth of the market studied. However, sudden dip in the semiconductor industry and waste management of semiconductors are anticipated to hinder the growth of the market studied.By product type, the hydrogen peroxide segment accounted for the largest share of 25%, in 2018. By geography, Asia-Pacific dominated the global market. In 2018. It also expected to register the fastest CAGR of 7.05% over the forecast period.Key Market TrendsIncreasing Demand for Hydrogen Peroxide• The hydrogen peroxide chemical is estimated to hold the highest share in the global market, on account of its extensive use in the semiconductor industry as a wet chemical, from the long-established applications in the etching of printed circuit boards to the more recent application of ultra-high purity grades in the semiconductor production.• The manufacturing and processing of semiconductor wafers mainly involve wet chemistry steps, where hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is used in combination with other chemicals for cost-effective cleaning and etching. The main application of hydrogen peroxide in the electronics industry include:• In the first step of RCA cleaning, it is used with ammonia (removal of organic impurities and particles on wafers)• In the third step of RCA cleaning, it is used with hydrochloric acid (removal of metallic impurities on wafers)• Finally, with sulfuric acid in piranha acid, for residual organic film removal• High purity hydrogen peroxide is a key chemical in the manufacturing of semiconductor chips. The demand for ultra-pure hydrogen peroxide increases with the increase in the complexity of computer chips and the miniaturization of circuits in them.• Due to rapid expansion in the electronics industry, the demand for electronic chemicals used to clean and etch large-scale integrated circuits and semiconductors has also surged. To offset that demand, companies have started investing in new hydrogen peroxide production plants.• For instance, in 2018, Solvay announced to open a new electronic grade hydrogen peroxide plant in China. With an annual capacity up to 24,000 metric ton, the new facility is likely to supply the semiconductor industry with an essential chemical agent for the production of integrated electronic circuits.• All the aforementioned factors, in turn, are expected to increase the demand for wet chemicals in the electronics and semiconductor applications.Asia-Pacific to Dominate the World Market• Asia-Pacific region dominated the global market share in 2018. With growing demand for the electronics in the countries such as China, India, and Japan, the usage of wet chemicals is increasing in the region.• The semiconductors market in China is currently lagging behind. Currently, China is the net importer of semiconductor chips with China manufacturing less than 20% of semiconductors used. As part of the country's ambitious Made in China 2025 plan, the Chinese government has announced their decision to reach output of USD 305 billion by 2030, and therefore meet 80% of its domestic demand. In 2018, China imported semiconductor chips worth USD 312 billion.• Similarly, over 90% of the IC's that are currently being used by China are either imported or domestically manufactured by foreign chipmakers. In 2018, the total imported volume of integrated circuits in China was about 417.60 billion units, representing an increase of 10.80% Y-o-Y over 2017. The total imported value of these integrated circuits was about USD 312.06 billion, representing an increase of 20% Y-o-Y over 2017.• The Chinese government has declared to invest above USD100 billion over the following decade to catch up with the United States in semiconductor technology. Some of the cities which have announced their plans for the production facilities for semiconductors include Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu, Hefei, Shenzhen, Wuhan, Xiamen and Liaoning, and Shaanxi. Therefore with the establishment of new semiconductor manufacturing facilities, the demand for wet chemicals is expected to rapidly increase over the forecast period.• The aforementioned factors are contributing to the increasing demand for wet chemicals consumption in the region during the forecast period.Competitive LandscapeThe wet chemicals market for electronics and semiconductor applications is highly concentrated, with top five players accounting for over 60% of the market share in 2018. Major players in the market include KMG Chemicals, BASF, Avantor, Honeywell International, and KANTO Chemical Co, amongst othersKey Topics Covered1 INTRODUCTION1.1 Study Deliverables1.2 Study Assumptions1.3 Scope of the Study2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY4 MARKET DYNAMICS4.1 Drivers4.1.1 Rising Demand from Modern Technology Industries4.1.2 Surging Demand for Hydrogen Peroxide from the Semiconductor Industry4.2 Restraints4.2.1 Waste Management for Semiconductors4.2.2 Sudden Dip in the Semiconductor Market4.3 Industry Value-Chain Analysis4.4 Porters 5 Force Analysis4.4.1 Bargaining Power of Suppliers4.4.2 Bargaining Power of Consumers4.4.3 Threat of New Entrants4.4.4 Threat of Substitute Products and Services4.4.5 Degree of Competition5 MARKET SEGMENTATION5.1 Product Type5.1.1 Acetic Acid5.1.2 Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA)5.1.3 Hydrogen Peroxide5.1.4 Hydrochloric Acid5.1.5 Ammonium Hydroxide5.1.6 Hydrofluoric Acid5.1.7 Nitric Acid5.1.8 Phosphoric Acid5.1.9 Sulfuric Acid5.1.10 Other Product Types5.2 Application5.2.1 Semiconductor5.2.1.1 Cleaning5.2.1.2 Etching5.2.2 Other Electronic Applications5.2.2.1 Integrated Circuit (IC) Manufacturing5.2.2.2 Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) Manufacturing5.3 Geography5.3.1 Asia-Pacific5.3.1.1 China5.3.1.2 India5.3.1.3 Japan5.3.1.4 South Korea5.3.1.5 Taiwan5.3.1.6 Rest of Asia-Pacific5.3.2 North America5.3.2.1 United States5.3.2.2 Canada5.3.2.3 Mexico5.3.3 Europe5.3.3.1 Germany5.3.3.2 United Kingdom5.3.3.3 France5.3.3.4 Russia5.3.3.5 Rest of Europe5.3.4 Rest of the World6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE6.1 Mergers & Acquisitions, Joint Ventures, Collaborations, and Agreements6.2 Market Share Analysis6.3 Strategies Adopted by Leading Players6.4 Company Profiles6.4.1 Avantor Inc.6.4.2 BASF SE6.4.3 Eastman Chemical Company6.4.4 FUJIFILM Corporation6.4.5 Honeywell International LLC6.4.6 Kanto Chemical Co.

The main application of hydrogen peroxide in the electronics industry include:- In the first step of RCA cleaning, it is used with ammonia (removal of organic impurities and particles on wafers)- In the third step of RCA cleaning, it is used with hydrochloric acid (removal of metallic impurities on wafers)- Finally, with sulfuric acid in "piranha acid", for residual organic film removal- High purity hydrogen peroxide is a key chemical in the manufacturing of semiconductor chips. The demand for ultra-pure hydrogen peroxide increases with the increase in the complexity of computer chips and the miniaturization of circuits in them.- Due to rapid expansion in the electronics industry, the demand for electronic chemicals used to clean and etch large-scale integrated circuits and semiconductors has also surged. To offset that demand, companies have started investing in new hydrogen peroxide production plants.- For instance, in 2018, Solvay announced to open a new electronic grade hydrogen peroxide plant in China. With an annual capacity up to 24,000 metric ton, the new facility is likely to supply the semiconductor industry with an essential chemical agent for the production of integrated electronic circuits.- All the aforementioned factors, in turn, are expected to increase the demand for wet chemicals in the electronics and semiconductor applications.Asia-Pacific Region to Dominate the Market- Asia-Pacific region dominated the global market share in 2018. With growing demand for the electronics in the countries such as China, India, and Japan, the usage of wet chemicals is increasing in the region.- The semiconductors market in China is currently lagging behind. Currently, China is the net importer of semiconductor chips with China manufacturing less than 20% of semiconductors used. As part of the country's ambitious "Made in China 2025" plan, the Chinese government has announced their decision to reach output of USD 305 billion by 2030, and therefore meet 80% of its domestic demand. In 2018, China imported semiconductor chips worth USD 312 billion.- Similarly, over 90% of the IC's that are currently being used by China are either imported or domestically manufactured by foreign chipmakers. In 2018, the total imported volume of integrated circuits in China was about 417.60 billion units, representing an increase of 10.80% Y-o-Y over 2017. The total imported value of these integrated circuits was about USD 312.06 billion, representing an increase of 20% Y-o-Y over 2017.- The Chinese government has declared to invest above USD100 billion over the following decade to catch up with the United States in semiconductor technology. Some of the cities which have announced their plans for the production facilities for semiconductors include Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu, Hefei, Shenzhen, Wuhan, Xiamen and Liaoning, and Shaanxi. Therefore with the establishment of new semiconductor manufacturing facilities, the demand for wet chemicals is expected to rapidly increase over the forecast period.- The aforementioned factors are contributing to the increasing demand for wet chemicals consumption in the region during the forecast period.Competitive LandscapeThe wet chemicals market for electronics and semiconductor applications is highly concentrated, with top five players accounting for over 60% of the market share in 2018. Major players in the market include KMG Chemicals, BASF SE, Avantor Inc., Honeywell International LLC and KANTO CHEMICAL CO.

Global Electric Bus Market Set to Witness a CAGR of 12.14% During 2019-2024 - BYD Leads the Market, Followed by YutongPR NewswireJuly 26, 2019 Friday 5:00 PM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 935 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, July 26, 2019 BodyPR NewswireThe"Electric Bus Market - Growth, Trends, and Forecast (2019 - 2024)"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.The global electric bus vehicle market is expected to register a CAGR of 12.14% during the forecast period, 2019-2024.Key HighlightsThe growth of the electric bus market has been attributed to the increasing concerns on the depletion of fossil fuels and environmental pollution. To tackle the above issues, many governments across the world have initiated changes in the public transportation system by replacing the heavy-duty diesel and gasoline run buses with zero-emission electric buses. Asia-Pacific has been leading the global electric bus market with increased government initiatives in countries, like India, China, and Japan. However, fluctuating in government policies and subsidies is likely to impact the growth of electric buses. For instance, the Chinese government is planning to withdraw subsidies on electric buses by 2020, which is further anticipated to impact the cost of electric buses in the country during the forecast period.Major Market TrendsBattery Electric Bus to Witness GrowthTransit agencies across various countries have been significantly promoting to adopt more electric buses for public transportation in the coming years. Among the regions, Asia-pacific and North America are likely to show a high adoption rate of battery electric bus during the forecast period, owing to their on-going purchase orders for e-buses. For instance, in North America, among several states of United States, California identified as the primary state on electric buses usage and its transport authorities have agreed to operate 357 electric buses, including purchased and ordered buses.Additionally, across California, mayors from Sacramento, Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland, have signed a letter to the California Air Resources Board (CARB) in 2018, urging the transit agency to accelerate the deployment of electric bus.While in Asia-Pacific, especially in India, Olectr-BYD has deployed nearly 100 electric buses in the Indian market as of 2018 and is expected to continue to increase its e-bus numbers in the country during the forecast period.Asia-Pacific Dominates the Global MarketIn Asia-Pacific, China is the largest manufacturer and consumer of e-buses in the world. The domestic demand is being supported by national sales targets, favorable laws, supportive subsidies, and municipal air-quality targets.However, in 2017 and 2018, the sales of battery electric buses had declined due to the changes in policies and subsidies between national and local governments in the country.During the forecast period, China may continue to see growth in the adoption of electric buses, as more than 30 Chinese cities have made plans to achieve 100% electrified public transit by 2020, including Guangzhou, Zhuhai, Dongguan, Foshan, and Zhongshan in the Pearl River Delta, as well as Nanjing, Hangzhou, Shaanxi, and Shandong. As of December 2018, Shenzhen, one of the Chinese megacities, has nearly 16,000 electric buses that are operating.Competitive LandscapeSome of the major players in the electric bus market, includes BYD, Volvo, Daimler, Yutong, etc. Among them, BYD continues to rank top in the market, owing to its growing orders for electric bus from domestic, as well as international markets. Companies, like BYD and Yutong, have covered a major share of more than 40% in the China market in 2018.Key Topics Covered1 INTRODUCTION1.1 Study Deliverables1.2 Study Assumptions1.3 Scope of the Study2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY4 MARKET DYNAMICS4.1 Market Overview4.2 Market Drivers4.3 Market Restraints4.4 Industry Attractiveness - Porter's Five Force Analysis4.4.1 Threat of New Entrants4.4.2 Bargaining Power of Buyers/Consumers4.4.3 Bargaining Power of Suppliers4.4.4 Threat of Substitute Products4.4.5 Intensity of Competitive Rivalry4.5 Technology Trends5 MARKET SEGMENTATION5.1 By Vehicle Type5.1.1 Battery Electric Bus5.1.2 Plug-in Hybrid Electric Bus5.2 By Consumer Segment5.2.1 Government5.2.2 Fleet Operators5.3 Geography5.3.1 North America5.3.1.1 United States5.3.1.2 Canada5.3.1.3 Mexico5.3.1.4 Rest of North America5.3.2 Europe5.3.2.1 Germany5.3.2.2 United Kingdom5.3.2.3 France5.3.2.4 Spain5.3.2.5 Russia5.3.2.6 Rest of Europe5.3.3 Asia Pacific5.3.3.1 China5.3.3.2 India5.3.3.3 Japan5.3.3.4 Rest of Asia-Pacific5.3.4 South America5.3.4.1 Brazil5.3.4.2 Argentina5.3.4.3 Rest of South America5.3.5 Middle East and Africa5.3.5.1 Saudi Arabia5.3.5.2 South Africa5.3.5.3 Rest of Middle East and Africa6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE6.1 Vendor Market Share6.2 Company Profiles6.2.1 Daimler AG6.2.2 Anhui Ankai Automobile Co.

The global economy just dodged another bullet. But the US-China trade truce won't fix itCNN WireJuly 1, 2019 Monday 2:26 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 767 wordsByline: Analysis by Charles Riley, CNN BusinessDateline: LONDON (CNN Business) BodyLONDON (CNN Business) --  Stocks and oil prices shot higher Monday after the United States and China announced a cease fire in their trade war. Yet the fragile truce does little to alleviate pressure on a global economy wounded by earlier exchanges of fire that hit manufacturing and trade. President Donald Trump agreed at the G20 summit in Japan to hold off on new tariffs, but US taxes on $250 billion in Chinese imports and the retaliatory measures they provoked remain in place. Trump also lifted some restrictions on Huawei, but he said the fate of the Chinese tech company wouldn't be decided until the final stage of talks on a bigger trade deal.Most significantly, there was no breakthrough on the fundamental issues that led to conflict between the world's two largest economies. Analysts think the lack of progress means that existing tariffs won't be lifted anytime soon, keeping pressure on supply chains and a lid on global growth."Restarting trade talks does not mean that the United States and China will reach a deal any time soon," said Tommy Wu of Oxford Economics. "Negotiations will continue to be difficult, given the tough stance that the two sides would likely assume."Tariffs have weighed heavily on the global economy this year. They have helped to depress factory activity in China, where growth was already slowing, and contributed to a decline in global trade volumes. Multinational companies have sought to mitigate the risk to their supply chains, but many --- including tech giants like Apple --- remain vulnerable to new US taxes and potential retaliation by China. The International Monetary Fund in April cut its forecast for global growth this year to 3.3%, warning that a sharp escalation in trade tensions could wreak havoc on supply chains and disrupt industries such as carmaking. That would be the weakest rate of expansion since the great recession of 2009. In May, the JPMorgan global manufacturing index slumped to its lowest level since 2012. Consumers are being hurt too: American companies including Costco and Walmart have said they are raising prices because of tariffs."The global economy has hit a rough patch: investment has weakened and trade has slowed significantly, with export and import growth rates at their lowest level since the great financial crisis," IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said at the G20.Central banks are now being forced to step into the breach. The US Federal Reserve has signaled that it could make two rate cuts this year in response to concerns about Trump's trade policies, increased business debt and weakness in manufacturing. The European Central Bank has signaled it could even return to printing money. India and Australia have already cut rates.The big question now is how talks between the United States and China proceed. Trump wants Beijing to open its vast market to more American companies, and to reduce government subsidies for Chinese companies that give them a leg up on foreign competitors. The American president has also demanded that Beijing refrain from stealing intellectual property from US companies.China's leaders have meanwhile denied US allegations of wrongdoing and resisted making major changes to an economic system that has lifted hundreds of millions of its citizens out of poverty. Beijing has increased its spending and cut taxes to help cushion the blow to its economy from the trade war. Analysts at Berenberg, a German investment bank, said Monday that the US-China truce should be treated with caution. They noted that a meeting last year between Trump and Xi at the G20 summit in Brazil ended on a positive note, but talks later broke down leading both sides to impose new tariffs. "Progress towards an eventual resolution that ends with both sides removing the tariffs enacted since Trump became US president and perhaps going further with a broad US-China trade deal remains far off," wrote Berenberg's Holger Schmieding and Kallum Pickering. Trump's desire for a strong US economy and stock market heading into the 2020 presidential election could deter him from further escalating the trade war with China, or opening a new front with major trading partners such as Canada, Mexico or the European Union."A US economy that remains sufficiently strong is Trump's best bet for reelection," said the Berenberg analysts. "As US economy data has been softening of late, these recent positive steps on trade could be a sign that Trump is ready to ease up for a while to keep the economy on track."TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Electric Vehicles Market Sales Will Surge to 4 Million Units in 2020, 12 Million Units in 2025 and 21 Million Units in 2030PR NewswireJuly 3, 2019 Wednesday 8:00 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1026 wordsDateline: PUNE, India, July 3, 2019 BodyPR NewswireReportsnReports added new research report Global and China Electric Vehicle (BEV, PHEV) Industry Report, 2019-2025 at its online research database. As per current cost, the market will be at a tipping point in 2022 when a battery electric vehicle will have almost the same cost as a fuel vehicle, which means electric vehicle can be selected on an equal footing, and whenElectric Vehicles Market will see an expanding share of the automotive market.In 2018, 2 million electric vehicles were sold worldwide, and the sales figure will surge to 4 million units in 2020, 12 million units in 2025 and 21 million units in 2030 with the cuts in production costs.By 2030, battery electric vehicles will account for 70% of electric vehicles. Amid the burgeoning sales of electric vehicles, the sales volume of fuel vehicles will stabilize, and start to take a nosedive from 2024.Policies will serve as a stimulus for the electric vehicle industry in a long period of time, and the fuel economy and emission standards of the world's major automotive markets have been finalized. To be in line with these mandatory measures (for example, the EU vehicle carbon dioxide emission goal), the electric vehicle market will evolve fleetly. Plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles will make up 10% of the global vehicle sales volume by 2025, and 22% by 2030, of which battery electric vehicles will command more than half of the total EV sales.Get Discount on Electric Vehicles Market (BEV, PHEV) Research Report athttps://www.reportsnreports.com/contacts/discount.aspx?name=2303335 As the US and European governments vigorously promote the development of electric vehicle technology, China will become the main battlefield for EV makers in the next two decades. Up to date, China's electric vehicle industry has passed through incubation, and the Chinese government is downsizing subsidies for EV purchase and will completely terminate the subsidy in 2020. The demand may be somewhat suppressed in the next two years, but then it will resume strong growth with the advent of the era of economical electric vehicles. In 2025, China's EV sales will reach 5 million units, a 20% share of China's automobile sales. By 2040, China's EV sales will occupy 68% of the global automobile sales.At present, battery energy density and safety are still the primary factors restricting the development of electric vehicles. Nowadays, common electric vehicle on the market only has the mileage endurance of 300-500 km, which will be raised in the next eight to ten years thanks to constantly updated new technology for power batteries during 2020-2030, such as lithium air, alternative metal ion chemicals, solid state battery technology and high energy capacitors.In terms of charging technology, the next-generation 800V battery electric vehicle will feature a longer recharge mileage and a shorter charging time. The 240-400KW ultra-high-speed charging piles will greatly shorten the charging time.Direct Purchase of Electric Vehicles Market (BEV, PHEV) Research Report athttps://www.reportsnreports.com/purchase.aspx?name=2303335 Global and China Electric Vehicle (BEV, PHEV) Industry Report, 2019-2025 focuses on the following:Major policies about electric vehicle industry in China; Sales volume of electric vehicles, competitive pattern and development trend worldwide; Sales volume of electric vehicles, competitive pattern and development trend in China; Production and sale and competitive landscape of electric vehicle market segments in China, involving electric passenger vehicle (BEV, PHEV), electric bus (BEV, PHEV), and electric logistics vehicle; Electric vehicle industry chain in China, covering charging pile, battery, motor, inverter, and IGBT; Status quo, production bases, capacity, planning for vehicle models, development strategies, etc. of key Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers.Table of Contents:Overview of Electric Vehicle IndustryPolicy Environment for Electric Vehicle IndustryElectric Vehicle MarketChinese Electric Passenger Car MarketChinese Electric Commercial Vehicle MarketMajor Electric Vehicle Manufacturers in ChinaElectric Vehicle Industry ChainMarket Summary and ForecastAnother Related Research Report Electric Vehicle Market Insights 2019, Global and Chinese Analysis and Forecast to 2024report provides key statistics on the market status of the Electric Vehicle manufacturers and is a valuable source of guidance and direction for companies and individuals interested in the industry.

Alcoa reached an agreement in January 2019 with the workers' representatives at the two aluminum plants as part of the collective dismissal process announced in October 2018. As part of that agreement, the smelters, with combined operating capacity of 124,000 metric tons per year, were curtailed in February and maintained in restart condition.Alcoa expects to record restructuring-related charges in the third quarter of 2019, rather than in the second quarter of 2019, estimated to range from $100-140 mln, or $0.54 to $0.75 per share, depending on whether an acquisition or collective dismissal occurs. Related cash outlays are expected to be approximately $100-130 mln, with approximately half to be paid in 2019.09:13WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: -14.40.

The plants include the casthouses at both facilities and the paste plant at La Corua, which are currently in operation, and the two curtailed smelters. Alcoa has reached an agreement with the workers' representatives relating to a transaction between the company and PARTER Capital Group AG. However, a final acquisition is subject to a buyer-provided credit facility to support future operations. If the acquisition cannot be completed by July 31 (extended from the original June 30 deadline), the collective dismissal and social plan are expected to go into effect on August 1, 2019. Alcoa reached an agreement in January 2019 with the workers' representatives at the two aluminum plants as part of the collective dismissal process announced in October 2018. As part of that agreement, the smelters, with combined operating capacity of 124,000 metric tons per year, were curtailed in February and maintained in restart condition.Alcoa expects to record restructuring-related charges in the third quarter of 2019, rather than in the second quarter of 2019, estimated to range from $100-140 mln, or $0.54 to $0.75 per share, depending on whether an acquisition or collective dismissal occurs. Related cash outlays are expected to be approximately $100-130 mln, with approximately half to be paid in 2019.09:13WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: -14.40.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 224,000 (Briefing.com consensus 160,000) while average hourly earnings grew 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).The stock market is finding the strong headline beat disappointing because it has led to a reduction in expectations for an aggressive rate cut at the July FOMC Meeting. The fed funds futures market now sees just an 8.0% implied likelihood of a 50-basis point rate cut in July, down from 29.2% on Wednesday. The fed funds futures market remains certain that a 25-basis point rate cut will take place on July 31.Treasuries retreated in response to today's data, sliding toward this week's lows.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -53.60.The S&P 500 futures trade 14 points below fair value.Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region were relatively mixed on Friday following an otherwise good week for most markets. Today's mixed disposition was attributed in part to a wait-and-see attitude in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report, which will have implications for the Fed's policy stance. Other factors in play included a preliminary estimate from Samsung Electronics that its second quarter profit was down 56% yr/yr, a stronger-than-expected household spending report for May out of Japan, and a South China Morning Post report indicating China won't buy agricultural goods from the U.S. if the U.S. "flip flops again in future trade negotiations."In economic data: Japan's May Household Spending +5.5% m/m (expected +1.2%, last -1.4%) and +4.0% yr/yr (expected +1.4%, last +1.3%); May Preliminary Leading Index 95.2 (expected 95.3, last 95.9)Australia's June AIG Construction Index 43.0 (last 40.4)---Equity Markets---Japan's Nikkei: +0.2% (+2.0% for the week)Hong Kong's Hang Seng: -0.1% (+0.8% for the week)China's Shanghai Composite: +0.2% (+1.1% for the week)India's Sensex: -1.0% (+0.3% for the week)South Korea's Kospi: +0.1% (-0.9% for the week)Australia's ASX All Ordinaries: +0.5% (+2.0% for the week)Major European indices are registering modest losses in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report. A decidedly disappointing Factory Orders report for May out of Germany, however, has been an early guide for the negative stance. Additionally, the news from Thursday that the British navy seized an Iranian oil tanker headed for Syria has fostered some geopolitical angst that is keeping buying efforts in check.In economic data (Thursday and Friday): Eurozone's May Retail Sales -0.3% m/m (expected +0.4%, last -0.1%) and +1.3% yr/yr (expected +1.6%, last +1.8%)Germany's May Factory Orders -2.2% m/m (expected -0.1%, last +0.4%); June Construction PMI 50.0 (expected 52.0, last 51.4)Switzerland's June CPI 0.0% m/m (expected -0.1%, last +0.3%) and +0.6% yr/yr (expected +0.5%, last +0.6%)France's May Trade Balance EUR -3.3B (expected EUR -5.7B, last EUR -4.9B)Spain's May Industrial Production +1.4% (expected +1.1%, last +1.8%); June Consumer Confidence 102.3 (expected 95.1, last 96.9)U.K.'s June Halifax House Price Index -0.3% m/m (expected +0.3%, last +0.4%) and +5.7% yr/yr (expected +5.4%, last +5.2%); Q1 Labor Productivity -0.5% (expected -0.6%, last +0.3%)---Equity Markets---STOXX Europe 600: -0.6%Germany's DAX: -0.6%U.K.'s FTSE 100: -0.6%France's CAC 40: -0.5%Italy's FTSE MIB: -0.4%Spain's IBEX 35: -0.6%08:33WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: -4.90.

A decidedly disappointing Factory Orders report for May out of Germany, however, has been an early guide for the negative stance.

Today's mixed disposition was attributed in part to a wait-and-see attitude in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report, which will have implications for the Fed's policy stance. Other factors in play included a preliminary estimate from Samsung Electronics that its second quarter profit was down 56% yr/yr, a stronger-than-expected household spending report for May out of Japan, and a South China Morning Post report indicating China won't buy agricultural goods from the U.S. if the U.S. "flip flops again in future trade negotiations."In economic data: Japan's May Household Spending +5.5% m/m (expected +1.2%, last -1.4%) and +4.0% yr/yr (expected +1.4%, last +1.3%); May Preliminary Leading Index 95.2 (expected 95.3, last 95.9)Australia'a June AIG Construction Index 43.0 (last 40.4)---Equity Markets---Japan's Nikkei: +0.2% (+2.0% for the week)Hong Kong's Hang Seng: -0.1% (+0.8% for the week)China's Shanghai Composite: +0.2% (+1.1% for the week)India's Sensex: -1.0% (+0.3% for the week)South Korea's Kospi: +0.1% (-0.9% for the week)Australia's ASX All Ordinaries: +0.5% (+2.0% for the week)---FX---USD/JPY: +0.2% to 108.03USD/CNH: +0.1% to 6.8804USD/INR: +0.1% at 68.5307:02WIRES On The WiresLGI Homes, Inc.

Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Monday, July 8th.Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Markets are beginning the week lower. Take a look at futures indicating a decline at the start of trading. Dow futures down 78 points right now, quarter of a percent. S&P futures down 7 and the Nasdaq futures lower by 37.Trade tensions concern that the fed will keep rates on hold impacting stocks this morning after another blowout jobs numbers out last Friday.The major averages were lower on Friday but they were higher for the holiday shortened week. The Nasdaq was up nearly 2 percent on the week, as you can see. There are the numbers for the week. Even though weakness on Friday capped off what was a really good week.European indices are lower this morning as well as the U.S. Take a look. FT 100 down 6, CAC 40 in Paris down 12 and the DAX index in Germany lower by 28.In Asia overnight, it was selloff across the board. Japan put export controls on semiconductor materials bound for South Korea. The Nikkei average down 1 percent. But the Shanghai composite the hardest hit, down in China by two and two thirds percent.Border crisis -- the White House is gearing up for major deportations as the Justice Department shakes up its legal team over the census.And Democrats divided -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez trading barbs on Twitter. What it means as lawmakers get back to work today.Amazon is making returns easier, now a major retailer will accept Amazon returns in-store. Find out which one.Then -- not ready for retirement? Well, a new poll reveals the shocking number of Americans who say they will never retire and why.All those stories coming up this Monday morning. And joining me to break it all down: Fox Business Network's Jackie DeAngelis; RealClearPolitics co- founder and president Tom Bevan; and Barron's associate editor Jack Hough.Great to see you this morning.JACK HOUGH, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, BARRON'S: Good to see you.JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for being here.Here we are on the doorstep of second quarter earnings which is also important and we are expecting a pickup from the first quarter. But you think that's priced into the market -- Jack? How do you see the second quarter earnings season playing out with the markets?HOUGH: The bar is low, right. The number to beat is like zero on earnings. No one is looking for growth.Now, the companies always exceed expectations. They set expectations -- they made the expectations low enough so we'll end up with a few points of earnings growth and people will be happy enough. Much of it will come from stock buybacks.But right now it's good enough. And the comparisons get easier in the fourth quarter. So I don't think there's anyone out there that's looking for gangbusters growth right now. I expect it to be good enough.BARTIROMO: and it's all about what they say about the future, of course. But here we are talking about a rate cut -- Jackie, seven months after we were talking about three rate increases --DEANGELIS: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: -- for 2019.DEANGELIS: And I still think that folks who were looking for that 50 basis point cut in July, I mean that was very aggressive. The Fed said they're going to watch things. They said they're ready to act but they didn't say they were going to give you 50 basis points right off the bat.I don't even think that you'll get the 25 basis points. I think Jerome Powell is going to stand back and watch the whole situation unfold.BARTIROMO: I think you're right. And I think you made a really good point earlier. And that is what happens to the markets if they do cut rates by 50 basis points? I mean we must be really seeing a sharp slowdown. What do they know that we don't know?We're talking about a 51-year-low in unemployment and growth in the first quarter of better than 3 percent. Why 50 basis point rate --(CROSSTALKING)HOUGH: 50 basis points -- that's the resuscitation paddle. That means the patient is dying on the table.BARTIROMO: Exactly.HOUGH: You don't want to see that, right.BARTIROMO: No, exactly.BEVAN: According to Trump, the Dow would be 5,000 to 10,000 higher.BARTIROMO: That's right.We've got a big show this morning. Coming up this morning, joining the conversation: Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Napolitano is here. The CEO of Cambria is here. Marty Davis has an interesting story in terms of beating China. Publicis Sapient CEO Nigel Vaz joining us this morning. Along with former Connecticut Senator and United against Nuclear Iran chairman, Joe Lieberman. Plus singer and songwriter Joy Villa is back with us this morning.Don't miss a moment of it. We have a big two hours coming up.And this hour we're kicking off our top story with Iran -- tensions are rising. Iran says it will breach the uranium limit set by the 2015 nuclear agreement, putting pressure on European allies to salvage this deal. President Trump issued a warning to Tehran yesterday. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Iran better be careful. You enrich for one reason and I won't tell you what that reason is but it's no good. They better be careful.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says that there could be increased sanctions and the European Union is extremely concerned and calling on Iran to reverse any actions that go against this nuclear deal.Joining us right now is former speaker of the house, Fox News contributor, author of the book, "Collusion" Newt Gingrich. Newt -- it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It's good to be with you.And you're right, you have a lot of things going on. I want to go back to an earlier segment here and tell you I have been to the zoo on Cheyenne Mountain. It's a great zoo. And they had a remarkable experience of breeding animals. So, thrilled that a baby giraffe made it onto your show.BARTIROMO: I know, us too. It's so cute. It's a beautiful picture. Waiting to see actually what -- is it a boy or is it a girl. So we'll let you know when we find out.Look there's a lot going on in terms of the 2020 race. You know that. The President and his handling of foreign policy, whether it be Iran or China. Who in the Democratic field could come close to the President's handling of some of these foreign policy issues. And now you've got this split going on with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticizing far left House Democrats including Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for voting against the $4.6 billion border deal that the President signed into law.GINGRICH: Yes, look, I think you're beginning to see the bloom come off of the excitement the Democrats had after they won last year. Speaker Pelosi, who I think is essentially right in this argument, is really faced with some people who are virtually crazy.And she doesn't know what to do with them. And I think she's going to keep taking them on --BARTIROMO: Yes.GINGRICH: -- and of course they're counter-attacking, taking her on.I think on the question of foreign policy, this is a major challenge when you're running for president. Vice president Biden clearly has the experience to have been in the room, he knows leaders around the world.BARTIROMO: Right.GINGRICH: He's probably the person who has the best opportunity, except he's Joe Biden and in the end he's not going to be there.So when you get past Biden, I think they have a real stature gap problem that isn't obvious yet. You start thinking about nuclear weapons, negotiating with China --BARTIROMO: Yes.GINGRICH: -- negotiating with North Korea, I'm not sure of any Democrat who's going to be able to stay in the arena next summer Trump or debate Trump next fall and have any kind of believability.BARTIROMO: Yes. No, you make a good point. Especially since they're not focusing on it at all right now. Some of the most important issues you don't hear at all in the conversation among the Democrats.The Speaker said in an interview with the "New York Times", quote, "All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world but they didn't have any following. They're four people and that's how many votes they got."Ocasio-Cortez (INAUDIBLE). She said this. That public whatever is called public sentiment and wielding the power to shift it is actually how we actually achieve meaningful change in this country."You were critical of Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez. What about this most recent fight?GINGRICH: I just think that what she said about the border, what she said about American government employees was viciously dishonest. She knew it was dishonest. It weakens the United States. Here you have a person who votes against paying for the extra money which the border patrol said they desperately need and then attacks the border patrol when they don't get the money she doesn't want to give them.BARTIROMO: Right.GINGRICH: There's something so fundamentally profoundly wrong about her and about her whole approach to things.By the way, the person who really captured the current mood was Willie Brown, the brilliant former speaker of the house in California who knows Kamala Harris very, very well. And he just wrote a column that said based on those first round of debates, there is nobody running who is going to beat Donald Trump. And I think that should sober Democrats.Willie Brown is one of the smartest professional politicians the Democratic Party's had in the last generation. And he just thinks none of these people have the ability to stay in the ring with Donald Trump.BARTIROMO: And he was very -- for a long time, very close with Kamala Harris.GINGRICH: He really was. And I think they may have had a falling out. But he's just a great professional. I used to watch him when he was speaker of the assembly with great admiration. He could out-maneuver everybody in both parties.And I think what he's telling you is when you think about getting beyond the -- you know, all of them raised their hand, for example, and say they want open borders.(CROSSTALKING)BARTIROMO: And they want to give healthcare to illegals.There are people in this country, legal citizens, who are not getting proper healthcare and yet they want to give health scare to illegals.GINGRICH: And now you have the new game where they actually go down across the border to help teach people how they can break into the United States. So you have Senator Booker in essence helping people learn how to violate American law.Well, all this stuff erodes their ability to get to the center and my next newsletter is going to be about George McGovern, the election of '72, and what we're seeing right now because there are powerful parallels, I think, to the isolation of the McGovern campaign.HOUGH: Hey, Newt -- Jack Hough from Barron's magazine. Let's just say that if I had watched those debates, theoretically let's say I agree with your analysis, that I was looking for something to like and I didn't really find it. How late is too late for some new face to show up in this race? Is it already too late? Do we already see everybody we're going to possibly see running for the Democrats.BARTIROMO: As we know, Tom Steyer now says he wants to get into the race, Newt.GINGRICH: You know what -- you raised a really good question. My sense is -- I'm trying to think back to my own experience. I think you could probably, if you have enough resources and Steyer obviously is a billionaire, if you have enough resources, I think you could probably get in the race as late as December and be competitive almost everywhere.The question will be, when can you get on the ballot in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina. That will be the first break point. And then the Democrats have brought a lot of their primaries up so they're earlier than they used to be.BARTIROMO: Yes.GINGRICH: But I think If you had enough resources, you could see one or two more candidates come in. And frankly In the age of instant television and cable and Twitter and Facebook, you can move very, very fast.BARTIROMO: Tom.BEVAN: Newt -- this is Tom Bevan back to studio.Back to Iran -- I mean obviously events can intervene in presidential campaigns obviously and where we're going with Iran, tensions rising, Trump keeps making these veiled threats, warning Iran to be careful.How do you see this playing out? I mean is there any chance that we're going to get European allies to come on-board and help with sanctions to keep this thing contained?GINGRICH: There's a chance. And then I know that Secretary Pompeo is working very hard to do just that. The challenge is, even when the Iranians announce they're breaking the deal, that the Europeans are so desperate to sell them goodies and help the European economy, which is not very strong, they sort of close their eyes and cling to it and hope something good will happen.If you look around the planet, I think this is very sobering. You have an Iranian problem. You have North Korea. You have Venezuela. You have negotiations with China. You have Russia being as aggressive as Putin can figure out how to be. I mean all of these are challenges that are very real and at the same time you have the kind of weakness we see with Brexit and the collapse of the British government. This is a time of very substantial uncertainty.BARTIROMO: All this, Newt -- by the way while the President is going to be meeting with the Emir of Qatar tomorrow, important meeting. Obviously, the Emir in town apparently I heard there's a big dinner that Steven Mnuchin is hosting for the Emir and then the President will meet with him tomorrow, critical ally in the Middle East. What's your reaction to this?GINGRICH: Look, I think that there's a very important issue here and I've talked at great length with the American airlines that are deeply involved in this.Qatar claimed that it was going to quit cheating on the deals it had with the United States and undermining the American airlines. Qatar has been deliberating undercutting and acting in ways that make it impossible for a free market company to compete in the Middle East.They promised several months ago that they would stop. They haven't stopped. And certainly those of us who are working this issue hope that the President's going to look them in the eye and say look, you've got to keep your word. We want to inspect results, not just worse. For the future of the American airline industry, this is a very big issue.BARTIROMO: And they're a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood. The President has not I guess deemed them a terrorist organization yet. That's coming, I understand.GINGRICH: By the way, they're pretty isolated. I mean the Saudis are against them; UAE is against them. The United Arab Emirates.So Qatar is not coming here from a position of great strength. And I suspect they're eager to find some way to make Secretary Mnuchin and President Trump happy.BARTIROMO: That's a good point. Newt -- it's great to see you this morning. Thanks so much.GINGRICH: Good to be with you. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Newt Gingrich there.Coming up new Amazon dropoff, a major retailer now accepts Amazon returns. We'll tell you who.And then retirement out of reach, why many Americans fear they will never stop working. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Conservatives regaining control in Greece. Cheryl Casone with the details.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: that's right, Maria. Greek voters electing opposition leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis as prime minister on a promise to cut taxes and spur economic growth effectively removing the left wing government that couldn't end the country's long economic slump.This election coming as Greece struggles to emerge from a nearly decade- long financial crisis that saw its economy plunge.Back here at home, Kohl's is helping Amazon with returns. The partnership starts in stores just in time for Prime Day and back-to-school shopping sprees. Kohl's says it's going to accept Amazon returns at all of its stores nationwide.And we are often told to save money for retirement. But according to a new poll, nearly one quarter of Americans plan to keep working because they need the money. 23 percent say they intend to stay on the job, about 25 percent of Americans want to keep working past that 65th birthday but that may be an unrealistic goal because issues like illness, injuries, layoffs can force older workers to leave their jobs before they're actually ready to retire.And we've seen this in particular in the great recession, Maria. Those older workers had a tough time kind of hanging in with the workforce. Things are better now.BARTIROMO: But you never really expect somebody to just go at 65 and like head to the hammock, right.CASONE: Right.BARTIROMO: I mean people like do other things.CASONE: True. They say keep moving, keep doing, keep thinking.BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly.CASONE: That's the word.BARTIROMO: Cheryl -- thank you.CASONE: You bet.BARTIROMO: Coming up. The crisis at the border -- the White House readying for more deportations as the Justice Department shakes up its legal team over the census issue.Then no more manic Mondays, how some employers are looking to Sunday to set the tone for the week. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.A shift for the Justice Department -- the DOJ announcing it is now looking at appointing a new legal team to handle the citizenship question on the 2020 census. Current deputy attorney general James Burnham will no longer be heading efforts in this case. President Trump has said he is considering an executive order to add the questionJoining us right now is Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano. Assess the situation for us -- Judge.JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: I think the President and the DOJ are looking for a way around the Supreme Court opinion in order to get this question on the ballot. There simply is no way around it.Right now there are two injunctions signed by federal district court judges -- one here in New York and one in Maryland -- saying to the Census Department or the Census Bureau and the Commerce Department, you shall not add this question because the Supreme Court does not believe the reason you gave for it.So the President is -- after the Justice Department gave up the ghost last weekend, the President said no, no, no, we're not giving up the ghost, we're going to find another way to do it, send another team of lawyers there. Well, guess what? You can't come up with a reason for government behavior that's an afterthought. You can only come up with what the true reason was at the time the government made its mind up to put this question on and the Supreme Court has rejected that reason, saying it's lacking credibility.So the bottom line here is, I don't think the President and the DOJ can get anywhere. The President can't order this by an executive order because that would be violative of the restraint order imposed by these two courts.BARTIROMO: So it's really about the reason that the Supreme Court knocked this down, right?NAPOLITANO: Yes.BARTIROMO: I mean because when you just think about what we're talking about, isn't that the reason that you have a census in the first place, to figure out how many Americans and how many illegals are in your country.NAPOLITANO: No. No. You have a census to figure out how many human beings are here. This is the first time -- take that back -- this is the first time in the modern era -- the last time this happened was in the 50s, in the early 50s that the government was attempting to discern -- it's not necessarily illegal because you can be not a citizen of the United States but here legally.The census question that the President wants to ask is not are you here legally but what is the citizenship of everybody in the house.(CROSSTALKING)BARTIROMO: Right -- and I don't have a problem with it. Like so what? What's your citizenship?NAPOLITANO: Well, the statute says, which the Supreme Court construed, that the questions in addition to how many people live there, which is the only question the constitution authorizes, and by the way the only question -- they don't want to hear this -- the only question you really have to answer is how many people live there. Now they're asking about toilets and education and when your roof was put on your house and all kinds of things.But the government would have to show that the citizenship question is relevant to counting heads. The President said over the weekend, the citizenship question was relevant to redistricting. Man, they do not want to hear that because that is not relevant to districting because Districting, deciding how many people live in a congressional district is based on human beings, whether or not -- no matter what they're a citizen - - country they're a citizen of.So I don't know where this is going to go. The DOJ has some egg on its face to switch teams like this right after the Supreme Court defeat. A Supreme Court defeat that by the way invited them to go back to court to see if they could resolve this, is either embarrassing to the lawyers that were involved or they asked to get off because they don't think there's any way around the Supreme Court decision.BARTIROMO: So you don't think he'll be able to do an executive order on this.NAPOLITANO: No. And I believe that the inquiries, the census forms are being printed without that question even as we speak.BARTIROMO: Tom.BEVAN: But correct me if I'm wrong, Judge, but the court ruled that asking the question itself is constitutional. It passed this constitutional muster it was just the reason in question. And basically told the (INAUDIBLE) to go back and show us your work and give us a better reason.NAPOLITANO: Yes. Because the statute requires a reason. The statute that Congress enacted said says if the census wants to ask questions other than how many human beings are living in this dwelling, they have to give a reason that is connected to their purpose, not a political reason, but to their purpose.BARTIROMO: Ok.NAPOLITANO: So that's where we stand. I can't predict how this is going to -- I mean, I can predict how this is going to end. It's nearly impossible for the Justice Department to come up with an afterthought, a reason now that was a true reason then that they didn't tell the court about then.BARTIROMO: Let me switch gears and ask you about this facial recognition and privacy. The ""Washington Post" just reported that the FBI along with Immigration and Customs Enforcement have been scanning state driver's license photos to gather information on millions of Americans without their knowledge or consent.Documents obtained by the "Post" reportedly show federal investigators using DMV databases. Judge -- this is exactly what China does, obviously. They are tracking all their citizens. But when you start looking at the U.S. government tracking citizens in any way, shape or form, people's backs go up.NAPOLITANO: Well people's back does go up. Look, there's two arguments here. The government's argument is when you get your driver's license, you are waiving your right to privacy in your face. You give a picture of your face to the government. So you don't have a right to privacy in it.The other argument is, my goodness, the government can't be gathering information on us as if it's putting a fishing net out there because the whole purpose of the Fourth Amendment, which guarantees the right to privacy, is to prevent the government from using a fishing net.Most people don't know that 21 states have statutes that allow the FBI to use these fishing nets and the other states either prohibit it or are silent about it. Americans should know about this.Has the Congress authorized this? No. And yet the FBI is doing it, much to the chagrin and surprise of many members of Congress.BARTIROMO: Well, there's an incredible amount of database of people's faces.NAPOLITANO: It's interesting. There's 330 million Americans. There's close to 700 million photos in the database.BARTIROMO: Exactly right. Yes, exactly.NAPOLITANO: Who are they?BARTIROMO: By the way, great op ed in the "Journal" this morning from Secretary Mike Pompeo on unalienable rights. He's starting a new commission on unalienable rights, separating what is your unalienable right that could never be taken away --NAPOLITANO: Does the government really believe there are no rights it can take away?BARTIROMO: -- versus the rights of governments that, like, for example, a right to healthcare, a right to other things. It's worth a read this morning from Secretary Pompeo.NAPOLITANO: I'm going to read it as soon as I get off.BARTIROMO: Judge -- great to see you.NAPOLITANO: Pleasure.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. Andrew Napolitano there.Quick break and then more controversy at Starbucks to report. Six cops asked to leave Starbucks after a customer was uncomfortable. Starbucks is apologizing.

What employers are doing to prevent burnout.All those stories coming up. But first, our top story this half an hour, U.S.-China trade policies, President Trump over the weekend talking about the success with China, watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're taking in billions and billions of dollars from China. We've never taken in $0.10 from China. China has ripped us off during Obama and Biden, during in all fairness, Bush and other presidents and Clinton, obviously.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, Cambria winning a trade dispute against China with the U.S. International Trade Commission saying that cord surface products from China harm the U.S. industry. Cambria produces chords. The CEO of Cambria, Marty Davis joining me right now to talk more about that. Marty, great to see you. Thank you so much for being here.MARTY DAVIS, CEO, CAMBRIA: Good morning, Maria. Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Congratulations. This was an important ruling.DAVIS: It was an important ruling.BARTIROMO: Tell me about this and what you have faced over these last several years as China has come in and put cheaper quarts on the market.DAVIS: Well, I think what we faced was we built a business, a product line in an industry in a space, court surfacing with other competitive companies from around the world. And as that market started to grow rapidly and expand and blossom, the Chinese supply chain, you know, in my opinion driven by the Chinese Treasury and their -- and their communist, you know, dictator, party dictatorship, targeted our industry and brought in huge amounts of Chinese quartz supply funded by the government. It's not Chinese quartz that disrupted our business or the plagued our business, it's the subsidy and the dumping by the Chinese Treasury and navigated, manipulated by their government, to really eviscerate U.S. manufacturing spaces.BARTIROMO: And we saw this -- them do this in steel, we saw them do this in a lot of other industries as well. As an American produce -- a leading American producer of this, what was the impact to your company?DAVIS: Well, it immediately started to disrupt the economics, the free market fair economics that were born of the competition. Many people feel you're trying to prevent China from coming in to get you special pricing if you will or economics, it's not. It's to protect economics born of free markets and China comes in with subsidized material. And in our case, they were dumping material into our country, violating existing U.S. trade law lower than our raw material cost. And that made it very apparent to us that there was -- there was something beyond just low priced labor in China that was playing a part in what was happening. And that's really what the president understands and what he's -- he and his team have said and what they're really prosecuting by the advent or the use, utilization of tariffs which really are a trade enforcement tool.China's violated the World Trade Organization laws ever since President Bush and President Clinton together really brought them in to the most favored nation status on a permanent basis. And since Clinton and Bush together brought them into the World Trade Organization.We've lost -- you know, upwards of five million manufacturing jobs. President Trump and his team understand that and they really have been going forward to save American manufacturing and have begun to do so.BARTIROMO: Did Clinton and Bush not understand that, Marty?DAVIS: I think President Bush and President Clinton obviously did what they thought was right for America. They were leading our country. But they just got it wrong. And I think it would do them both well to stand up and say we got it wrong. And actually, you know, it's a policy issue, not a political issue proven by both parties and it was a Republican Congress. And saying, we got it wrong for America. We have to be a little bit more concerned about getting it right rather than being right and come out and support the president and say thank you for stepping in, having the courage and the vision and the boldness to fix this problem we created.BARTIROMO: Yes, look at these numbers, in 2010, China exported only $5 million of quartz to the United States. By the time 2018 rolled around, China was exporting $600 million in Chinese quartz to the United States. I think for so many years American companies were so interested in getting a foothold in China to sell to the 1.4 billion people there, that they forgot to protect their own products.DAVIS: Yes, I mean, it's been a big failure of the entrance of China to the WTO. We went from $90 million -- billion deficit to $600 billion as the president cites. For us, they displaced over a billion dollar worth of free market economics. It's a command economy. If you take it back to Russia, and the Nixon administration's efforts with Russia and their communist government employing themselves in our markets, in our free markets, this is really the same thing all over again and it doesn't work. And it's eviscerated American manufacturing and it's a critical aspect to our economy. And this goes all the way -- I mean, to really get weird about it, take it back to Alexander Hamilton. I mean, and Lincoln ran on this, if you look at the record. He ran on the American project, if you will.BARTIROMO: That's fascinating.DAVIS: Which was to protect our manufacturing.BARTIROMO: The ITC and the Commerce Department investigated and found that the dumping was so bad from China, that it had to impose 300 to 500 percent duties to offset the level of unfair trading. Do you -- do you think there's a downside risk to the president not doing a deal with China?DAVIS: No, I mean, there's a downside to that, I believe. But I believe the upside is greater for the country in the long term. There's a study put out by a Mr. Scott back in 2001 that said that Clinton's own analysts understood this if you read the report, that this wasn't going to go well and as it related to the math. It was going to be 60 to 70 years before there'd be a chance of balance. There's actually it's gone worse than they predicted.And you know, and for us, we won our case, Maria. So we're handled. We prosecuted. We spent $4 million petitioning the U.S. government. They found that China was violating existing U.S. trade law. We as a company don't get any of the duty money. We're back to work. And they're still - - they dump tremendous amounts in during that period of time that we were fighting them. And now they've moved shop over in some cases to India and Turkey where, again, it's the same quasi, you know, command economy economics that come in.And it's President Trump on a policy basis understands that America truly has been being ripped off. It goes back to 1962 when we really started moving from the gap thing and we for the first time gave the president the power of the tariff power but really opened up our trade because of agriculture and really expanded it greatly after the H.W. Bush administration and the Clinton administration and now the George W. Bush finalized it with the permanent most favored nation and we don't hold them in check.BARTIROMO: Right.DAVIS: They violated U.S. trade law very shortly after we put them -- put them in the WTO.BARTIROMO: There's a lot of lobbying going on right now on behalf of the Chinese in Washington where as the Chinese are saying, look, we want to be able to compete. You saw what the vice chairman said just overnight, the vice president saying you can't shut China out of this market. What do you think is going to happen here? How does this play out? Will the president have enough support in that region, whether it be Vietnam, Philippines, other countries to import from if in fact a deal does not materialize?DAVIS: Well, I think -- I think those raw material and supply chains will develop elsewhere. They'll develop in a free market with economics that are fair to the competitive landscape and will continue to sustain themselves.So, I think the -- we're not asking China to stay out. We're asking them to play fair. Free trade demands fair trade. And the Chinese don't play fair in any level, at any level, and this doesn't even speak to the fact they closed their markets and they violate all kinds of I.P. law and I.P. practices among -- you know, within the WTO and beyond.BARTIROMO: So is that a culture? Can you really move the needle on something that's been cultural, the theft of intellectual property for decades and decades and then there's all this money.Aa What I think the American people --BARTIROMO: You mentioned the Treasuries. China has so much money to just go and acquire all of these companies anywhere it wants that have specialties.DAVIS: One of the way they subsidies their companies, they have the largest bad debt book in the world, we're one of them because they fund their companies and then forgive the debt. But they do have a lot of money. But they need our -- you know, our markets and they're hijacking American prosperity and free enterprise through the virtues of a communist dictatorship.So, I think it surprises me that American citizens across the board look at this as a political issue when it's a policy issue and that we're talking about a communist party dictatorship here. You know, really hijacking our marketplace without having to play by the rules, that's the challenge.BARTIROMO: I'll tell you tough, the president -- the president is keeping his boot on Xi's neck.DAVIS: Yes, he is.BARTIROMO: I mean, whether it be through Twitter or his statement, it's pretty incredible in terms of --DAVIS: I'm sure Xi hopes that Trump, you know, doesn't make it through this next election --BARTIROMO: Which is why the media has been really so complicit and really a part of this. Because the media, the mainstream media telling the story of how Trump is doing terribly and all the chaos, made China believe that well, maybe we'll be done with this guy in the next two years.DAVIS: You're right on. I mean, if our -- if our politician would worry about getting it right instead of being right, they should be supportive of the president. I mentioned some former administrations that should support the president. And it's a policy issue, not a political issue and if the Chinese got that message, President Trump and his team would be in a much better negotiating position with China.BARTIROMO: Real quick, before you go, from your demand side of the story, how's business going today because we're always trying to get a read on the economy right now and yours is a very good indicator in terms of building.DAVIS: Yes, I think it's a --BARTIROMO: Real quick.DAVIS: It's flat to some growth but it's hesitant. I think the economy is a little hesitant for us right now. But we've had a lot of dumping that occurred --BARTIROMO: Yes.DAVIS: -- during this last year so those inventories haven't vetted themselves out yet.BARTIROMO: Marty, it's great to have you on the program.DAVIS: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Marty Davis joining us, Cambria. We will take a break. Then Starbucks is in big, hot water, police officers were asked to leave one of its stores. We've got the details, next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. An apology from Starbucks this morning to police in Arizona. Cheryl Casone with the details now in headlines, Cheryl.CASONE: That's right, Maria. The coffee giant's vice president traveled to Tempe, Arizona to make amends after a group of officers were asked to leave the store when a customer complained that they didn't feel safe. Well, this incident sparked outrage on social media. The #DumpStarbucks actually started the trend. Well, the Tempe Officers Association said it was encouraged after the meeting between the police chief and the Starbucks executive. And that is what they wrote, right there as you can see on Facebook.Well, British Airways is being fined a record $229 million after a data breach last year, credit card information belonging to half a million travelers was stolen in an attack on the airlines' website. An investigation by U.K. regulators found, quote, poor security arrangements by British Airways. The airline says it is surprised and it is disappointed by the fine.Well, the workweek starting a little earlier than usual for many employees. I'm sure a lot of you are going to relate to this. According to Workplace experts, more employees find themselves on the job starting Sunday night, according to the Wall Street Journal. The job creep has reportedly become a leading contributor to burnout which the World Health Organization has officially recognized as a syndrome. Access to smartphones and productivity apps has gotten people to start working and start dreading the work the Monday as early as Sunday evening. Although I never dread my Sunday mornings because I watch you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank you.CASONE: Always a good thing.BARTIROMO: Well, having the phone, you're working all the time 24/7.CASONE: Yes, I think -- I mean, I work -- it's seven days a week.BARTIROMO: It is.CASONE: My phone's always with me.BARTIROMO: It sure is. Cheryl, thanks.CASONE: You bet.BARTIROMO: Coming up, business in the digital age, how one company is helping big brands get a foothold in the digital market. We're going to check it out when we come right back. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Transforming business in the digital age. A must do for so many. That is the focus of Publicis Sapient, a digital consulting firm that's worked with major brands like McDonald's, Walmart, Mercedes-Benz to improve the way they work and serve their customers. Joining us right now is Publicis Sapient CEO, Nigel Vaz. Nigel, it's great to have you. Thanks so much for joining us.NIGEL VAZ, CEO, PUBLICIS SAPIENT: Glad to be here.BARTIROMO: What I found when I was in Cannes that it doesn't matter how established your brand is, you could be the NFL, Bank of America, Levi Strauss, whatever, everybody is dealing with the same struggle, and that is how to reach young people and how to reach women.VAZ: That's correct and I think if you look at these audiences, one of the big shifts that you're seeing is they're behaving more differently, not just young people and women but people in general are behaving far different than most of the businesses were used to. For the longest time, it was you could basically say one thing and do something completely different and the cognitive dissonance between those two things, wasn't really affecting your business.Today, you absolutely have to be, do and say the same sets of things because people actually experience your brand and very quickly start to believe what they feel rather than what you're telling them.BARTIROMO: So tell us how Publicis Sapient helps companies do that, reach all of these brands and make sure to transition to digital.VAZ: Yes, I think the first thing we try and do is get this idea that whatever you experience as a brand is essentially what your brand is saying. For the longest time, marketing and communications was separate from customer service, from platforms, from technology that you use to. You know, let's take an airline as an example, right. So you could be showing wonderful ads on T.V. about a flight attendant caring about somebody on the plane. But when they lose your bags or when you're trying to check into the airport you have a real problem.So, the kind of stuff we do, for example, is saying how do we look at every single step in the customer journey and help that step become seamless and more efficient. And start asking simple questions like, why. Why do I have to go into a bank to open a bank account? Why does the mortgage take 10 days? Why can't I actually pick my hotel room and get the view from my hotel room before determining, well, I want to pay that extra how many dollars to stay on the 19th floor versus the 14th floor?BARTIROMO: Wow, that would be nice.JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT: How do you adjust the messaging? You were saying that the younger population is a little harder to reach, women, older people? How do you adjust that message across generations and still try to encompass everybody?VAZ: I think the message -- our primary focus is basically not just the communication of the message. So we try to think about this as marketing as a service. So how do you actually create a service. So let me give you an example. If you were watching television and in many markets one of the biggest challenges you basically have from a network perspective is understanding what the advertiser can advertise on based on who's watching. So what we did is created a mobile app that you can use from your cell phone to start to switch channels where your phone becomes your remote control.And in that situation now, not only are you creating more convenience for the customer, but you're basically also providing the network a way and to connect to that consumer that is different than how they otherwise would.BARTIROMO: I love it. Nigel, great ideas. Good to have you on the program. Thanks so much. Nigel Vaz, joining us there.A major shakeup at Deutsche Bank, that's next.Load-Date: July 8, 2019End of Document

GUANGDONG POLICE TAKE SALIVA SAMPLES AMID FEARS OF NATIONWIDE DNA PROGRAMStates News ServiceAugust 7, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 757 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Authorities in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong have begun taking saliva samples from bus passengers arriving in Foshan, sparking concerns that the government may be rolling out a nationwide DNA database.Officers from the Danzao police station in Foshan were taking mouth swabs from passengers passing through the local bus terminal on Monday after checking their ID, sources told RFA.Photos taken of the process have led to concerns among social media users that police would be using the samples to build a nationwide DNA database.An employee who answered the phone at the bus terminal confirmed the social media reports when contacted by RFA on Wednesday."Security checks are very strict right now, and everyone has to get checked," the member of staff said. "They are checking whether you have taken drugs or not. The checks are being carried out by the Danzao police bureau."An officer who answered the phone at the Danzao police bureau also confirmed that the samples were being collected."Yes, that is happening," the officer said. "We have arranged for police to go out and collect samples of saliva from anyone going to the bus station as a way of preventing unexpected incidents.""Everyone will have to do this, because we have had orders to do it," he said. "We have to collect samples from these people to prevent incidents such as robbery from occurring."The police were also spotted storing the samples in a saliva collection card similar to those made by companies specializing in the collection and storage of DNA samples.An agent for biotech firm Shandong Heze confirmed that public security bureaus across the country are among the largest customers for such equipment."Saliva collection cards are used by the police, and are generally entered into a database," the agent said.High-tech totalitarianismThe saliva collection policy in Danzao comes after authorities in the northwestern region of Xinjiang rolled out a massive DNA and biodata collection program, in a bid to monitor every aspect of people's lives.U.S.-based legal scholar Teng Biao said the practice could now be rolled out across the rest of the country."What we have here is the rolling out of the Xinjiang model to the entire country," Teng said. "It is a trend that's known as high-tech totalitarianism.""They are using various forms of contemporary digital technology and facial recognition technology to implement comprehensive and ubiquitous social control. It's an enhanced version of 1984," he said in a reference to George Orwell's dystopian novel about a surveillance state under the watchful eye of Big Brother."Collecting such data within a system like China's is entirely aimed at tightening social control," he said.Teng called on the international community to condemn or sanction international companies and local Chinese companies that provide digital surveillance technology to the Chinese government.'Free health care'The New York-based group Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported in December 2018 that Chinese authorities in Xinjiang are collecting DNA samples, fingerprints, iris scans, and blood types of all residents in the region between the age of 12 and 65."DNA and blood types are being collected through a free annual physical exams program called Physicals for All," the group said in a report."The mandatory databanking of a whole population's biodata, including DNA, is a gross violation of international human rights norms, and it's even more disturbing if it is done surreptitiously, under the guise of a free health care program," HRW China director Sophie Richardson said at the time.The biometric collection scheme is detailed in an official document called "Regional Working Guidelines on the Accurate Registration and Verification of Population," dated July 2, 2017, it said."Chinese authorities seem to think they can achieve 'social stability'by placing people under a microscope, but these abusive programs are more likely to deepen hostility towards the government," said Richardson. "Beijing should immediately stop these programs, and destroy all data gathered without full, informed consent."DNA information is highly sensitive and can facilitate a wide array of abuses if it is collected or shared non-consensually, according to HRW, which called any compelled collection or use by the government "a serious intrusion on the right to privacy."Reported by Ng Yik-tung and Wong Lok-to for RFA's Cantonese Service.

U.S., ARMY MUST STEP UP INVESTMENT IN AIStates News ServiceAugust 21, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 451 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: ARLINGTON, Virginia BodyThe following information was released by the Association of the United States Army:China is investing in artificial intelligence at a "much, much faster pace" than the U.S. government, though It is not yet ahead, a prominent AI expert recently told Army intelligence planners.Tuomas Sandholm, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and a renowned expert on artificial intelligence, made his remarks at a lecture sponsored by the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command's intelligence division and the Association of the U.S. Army's Virginia Colonial chapter.The Chinese government and its regional governments combined "are probably investing 100-to-1 in AI compared to the U.S. government," he said. While the U.S. still has the lead, and there is a lot of technology it does not yet have, the Chinese "are moving at a much, much faster pace. The government investment in AI is huge compared to the U.S.," he said.In 2009, when he began traveling to China, English was not even spoken at the only five-star hotel in Beijing, Sandholm said. In 10 short years, as he has lectured at tech conferences and meetings around the world, he has watched the Chinese leap ahead in artificial intelligence."Now, they're submitting more papers to the top conferences and journals than any other country in the world. It is a very scary thing," Sandholm said at the July 23 lecture at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia.He described witnessing "extreme learning" during his lectures by audiences stacked with low-paid Chinese workers taking copious notes, recording with video cameras, and at dinners with questions submitted to him in English.Sandholm also had some advice for the Army on how it can work more closely with the technology industry, including how to choose the right people."There are a lot of people now who talk about AI, companies who talk about, 'Hey, we do AI.' It's hard to see who's real, but it's actually really easy," he said, offering two ways to effectively vet peoples' claims.To pinpoint the best, highly cited academics, start by consulting the H-Index, a public metrics system that measures the work and impact of specific authors and scientists rather than those of a publication. But, he said, a lot of those highly cited academics "have never fielded anything or built anything that has come to the real world."To complement information found on the H-Index, he said, look at a scientist's track record, whose systems have been fielded and how long their systems have been running "so it's not just, 'Oh, I fielded it and two years later it was discontinued and put on the shelf.' It's a track record, there's nothing better, because anybody can talk."Load-Date: August 21, 2019End of Document

University of Southern California: Battle for the Future of Hong Kong: Are Protests Tipping Point?Targeted News ServiceAugust 24, 2019 Saturday 7:31 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 651 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: LOS ANGELES, California Body[TNSscienceresearch] -- The University of Southern California (USC) issued the following news release:Protests erode the "One Country, Two Systems" model"China will resist using military force since it would lead to very serious damage to the credibility of Hong Kong as an international financial center," said Stanley Rosen, professor of political science at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and an expert in Chinese politics, film and the relationship between China and Hollywood."It would almost completely erode the 'One Country, Two Systems' model which has led to Hong Kong's continuing success after the handover in 1997 and was originally intended to be a model for Taiwan."He added:* If China resorts to force, it would increase international fear China is growing as a threat to peace.* Beijing would be challenged to pacify Hong Kong due to loss of popular support from the city's citizens, especially youth who have fueled protests.* While aspects of the British legal system remain, the local government that answers to Beijing, not the people, has eroded those freedoms.Contact: (213) 740-1697 or rosen@usc.eduChina's tactics include disinformation via social media"China has taken a leaf from the Russian playbook and used not just its national media, but Twitter and Facebook to spread disinformation about the Hong Kong protests; specifically, that they are being fomented by the CIA," said Gregory Treverton, professor of the practice of international relations and spatial sciences at the Spatial Sciences Institute at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences."As someone who has run a U.S. intelligence agency, I know that intelligence is capable of making mistakes, but getting involved with the protests is one the CIA would not make. The counterpart to the adage 'don't stop your enemies when they are doing something stupid' is 'don't crush your friends in your embrace.'"He added:* China is finding it easier to use social media to thwart democracy than it did using traditional media to advance Communism during the Cold War.* Fomenting a foreign conspiracy narrative is easy nowadays; all it takes are inexpensive trolls to post content supplemented by automated bots.* Belatedly, Twitter and Facebook have countered by taking down accounts linked to the Chinese government and its propaganda campaign.Contact: (310) 393-0411 or treverto@usc.eduUse of force to quell protests would have deep downside"So far, Beijing has succeeded in keeping the limited violence in the protests in the news, playing to popular worries about disorder and keeping the discontent stemming from economic challenges from finding sympathetic ears on the mainland," said Clayton Dube, director of the USC U.S.-China Institute at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism."I don't think that Beijing will send in troops to quell the protests. Given the slowing of the Chinese economy and the ongoing trade and tech war with the United States, I believe Beijing would consider dramatic action to end demonstrations in Hong Kong as having a deep downside and a limited upside."He added:* Beijing is disappointed in the ability of the Hong Kong government to end the protests, but understands that the costs of a crackdown would be significant.* People in Hong Kong, accustomed to enjoying civil liberties such as freedom of speech, association and assembly, are eager to defend their rights and press for others they believe were promised.* Young people in Hong Kong echo complaints of other youths around the world; they are frustrated with economic conditions. Although they are the best educated generation, they don't see the same opportunities available to previous generations of college graduates.Contact: (213) 821-4382 or cdube@usc.eduContact: Jenesse Miller, 213/810-8554, jenessem@usc.eduCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6832722 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: August 24, 2019End of Document

2019 Report Bundle: The Global M2M/IoT Communications Market (4th Edition) / Cellular & LPWA IoT Device Ecosystems (3rd Edition)GlobeNewswireAugust 19, 2019 Monday 6:55 AM PTCopyright 2019 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: RESEARCH ANALYSIS AND REPORTSLength: 2183 wordsBodyDublin, Aug.  19, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The     "The Global Wireless M2M/IoT Market"   report has been added to     ResearchAndMarkets.com's  offering.    A Complete Set of Two Unique Reports - Offering In-Depth Analysis and Unique Insights into the Global Wireless M2M/IoT Market:• The Global M2M/IoT Communications Market - 4th Edition• Cellular & LPWA IoT Device Ecosystems - 3rd EditionThe Global M2M/IoT Communications Market analyses the latest trends and developments in cellular IoT and low power wireless networking.

This strategic research report provides you with 120 pages of unique business intelligence including 5-year industry forecasts and expert commentary on which to base your business decisions.Highlights from the report:• 360-degree overview of the main IoT wide area networking ecosystems• Comparison of technologies and standards• Updated profiles of the main suppliers of IoT chipsets and modules• Cellular IoT module market data for 2018• Early adoption trends for emerging LPWA technologies• Cellular and non-cellular LPWA IoT device market forecast until 2023The Global M2M/IoT Communications Market - 4th EditionThe  publisher estimates that the global number of cellular IoT subscribers  increased by 70 percent during 2018 to reach 1.21 billion at the end of  the year - corresponding to around 13 percent of all mobile subscribers.  Until 2023, the number of cellular IoT subscribers is forecasted to  grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 49.4 percent to reach  9.03 billion at the end of the period. During the same period, cellular  IoT network revenues are forecasted to grow at a compound annual growth  rate (CAGR) of 34.4 percent from  6.7 billion in 2018 to approximately   29.4 billion in 2023. Meanwhile, the monthly ARPU is expected to drop to   0.27.East Asia was the largest region with 848.0 million IoT  subscribers at the end of 2018, far ahead of Western Europe and North  America with 157.6 million and 111.7 million respectively. Altogether  the main regions accounted for over 95 percent of the global installed  base. Latin America, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Russia & CIS  had in the range of 19-32 million cellular IoT subscribers each, while  Africa, Middle East, Central Eastern Europe, and Australia & Oceania  were in the span 7-19 million.China is the world's largest  market for cellular IoT connectivity services by volume. According to  operator subscriber data, the installed base grew by 124 percent  year-on-year to reach 767 million at the end of 2018. This corresponded  to 63 percent of the global installed base. The spectacular numbers  reported by the domestic mobile operators leave no doubt that China is  leading the global adoption of massive IoT. The country has surpassed  Europe and North America in terms of penetration rate - 54.7 IoT  connections per 100 inhabitants at the end of 2018 - and is on track to  reach 1 billion IoT connections during 2019. The Chinese government is  actively driving adoption as a tool for achieving domestic and economic  policy goals, at the same time as the private sector implements IoT  technology to improve efficiency and drive innovation. The publisher  believes that the role of the government is the main explanation for why  China is ahead of the rest of the world in the adoption of IoT. Like  other advanced economies, the country has widespread adoption of  connected cars, fleet management, smart metering, asset monitoring and  other traditional applications for cellular IoT.It has also given  rise to new consumer services enabled by connectivity like  bike-sharing. The most distinctive characteristic of the Chinese IoT  market is, however, the way that the government is systematically using  new technology to implement its vision for urban life in the 21st  century. China Mobile is the world's largest provider of cellular IoT  connectivity. At the end of 2018, the operator reported 551 million IoT  connections and a year-on-year growth rate of 141 percent. China Unicom  and China Telecom ranked second and third with 110 million and 106  million connections respectively. Vodafone ranked first among the  Western operators and fourth overall with 81 million connections,  followed by AT&T in fifth place with 51 million. Verizon, Deutsche  Telekom, and Telefnica had in the range 25-35 million cellular IoT  connections. Softbank/Sprint and Telenor were the last players in the  top ten with 21 million and 17 million connections respectively.  Year-on-year growth rates for the mentioned operators were in the span  20-35 percent, except for Softbank/Sprint that only grew 3 percent. IoT  connectivity revenues are growing at a considerably slower rate than  the number of connections. The author's analysis of the IoT business  KPIs released by mobile operators in different parts of the world  suggests that global IoT revenues increased by around 19 percent during  2018, while the monthly APRU dropped by 30 percent. Excluding China, the  trend was less dramatic with revenues growing by 16 percent and ARPU  declining 7 percent. Indeed, there is a negative correlation between  growth in connections and monthly ARPU as the bulk of net additions are  cost-sensitive devices.Verizon reported the highest IoT revenues  of  1.4 billion (US$ 1.6 billion) in 2018 and the highest monthly ARPU  of an estimated  3.65. Around 60 percent of sales derived from the  Verizon Connect fleet management and telematics business. China Mobile  ranked second with yearly IoT sales of  964 million but had the lowest  monthly ARPU of just  0.21. Vodafone and AT&T were not far behind.  Annual IoT revenues for the Vodafone group in 2018 were approximately   830 million, with a monthly ARPU of  0.82. AT&T does not report IoT  revenues but is believed to have generated approximately  750-800  million.Cellular & LPWA IoT Device Ecosystems - 3rd EditionThe  Internet of Things is weaving a new world wide web of interconnected  objects. At the end of 2018, approximately 1.3 billion devices were  connected to wide area networks based on cellular or LPWA technologies.  The market is highly diverse and divided into multiple ecosystems. This  report will focus on the four most prominent technology ecosystems for  wide-area IoT networking - the 3GPP ecosystem of cellular technologies,  the emerging LPWA technologies LoRa and Sigfox and the 802.15.4  ecosystem.The 3GPP family of cellular technologies support the  biggest ecosystem in wide-area IoT networking. The publisher estimates  that the global number of cellular IoT subscribers increased by 70.0  percent during 2018 to reach 1.2 billion at the end of the year -  corresponding to around 13.0 percent of all mobile subscribers. Yearly  shipments of cellular IoT devices increased by 76.2 percent in 2018 to  reach 651.9 million units. Growth was fuelled by an exceptional market  expansion in China, where the installed base of cellular IoT connections  increased by 124.1 percent year-on-year to reach 767.0 million at the  end of 2018.The cellular IoT technology landscape is in a phase  of rapid transformation. Developments in China accelerate a global shift  from 2G/3G to 4G technologies. As the initial focus for 5G will be  high-bandwidth applications, the author believes that 4G will become  the preferred platform for IoT in the foreseeable future. The move from  2G to 4G began in North America with 3G as an intermediate technology.  The region has seen a rapid uptake of LTE CAT-1 since 2017 and CAT-M  starting in 2018 at the same time as GPRS and CDMA are fading away.  Europe began to see the adoption of LTE CAT-1 in 2018 and is now  followed by an accelerated uptake of LTE-M and NB-IoT in 2019/2020.  China is moving fast from GPRS to NB-IoT in the mass-market segment and  cumulative NB-IoT shipments are expected to exceed 190 million units by  the end of 2019. At the same time, there will also be a fast-growing  demand for LTE CAT-1 and LTEM, as well as LTE CAT-3+. 2G and 3G will be  in a steady decline in all developed markets with demand shifting to  developing countries with limited availability of 4G networks. The  Publisher expects that 5G will become commercially available for  verticals such as automotive in 2020.LoRa is gaining momentum as a  global connectivity platform for IoT devices. According to Semtech, the  global installed base of LoRa devices was approximately 87 million at  the beginning of 2019. The first major volume application segments are  smart gas and water metering, where LoRa's low power consumption matches  the requirements for long-life battery operation. LoRa is also gaining  traction for the metropolitan area and local area IoT deployments as a  platform for networking smart sensors in cities, buildings,  manufacturing plants and similar. Semtech has stated that it generated  in the range of US$ 78 million in revenues from LoRa chips in its  financial year ending in January 2019 and expects to reach US$ 100-140  million in fiscal 2020. The author estimates that yearly shipments of  LoRa devices were 36.3 million units in 2018. Until 2023, yearly  shipments are forecasted to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR)  of 33.7 percent to reach 155.0 million units. While the Asia-Pacific  region accounted for about 60 percent of total shipments in 2018, LoRa  device shipments in Europe and North America are expected to scale into  significant volumes in the coming years as early adopters move from  pilots to large-scale deployments.Sigfox has very ambitious plans  for establishing the technology bearing the company's name as the  leading global platform for ultra-narrow band IoT networks. In order to  meet its strategic goals, Sigfox must be able to break into entirely new  mass-volume device segments and prove its capability to create value by  adding connectivity to things that never communicated before. At the  end of 2018, Sigfox reported 6.2 million connected devices. In a  positive scenario where early trials ramp up to large-scale commercial  deployments, the author forecasts that shipments of Sigfox devices  will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 63.1 percent from  3.8 million units in 2018 to 43.9 million units by 2023. 802.15.4  WAN is an established connectivity platform for private wide-area  wireless mesh networks used for applications such as smart metering.  Faced with increasing competition from emerging LPWA standards, 802.15.4  WAN is however only expected to grow at a moderate rate in the coming  years. The author forecasts that shipments of 802.15.4 WAN devices  will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.3 percent from  19.3 million units in 2018 to 46.6 million units by 2023. Smart metering  is expected to account for the bulk of demand. WiSUN is the leading  industry standard for smart electricity metering networks in North  America, with adoption also spreading to Asia-Pacific and Europe.Companies Mentioned                   • A1 Telekom Austria• AT&T• Aeris• Altair Semiconductor• Altice Europe• America Movil• Arkessa• Arm ISG• BICS• BT Group• Bouygues Telecom• Cheerzing• China Mobile• China Telecom• China Unicom• Com4• Cubic Telecom• Deutsche Telekom• EMnify• Eseye• Etisalat• Fibocom• Freeeway• GCT Semiconductor• Gemalto• Globalstar• Gosuncn WeLink• HiSilicon• Inmarsat• Intel• Iridium• JT Group• KDDI• KORE Wireless• KPN• KT• LPWA networks• LoRa networks• MTN• MTS• Matooma• MediaTek• Megafon• NTT Docomo• Neoway• Nordic Semiconductor• Ooredoo• Orange• Orbcomm• POST Luxembourg• Plintron• Proximus• Qualcomm• Quectel• Rogers Communication s• SK Telecom• Samsung Electronics• Sanechips Technology• Sequans Communications• Sierra Wireless• Sigfox networks• Singtel• Softbank• Soracom• Sprint• Sunsea AIoT (SIMCom & Longsung)• T-Mobile USA• Tata Communications• Tele2• Telecom Italia• Telefonica• Telenor• Telia Company• Telit• Telstra• Thingstream• Transatel• Turkcell• Twilio• UNISOC (Unigroup Spreadtrum & RDA)• Unlimit• UtilityConnect• Verizon• Vivo and Telefnica• Vodacom• Vodafone• Vodafone Idea• Wi-SUN• Wireless Logic• Zain• ZigBee• iBASIS• u-blox          For more information         about this  report  visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/f5oyw7 Research and Markets also offers Custom Research services providing focused, comprehensive and tailored research. CONTACT: ResearchAndMarkets.com          Laura Wood, Senior Press Manager          press@researchandmarkets.com          For E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470          For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630          For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900 Load-Date: August 20, 2019End of Document

Brindisi Successfully Includes Upstate New York Priorities in National Defense Authorization ActTargeted News ServiceJuly 12, 2019 Friday 7:03 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 663 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Anthony Brindisi, D-New York, issued the following news release:Congressman Anthony Brindisi (NY-22) successfully secured Upstate New York priorities in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The 2019 NDAA, which passed the House of Representatives today, sets funding levels and policies for the U.S. Department of Defense.Brindisi led an amendment to authorizes $10 million to establish a Quantum Information Science Innovation Center. The Rome Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is leading quantum information technology for the Department of Defense. Recently in 2017, Rome Lab took a major step in its quantum research by becoming the first Department of Defense Lab to trap an ion, which was a major breakthrough in the development of quantum capabilities for the Air Force. Quantum research and technology development is being aggressively pursued by other countries, including China, who recognize the massive potential of quantum technologies. AFRL's efforts to develop Quantum technologies has immense national security implications, and it is crucial that the United States does not fall behind our adversaries in this field.Brindisi also co-led an amendment with Congressman Max Rose (NY-11) to crack down on illegal Fentanyl shipments from China. After a surge in opioid deaths in Broome and Oneida counties, Brindisi helped introduce the Fentanyl Sanctions Act -- the first-ever fentanyl sanctions effort in the House of Representatives -- to force the Chinese government to honor their commitment to make all fentanyl illegal and provide the United States with more tools and resources to go after illicit traffickers in China, Mexico, and other countries. He then fought to get the legislation included in the NDAA.Additionally, Brindisi continued his efforts to improve mental health care for servicemembers. Brindisi successfuly passed an amendment requiring deployed servicemembers must reieve an in-person mental health assessment every 180 days. Brindisi, a fierce advocate for mental health for servicemembers and veterans, previously passed his Support for Suicide Prevention Coordinators Act through the House earlier this year."Today's critical legislation ensures we have the resources and tools we need to keep our country safe and secure," Brindisi said. "I am proud to have worked across the aisle to include Upstate New York priorities like ensuring our troops have access to mental health care, cracking down on China for their role in the opioid crisis, and strengthening the mission at Rome Lab. This bill also gives our troops a much-need and well-deserved pay raise. I will continue fighting to ensure our priorities make it to the President's desk and become law. There is nothing more important than keeping our families and our county safe."Brindisi voted for the NDAA and it passed the House 220-197. The bill will now head to conference with the Senate.Brindisi's amendments included:- Fentanyl Sanctions Act Amendment: This language demands the Chinese government honor their commitment to make all fentanyl illegal and provide the United States with more tools and resources to go after illicit traffickers in China, Mexico, and other countries.- Mental Health Assessment for Servicemembers: Requires every deployed servicemember to undergo an in-person mental health assessment every 6 months.- Quantum Information Science Center in Rome: Authorizes $10 million to establish a Quantum Information Science Innovation Center. Brindisi previously secured the $10 million appropriation.Additionally, the NDAA provides:- A 3.1 percent pay raise for military members.- Additional financial assistance for child care for military families.- An additional $121.3 million to clean up PFAS chemicals in drinking water on or near military bases.- Prevents diverting Department of Defense funds from projects like Rome Lab's Perimeter Security from being used for a border wall.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6788866 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 13, 2019End of Document

After a surge in opioid deaths in Broome and Oneida counties, Brindisi helped introduce the Fentanyl Sanctions Act the first-ever fentanyl sanctions effort in the House of Representatives to force the Chinese government to honor their commitment to make all fentanyl illegal and provide the United States with more tools and resources to go after illicit traffickers in China, Mexico, and other countries. He then fought to get the legislation included in the NDAA.Additionally, Brindisi continued his efforts to improve mental health care for servicemembers. Brindisi successfuly passed an amendment requiring deployed servicemembers must reieve an in-person mental health assessment every 180 days. Brindisi, a fierce advocate for mental health for servicemembers and veterans, previously passed his Support for Suicide Prevention Coordinators Act through the House earlier this year."Today's critical legislation ensures we have the resources and tools we need to keep our country safe and secure," Brindisi said. "I am proud to have worked across the aisle to include Upstate New York priorities like ensuring our troops have access to mental health care, cracking down on China for their role in the opioid crisis, and strengthening the mission at Rome Lab. This bill also gives our troops a much-need and well-deserved pay raise. I will continue fighting to ensure our priorities make it to the President's desk and become law. There is nothing more important than keeping our families and our county safe."Brindisi voted for the NDAA and it passed the House 220-197. The bill will now head to conference with the Senate.Brindisi's amendments included:Fentanyl Sanctions Act Amendment: This language demands the Chinese government honor their commitment to make all fentanyl illegal and provide the United States with more tools and resources to go after illicit traffickers in China, Mexico, and other countries.Mental Health Assessment for Servicemembers: Requires every deployed servicemember to undergo an in-person mental health assessment every 6 months.Quantum Information Science Center in Rome: Authorizes $10 million to establish a Quantum Information Science Innovation Center. Brindisi previously secured the $10 million appropriation.Additionally, the NDAA provides:A 3.1 percent pay raise for military members.Additional financial assistance for child care for military families.An additional $121.3 million to clean up PFAS chemicals in drinking water on or near military bases.Prevents diverting Department of Defense funds from projects like Rome Lab's Perimeter Security from being used for a border wall.Load-Date: July 12, 2019End of Document

This strategic research report provides you with 120 pages of unique business intelligence including 5-year industry forecasts and expert commentary on which to base your business decisions.Highlights from the report:360-degree overview of the main IoT wide area networking ecosystems Comparison of technologies and standards Updated profiles of the main suppliers of IoT chipsets and modules Cellular IoT module market data for 2018 Early adoption trends for emerging LPWA technologies Cellular and non-cellular LPWA IoT device market forecast until 2023The Global M2M/IoT Communications Market - 4th EditionThe publisher estimates that the global number of cellular IoT subscribers increased by 70 percent during 2018 to reach 1.21 billion at the end of the year - corresponding to around 13 percent of all mobile subscribers. Until 2023, the number of cellular IoT subscribers is forecasted to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 49.4 percent to reach 9.03 billion at the end of the period. During the same period, cellular IoT network revenues are forecasted to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34.4 percent from 6.7 billion in 2018 to approximately 29.4 billion in 2023. Meanwhile, the monthly ARPU is expected to drop to 0.27.East Asia was the largest region with 848 million IoT subscribers at the end of 2018, far ahead of Western Europe and North America with 157.6 million and 111.7 million respectively. Altogether the main regions accounted for over 95 percent of the global installed base. Latin America, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Russia & CIS had in the range of 19-32 million cellular IoT subscribers each, while Africa, Middle East, Central Eastern Europe, and Australia & Oceania were in the span 7-19 million.China is the world's largest market for cellular IoT connectivity services by volume. According to operator subscriber data, the installed base grew by 124 percent year-on-year to reach 767 million at the end of 2018. This corresponded to 63 percent of the global installed base. The spectacular numbers reported by the domestic mobile operators leave no doubt that China is leading the global adoption of massive IoT. The country has surpassed Europe and North America in terms of penetration rate - 54.7 IoT connections per 100 inhabitants at the end of 2018 - and is on track to reach 1 billion IoT connections during 2019. The Chinese government is actively driving adoption as a tool for achieving domestic and economic policy goals, at the same time as the private sector implements IoT technology to improve efficiency and drive innovation. The publisher believes that the role of the government is the main explanation for why China is ahead of the rest of the world in the adoption of IoT. Like other advanced economies, the country has widespread adoption of connected cars, fleet management, smart metering, asset monitoring and other traditional applications for cellular IoT.It has also given rise to new consumer services enabled by connectivity like bike-sharing. The most distinctive characteristic of the Chinese IoT market is, however, the way that the government is systematically using new technology to implement its vision for urban life in the 21st century. China Mobile is the world's largest provider of cellular IoT connectivity. At the end of 2018, the operator reported 551 million IoT connections and a year-on-year growth rate of 141 percent. China Unicom and China Telecom ranked second and third with 110 million and 106 million connections respectively. Vodafone ranked first among the Western operators and fourth overall with 81 million connections, followed by AT&T in fifth place with 51 million. Verizon, Deutsche Telekom, and Telefnica had in the range 25-35 million cellular IoT connections. Softbank/Sprint and Telenor were the last players in the top ten with 21 million and 17 million connections respectively. Year-on-year growth rates for the mentioned operators were in the span 20-35 percent, except for Softbank/Sprint that only grew 3 percent.IoT connectivity revenues are growing at a considerably slower rate than the number of connections. The author's analysis of the IoT business KPIs released by mobile operators in different parts of the world suggests that global IoT revenues increased by around 19 percent during 2018, while the monthly APRU dropped by 30 percent. Excluding China, the trend was less dramatic with revenues growing by 16 percent and ARPU declining 7 percent. Indeed, there is a negative correlation between growth in connections and monthly ARPU as the bulk of net additions are cost-sensitive devices.Verizon reported the highest IoT revenues of 1.4 billion (US$ 1.6 billion) in 2018 and the highest monthly ARPU of an estimated 3.65. Around 60 percent of sales derived from the Verizon Connect fleet management and telematics business. China Mobile ranked second with yearly IoT sales of 964 million but had the lowest monthly ARPU of just 0.21. Vodafone and AT&T were not far behind. Annual IoT revenues for the Vodafone group in 2018 were approximately 830 million, with a monthly ARPU of 0.82. AT&T does not report IoT revenues but is believed to have generated approximately 750-800 million.Cellular & LPWA IoT Device Ecosystems - 3rd EditionThe Internet of Things is weaving a new world wide web of interconnected objects. At the end of 2018, approximately 1.3 billion devices were connected to wide area networks based on cellular or LPWA technologies. The market is highly diverse and divided into multiple ecosystems. This report will focus on the four most prominent technology ecosystems for wide-area IoT networking - the 3GPP ecosystem of cellular technologies, the emerging LPWA technologies LoRa and Sigfox and the 802.15.4 ecosystem.The 3GPP family of cellular technologies support the biggest ecosystem in wide-area IoT networking. The publisher estimates that the global number of cellular IoT subscribers increased by 70 percent during 2018 to reach 1.2 billion at the end of the year - corresponding to around 13 percent of all mobile subscribers. Yearly shipments of cellular IoT devices increased by 76.2 percent in 2018 to reach 651.9 million units. Growth was fuelled by an exceptional market expansion in China, where the installed base of cellular IoT connections increased by 124.1 percent year-on-year to reach 767 million at the end of 2018.The cellular IoT technology landscape is in a phase of rapid transformation. Developments in China accelerate a global shift from 2G/3G to 4G technologies. As the initial focus for 5G will be high-bandwidth applications, the author believes that 4G will become the preferred platform for IoT in the foreseeable future. The move from 2G to 4G began in North America with 3G as an intermediate technology. The region has seen a rapid uptake of LTE CAT-1 since 2017 and CAT-M starting in 2018 at the same time as GPRS and CDMA are fading away. Europe began to see the adoption of LTE CAT-1 in 2018 and is now followed by an accelerated uptake of LTE-M and NB-IoT in 2019/2020. China is moving fast from GPRS to NB-IoT in the mass-market segment and cumulative NB-IoT shipments are expected to exceed 190 million units by the end of 2019. At the same time, there will also be a fast-growing demand for LTE CAT-1 and LTEM, as well as LTE CAT-3+. 2G and 3G will be in a steady decline in all developed markets with demand shifting to developing countries with limited availability of 4G networks. The publisher expects that 5G will become commercially available for verticals such as automotive in 2020.LoRa is gaining momentum as a global connectivity platform for IoT devices. According to Semtech, the global installed base of LoRa devices was approximately 87 million at the beginning of 2019. The first major volume application segments are smart gas and water metering, where LoRa's low power consumption matches the requirements for long-life battery operation. LoRa is also gaining traction for the metropolitan area and local area IoT deployments as a platform for networking smart sensors in cities, buildings, manufacturing plants and similar. Semtech has stated that it generated in the range of US$ 78 million in revenues from LoRa chips in its financial year ending in January 2019 and expects to reach US$ 100-140 million in fiscal 2020. The author estimates that yearly shipments of LoRa devices were 36.3 million units in 2018. Until 2023, yearly shipments are forecasted to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 33.7 percent to reach 155 million units. While the Asia-Pacific region accounted for about 60 percent of total shipments in 2018, LoRa device shipments in Europe and North America are expected to scale into significant volumes in the coming years as early adopters move from pilots to large-scale deployments.Sigfox has very ambitious plans for establishing the technology bearing the company's name as the leading global platform for ultra-narrow band IoT networks. In order to meet its strategic goals, Sigfox must be able to break into entirely new mass-volume device segments and prove its capability to create value by adding connectivity to things that never communicated before. At the end of 2018, Sigfox reported 6.2 million connected devices. In a positive scenario where early trials ramp up to large-scale commercial deployments, the author forecasts that shipments of Sigfox devices will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 63.1 percent from 3.8 million units in 2018 to 43.9 million units by 2023.802.15.4 WAN is an established connectivity platform for private wide-area wireless mesh networks used for applications such as smart metering. Faced with increasing competition from emerging LPWA standards, 802.15.4 WAN is however only expected to grow at a moderate rate in the coming years. The author forecasts that shipments of 802.15.4 WAN devices will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.3 percent from 19.3 million units in 2018 to 46.6 million units by 2023. Smart metering is expected to account for the bulk of demand. WiSUN is the leading industry standard for smart electricity metering networks in North America, with adoption also spreading to Asia-Pacific and Europe.Companies MentionedA1 Telekom Austria AT&T Aeris Altair Semiconductor Altice Europe America Movil Arkessa Arm ISG BICS BT Group Bouygues Telecom Cheerzing China Mobile China Telecom China Unicom Com4 Cubic Telecom Deutsche Telekom EMnify Eseye Etisalat Fibocom Freeeway GCT Semiconductor Gemalto Globalstar Gosuncn WeLink HiSilicon Inmarsat Intel Iridium JT Group KDDI KORE Wireless KPN KT LPWA networks LoRa networks MTN MTS Matooma MediaTek Megafon NTT Docomo Neoway Nordic Semiconductor Ooredoo Orange Orbcomm POST Luxembourg Plintron Proximus Qualcomm Quectel Rogers Communication s SK Telecom Samsung Electronics Sanechips Technology Sequans Communications Sierra Wireless Sigfox networks Singtel Softbank Soracom Sprint Sunsea AIoT (SIMCom & Longsung) T-Mobile USA Tata Communications Tele2 Telecom Italia Telefonica Telenor Telia Company Telit Telstra Thingstream Transatel Turkcell Twilio UNISOC (Unigroup Spreadtrum & RDA) Unlimit UtilityConnect Verizon Vivo and Telefnica Vodacom Vodafone Vodafone Idea Wi-SUN Wireless Logic Zain ZigBee iBASIS u-bloxFor more information about this report visithttps://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/zazk89Research and Markets also offersCustom Researchservices providing focused, comprehensive and tailored research.Media Contact:Research and MarketsLaura Wood, Senior Managerpress@researchandmarkets.com  For E.S.T Office Hours Call +1-917-300-0470For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call +1-800-526-8630For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900U.S. Fax: 646-607-1907Fax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716 View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-m2miot-communications-market--cellular--lpwa-iot-device-ecosystems-report-bundle-2018-2023-300903545.htmlSOURCE Research and MarketsLoad-Date: August 20, 2019End of Document

Protesters return to the streets in Hong Kong a week after the inaugurayCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 7, 2019 SundayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 594 wordsBody       "Together we remain," on the demonstrators' posters (AFP)A week after the assault on the Hong Kong Parliament, tens of thousands of people on Sunday a new demonstration began on Sunday to continue demandingthe final withdrawal of the controversial extradition bill and the resignation of the head of the government Carrie Lam.The march ran through the peninsular district of Kowloon, a shopping area where many tourists congregate, mostly from mainland China.A protester shouts slogans during protest (AFP)This is the first time in recent weeks that one of these demonstrations in protest against the bill is held in this area and not on the island of Hong Kong, home to the main financial district.Some of those mobilized have said they seek in this way to explain their claim to those living on the continent.The flag of the United Kingdom, which ruled Hong Kong until 1997, among the protesters, a symbol of opposition to China's control (AFP)Protesters, mostly dressed in black, are displaying signs with slogans such as "Together, standing," "No to Extradition to China" or "Carrie Lam, resignation." Lam, however, enjoys the full support of the Chinese government, which urges her to repress protesters who turn violent.The protest is expected to end next to the high-speed train station, which connects to Beijing and other cities in China.A demonstrator with a yellow umbrella, symbol of the 2014 protests against Beijing that has returned to the streets (AFP)A device of about 1,500 police officers has been deployed in these facilities, in the prevention of possible incidents.Through social media and the Telegram messaging app, groups of protesters have called to "take" the station, one of the main symbols of the Chinese presence in the city, as inside are police officers and marks one of the borders of the autonomous region.This time the protestoccurs on the mainland and not on the island of Hong Kong, and is expected to culminate at the train station (AFP)After the assault on the Legislative Council, which took place last monday, the demonstrators were in a kind of period of reflection until they decided to call this new protest.The events took place on the same day as the twenty-second anniversary of the 1997 transfer of Hong Kong's sovereignty to China over the UnitedKingdom, following a demonstration involving some 550,000 People.It is the first large protest organized after the takeover of Parliament, a week ago (AFP)This Sunday is the last of the numerous protests since the end of March to demand the withdrawal of the controversial extraditionbill, which would facilitate the delivery of suspects to other jurisdictions, including mainland China .As a result the bill has been postponed, but yet the turmoil persists and protesters are now calling for democraticreforms and a brake on Chinese rule of Hong Kong, a city that has a special status and greater freedoms than others localities in mainland China.Since the start of the demonstrations, the EFE agency has told the EFE agency of sources of the pro-democracy movement, 71 people arrested, 15 of them after the break-in in Parliament.Vigils were also held yesterday in memory of the four young people who have committed suicide in recent weeks in connection with the protests.Thousands of umbrellas gathered for protest (AFP)With information from EFE and AFPMORE ON THIS THEME:"Hong Kong is not China": photos of Parliament's demonstrationHong Kong police regained control of the Legislature buildingIs Hong Kong part of China?

At protests in Hong Kong, faces are weaponsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 1, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1090 wordsBody       Demonstrators in Hong Kong on July 14. Many people wear masks to thwart attempts by police cameras to identify them. (Lam Yik Fei/The New York Times)HONG KONG — Officers fought Colin Cheung in a police car that looked particular. They needed to search his face.They took him by the jaw to force him to put his head in front of his iPhone. He was slapped. They yelled, "Wake up!" They opened his eyes. Nothing worked: Cheung had disabled access to his phone with facial recognition after quickly pressing a button as soon as he was arrested.After several weeks of intense protests, Hong Kong protesters and police have turned identities into weapons. Authorities search online for protest leaders and search their phones. Now many protesters cover their faces and fear that the police are using cameras and perhaps other tools to locate them.When police stopped using badges as violence escalated, some protesters began exposing officers' identities online. A Telegram channel, the messaging app, searches for and publishes personal information about officers and their families. The channel, Dadfindboy, has more than 50,000 subscribers and promotes violence in a raw and caricatured way. Rival pro-government channels seek to unmask protesters in a similar way.Cheung, who was arrested last week on suspicion of "conspiracy and complicity in a homicide, is subscribed to the Dadfindboy channel, although he denied being one of its founders, as the police have claimed, and concited the publications inciting violence. Cheung believes he was arrested because he developed a tool that could compare images with a set of photos of officers to find matches, a project he later abandoned."I don't want them to be like a secret police," said Cheung, who was released on bail and has not been charged with any crime. "If law enforcement uses nothing to show their identity, they will become corrupt. They can do whatever they want."One protester spray-painted a security camera outside the Chinese government office in Hong Kong last week. As protests intensify, faces and identities have become powerful weapons for both sides. (Lam Yik Fei/The New York Times)"With the tool, ordinary citizens can know who the cops are," he added.Hong Kong is at the forefront of a significant change in the methods used by the authorities to track down dangerous criminals and legitimate political protesters alike, as well as in the ability of its objectives to respond. Across the border with China, police often capture people via digitized fingerprints,obtained through one of the most invasive surveillance systems in the world. The advent of facial recognition technology and the rapid expansion of a vast network of cameras and other monitoring tools have significantly increased those capabilities.The transformation touches on a very sensitive fiber in Hong Kong. The protests began with a bill that would have allowed the city to extradite crime suspects to mainland China, where police and courts ultimately respond to the Communist Party.Hong Kong authorities have issued strict privacy controls for the use of facial recognition and the collection of other biometric data, although the scope of these efforts is unclear. It also appears that they are using other technological methods to monitor the protesters. Last month, a 22-year-old man was arrested for being the administrator of a Telegram group.Protesters are responding. On Sunday, as another protest turned into a violent confrontation with police, some of those involved directed laser pointers at police cameras and used spray paint to block the lenses of the placed security cameras in front of the Chinese government liaison office. Some riot officers held cameras on sticks just behind the vanguard as they fired tear gas and rubber bullets.The anger of the protesters intensified after police removed the identification numbers from their uniform, presumably to prevent violent acts from being reported to city leaders. For some protesters, the maneuver suggests that police follow the example of mainland China, where officers have no public responsibility and often fail to identify.Representatives of the Hong Kong police said that the personal information of officers and their friends and relatives had been posted online. On July 3, police said they had arrested eight people accused of disclosing unapproved personal information, among other charges. A spokesman for law enforcement mentioned that members of the police force reported more than eight hundred incidents in which officers or their families had been harassed after the data was disclosed.Dadfindboy is a forum for disclosing private information (or doxxing) of police officers. With an ingenious tone, youthful, cruel or profane there is published personal information and photos, some of them intimate, of the relatives of police officers.The channel has called for violence, often in caricatured ways, although there is no evidence that it has incited any specific act. One publication instructed the protesters in the use of the slingshots. Another explained how to make a blowtorch with spray deodorant. A recent survey asked channel fans what were the best ways to punish the police. Options included jail, gas chambers, living burial, guillotine, and machine gun executions. He won to bury them alive with about a third of the vote.Police arrested Cheung eleven days after the Telegram channel was created and accused him of being the administrator. He also accused him of publishing a guide on how to murder police officers. Cheung denies the allegations and an investigation by The New York Times could not find publications consistent with what was described by the police.Cheung, a very thin 29-year-old man, was arrested at a mall around noon on July 18, according to his version of events. Four plainclothes cops waited for him to unlock his phone and then he wasthey lay on top of it to try to forcibly remove it from their hands.After officers tried to use his face to unlock the phone, they took him to the police station where, according to Cheung, he was beaten and interrogated. Police officers then went to his home and used a USB stick loaded with software to unauthorizedly access their computers, according to Cheung's version of the incident. He also said he was detained for more than ten hours and was unsure how he had been identified by the police.Hong Kong police confirmed the investigation, but refused to offer further comment.*Copyright: c.2019 New York Times News ServiceLoad-Date: August 1, 2019End of Document

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -53.60.The S&P 500 futures trade 14 points below fair value.Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region were relatively mixed on Friday following an otherwise good week for most markets. Today's mixed disposition was attributed in part to a wait-and-see attitude in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report, which will have implications for the Fed's policy stance. Other factors in play included a preliminary estimate from Samsung Electronics that its second quarter profit was down 56% yr/yr, a stronger-than-expected household spending report for May out of Japan, and a South China Morning Post report indicating China won't buy agricultural goods from the U.S. if the U.S. "flip flops again in future trade negotiations."In economic data: Japan's May Household Spending +5.5% m/m (expected +1.2%, last -1.4%) and +4.0% yr/yr (expected +1.4%, last +1.3%); May Preliminary Leading Index 95.2 (expected 95.3, last 95.9)Australia's June AIG Construction Index 43.0 (last 40.4)---Equity Markets---Japan's Nikkei: +0.2% (+2.0% for the week)Hong Kong's Hang Seng: -0.1% (+0.8% for the week)China's Shanghai Composite: +0.2% (+1.1% for the week)India's Sensex: -1.0% (+0.3% for the week)South Korea's Kospi: +0.1% (-0.9% for the week)Australia's ASX All Ordinaries: +0.5% (+2.0% for the week)Major European indices are registering modest losses in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report. A decidedly disappointing Factory Orders report for May out of Germany, however, has been an early guide for the negative stance. Additionally, the news from Thursday that the British navy seized an Iranian oil tanker headed for Syria has fostered some geopolitical angst that is keeping buying efforts in check.In economic data (Thursday and Friday): Eurozone's May Retail Sales -0.3% m/m (expected +0.4%, last -0.1%) and +1.3% yr/yr (expected +1.6%, last +1.8%)Germany's May Factory Orders -2.2% m/m (expected -0.1%, last +0.4%); June Construction PMI 50.0 (expected 52.0, last 51.4)Switzerland's June CPI 0.0% m/m (expected -0.1%, last +0.3%) and +0.6% yr/yr (expected +0.5%, last +0.6%)France's May Trade Balance EUR -3.3B (expected EUR -5.7B, last EUR -4.9B)Spain's May Industrial Production +1.4% (expected +1.1%, last +1.8%); June Consumer Confidence 102.3 (expected 95.1, last 96.9)U.K.'s June Halifax House Price Index -0.3% m/m (expected +0.3%, last +0.4%) and +5.7% yr/yr (expected +5.4%, last +5.2%); Q1 Labor Productivity -0.5% (expected -0.6%, last +0.3%)---Equity Markets---STOXX Europe 600: -0.6%Germany's DAX: -0.6%U.K.'s FTSE 100: -0.6%France's CAC 40: -0.5%Italy's FTSE MIB: -0.4%Spain's IBEX 35: -0.6%08:33WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: -4.90.

HUAWEI'S NORTH KOREA 3G COLLABORATION LIKELY VIOLATED SANCTIONS, EXPORT LAWS, EXPERTS SAYStates News ServiceJuly 23, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 832 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A report this week by The Washington Post showing how the Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co. secretly helped the North Korean government build the country's commercial wireless network points to sanctions and export control law violations and underscores the depth of Beijing-Pyongyang ties, analysts say.The Post, citing spreadsheets and other internal documents obtained from a former Huawei employee, reported on Monday that Huawei partnered with a Chinese state-owned firm, Panda International Information Technology Co. Ltd., on a variety of North Korea projects over at least eight years."Taken together, the revelations raise questions about whether Huawei, which has used American technology in its components, violated U.S. export controls to furnish equipment to North Korea, where the isolated regime has faced extensive international sanctions over its nuclear weapons program and human rights abuses," said the U.S. daily.The newspaper published a statement from the company that said ""Huawei is fully committed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the countries and regions where we operate, including all export control and sanction laws and regulations" of the United Nations, United States and European Union.Analysts told RFA's Korea Service that the Huawei transactions in North Korea revealed in The Post report point to likely violations of international sanctions implemented under U.N. auspices to curb Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and missile programs. Sales to North Korea of equipment containing U.S.-origin components would also violate U.S. export control laws."Much of this appears to have occurred before the major implementation of UNSC sanctions. But given Huawei dependence on US semiconductors, there is a fair possibility that Huawei violated U.S. export control laws," said Robert Manning, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council."In any case, this disclosure complicates U.S.-China relations, as the fate of Huawei is a major element in current U.S.-China trade talks,"In May, the U.S. Commerce Department added Huawei and nearly 70 affiliates to its prohibitive "entities list" of companies that pose a threat to the nation, based on the possibility that its products could be used for surveillance. Huawei, at the center of a U.S. trade war with China, has denied that it poses a security threat."It looks like there was a possible violation of sanctions here -- though that is still unclear and perhaps something unable to be proven (as Huawei appears to be denying everything)," said Bruce Bechtol, a former intelligence officer at the Defense Intelligence Agency who is now a professor at Angelo State University in Texas."But the sales of this type of technology and equipment to North Korea is a violation of sanctions. If it can be proven, the United States is likely to take further action," he said."It also shows that Chinese companies remain willing and able to do business with North Korea, while at the same time attempting to keep it as low key as possible and avoiding any negative publicity in the West," added Bechtol.RFA sought comment by telephone and e-mail from the Chinese embassy in Washington, the U.S. Department of Justice and other agencies and received no reply.The US Department of Commerce and the Treasury Department declined to comment.A U.S. Department of State official said the agency was aware of the report but said "we are not going to comment on its veracity.""Huawei has long conducted business with malign foreign actors," the state department official said."Earlier this year, Huawei was indicted for its duplicitous activity to evade sanctions against Iran. As we have repeatedly stated, we believe there are significant risks to doing business with Huawei," added the official.Huawei is one of the world's leaders in smartphone production and a top telecom provider of 5G networks, which analysts believe will transform society through high data transmission rates that can power self-driving cars, support remote surgery, and create smart cities that optimize the use of resources.But in addition to blacklisting the firm over fears its technology could be coopted by the Chinese government for surveillance purposes, the U.S. is pushing other nations to also ban the telecom provider."Considering the fact Huawei already broke U.S sanctions law in conducting business with Iran, it is long past time to wall off American networks from this rogue firm," said Harry Kazianis, director of Defense Studies at the Center for the National Interest. He said the report on Huawei helping North Korea "clearly shows it will do business with anyone.""Simply stated, they should be permanently banned from selling any new telecom equipment in the U.S, nor should we sell them any technology to help them sell their good to anyone else," he told RFA.Reported by Rhee Kyung-ha and Kim So-young for RFA's Korean Service.

For Apple Investors, Trump's Unpredictable Trade Policies Have a Silver LiningTheStreet.comAugust 18, 2019 Sunday 11:23 AM EDTCopyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 546 wordsByline: Annie GausHighlight: It's created an environment of low expectations for the stock, which trades at a much lower multiple compared to other tech giants.BodyAs Apple  investors know all too well, things can turn on a dime when it comes to trade.The Trump administration's ongoing trade conflict with China has taken investors on a wild ride over the past year, but there was good news for Apple investors this week. The White House announced a postponement of a planned 25% tariff on laptops, cell phones and other electronics until Dec. 15; Apple shares are up 2.7% since the tariff reprieve was announced."It goes to show it's a fluid situation -- there seems to be a lot of movement, and just when you think a direction has been set, things change," said D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte. As just one example of the complexity in weighing the overall risk of tariffs, it also came to light this week that Apple Watch -- a rising star of Apple's hardware portfolio -- will be subject to a  along with AirPods and Home Pod. A reprieve from iPhone tariffs is an obvious plus for Apple. In early August,, Bank of America analysts estimated the earnings hit from the tariffs at roughly $0.50-$0.75 per share; the tariff reprieve gives Apple essentially a full year of iPhone and other electronics sales free from additional tariff impacts. "While the U.S. government is trying its best to use tariffs to improve its negotiating leverage with the Chinese government, this is a reminder that the consumer electronics companies in the U.S. still have very significant influence on policy," Forte added. It isn't clear if Apple played any direct role in the tariff reprieve, but it is conceivable that there was some manner of influence at play. Apple CEO Tim Cook was slated to dine with the president Friday evening, according to a Trump tweet.There may be another silver lining to the trade uncertainty, according to Forte."Apple benefits tremendously from low expectations, and the trade war has done nothing but lower them," he added. "It's created a benevolent environment for the stock."Apple currently trades at the lowest multiple of the FAANG grouping; as of August 15, Apple's price-to-earnings ratio was 17.28, substantially less than Amazon  (73.15), Facebook  (30.46), or Alphabet  (22.42).Forte isn't alone in pointing out the signs of low expectations around Apple shares relative to other tech giants. With Apple gradually shifting the narrative away from iPhone sales and onto services and other products, notably wearables, more bullish analysts believe Wall Street hasn't totally caught up to the new reality. "Keep in mind, in the most recent quarter, Apple earned 2x more than Facebook and Amazon combined and has over a billion daily active users," wrote Loup Ventures' Gene Munster of Apple's most recent quarter, which demonstrated strong growth in services and wearables revenue as well as a modest return to growth in China. On a July 30 investor call, CEO Tim Cook was  , and about the business overall, telling investors "we feel very good about the trajectory."A confluence of factors led to the improvement: a Chinese government stimulus, a trade-in programs and other proactive pricing action by Apple, and "growing engagement with the broader Apple ecosystem" according to Cook.Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook are holdings in Jim Cramer's.

A gang of masked people beats up citizens on the Hong Kong subwayCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 22, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 695 wordsBodyThe seventh consecutive weekend of protests in Hong Kong turned the city centre back into a battlefield. Overnight, gangs of men dressed in white T-shirts - as opposed to the black color of the mobilizations - beat the protesters on the subway with sticks. Another Sunday, the Hong Kongers took to the streets to reiterate their rejection of the extradition law, "dead" but not withdrawn, and become a symbol of the Chinese government's slow erosion of the system of freedoms.A long peaceful march toured the city centre during the day until violence arrived with the night. Young protesters protected with helmets, masks and umbrellas cut off several avenues in the Central District and surrounded Wanchai police station, as they did on previous occasions. The novelty came when the crowd pointed to their true adversary and for the first time headed to the representative office of the Chinese government, to which they threw eggs and whose emblem they crossed with spray, a symbolic gesture similar to that made inside the Parliament. In the last month these demonstrations have repeatedly summoned more than one million people in a territory of 7.3 million inhabitants. On this occasion, the usual number dance ranged from 430,000 attendees according to the organizers, the Civil Human Rights Front, and the 138,000 of the police.Police riot gear sused tear gas and rubber balls to disperse the crowd in clashes that were especially violent in the area adjacent to the ferry terminal to Macau, until the protesters ended up retreat around midnight. Many of them left the area by metro, where the second focus of violence took place of the day.Attacks on protestersAt the Yuen Long metro stop, a residential neighborhood in the Nuevos Territorios area, a group of white-clad men attacked all those wearing the black color of the protesters in a charge that was left with at least 45 wounded. The assailants were armed with wooden sticks and metal tubes, a choice that does not seem to be the result of chance: pro-Chinese propaganda tends to portray Hong Kongers as spoiled children who must be disciplined at a whim by their parents. This same expression was used by Arthur Shek, vice president of the Hong Kong Economic Times, during his speech at Saturday morning's pro-China march.Multiple videos shared on social media capture the aggressions perpetrated by those suspected of being members of the local mafias, known as triads, recruited by supporters of the Chinese regime. Images released throughout today show lawmaker Junius Ho, opposed to protests, greeting cordially and conpering to several of the men in white. Similar attacks had already taken place during the 2014 Umbrella Revolution.Many of the criticisms of the citizens have been directed against the actions of the police force, whose telephone line was blocked and ended up being late to the scene. At a press conference called at 5 a.m. today, Yau Nai-keung, assistant district commander, stated that "police started receiving calls after ten o'clock at night." In Yau's words, there were about a hundred people concentrated in the subway station, so they had to wait for the arrival of reinforcements. The riots continued overnight in the nearby village of Nam Pim Wai, from which police withdrew without making any arrests.The reputation of Hong Kong's police force, once regarded as one of the mostAsia, has sunk after these weeks of protests. One of the protesters' demands calls for their repressive action to be subject to an independent investigation. This has made them more cautious, which explains their passivity during last week's assault on Parliament; a movement that has also been interpreted as a strategic decision for the vandalization of the official headquarters to damage the favorable international image enjoyed by the protests.Carrie Lam, chief executive, has repeatedly put her position on the table but her resignation, another of the protesters' basic requests, has been blocked from Beijing. The conflict continues without an apparent solution in sight. Meanwhile, Hong Kong is further sinking into a spiral of violence that begins to create deep social fragmentation.Load-Date: July 22, 2019End of Document

Taiwan's $2.2B missile, tank purchase approved by State DepartmentUPIJuly 9, 2019 Tuesday 1:16 PM ESTCopyright 2019 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 564 wordsByline: ALLEN CONEDateline: Dec. 31 BodyThe State Department has approved two contracts worth $2.2 billion for possible foreign military sales to Taiwan of Abrams tanks and Stinger missiles.The Defense Security Cooperation Agency on Monday notified Congress it approved a $2 billion deal for 108 M1A2T Abrams tanks and a $223.6 million deal for Man-Portable Air-Defense Stinger missiles, as well as related equipment and support, as negotiated by the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office.The sales serve U.S. national, economic, and security interests, DSCA said, by supporting Taiwan's "continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability."DSCA said the sales will improve the security and assist in "maintaining political stability, military balance and economic progress in the region."General Dynamics Land Systems will be the primary contractor for the 108 M1A2T Abrams tanks, as well as 216 M240 Machine Guns, 14 M88A2 HERCULES vehicles, 16 M1070A1 heavy equipment transporters and ammunition.As of 2015, Taiwan has 376 M60A3 Patton tanks, which were introduced by Chrysler's Detroit Arsenal in 1959, and 450 Brave Tiger tanks, developed by General Dynamics and the Republic of China Army, which have been in service since 1990, according to GlobalSecurity.org.Production of the new tanks will be at Anniston Army Depot, Anniston, Ala., and the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center in Lima, Ohio. The M88A2 recovery vehicle prime contractor will be BAE Systems in York, Pa., and the M1070Al Heavy Equipment Transporter prime contractor will be Oshkosh in Wisconsin.Raytheon Missile Systems is the primary contractor for the 250 Block I-92F MANPAD Stinger missiles and four Block I-92F MANPAD Stinger Fly-to-Buy missiles, as well as a trainers, parts and other support.Both deals include U.S. government and contractor representatives on the ground in Taiwan, Twelve representatives will be in Taiwan for six weeks to support the Stinger, while 30 government representatives and 15 contractors will be there for up to six years to manage fielding and training on the Abrams tanks.Mainland China on Tuesday described the sales to Taiwan as a "reckless" policy."The United States has recklessly interfered in Chinese domestic affairs," Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular press briefing. "It has undermined China's sovereignty and security interests."Beijing recognizes Taiwan as a breakaway province. In 1949, Chinese nationalist leaders fled to Taiwan when  came to power."Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory," the foreign ministry spokesman said. "Do not underestimate the Chinese government and the people's will to defend national sovereignty and territory."Taiwan has been working to modernize and upgrade its defense capabilities, with several deals receiving approval in the last few months.Raytheon in May was awarded a $355.4 million contract to refurbish AGM-88B missiles for Qatar, Bahrain and Taiwan, though the breakdown of what each country received was not announced. The State Department in April also approved a $500 million possible contract renewal for training of Taiwanese F-16 pilots and maintenance support at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona.Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense in February applied to buy F16-V fighter jets, known as Vipers. The State Department has not yet approved the deal.Load-Date: July 10, 2019End of Document

I even have my -- I even have proper shoes on. Again, it's like the old Bugs Bunny cartoon with Elmer Fudd, you have to have your proper outfit on or attire, or your personality changes.BARTIROMO: Well, there's a camera over there, so we're still be able to check out your hot shoes that --MCDOWELL: I didn't --BARTIROMO: -- you have on all of the time.MCDOWELL: What row? I didn't know that. I'm glad I did not make that mistake.MIKE MURPHY, CEO & MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF: This is amazing and you deserve it. I was out with friends last night in New York City at Elio's, on the Upper East Side, five finance-type people all say hello, all big fans of you, big fans of the show and you deserve this. It's awesome.BARTIROMO: Great. Thank you so much.MURPHY: Congratulations.BARTIROMO: Yes. No, it feels good.BUD CUMMINS, FORMER ATTORNEY OF THE UNITED STATES: And for -- and for the bigger guys, I kind of like having the counter. The last time I was here, you're exposed all the way down. You have to kind of make sure your suits fit just right.BARTIROMO: Well, we are glad you're here. We've got a focus on Mueller this morning, and we want to get your take on what to expect. The former special counsel going before lawmakers in about two hours, 8:30 a.m. Eastern is when it starts. He'll be accompanied by a key aid, Aaron Zebley, who worked with Mueller during his nearly two-year investigation.This will be the first time Mr. Mueller is answering questions about the probe. President Trump commented on it yesterday. Here's what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: No collusion, no obstruction. Oh, that's not good enough, let's go more, $40 million, interview 500 people, they've got nothing, 2,500 subpoenas, they did everything. They're collusion, no collusion. They have no collusion.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Yes. We've been talking about this for a long time. Bud, what are you expecting?CUMMINS: Theater, political theater, I don't think there'll be any new information that comes up, Robert Mueller is a smart guy, and I think the Democrats are going to just try and cut some campaign ads. That they're going to --BARTIROMO: Yes, but what about --CUMMINS: -- try to get him to read from the report and make clips out of it.BARTIROMO: What about the Republicans? I mean, the Republicans will want to know if Mueller focused, at all, on the origins of the Russia investigation, why we've been having our heads on fire for three years about collusion, when we knew from the get-go, certainly this group did, that there was no collusion and it was a setup.CUMMINS: Sure there's a series of questions that he'll be asked and I don't expect -- I think he'll dodge them, but I hope he answers them, the questions --You know, frankly, I was on your show for the first time, talking about this, around the time he was appointed, and we were already seeing that the basis for the allegations seemed to be falling apart, but yet within a month of his appointment, he already had 13 lawyers appointed on -- he was gearing up for something big.And I'd like to know what he thought he was gearing up for, because it seemed pretty apparent that the Russian collusion story was falling apart within weeks of his appointment.BARTIROMO: Thirteen lawyers, which is one of the questions, I think --CUMMINS: Which become 19 --BARTIROMO: -- that the Republicans want to ask. How did you come -- how did you come to this group? Given the fact that so many of them were either Clinton donors, Clinton fans, they worked with the Clinton global initiative, I mean, it was pretty extraordinary, his group, that was so bipartisan.MCDOWELL: That might be one of the only --BARTIROMO: Part bipartisan rather.MCDOWELL: -- questions from the Republicans that he might be willing to answer, but if he gets grilled about the predicate of the counterintelligence probe within the FBI, about the evidentiary basis of it, about the use of the Steele dossier.Again, how it wound up being used to spy -- funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and used to spy on her opponent. I doubt he will answer any of those questions. And the Republicans need to be careful, as well, that they don't overplay their hand.Again, if they try to turn it into theater and Mueller says nothing in his answer, then that can reflect badly upon them.BARTIROMO: Yes, you're absolutely right.MURPHY: It's amazing that we're at this point now from where it started and you've been calling it the whole way that it's kind of a hoax. And now that we're here, and now coming at them from both sides, I mean, it is -- you couldn't have scripted a better Hollywood story.BARTIROMO: It's unbelievable.MURPHY: It's amazing.MCDOWELL: it's not Hollywood. The Wall Street Journal editorial page calls it a summer rerun, that basically, the -- it's a flagging T.V. show and they're bringing in a celebrity guest, the Democrats are.BARTIROMO: Yes. I like the way that piece started. There's nothing better for ratings than a celebrity -- a celebrity guest --MCDOWELL: But he's Charo, I mean, he's not going to really boost the ratings, I'd date myself by saying that.CUMMINS: But what's critical, and I hope that people try to understand this, is the special counsel -- I was a United States attorney, special counsel is basically United States attorney that wasn't appointed by the president, he's being asked to investigate. And he had the same job, the same powers.There's nothing about that job that says you go out and investigate somebody, don't find a crime, and then write a lengthy unflattering report and release into the public. If I'd have done that to anybody, I'd have been fired in 20 seconds.And so, there's -- this is not a criminal investigation, at that point, it becomes political, and it's very obvious that that report was written for political purposes, to me, I don't think there's any real explanation, especially for volume two, the obstruction stuff to me, ludicrous.MCDOWELL: And the inappropriate claim that he didn't -- the report did not exonerate President Trump. That was highly inappropriate. The Democrats are going to try and play off of that. But I read the entire Mueller report, and you have --And I've said this before, you have an FBI investigation, a Mueller investigation that went ahead, that were not obstructed. You have no witnesses interfered with, 500 search warrants, and the Mueller team interviewed anybody they wanted to, even people within the White House.That's not obstruction. And 21 percent of Americans, only 21 percent, want impeachment hearings started. The Democrats to try to move the needle on that, good luck, not happening.BARTIROMO: There's a new reporting this morning from John Solomon about Mifsud. And in the -- in the Mueller report, Joseph Mifsud is referred to as a Russian operative. We knew that was questionable.We've known that was questionable for a long time, we have George Papadopoulos on my "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" program earlier this year, who told us the whole story about Joseph Mifsud and how he dropped the bomb in his lap and said oh, the Russians have e-mails from Hillary Clinton. We're going to get to that, that's coming up in the program.But even as this -- Mueller testifies today, there's new information coming up about the origins of the Russia investigation, and why the left just basically inserted Donald Trump into Russia meddling in the -- in the west. We want to look at that this morning.We're also looking at big tech, big technologies under fire, the Department of Justice, opening an antitrust review into certain technology companies likely affecting Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple, Mike, your reaction to this?MURPHY: All trading down a little bit this morning, but if you remember, Google went through something very similar a few years ago. I don't think there's too much here, really. It's important that they look into them. It's important that we understand that it's a fair business environment.But when you look at them, I mean, think about Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, there's enough competition amongst these four, and then there's other new technology companies that we talk about often that are coming into the frame now.So, I don't think there's too much there. There may be something for the government needs to look, I think, but I don't think it's going to have too much of an impact, and remember, Microsoft was the first big tech company to go through this, made it through unscathed, then look at them now.BARTIROMO: Even though -- even though Google does control 90 percent of search, that's the market share, and I know this is about privacy, this is about censoring conservatives, but the market share on Google, it's, I mean, 90 percent.MURPHY: It is, and then you can go to Google not working with the U.S. government, and working with the --BARTIROMO: That's right.MURPHY: -- Chinese government, so --BARTIROMO: There's that.MURPHY: -- there's -- Google has more exposure than anyone else there, but I think, again, they've been down this road before and they were able to come out of it without any issues and I think the same will happen here.BARTIROMO: OK.MCDOWELL: Bud might be able to weigh in on this, but I think that, in terms of, it might not be legal action by the justice department, but ultimately, the Federal Trade Commission, I think, is going to prevent a lot.It is going to take a closer look at any acquisition that these large companies make, because what they've been doing, not just say, Facebook buying Instagram or WhatsApp, but they go out and buy small companies, small companies, small companies, just to gobble up the talent, and basic - -A lot of times, they'll buy the company and then not do anything with the technology, so that does inhibit growth in this country in terms of innovation and even exploration.One other story that was in the Journal, and this is, again, the regulatory pressure on these companies, Bill Barr, the attorney general, is reopening the debate over whether tech companies Apple and Facebook, should be required to provide law enforcement agencies with a way to break encryption on devices and apps used by terrorists, drug cartels and other criminal suspects.Barr said yesterday, warrant proof encryption was enabling dangerous criminals to cloak their communications and activities behind an essentially impenetrable digital shield. This is the San Bernardino terrorism case where Apple basically went to court to fight the FBI from having to rewrite code and open the device. This is a huge, huge issue for tech companies going forward.BARTIROMO: Yes, it sure is, and the privacy issues and the breaches happen every day. We continue to get more evidence of these breaches and how they're handling our information.CUMMINS: But if they open it up for terrorist investigations, pretty soon they'll be also investigating financial people and bankers, and lawyers, so you know, it's a --MCDOWELL: Slippery slope.CUMMINS: -- slippery slope.MURPHY: Ad if they do that, I think the criminals are ones who are going to figure out a way around it or the next way to do it without being tracked.BARTIROMO: Which is what Apple said from the get-go, we don't want to have a back door because once there's a back door, there's a back door.CUMMINS: There's a -- and they want to use it.BARTIROMO: For others to get in.MCDOWELL: No, I was just going to say, but you go into -- investigate a pedophile, and if their phone is locked, their computer is locked, there is nothing you can do about it.And I know the Manhattan district attorney, Cy Vance, has talked to you about that very thing, about they have cases where they can't really pursue these criminals, even these pedophiles, because they can't get access to the information on their devices.CUMMINS: But we've got FISA warrants to chase terrorists, not Carter Page, but we chase Carter Page with one, so --BARTIROMO: That's right.CUMMINS: -- that's the problem.BARTIROMO: Good point, because the team -- the FBI and the DOJ were using our terrorism tools, informants, you know, spying and wiretapping, these are things we use for terrorists. They were using it on Donald Trump.CUMMINS: How do you not use a tool that's on the table --BARTIROMO: Just incredible.CUMMINS: -- if you think you're doing something you should be --BARTIROMO: Real quick on Boeing, we got to get to Boeing earnings. It's going to be a market mover. The aerospace giant expected to release the second quarter numbers in the hour, investors are watching closely. Given the company's problems with the 737 Max jet, the potential impact it could have on Friday's GDP numbers, as well.And Mike, I want to get your comment here, but also, on Caterpillar. Caterpillar is basically giving you an indication of the global economy, particularly China as well.MURPHY: Exactly, more of a (INAUDIBLE) on Caterpillar, Boeing, I think, is specific to the 737s and how they're going talk about their orders going forward. But remember, Boeing stock has rallied a little bit more than 10 percent, leading into these earnings announcement, although, its traded off since the news it has rallied.Caterpillar is going to be interesting because they should give us a good read on China, what's going on over in China. And, again, I think the U.S. will carry Caterpillar, but the international markets, I don't expect much from.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll keep watching that. We've got a lot on the show this morning. We'll take a quick break.When we come back, extreme weather, the incredible moment a tornado rips the roof off of a motel, we've got the pictures, wait until you see this mayhem, and then earnings on tap, Boeing, Caterpillar, AT&T, among the heavy hitters reporting this morning, all of the numbers and the impact, coming up. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Puerto Rico's governor, reportedly resigning today, Cheryl Casone on headlines right now, Cheryl, good morning.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. Well, massive cheers in Puerto Rico, on news that Governor Ricardo Rossello is stepping down.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Well, a Puerto Rican newspaper, the main one there, has reported that the embattled governor is going to resign today, after a week of massive protests there. Leaked messages from within Rossello's inner circle revealed insensitive comments.On Sunday, he announced he will not seek re-election next year, but he vowed, at the time, to stay in office. We're waiting for the developments out of there.Back here, in the U.S., the northeast is cleaning up this morning after severe storms slammed the region. Cape Cod, Massachusetts hit with two very rare tornadoes. And then, take a look at this, a tornado completely ripped off a hotel roof, terrifying the guests that were -- yes, on vacation there. Luckily, nobody was hurt.Well, investors are liking what they're seeing in Chipotle's latest earnings, the stock rallied in overnight trading after the company's second quarter profit and same-store sales topped expectations. Chipotle, which you're seeing, certainly share problems with food safety, also raised guidance for the year. So, a little bit of a turnaround there.Shares of Snap, by the way, sharply higher in premarket trading, we should add. After the bell, the Snapchat parent reported a smaller than expected loss on revenue that beat the street's forecast. There's the stock in the premarket, 10 and a quarter percent to the upside. User growth, by the way, hit a record. That was one of the concerns from investors, so they're gaining new users.UPS is soon going to begin Sunday pickup and delivery, keeping up with their rival, FedEx. UPS is going to start working seven days a week in January. The two largest carriers are under pressure to speed up deliveries as, of course, long-time customer, Amazon, is building out its own transportation systems with its own planes.UPS is set to report earnings at 7:00 a.m. We're going to bring you those numbers as soon as they come in, Maria, and those are your headlines this morning.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Cheryl, great. All right, we'll take a short break. When we come back, Tech Rec, shares of big technology tumbling this morning, after the Department of Justice announces a massive antitrust investigation into whether or not these companies are actually too big.Then, caught on camera, the heart-stopping moment, a bison charges at a little girl and launches her into the air. Look at this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. AT&T is reporting earnings that are in line with expectations right now. You'll see it on the tape in a moment. Meanwhile, we're looking at a big crack down on big technology.Shares of Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google, parent company, Alphabet, all under pressure this morning, after the Department of Justice announced a broad antitrust review aimed at investigating whether these companies stifle competition.This comes as several of these big tech companies will be reporting earnings this week and next, joining us right now, to talk more about that, is Payne Capital Management president, Ryan Payne, and Applico CEO, Alex Moazed, and it's great to see both gentlemen, thanks very much for joining us.RYAN PAYNE, PRESIDENT, PAYNE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: So, I guess, let me start with you Ryan, because the stocks are under pressure this morning, as an investor, what do you want to do when you come in and the top story in the Journal this morning is this major antitrust inquiry into tech?PAYNE: I mean, down 1-1/2 percent isn't exactly major pressure, Maria.So, I think it also tells you the market is not overly concerned about it. But I'm just hard-pressed to think any of these stocks or companies or monopoly, I mean, for instance, Amazon is literally half the revenue of Wal-Mart, so it's hard to justify that they have a monopoly on e-commerce sales or, you know, any sort of retail sales in general.BARTIROMO: You wonder -- you wonder, Alex, if you know, this antitrust investigation trips over other things, I mean, as we speak, Congressmen Devin Nunes is suing Twitter for censoring his conversation for taking his posts down and leaving others up, which are similar in nature, you've got the president saying that he doesn't get fair -- treated fairly.So, I know that the antitrust app -- the antitrust investigation, when you look at, you know, dominance, Amazon may not be dominant. What about tripping into other things?ALEX MOAZED, CEO, APPLICO: Well, I think that's exactly what this antitrust review is looking at is, how do these tech platform monopolies, they absolutely are monopolies, how do they compete or thwart the producers, the suppliers, the content creators on a Twitter, on a YouTube, on a Facebook. The websites on a Google search, the sellers on an Amazon.And that absolutely is where they get in trouble. That's what basically what Microsoft got in trouble within the 90s.MURPHY: So much of Apple's revenue and their whole business is built around iPhone, yet there's so many smartphones out there from Google to Samsung, so would you call Apple a monopoly, or is it because the Apple store, how do you look at that?MOAZED: Basically, all of these platform industries have a winner take all dynamic, which means there's one or two given winners, so there's iOS and Android, and they absolutely control 95 percent of all of the actual operating systems in mobile.And then you look at, there's an article in the Wall Street Journal, this morning, about Apple get favoring its own apps, versus other third party app developers in the app store, which is the same thing as Google, favoring its own content over Yelp and TripAdvisor and many other sites.And this is where they get in trouble, when they vertically integrate or they compete unfairly with the producers that are supposed to be contributing value or content or apps into the platform's ecosystem. That's kind of what you would call, maybe, being greedy.MCDOWELL: And it would be in previous years, unthinkable, maybe, that a Republican administration at a Republican White House would have its justice department reviewing companies in this way, but not with this president. Because, again, he has a view --He has talked about these large tech companies in the same way that Elizabeth Warren has talked about them, in terms of their overriding power and that they've got too much power and too few hands, so --CUMMINS: Well, their signal, not only in the attorney general's comments, but if you read it, you know, the FTC and DOJ, they haven't just had one meeting about this. Apparently, there's been a series of meetings and negotiations.You know, it's not just the -- well, let's have a meeting about antitrust so we can check that box and say we -- this is something they're working on, and they -- and they -- and they put a lot of energy into. So, I think something will come out of it.I don't know. I'm not an antitrust guy, and I'm certainly not a big tech guy, so I don't know what the potential remedies might be if they found problems. I'd be interested -- you know, what do you think is worse case for them, what might happen?BARTIROMO: Because when the president joined us about two weeks ago or so, I said to him, Mr. President, you would rather see competition, right, or do you want to -- because you would think as Republicans want competition to come into the market place before any regulation.And the president was very clear, he said, you know what? We might need legislation that will lead to competition.MOAZED: Yes. I think, so, I mean, look, there's a spectrum and Warren isn't even on the spectrum, OK? So, the prospect of breaking these up, I don't think is realistic, what is realistic is regulation that says Zuckerberg just calls for this in June.We don't know where the line is between taking abusive or hateful speech off of our platform versus violating free speech. Literally, wants to be regulated and this is the role of government to lay out those lines about what's appropriate versus what is then violating free speech, and no one has done that yet.BARTIROMO: Ryan, jump in here, talk about the investor case for these stocks here, when you put a portfolio together, how much of it wants to -- do you want focused on tech?PAYNE: Well, first off, I mean, all of these companies are going to literally double the revenue or they have, over the last 12 months, so, obviously, they're still growing rapidly. I think it's definitely the momentum trade right now. I mean, even if you own the S&P 500 right now, it's kind of like a tech fund and drag, 30 percent tech right now.So, I think, you know, there's a lot of money pouring into the S&P 500, managers have to keep up with the index, so I think a lot of money is going to keep pouring into these stocks. I don't think they're the best value on the overall market, but I think there's momentum trade absolutely, and these stocks have room to run here, Maria.BARTIROMO: All right, we might join --MURPHY: Just -- yes, as an investor, you know, all due respect to President Trump, but I would rather, these companies police themselves and I don't want government --BARTIROMO: Really, though?(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Dagen, you've been saying it for three years.MOAZED: Good luck with that.MCDOWELL: Do something about it. Don't let people murder their children - -BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: -- on Facebook live video streaming because the government's going to come after you because they've been so reckless with people's information. This was not about Cambridge Analytica.This was about a business scheme designed by the management, for years, to basically grow the user base, it's like oh, these app developers will give you access not just to friends, people's information, but the information of their friends, and we'll kind of -- and not really tell people that that's going on.BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.MCDOWELL: It went on for years. That's how they got as big as they are.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a good point. I mean, they're going to have to start policing themselves at some point. Alex, thank you so much --MOAZED: Thank you.BARTIROMO: -- for joining us, Ryan, great to have you as well.PAYNE: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: We showed you AT&T earnings on the screen, a few minutes ago. Quarterly numbers are pretty much in line or better on the revenue side, Lauren Simonetti with all of the numbers and analysis, Lauren, good morning.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey, Maria, AT&T just crossing in line, EPS, $0.89 a share, a slight beat on revenue, coming in at $44.95 billion versus the estimate of $44.85 billion. AT&T CEO says that company is on track to deliver on all priorities this year.Free cash flow, that's important, $8.8 billion, of course, they have to pay down some debt from that Time Warner acquisition and put that money towards the streaming service. HBO Max, which is set to come out at some point, possibly this spring of 2020, so listening on the call which is in two hours from now, for anything that the company has to say about that, specifically.BARTIROMO: All right, the stock is down about a third of the percent. Thank you so much, Lauren. We'll take a break. When we come back, Robert Mueller is taking the stand today. We are previewing the former special counsel's highly anticipated hearing all morning this morning, what you need to know, how President Trump is reacting, all of that coming up.And then a hero's victory, the Senate approves extending the 9/11 victims fund. The moment between Jon Stewart and Senator Mitch McConnell goes viral. Check this out, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, July 24th.Your top stories right now. 6:33 a.m. on East Coast. Mueller on hot seat this morning. His highly anticipated testimony on Capitol Hill, now just hours away. We're taking a look at what to expect this morning.And who could be disappointed when it all said and done. Another big day for earnings this morning. We got two big ones. Dow Component's Boeing and Caterpillar set to report the usually are market movers. Of course, for Boeing, we're taking a look at the effect of the grounding of the 737 MAX jet. We'll bring you the numbers and full analysis.Caterpillar does move markets. That's a good indicator of China in global economy. Ahead of earnings and Mueller testimony, Futures this morning are indicating a lower opening for the broader averages. Dow Futures down 63, S&P down eight, and the Nasdaq Futures lower by 45.Stocks rally ending the day near session highs yesterday. Meanwhile, pretty good day. Take a look, Dow Industrials up 177 points yesterday, two-thirds of one percent. The S&P was up 20 points, and the Nasdaq was higher by 47 at the closed on wall street yesterday.In Europe this morning, take a look at the momentum and it is mixed. They've got the FT-100 following Wall Street lower down 65 points, almost one percent. The CAC Quarante in Paris down 29, but the DAX Index in Germany is higher up about 30 points. We have a round of weak PMI data out of France and Germany. That's the Purchasing Managers Index's indicates manufacturing slowing down.In the U.K., of course, Boris Johnson will become prime minister later today. In Asia overnight, most of the markets saw gains on renewed U.S.- China trade talks except South Korea as you can see there.Our top story this half an hour is the testimony of Robert Mueller. Former special counsel Bob Mueller set to appear before the House Judiciary Committee in two hours' time. Later, he will be appearing before the House Intelligence Committee after speaking with the Judiciary.President Trump and House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler spoke out before the testimony.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: How about this whole witch hunt that's going on, shall I talk about it for a second? First of all, it's very bad for our country, makes it very hard to deal with Russia, and we should be able, they are nuclear power, they have a big country. And we should be able to deal with them without having this artificial stuff.They interviewed 500 people. Listen to this, 2,500 subpoenas. They did everything. The collusion, no collusion. They have no collusion.REP. JERROLD NADLER (D-NY): Mueller investigation revealed a lot of conduct by the president which the American people should be aware of. The president and the attorney general have systematically lied to the American people that what was in that report.I know, they have said no obstruction, no collusion, he was totally exonerated, although those three statements are not true. It's important that the American people understand what was in that report, and then we'll go from there.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, Robert Mueller's longtime aide Aaron Zebley, will also appear beside the former special counsel. He will not be able to answer questions but can advise Mueller.Joining us right now is former federal prosecutor, Fox News contributor Andrew McCarthy. And Andrew, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks so much for being here.ANDREW MCCARTHY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Morning Maria.BARTIROMO: Well, we've talked a lot about this over the last 2-1/2 years. First, your thoughts on his aide being there with him, Zebley?MCCARTHY: Well, you know, I think it's a bad look for Mueller, because the wrap on the investigation, at least, one of the wraps on it was that he was very staff directed, and that he was more or less a hands-off detached figurehead, while all these staffers who -- you know, are known for or notorious for being pretty aggressive Democratic activists, or at least, a lot of them did the laboring more on the investigation.So, having this happen, I'm curious about why he would allow it to look that way. In terms of the substance of it, I don't know, Maria that it makes a lot of difference because he's been directed to do what he really wants to do, which is confine himself to the four corners of the report.BARTIROMO: Right.MCCARTHY: So, in that sense, it shouldn't matter whether it's one guy, two guys, 10 guys doing the testifying. If all he can talk about is the report, the report says what it says.BARTIROMO: What about you Bud Cummins, former U.S. attorney, how do you see it?CUMMINS: You know, the first thing is there's nothing prosecutorial about this whole exercise. I'd like to hear what Andrew if he agrees with me, but there is no -- there is nothing in the job that he did or the job that I did that involves providing Congress with all this data that you derived in a confidential criminal investigation using all the intrusive tools.We used the special counsel in my view is kind of turned himself into almost a fourth branch of government, a truth commission and Congress is being allowed to grab all that information for political purposes.So, you know, I think -- I think the whole process is flawed and it's wrong, but we're going to do it. And I think, the fact that he's going to have an aide there is really just going to be the difference between a mad man to turnaround behind him and ask people what page am I supposed to be on and ask the guy sitting next to him.BARTIROMO: You're saying because the report was written so many levels below him.CUMMINS: Right. And Andrew raised a good question. How much -- how much did the staff thrive this, and how much maybe was even played? Because you know, I really questioned the correctness of including volume to at all. And I wonder if Mueller was completely behind that or if he -- if he -- you know arbitrator to dispute on his staff and gave in? It'd be interesting to know that but he's not going to tell anybody that today.BARTIROMO: Andrew?MCCARTHY: Yes, well, I think the reason volume two is there is because the staff which ran this investigation did the probe under a different understanding of obstruction law than what the Justice Department traditionally would follow, particularly in connection with the president of the United States.And when Attorney General Barr was confirmed and took over at the Justice Department.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCCARTHY: I think it became clear that they were going -- the Justice Department was going to insist on a traditional understanding of obstruction which means there has to be tampering with witnesses or tampering with evidence.You can't go after the president on obstruction for the exercise of his constitutional prerogatives.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCCARTHY: And I think for Mueller's purposes, that's where it broke down. That's why you get this equivocation about, "Well I didn't charge him but I'm not exonerating him." They investigated on a bogus theory, I think.MCDOWELL: Andy touched on this -- Hey, Andy its Dagen. A little bit.MCCARTHY: Hi, Dagen.MCDOWELL: But this is why Mueller's performance today is so important. Does he seem to have a good grasp of the facts? Does he come across clear- minded that statement that he made was a little off and awkward? And it will raise the issue if he doesn't have -- if he's not in charge of information.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: And can give a clear reason to explanation about what's in the report and why the team made the decisions that they did? Then, he's going to run into some problems and it's going to open a lot of doors for the Republicans that they might not expect.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's going to be real transparent. In fact, one thing that is becoming more and more transparent is something John Solomon reported yesterday from The Hill, and that is the John Durham's team. This is the person in charge of the origins of the investigation, investigation.He is looking to interview Joseph Mifsud. Now, Mifsud reportedly was tasked with giving former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos access to Russian Intel, dealing with Hillary Clinton's e-mails. Back in May, George Papadopoulos joined me on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES". And I asked him about his meeting with Mifsud back in Rome. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: So, he tells you Russia has e-mails of Hillary Clinton's and this is the bomb that you feel was the whole reason that they wanted you to go to Rome to meet him because he -- they wanted him to tell you about these e-mails that Russia had of Hillary Clinton. Is that right?GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS, FORMER CAMPAIGN ADVISER TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: That's absolutely correct. I think this person was some sort of plans for years.BARTIROMO: They wanted you to go back and tell Trump about Russia having Hillary Clinton e-mails.PAPADOPOULOS: Yes.BARTIROMO: Did you do that?PAPADOPOULOS: Absolutely not. That wasn't my job.BARTIROMO: So, you told the FBI you believe you met him in March when, in fact, you met him in April. And that was the perjury, so you went to jail for what? How many nights?PAPADOPOULOS: I went to jail for 11 nights because of this, after I had honey pots, money thrown my way, wiretaps, surveillance by foreign countries, and then, I finally get caught in some perjury trap, and I go to jail for 11 nights. It was ridiculous. BARTIROMO: And you feel that this was entrapment.PAPADOPOULOS: Absolutely. I feel it was entrapment. And I'm very happy to see Congressman Devin Nunes and the letter that he sent to Secretary Pompeo and Gina Haspel to get more information on this person, Mifsud.Because if it's indeed proven that this person was really entrapping me, not even spying on me, and then there was a coordinated effort between these other various intelligence agencies.BARTIROMO: Yes.PAPADOPOULOS: Including the DIA and Australians, to extract this fake information, and then spy on me with another honey pot in London with Halper.BARTIROMO: Yes.PAPADOPOULOS: This thing reeks of spying, entrapment and illegal and illicit behavior.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: And Andrew, this is really what we're talking about the origins of the investigation. Here is a guy, George Papadopoulos. He was working for Ben Carson. Ben Carson pulls out of the race. He then -- he gets an outreach on LinkedIn from this international center of law practice. I've never heard of it, but they reach out.MCCARTHY: That's right.BARTIROMO: We love your work, we want you to come to work here. He takes the job, he's got nothing else to do. He just pulled out of the Ben Carson campaign. He works at him a month into it, and he realized this is not for me, I don't want to work here. He gives them his two-week notice. Says, I'm quitting, I want to go work for Donald Trump, I'm going to go who join his campaign. They say, wait, before you quit, we want to send you to Rome, we have a lot of important people for you to meet.MCCARTHY: Right.BARTIROMO: One of those people was Joseph Mifsud.MCCARTHY: Yes, I'm really glad that you're homed in on him because I think Mifsud is the unexplored, very interesting character in this whole narrative. You know, another very interesting thing, Maria, is Mueller's team or, at least, the FBI, I should say because this was before Mueller was involved.The FBI actually interviewed Mifsud after they interviewed Papadopoulos. He denies having told Papadopoulos about e-mails. And I mention this only because if there's one thing that we learned during this investigation, it's that Mueller knows how to bring a false statements case.BARTIROMO: That's incredible.MCCARTHY: Yet, no one brought a false statement case against this guy --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCCARTHY: -- whose story is what Papadopoulos's narrative is base on.BARTIROMO: And it's important because if we do find out that he actually worked with Western intelligence, then we know that it was entrapment. He's not some Russian oligarch, he's a guy who was hired by the FBI.It's good to see you, Andrew. Thank you.MCCARTHY: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Andrew McCarthy. Special coverage of this highly anticipated hearing, next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The Senate overwhelmingly voting in favor of extending the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund. Cheryl Casone on headlines now, Cheryl.CASONE: That's right Maria, the bill guarantees ongoing funding for 9/11 first responders. This photo we're going to show you now captured, we should say, kind of awkward moment when Senate Majority Mitch McConnell passed Jon Stewart before that vote happened. McConnell did not stop to talk to Stewart who, of course, has been a very outspoken advocate for 9/11 First Responders. The (INAUDIBLE) Stewart is embracing John (INAUDIBLE) who was a worker at the World Trade Center site, and also long-time activist. That was after the vote's emotional pictures there.Well offices (INAUDIBLE) company, WeWork, is looking to go public sooner than expected. They are aiming for September now, according to the Wall Street Journal. WeWork was recently valued at $47 billion in a private fund-raising round. It was reported last week that cofounder, Adam Newman, took in at least 700 million from selling some of his interest in the company and taking out loans against his remaining shares, we shall see.And then, this is video, that I'm not sure how to describe this guy -- it's gone viral. It's just -- a 9-year-old girl was launched in the air by a charging bison; this happened at Yellowstone on Monday afternoon. Caught on camera. There was a big group of people that were on a trail that were walking probably a little too close to the bison, we can assume here. She was not seriously injured; she was checked out, she was with her parents who I think is who's running away from -- the daughter and the bison. It takes my breath away. Anyway.BARTIROMO: Where are the parents?CASONE: I think those were the parents that were running away.BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.CASONE: That's the point here. And that also, they were on a trail with about 50 people. You're supposed to stay a minimum of 25 yards away from any wildlife -- any wildlife in Yellowstone, so why were they that close?BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.CASONE: Yes.BARTIROMO: You say they stand around during docile? You were there --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They did. I'm in there. And -- you know, I've got my picture made in front of me -- most of the time you can approach him and they just kind of stand there.BARTIROMO: God how scary.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The elk are dangerous too. I mean, they're real live animals; it's not Disneyland.BARTIROMO: Thanks, Cheryl. Coming up, the big business of fun. My exclusive interview with the Six Flags CEO on company earnings and how to keep excitement fresh for whole family -- good indicator of whether or not people are spending money on these kinds of things. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. It's the season for theme parks. Six Flags facing some new competition but not slowing down. The company reporting its eighth consecutive year of record financial performance last year, helped in part by a growing membership program. The company reported earnings earlier today. A miss in earnings, but a beat on revenue. Joining me right now in an exclusive Fox Business Interview with Six Flags President, Chairman and CEO Jim Reid Anderson. And Jim, it's always a pleasure to see you.JIM REID ANDERSON, CEO, SIX FLAGS: Great to be back, Maria. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us. So first, characterize the quarter for us. What did you see?ANDERSON: It's a record quarter. We saw improvements across every metric from attendance, revenue -- and EPS all growing between six and eight percent. It's the best second quarter in the company's history, and I want to point out that we just finished our ninth record year. So, our goal is to head for number 10 and that's what we're working towards.BARTIROMO: That's terrific. Congratulations!ANDERSON: Yes, very strong quarter.BARTIROMO: So, we've got a pretty good back drop in terms of the economy so that's part of it, but you think it's also partly because of the membership program that you've put in place.ANDERSON: We have made a lot of changes to our programming and in essence membership allows people to get this value offering, pay monthly, and we don't have to have them renew seasons passes every year; they just stay with us. So, membership now represents about 25 percent -- not reoccurring revenue about 25 percent of the total guest revenue.BARTIROMO: That's a big number.ANDERSON: And it's grown, you know, from 20 percent last quarter. So, rapidly improving and that brings stability, and consistency and you know that's really important to us.BARTIROMO: Now, the analyst reports this morning there are -- a lot of them are focusing on international business, the stock was down, after you reported. Because of that, I think partly people are wondering what's going to happen with China, given this China fight between the U.S. and China, and you're getting the necessary approvals for the theme park there. Tell us about it.ANDERSON: So, we have multiple parks across the world. So, in total 12, that we're working on, 11 of them are in China. And we are making progress in getting those approvals very nicely, so it takes while as you know with the macroeconomic issues there and the trade fight that's going on and just getting government approvals as government -- local governments change. But we're making progress and we've seen improvement there. So, we saw growth everywhere. We saw growth domestically; we saw it internationally. It was a good quarter.BARTIROMO: And you pointed out to me during the commercial break that even the international revenue portion is just a small portion of overall revenue.ANDERSON: Yes, it's three percent of our total revenue. And when you look at nine record years, and very strong growth in the second quarter, I think we're set up for another record year. That's our goal certainly.BARTIROMO: So, have you been impacted at all by China-U.S. fight? Do you think that --ANDERSON: Yes, I think that's part of why, you know, we saw that impact towards the end of last year. But you know, when you look at our business, Maria, we have five initiatives, international is the fifth of the initiatives and we're seeing growth in all of those initiatives. Very, very strong growth. And innovation is in our DNA and we bring news in every park, every year, and we've done that again this year in our North American parks where we've seen fantastic performance.BARTIROMO: I know you got to keep innovating. Freshening it up.ANDERSON: Yes, you have to do it regularly. And I would add one more thing, which I think you know: we've got a dividend yield. So, we're getting growth. We saw revenue growth of eight percent, right? Think about this seven, eight percent consistently.BARTIROMO: Good number.ANDERSON: And then on top of that, we've got a dividend yield of 6.2 percent. Think about that combo: growth and yield fantastic.BARTIROMO: That is a nice good yield. Jim, it's great to have you.ANDERSON: Great to be here.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much.ANDERSON: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: We'll be watching the story. Jim Reid Anderson from Six Flags there. Still ahead, big day for earnings. Boeing and Caterpillar among the Dow components reporting their quarterly numbers today. UPS also on deck. All of the numbers plus everything you need to know ahead of Robert Mueller's testimony. It's all right here next hour in MORNINGS WITH MARIA. back in a moment.Load-Date: July 24, 2019End of Document

Nike Finds Itself in a BindRealMoneyAugust 2, 2019 Friday 12:19 PM EDTCopyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 764 wordsByline: Stephen GuilfoyleHighlight: NKE has shot themselves in the proverbial foot more than once.BodyWar On Retail?Not the intent. That I understand. Indeed, fully understood is the need to confront nations, such as China, that have long imposed protectionist policies upon trading partners using the potential size of that nation's consumer market and cheap labor as leverage as multinational corporations based in highly developed economies have sought out less expensive means to develop cross border supply lines. Then there are the issues of forced partnerships and theft of intellectual properties that further put trading partners at an unfair disadvantage. The fact that these issue were left on the back burner for so long, and that China for many years had been permitted to over promise and then under deliver is why the issue now comes to a head.For the short-term, these overarching factors will matter little to those trying to invest around what is now a financial obstacle course. Among the obvious industries that will feel the moist pain will be large cap industrial type names, and the Materials as global economic growth further slows. In addition, the semiconductors, the retailers, and consumer electronics type firms will struggle as those firms will now face a choice of either moving supply lines away from China which will be costly to do, or simply charge more for their wares hurting not only U.S. consumers, but probably also revenue generation. Either that, or face pressured margin. All the while these firms are likely to be hit with sanctions of some kind by the Chinese government in response, while the Chinese consumer in all likelihood turns to Chinese competitors in a show of nationalism. Tough climate. Nike  , the athletic shoe and apparel company, is an example of such a firm that is in such a bind.It Takes TimeNow, don't get me wrong. Nike has shot themselves in the proverbial foot more than once. From sneakers that fell apart on national television while being worn by the most famous player in college basketball to the Betsy Ross shoe controversy that seemed to the casual observer to be possibly aimed at making headlines as much as any social cause. You'll recall that for the fourth fiscal quarter, Nike reported a miss on earnings generated by better than expected revenue. Gross margin slightly missed consensus as expenses related to "selling and administration" increased 9%. What strength there was in margin came from the Nike Direct business.The Chinese consumer certainly did not seem swayed by the trade war. Not only does Nike have to worry about this, but so do many firms across a broad array of businesses including Sarge fave Apple  . You know who does not have to worry about losing sales in China? FANG. That's right. Firms such as Amazon  , Alphabet  and Facebook  have zero exposure, not to mention most of your favorite cloud/software names. Not a lot of exposure there. Nike was able to boast 16% sales growth in China for the quarter, while they slowly started to move operations elsewhere.Currently, Nike manufactures 49% of the firm's footwear in Vietnam. Just 23% in China. The firm manufactures 27% off all apparel in China. Since the start of the trade war between the U.S. and China, Nike has moved roughly 6% of it's manufacturing to Vietnam. In addition, the firm has announced plans to go ahead with the building of a $184 million facility to be built in Goodyear, Arizona despite the withdrawal of a state grant in the wake of the Betsy Ross sneaker news. The fact is that moving established supply lines is a drawn out process.Still, China as of the last quarter, provides the firm with 16.7% of total revenue generation. Fortunately for retailers, as well as for consumers, by the time new U.S. tariffs are scheduled to be implemented (September 1), "Back to School" season will have passed.But Some On This Dip?The short answer is no. A better explanation would be that I spent the overnight increasing my cash position where I thought appropriate, and I would be careful about where to add new capital exposure. For those already long this name, you see the 2000 day simple moving average (SMA) at $81? That's also where support had been found back in March.The algos see that spot too. That spot breaks and you better hope $77 holds, because I would expect fund participation to accelerate upon such an occurrence. You want in? Better to wait and see if the shares can re-take the 50 day SMA at $84.50. Right now, Nike is just caught out in the open.(Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook are holdings in Jim Cramer's  .

MALAYSIAN MINISTER SLAMMED FOR COMMENTS ABOUT VISIT TO UYGHUR CAMPStates News ServiceJuly 2, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1299 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Malaysia's Islamic Affairs minister has come under sharp criticism after describing a Uyghur internment camp that he visited in China as a "training and vocational center," while human rights groups and U.S. officials have likened such facilities to concentration camps.The controversy began during Minister Mujahid Yusof Rawa's eight-day trip to China, when on June 26 he posted photos on his official Facebook page that showed adults sitting at yellow school desks in a room surrounded with artificial flowers.The minister declined Tuesday to disclose the location of the camp holding members of the Uyghur Muslim minority or answer other questions from BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service, about his trip."The Center is running industrial training activities with various skills such as sewing, legislation, art, flower arrangement and et cetera," a caption for one of the photos said, adding Mujahid that visited "the training and vocational center of the Uyghur community."The posting did not say if the "center" was in the Xinjiang region, where U.N. officials and rights groups said that up to 1.5 million Uyghurs and other mainly Muslim Turkic minorities had been held in detention camps since April 2017.Chinese authorities earlier denied the existence of internment camps, but said petty criminals had been sent to "employment training centers."On June 27, Amnesty International Malaysia expressed disappointment over the minister's description of the camp."Amnesty International has first-hand knowledge that the Chinese authorities have detained Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims outside any legal process in 'political education' camps for their perceived disloyalty to the government and Chinese Communist Party," the statement said."The authorities label the camps as centers for "transformation-through-education" but most people refer to them simply as "re-education camps," Amnesty said.In those camps, Uyghurs had been subjected to forced political indoctrination, renunciation of their faith, mistreatment, and, in some cases, torture, the rights watchdog group said.In May, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in an apparent reference to policies under Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union, cited "massive human rights violations in Xinjiang where over a million people are being held in a humanitarian crisis that is on the scale of what took place in the 1930s."'Most imbecilic'On Monday, the Malaysian state news service Bernama reported that Mujahid's visit to China was approved by the cabinet and "given guidance by the Foreign Ministry to ensure diplomatic ties between Malaysia and China were not affected."Mujahid didn't only go to China to visit the Uyghur ethnic group but also to exchange views on peace and religion, according to Bernama.On June 27, the Malaysian minister met with Wang Zuoan, vice minister of the United Front Work Department the ideological unit of the Chinese Communist Party. During their discussion, Mujahid emphasized the importance of "freedom of religions and respecting the rights of the citizens to practice the religion of their choice," said a statement issued by Mujahid's office on Monday, in which he defended himself from criticism over his description of the camp.The governments of Malaysia and neighboring Indonesia, the two largest Muslim-majority nations in Southeast Asia, have been vocal about the perceived oppression of the Palestinian people and persecution of Rohingya Muslims but relatively quiet about China's policies toward the Uyghurs.Last month, a Jakarta think tank lambasted Indonesia for failing to stand up for Uyghurs confined to internment camps in Xinjiang."The systematic repression of China's ethnic Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang Autonomous Region has caused little angst in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country," the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC) said in a report."The Indonesian government by and large sees the Uyghur crackdown as a legitimate response to separatism ...," it said.IPAC also pointed to the fact that China was Indonesia's largest trading partner and second largest investor, saying this added to Jakarta's reluctance to speak out on the Uyghur issue.China, for its part, has rejected allegations raised by a U.N. panel in August 2019 that Chinese authorities had built a "massive internment camp" in the restive Xinjiang region, where Beijing spent decades trying to suppress pro-independence sentiment.Although Beijing initially denied the existence of internment camps, Chinese authorities tried to change the public image of those facilities, describing them instead as "boarding schools" that provided vocational training and discouraged radicalization.P. Ramasamy, a senior official in the Democratic Action Party (DAP), one of the partners in Malaysia's ruling Pakatan Harapan coalition, was among those back home criticizing Mujahid for describing the camps as "training centers.""It appears that Malaysia is willing to modify its policy on Muslims in general when it suits its political and strategic purpose," Ramasamy, deputy chief minister of Penang state, told the Straits Times newspaper last week.Reacting to the minister's Facebook post about his visit to the Uyghur camp, Ahmad Farouk Musa, founder of the Islamic Renaissance Front (IRF), a Kuala Lumpur think tank, called Mujahid a "victim of Communist China propaganda.""This is surely the most imbecilic statement by our minister in this new government," the news portal Free Malaysia Today (FMT) quoted Ahmad as saying in an interview.False news flapMujahid, in his press statement on Monday, tried to fend off accusations that he was pandering to Beijing's propaganda.A news report about his trip "was confusing, incorrect and did not portray the whole speech," the statement from Mujahid's office said, referring to Free Malaysia Today, which published the story.The statement went on to defend a speech he made at the Beijing Foreign Studies University on June 28, in which FMT quoted Mujahid as saying that "false news" about Muslims being oppressed in China "could trigger a wave of sympathy for the oppressed and affect relationships.""In his speech text, the minister did not use the word Xinjiang or Uyghur as mentioned. The word 'false news' was used to describe how false news can jeopardize the bilateral relations between countries and communities," the statement from Mujahid's office said."For the record, China has approximately 20 million Muslims from various ethnic groups and has also 30,000 mosques and thousands of imams," it added.On Tuesday, Mujahid through his spokesman declined to respond to a series of questions from BenarNews about his trip to China, including whether he discussed with Chinese officials international concerns that had been raised about the mass incarceration of Uyghurs at internment camps, and whether his trip took him to Xinjiang.The fate of Uyghurs in detention camps in Xinjiang remains unknown and most of the detainees' families have been kept in the dark, according to rights groups."China has intensified its campaign of mass internment, intrusive surveillance, political indoctrination and forced cultural assimilation against the region's Uighurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups," Amnesty said in its statement last week.The controversy over Mujahid's comments erupted about nine months after Malaysia freed 11 ethnic Uyghurs from detention and sent them to Turkey, in defiance of a request by Beijing that Kuala Lumpur hand them over to Chinese authorities. The 11 had fled to the Southeast Asian nation after breaking out of a jail in neighboring Thailand in 2017.Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Load-Date: July 2, 2019End of Document

HK police fire tear gas at protesters as marchers defy banStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeAugust 11, 2019 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 624 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBodyAnd the city's Beijing-appointed leader Carrie Lam has made clear she will not grant the protesters' demands, which include a full withdrawal of the now-suspended extradition bill, direct election of the city's leader and an investigation into police violence.Opponents of the proposed extradition law said it would hurt the independence of Hong Kong courts and expose residents to political cases.Young people have been at the forefront of the protests, anxious about the erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong by China but also concerned with issues such as wealth disparities in the city.In a statement, the Chinese Foreign Ministry urged the U.S. diplomatic office in Hong Kong to "immediately make a clean break with various anti-China rioters" and "stop interfering in Hong Kong's affairs immediately".Cathay also faced pressure online after China's state-run press fuelled a #BoycottCathayPacific hashtag, which trended on Chinese social media.Lam blamed the protests for an economic downturn that she said was worse than any in the past, including the one caused by the 2003 SARS outbreak.China has lashed out at the British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, after he spoke to Hong Kong's leader about protests that have morphed from a campaign against a controversial extradition bill into rolling street demonstrations demanding electoral reforms."I support them, though I don't agree with all their methods", Annie Chan, a 51-year-old accountant, said at a shopping plaza that protesters briefly occupied.Jeffrey Epstein's death sends shock waves through Palm BeachThey argued that the new charges were improper because they covered largely the same ground as the non-prosecution agreement. However, federal prosecutors said in a statement on August 10 that their office will continue probing into the Epstein case.Hong Kong protesters are set to defy a police ban and take to the streets to march in the Chinese controlled territory, continuing demonstrations which have gripped the city.Last week, the Chinese government slammed Washignton after reports emerged that some U.S. diplomats based in Hong Kong had met with pro-democracy activists. There are as yet no police at the scene.On Saturday, she addressed students at Hong Kong army cadets camp and warned that the city was "suffering from external worries and internal perils". Neither protest disrupted flights.Earlier this week, Eadeh was photographed meeting with democracy activists Joshua Wong and Nathan Law, both of whom were prominent figures in the 2014 Umbrella Movement protests and have spent time in prison due to their activities.A report by the pro-Beijing newspaper Ta Kung Pao about U.S. diplomat Julie Eadeh contained personal information about Eadeh, her husband and their children. "This time is more serious". But she refused to offer concessions to protesters, accusing a "small minority of people" of wanting to destroy the economy and of having "no stake in the society which so many people have helped to build".In several locations riot police fired tear gas, and 16 people were arrested, but the rallies largely avoided the lengthy pitched battles between the two sides that have been seen in recent weeks. "We hope to do our work better", she said. Some chide them for playing intoBeijing's claim that hostile foreign forces are behind the demonstrations.The protests have strainedBeijing's relations with Britain, which has called on China to honour the terms of their handover agreement and the freedoms its promises.China dismissed the remark as "gangster logic". Hong Kong was guaranteed freedoms not granted in mainland China, including an independent judiciary, under a "one country, two systems" formula, when Britain handed it back to China in 1997.Load-Date: August 11, 2019End of Document

This is the tech news you need to know this Tuesday.• US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross confirmed on Monday that the US will grant Huawei a second 90-day license following its blacklisting. But President Trump has told reporters he doesn't want to do business with Huawei "at all."• President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he had spoken with Apple CEO Tim Cook about the impact of US tariffs on Chinese imports as well as competition from South Korean company Samsung. Trump said Cook "made a good case" that tariffs could hurt Apple given that Samsung's products would not be subject to those same tariffs.• Facebook and Twitter acknowledged that the Chinese government had been running a coordinated social media propaganda campaign targeting protesters in Hong Kong. Twitter said it detected 936 accounts originating in China, while Facebook detected five accounts, seven pages, and three groups. • Apple CEO Tim Cook's argument that tariffs would benefit Samsung and hurt Apple doesn't make a lot of sense. Apple's declining iPhone sales have little to do with Samsung, and more to do with its decision not to focus on new internet users in emerging markets.• Amazon, Facebook, and Google testified on Monday at a hearing by the Office of the US Trade Representative about France's new digital services tax, which will deprive them of millions of dollars in revenue. The three, along with other major US tech firms, were expected to argue that the tax is punitive and risks raising prices for consumers and partners in Europe.• Facebook's plan to integrate Instagram and WhatsApp more closely could hinder any attempts to break up the social media giant, Federal Trade Commission Chairman Joseph Simons said in an interview. Simons said all options were on the table as the FTC investigates Facebook for potential antitrust violations, but added that any attempt from Mark Zuckerberg to combine the social media company's three major brands could complicate any case.• Representatives from as many as a dozen states met with DoJ officials to discuss a multi-state effort to investigate big tech companies like Facebook and Google.  The states may announce their own, but coordinated, investigations as early as next month, the Wall Street Journal reports.• Tesla relaunched its ailing solar business with a panel-rental program, CEO Elon Musk announced on Twitter on Sunday. Rental rates for solar panels will start at $50 a month, with customers paying $65 in California.• Apple has released the official trailer for its coming original series "The Morning Show," starring Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, and Steve Carell. The TV show will premier in the fall exclusively on Apple's new subscription streaming service, Apple TV Plus.• Uber has hired a new UK chief as its gears up to ask for another license renewal in London.

INTRODUCING VA HOUSING LEGISLATION NAMED AFTER KANSAS VETERANStates News ServiceJuly 15, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 2117 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Kansas Senator Jerry Moran:Hello,Welcome to Kansas Common Sense. Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them.Introducing VA Housing Legislation Named After Kansas VeteranOur nations servicemembers put their lives in danger each and every day to protect the American way of life. Colonel (Ret.) Paul Benne, of Spring Hill, Kansas, is no different. In 2013, Col. Benne developed a medical condition that led to his retirement from the U.S. Army after 23 years of service. Col. Benne was rated 100 percent disabled at the time of his retirement. In 2016, Col. Benne was fitted by the VA for a wheelchair and applied for an SAH grant, as neither the Bennes home nor vehicle could accommodate his new wheelchair.After more than a year of navigating the VA, Col. Benne and his wife, Christine, contacted my office for assistance, and within three months of my office working with Col. Benne to engage the VA, Col. Benne was given a favorable decision on his adaptive housing claim and provided SAH grants.The Paul Benne Specially Adaptive Housing Improvement Act of 2019, which I introduced this week, will help veterans like Col. Benne who have suffered severe injury or illness as a result of their service. This bill will expand the SAH program and allow veterans to use this vital grant in a way that best fits their needs. Giving veterans greater access to the SAH program and granting them increased flexibility in how they use it will improve their quality of life, assist their family members and caregivers, and provide them with the independence they enjoyed before their injury.Thank you to Col. Benne and his wife, Christine, for their decades of selfless service to our nation and for their advocacy, resiliency and willingness to share their story, which will undoubtedly help many veterans in the future. Read more on this legislation here.Working to Prevent Scams and Fraud on Senior CitizensOn Wednesday, the Senate Commerce Committee unanimously voted to advance my bipartisan Stop Senior Scams Act to the full Senate for consideration. This legislation would make certain that retailers, financial institutions and wire transfer companies have the resources necessary to train employees on how to prevent financial fraud and scams targeting seniors, and would create a federal advisory council to educate stakeholders on ways to train their employees to spot and stop financial scams.As chairman of the Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, I will continue working to bring industry and advocacy leaders together to help educate the public, specifically senior citizens, on how to identify and avoid these harmful scams.Promoting Organ DonationThis week, President Trump signed an executive order that will help increase organ donations and advance kidney health a positive step forward that will ultimately save lives by introducing accountability for deficient Organ Procurement Organizations that does not currently exist, as these organizations self-report data and are rarely punished for poor performance.Still, I have not forgotten the work left to be done as it pertains to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Networks (OPTN) liver allocation policy changes earlier this year. We still must address OPTNs and the United Network for Organ Sharings reckless changes to the national liver distribution policy that could adversely impact many Americans seeking liver transplants. These organizations need greater accountability due to their misguided actions that could carry the heavy cost of losing human lives if remedial action isnt swiftly taken.These recent changes made by OPTN and UNOS will punish patients waiting for transplants in Midwestern states with higher rates of organ donation like Kansas and reward our lowest performing ones, unfortunately moving in the opposite direction of the Presidents executive order today.I will work to protect our hospitals and patients from dangerous decisions made at the federal level in our nations organ allocation policy and will continue to work with my colleagues and the administration on this issue.Working to Improve Accuracy of Broadband Coverage MapsThis week, I joined a bipartisan group of senators in urging the Federal Communications Commission to take specific, concrete steps to improve the accuracy of broadband coverage maps and to look at legislative proposals introduced recently in Congress to help guide the Commissions work.One example is the Broadband Data Improvement Act of 2019 that our bipartisan coalition introduced in May. The legislation would require broadband providers to report data to create an improved National Broadband Map that is significantly more accurate and granular to help determine what areas most lack broadband.Separately, I am a cosponsor of the Broadband Deployment Accuracy and Technological Availability (DATA) Act, which also aims to improve the accuracy of the broadband availability maps by strengthening the process by which data is collected. I will continue working to improve broadband data collection and reporting to close the digital divide.Supporting Critical Diabetes Research EffortsThis week, I met with two Kansas youth advocates from the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation in my D.C. office to discuss reauthorization of the Special Diabetes Program for Type 1 Diabetes and Special Diabetes Program for Indians, which will allow the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to continue their diabetes research uninterrupted and to further develop innovative new devices and treatments. As a member of the Appropriations subcommittee with funding jurisdiction over NIH, and as co-chair of the Senate NIH Caucus, I am committed to making certain that NIH has the necessary resources to continue their life-saving research.We also discussed the rising cost of insulin, and the position many diabetics find themselves in having to choose between paying for their expensive life-saving insulin, or putting that money toward other life necessities. Reports of tragic deaths of diabetics who rationed their insulin because of the high cost of the drug are heartbreaking and require a real, and urgent, solution. The Senate is working toward a bipartisan solution to help curb the rising cost of prescription medication, and addressing insulin costs ought to be included as part of this final package.Condemning Chinese Government Mistreatment of Falun GongThis week, Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and I led a large bipartisan coalition of senators in condemning the Chinese governments mistreatment of Falun Gong practitioners and the use of illegally harvesting their organs.Supporting religious freedom is fundamental to who we are as a nation, and matters relating to Falun Gongs persecution in China are urgent and deserve scrutiny from the United States and the world. Through this resolution, the Senate recognizes and highlights the findings of the State Department, United Nations and the Independent Tribunal into Forced Organ Harvesting and calls on the Peoples Republic of China to cease its oppression and torture of Falun Gong members. Click here to read our full resolution.Advancing our Space Partnership with AustraliaOn Tuesday evening, I joined NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine at an event hosted by Australian Ambassador Hon. Joe Hockey in honor of the 50th Anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. Australias facilities supported the Apollo 11 landing and their resources remain an asset to the mission of space exploration today.For more than 100 years, the United States and Australia have shared a strong partnership, and I enjoyed highlighting past space exploration achievements and looking ahead to future goals and accomplishments. As chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee with funding jurisdiction over NASA, I will continue engaging Administrator Bridenstine and Ambassador Hockey to advance our friendship with Australia particularly as it pertains to space exploration.Meeting with Kansans in Dickinson, Republic CountiesDickinson CountyThis weekend, I continued my Kansas Listening tour with stops in Dickinson and Republic counties. In Abilene, we discussed recent flooding that has devastated farmers and caused significant damage to infrastructure around the county. We also discussed immigration and border security, career and technical education, veterans healthcare, tariffs and the Senates recent passage of the NDAA.Republic CountyOn Saturday, I joined Kansans in Belleville for a Listening Tour stop where we discussed a number of issues, including my work to increase veterans access to healthcare through the VA MISSION Act.

In 2018, over $4 billion worth of goods were exported to those two markets, making up 35 percent of our states exports. Kansans depend on strong partnerships with Canada and Mexico for a robust economy, meaning it is critical that Congress pass the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in order to continue selling our goods to these crucial markets.Because USMCA was negotiated under the Trade Promotion Authority, the agreement must first pass the House of Representatives before it can proceed to the Senate. I urge my colleagues in the House to quickly pass this agreement once the implementing legislation is submitted to the House by the administration.Kansans in the OfficeTom Schwarzenberger of OlatheQuinta Schwarzenberger of OlatheBill of Rights InstituteBillie Casebeer of LouisbergGrace Stouts Gibson of HugotonMary Morrison of TopekaEllyssa Robertson WichitaAnna Scott of TopekaCapitol TourScott Abel of Dodge CityKaren Cook of WaKeeneyAngie DalBello of Prairie VillageIrene Dirks of WaKeeneyDenise Ellenburg of Overland ParkNicholas Fawcett of Saint FrancisKristin Fimple of WichitaHeather Frank of TuronVickie Frank of TuronEmily Hamm of BurlingtonDon Herron of WichitaJennifer Herron of WichitaLauren Herron of WichitaNoah Herron of WichitaRobyn Johnson of BendenaPaige Lambert of KiowaArielle Li of Overland ParkDaqi Li of Overland ParkGarrett Li of Overland ParkIsabel Li of Overland ParkJiayun Li of Overland ParkAaron Lindsay of HaysvilleGita Noble of TopekaDr. Steve Noble of TopekaMichelle Ohlde of Overland ParkTodd Ohlde of Overland ParkZack Ohlde of Overland ParkRepresentative Fred PattonDonna Raile of PalcoMike Raile of PalcoCaleb Silva of WichitaJacob Silva of WichitaJavier Silva of WichitaJavier Silva Jr of WichitaRachael Silva of WichitaClaire Snyder of LeavenworthDamian Snyder of LeavenworthEmily Snyder of LeavenworthHannah Snyder of LeavenworthJonathan Sossoman of TopekaLandon Stucky of InmanCandace Wright of MarysvilleRoss Wright of MarysvilleTyler Wright of Kansas CityChristians United for IsraelCarolyn Clink of OlatheEthan Finberg of LawrenceDonna MGinty of TopekaCheryl Steele of LenexaKansas Academy of Nutrition and DieteticsBreta Alstrom of HalsteadGerit Wagner of ManhattanKansas Home Care and Hospice AssociationJane Kelly of TopekaNCTARhonda Goddard of LenexaJill Kuehny of CaldwellCatherine Moyer of UlyssesCarla Shearer of Medicine LodgeCandace Wright of HomeNeosho Memorial Regional Medical CenterDenis Franks of ChanuteAnna Methvin of ChanuteHonored to Serve You in WashingtonIt is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C.

NOBEL WINNER LIU XIAOBO'S SPIRIT LIVES ONStates News ServiceJuly 11, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 416 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Despite Worsening Repression, Chinese Activists Press for ChangeYaqiu WangChina Researcher @YaqiuTwo years since Chinese Nobel Peace laureate Liu Xiaobo died from complications of liver cancer while guarded by state security on July 13, 2017, the Chinese government has neither investigated nor taken responsibility for the circumstances of his death. Instead, it has intensified repression of the human rights activists who carry on his legacy a grim reality marked just this week by the death of Ji Sizun after another baseless imprisonment.ExpandLiu Xiaobo.A few recent examples: in April, a Sichuan court handed down a three-and-a-half-year prison sentence to activist Chen Bing for producing and selling a liquor in commemoration of the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre. In May, Sichuan police detained Deng Chuanbin, an independent filmmaker, for tweeting a photo of the liquor. In June, Guangdong police detained labor activist Ling Haobo after Ling called on Twitter for Deng's release.This July also marks the fourth anniversary of the "709" crackdown: on July 9, 2015, Chinese police rounded up and interrogated about 300 rights lawyers, legal assistants, and activists across the country. Despite sustaining physical ailments and mental trauma as a result of torture by authorities, many continued their fight upon release. The lawyers pledged in a statement released ahead of the anniversary that they would "calmly face the suppression, persecution, detention and even prison sentences" for "pursuing freedom, equity, and justice."The activists and lawyers are not na¯ve about the possible consequences of their actions. Rather as they often tell me they feel compelled to act by their anger over injustices, their compassion for victims of abuses, and their friendships with fellow activists and lawyers. Activists have also expressed a desire to honor the life and legacy of Liu Xiaobo a friend, a mentor, and a towering figure in China's human rights movement. In his article commemorating Liu, dissident writer Mo Zhixu mused: "It wasn't through his direct urging and pushing that Xiaobo influenced me, but through his existence itself... He was an example, a role model.""Freedom of expression is... the source of humanity and the mother of truth," Liu Xiaobo said. Such unyielding faith in the intrinsic meaning of pursuing freedom inspires activists across China at a time of severe government repression and it will live on.Load-Date: July 12, 2019End of Document

Trump says he could lift Huawei sanctions after Xi meetingiCrowdNewswire (English)July 2, 2019 Tuesday 11:40 AM GMTCopyright 2019 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 481 wordsBodyThe G20 Summit wrapped up today in Japan, during which US President Donald Trump met with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Continue reading Trump says he could lift Huawei sanctions after Xi meetingThe G20 Summit wrapped up today in Japan, during which US President Donald Trump met with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Following their meeting, Trump announced that the two countries would resume trade talks and that the US would hold off on implementing new tariffs indefinitely. He also indicated that US companies would be permitted to resume sales to Huawei, although it's unclear when or how that will happen.In May, Trump signed an executive order that allowed the US government to block sales by US companies to foreign firms deemed a security risk. It's not immediately clear what   or if any   steps have been taken to lift the restriction on sales to the beleaguered Chinese technology company. According to The Washington Post, Trump told reporters that he will be meeting with US officials to ease the pressure on Huawei, but also that they haven't made a formal decision to lift them yet, while The Wall Street Journal reports that he indicated that the two countries will leave what to do with the company until the end of the negotiations.Huawei is caught in the midst of the larger US-China trade war. While both countries have levied tariffs against one another, US security officials have warned about the possibility that the telecommunications company maintains ties to the Chinese government, and could represents a security threat to the US. Trump's executive order prompted immediate headaches for Huawei: Google pulled the company's Android license, chipmakers stopped supplying parts, Microsoft stopped selling Huawei laptops, and the company wouldn't be allowed to use microSD cards in its devices.China reportedly planned to make a reprieve of Huawei a condition of returning to the bargaining table. Last month, Trump indicated (which US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin affirmed in June) that the US could lift restrictions against the company, provided that the US sees some forward movement on the trade talks, essentially demonstrating that the order has less to do with national security and more to do as a negotiation tactic. The countries will reportedly resume talks soon, and presumably, how the US handles Huawei will be a central part of that discussion.Tags: See Campaign:https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/29/19870318/president-donald-trump-china-huawei-lift-trade-ban-tariffs-trade-warContact Information:Andrew LiptakTags:,           Artificial Intelligence Newswire,           Wire,           United States,           EnglishLoad-Date: October 10, 2019End of Document

Treasuries started the cash session near their flat lines after futures backed off their highs from last evening. Those highs were registered after Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration is delaying the issuance of licenses that would allow U.S. companies to continue doing business with Huawei. The first hour of the session saw a sideways drift, which was followed by a push to highs after President Trump said that next month's trade talks with officials from China could be cancelled, adding that "we will not do business with Huawei." Treasuries spent the next couple hours in a slow retreat toward their starting levels, slipping to fresh lows after White House officials clarified that President Trump's comment about not doing business with Huawei referred to federal departments only while the Commerce Department will continue processing applications for special licenses from individual companies. Treasuries finished the day on lows, with the 10-yr yield narrowing this week's decline to 12 basis points. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.1% to 97.51, surrendering 0.6% for the week. Yield Check: 2-yr: +2 bps to 1.63% 3-yr: +3 bps to 1.57% 5-yr: +3 bps to 1.56% 10-yr: +2 bps to 1.73% 30-yr: +2 bps to 2.25%News: Japan's flash Q2 GDP increased 0.4% qtr/qtr (expected 0.1%; last 0.6%), growing 1.8% yr/yr (expected 0.4%; last 2.2%). Q2 GDP Capital Expenditure increased 1.5% qtr/qtr (expected 0.7%; last 0.3%) while External Demand decreased 0.3% qtr/qtr (expected -0.5%; last 0.4%).Germany's Association of Chambers of Trade and Industry expects that exports will show no growth in 2019, down from the previous forecast for a 1.2% increase. Italy's Deputy Prime Minister, Matteo Salvini, made it official that his party will bring forward a no-confidence motion, which he hopes will lead to a general election. Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, indicated that he will recall the parliament from its summer recess. Germany's June trade surplus totaled EUR18.10 bln (expected EUR18.50 bln; last EUR18.10 bln). June imports increased 0.5% m/m (expected 0.3%; last -0.3%) while exports decreased 0.1% m/m, as expected (last 1.3%).U.K.'s Q2 GDP decreased 0.2% qtr/qtr (expected 0.0%; last 0.5%), but increased 1.2% yr/yr (expected 1.4%; last 1.8%). June Industrial Production decreased 0.1% m/m (expected -0.2%; last 1.2%), falling 0.6% yr/yr (expected -0.2%; last 0.5%).

Those readings left the index for final demand up 1.7% yr/yr, unchanged from June. The index remains at its lowest level since January 2017. Core PPI was up 2.1% yr/yr, down from 2.3% in June.

The benchmark index is down 1.0% with noticeable weakness in the semiconductor stocks.The Nasdaq Composite is down 1.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 is down 1.4%.President Trump told reporters today that the U.S. will not be doing business with Huawei, which seemed to confirm a Bloomberg report yesterday that the U.S. Commerce Department has been refraining from approving business licenses to work with the Chinese company. The president added that September trade talks could get canceled but are still scheduled for the time being.None of these events has been too surprising for investors, but the prospect of U.S.-China relations further deteriorating has contributed to a steady broad-based decline today.All 11 S&P 500 sectors are down, including eight with losses of at least 1.0%. The information technology sector (-1.5%) is underperforming amid the trade uncertainty, which has also made a noticeable impact on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-2.0%). Many semiconductor companies are heavily exposed to China.Uber (UBER 39.72, -3.23) shares have dropped 7.5% after the company reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss of $5.2 billion. Revenue also missed estimates, but today's loss has simply given back a bulk of yesterday's 8% rally.In other earnings news, shares of DXC Technology (DXC 35.74, -15.90, -30.8%) have plunged over 30% after the company cut its FY20 outlook, while shares of Activision Blizzard (ATVI 47.56, -1.78, -3.6%) trade lower as investors remain underwhelmed by its downside Q3 guidance.The U.S. Treasury market, which has drawn plenty of attention this week, has been muted. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.70%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.2% to 97.43. Interestingly, despite the growth concerns, WTI crude is up 3.7%, or $1.94, to $54.48/bbl.Reviewing today's lone economic report, the Producer Price Index for July:The index for final demand increased 0.2% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, excluding food and energy, decreased 0.1% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). The m/m readings left the index for final demand up 1.7% yr/yr, unchanged from June. The index remains at its lowest level since January 2017.

Previous rulings in Lilly's favor had precluded the generic companies from launching the alternative salt forms until the patent expires. If the patent is ultimately upheld through all remaining challenges, Alimta would maintain U.S. exclusivity until May 2022, preventing marketing of generic products for as long as the patent remains in force.12:10SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (128) outpacing new lows (110) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ACAD, AEM, AIZ, AJRD, AMT, APPN, AVP, AWK, AWR, AXS, AYX, AZN, AZUL, BAH, BAM, BLDP, BLL, BRFS, CB, CCI, CECO, CIM, CINF, CME, CMG, CMS, COLD, CTAS, CUBE, CYTK, EIX, ELS, ENPH, EQIX, ES, EXR, FLT, FMC, FNF, HAE, HCP, HIG, LHX, HSY, ICE, IDA, KGC, LAUR, LNT, MCD, MELI, MKC, MLM, MODN, NEE, NEO, NTRA, NVCR, NVRO, OAK, PCTY, PODD, PRO, PSA, QTS, RGLD, RLI, RNR, ROKU, RPM, SAM, SBAC, SEDG, SHOP, SHW, SIGI, SO, SRC, STE, STOR, SUI, SVM, SWCH, TERP, TFX, TSN, TTD, VRSK, WEC, WELL, WK, WM, WPC, WPM, EVRG, WST, WTR, ZBH, ZTS, AQN, BHK, BKT, CYRX, EIM, EMB, FNV, FTS, FWONA, FWONK, IIM, IRT, MCR, MVF, MYI, NAC, NAD, NEA, NG, NMZ, NUV, NVG, NZF, OUT, PVG, RNP, RQI, VGM, VMOStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ACRS, ADAP, AEG, AM, AMTD, AR, ASNA, ATI, AXL, B, BRKMY, BCOR, BCS, BIDU, BOX, BT, CCO, CLB, CLVS, CMA, CNDT, COMM, CRESY, CYOU, DLTH, DXC, ENBL, EROS, EXPR, EXTN, FET, FLR, GLNG, GLOG, GMLP, GRPN, GT, GVA, HBM, HIMX, HMHC, HSBC, HSC, ING, JCP, KB, KEP, KMT, KT, LXFR, LYG, M, MAC, MCFT, MIK, MMLP, MMSI, MT, NE, NINE, NKTR, ODP, OEC, OLN, PLT, PRTA, PTEN, PVH, QNST, RGR, RIG, RL, SCHW, SEMG, SIG, SMLP, SSL, SSP, TAST, TECK, TEF, TELL, TGH, TMST, TPC, TRQ, TRUE, TSE, TUSK, VNTR, VRAY, VRTU, VSTO, WETF, WFTIQ, YY, BE, CARS, CEIX, CISN, CLNC, FIXX, FTCH, JHG, KLXE, LTRPA, SDRL, TRIP, WTRH, XELAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AFB, BFK, BUI, KTF, MCA, MQY, NBB, NID, NQP, WIAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: CEA, SHG, SHI, STN, BIOBETFs that traded to 52 week highs: EMB, FXY, IYR, UREETFs that traded to 52 week lows: FXB, XES11:45SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Farfetch (FTCH) sinks following second quarter press -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersAPPN (48.93 +13.16%): Topped consensus for Q2 EPS and revs (+11.7% yr/yr to $66.9 mln); issued mixed guidance for Q3 (sees revs above consensus, EPS below); raised its FY19 revs guidance, increasing its view of both subscription and total revenue for the year.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -40.00.The S&P 500 is up 0.2% for the week, but is on track to lose those slim gains at the open with the S&P 500 futures currently trading ten points, or 0.3%, below fair value.The decline in the futures could be a breather considering that the S&P 500 climbed 112 points, or 4.0%, over a two-day span. Of course, that advance followed a sharp sell-off that had many market participants blaming trade tensions, which are not helpful for economic growth prospects. In either case, the decline is modest and futures do not necessarily predict intraday action.Uber (UBER 40.12, -2.85, -6.7%) shares rose over 8% yesterday heading into its earnings report, which included a $5.2 billion quarterly loss.

Biktarvy combines the novel, unboosted integrase strand transfer inhibitor bictegravir with the demonstrated safety and efficacy profile of the Descovy dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone and is the smallest INSTI-based triple-therapy STR available. In China, Biktarvy is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults without present or past evidence of viral resistance to the integrase inhibitor class, emtricitabine or tenofovir.The approval of Biktarvy is supported by data from four ongoing Phase 3 studies: Studies 1489 and 1490 in treatment-nave HIV-1 infected adults, and Studies 1844 and 1878 in virologically suppressed adults. The trials are comprised of a diverse population of 2,414 participants on Biktarvy or an active comparator regimen, including a wide range of adult age groups and races/ethnicities. Biktarvy met its primary efficacy objective of non-inferiority at 48 weeks across all four studies.Biktarvy received marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Commission in 2018. In the United States, Biktarvy has a Boxed Warning in its product label regarding the risk of post-treatment acute exacerbation of hepatitis B.

Before this communication, the FDA had been silent as to whether it would convene an AdCom in connection with its review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. The FDA expressed, based on the timing of its recent decision to convene an AdCom, that November 14th is the earliest date on which it could hold an AdCom due to scheduling constraints for such a meeting.Accordingly, Amarin does not expect the FDA to take action on the sNDA by the previously announced September 28, 2019 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date. Amarin did not receive notice from the FDA of a PDUFA date extension. In light of the tentative AdCom date, Amarin anticipates that the PDUFA date will be extended, assuming a typical three-month extension, to a date in late December 2019. If so, this anticipated revised PDUFA date timing would offset three of the four months that were expected to be gained from FDA's earlier determination to conduct a priority review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. Prior to such determination, Amarin had expected a PDUFA goal date in January 2020, based on a standard 10-month review. Amarin plans to update the investment community after appropriately definitive information is available related to a new PDUFA date.Amarin intends to continue to move forward with its plans to double the size of its sales force to support the launch of Vascepa. Amarin plans to use the anticipated three-month delay in the PDUFA clock to better prepare for the assumed launch of Vascepa including more time to hire and train new sales representatives. To the extent that new sales managers and representatives are hired prior to the expanded label for Vascepa, Amarin intends to have them join the company's existing sales team in promoting Vascepa based on its current indication and existing promotional messaging.16:30EB Eventbrite appoints Lanny Baker as CFO, effective September 3 (17.49 +0.73)Mr. Baker joins Eventbrite from Yelp (YELP) where as CFO he oversaw corporate finance, accounting, investor relations and workplace functions.

The S&P 500 advanced 1.9%, which extended its two-day comeback to 112 points, or 4.0%, from its session low on Wednesday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 1.4%, the Nasdaq Composite increased 2.2%, and the Russell 2000 increased 2.1%.Thursday's positive disposition ostensibly formed overnight after China reported a surprise yr/yr increase in July exports while holding its yuan firm, which again signaled goodwill in trade relations. Today's rally, however, appeared to be more a continuation from yesterday's big intraday reversal that suggested the recent sharp sell-off may have been excessive.Interestingly, the S&P 500 traded just below its 50-day moving average (2934) for most of the afternoon before finally breaking above the key technical level late in the session. The benchmark index held above the level on a closing basis.All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher by at least 1.0%. The energy sector (+2.9%) led the advance as oil prices ($52.52/bbl, +$1.38, +2.7%) rebounded, followed by the information technology (+2.4%), communication services (+2.2%), and consumer discretionary (+2.0%) sectors.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 33.92, +4.73, +16.2%) led the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+2.7%) higher after it unveiled its well-received server CPUs that Google and Twitter will reportedly use. Broadcom (AVGO 270.98, +0.93, +0.3%) struggled to participate in the chip rally amid news that it is close to purchasing Symantec's (SYMC 22.92, +2.51, +12.3%) enterprise business for about $10 billion.In earnings news, Booking Holdings (BKNG 1941.01, +119.45, +6.6%), Lyft (LYFT 62.10, +1.81, +3.0%), and Roku (ROKU 122.03, +21.06, +20.9%) outperformed the broader market following positive results and/or upbeat guidance. Kraft Heinz (KHC 28.22, -2.65, -8.6%) disappointed investors with its results.U.S. Treasuries were under noticeable selling pressure today, which sent the 10-yr yield up 11 basis points to 1.79% at one point during the session. Buyers gradually came back, ultimately leaving the benchmark yield up three basis points to 1.72%. The 2-yr yield finished also finished three basis points higher at 1.61%.

Continuing claims for the week ending July 27 decreased by 15,000 to 1.684 mln.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims continue hovering near multi-decade lows.Wholesale inventories were unchanged in June (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%) on top of an unrevised 0.4% increase in May. Wholesale sales decreased 0.3% in June after decreasing a revised 0.6% (from +0.1%) in May.The key takeaway from the June report and the May revision is that the gap between inventory growth and sales growth is widening, which should exert some pressure on prices.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for July on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +21.2% YTDS&P 500 +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +13.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.1% YTD16:21TSE Trinseo misses by $0.45, misses on revs; guides FY19 EPS below consensus (35.00 +1.81)Reports Q2 (Jun) earnings of $0.99 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.45 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.44; revenues fell 23.0% year/year to $951.8 mln vs the $1.07 bln two analyst estimate.Latex Binders net sales of $230 million for the quarter decreased 18% versus prior year due mainly to the pass through of lower raw material costs.Performance Plastics net sales of $347 million for the quarter were 16% below prior year due mainly to lower prices from the pass through of lower raw material costs.Co issues downside guidance for FY19, sees EPS of $4.15-4.86, excluding non-recurring items, vs. $5.54 S&P Capital IQ Consensus.16:20ROAD Construction Partners beats by $0.04, misses on revs (14.02 +0.20)Reports Q3 (Jun) earnings of $0.33 per share, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.29; revenues rose 16.5% year/year to $227.3 mln vs the $229.67 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Project backlog at June 30, 2019 was $581.1 mln.Adjusted EBITDA was $31.3 mln, up 37.9%.16:19PBYI Puma Biotech. beats by $0.32, reports revs in-line (9.21 +0.40)Reports Q2 (Jun) loss of $0.57 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.32 better than the single analyst estimate of ($0.89); revenues rose 6.1% year/year to $53.9 mln vs the $53.4 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Net NERLYNX revenue in the second quarter of 2019 was $53.8 million, compared to net NERLYNX revenue of $50.8 million in the second quarter of 2018."We anticipate the following key milestones during the remainder of 2019: (i) meeting with the FDA to discuss the clinical development and regulatory strategy for the SUMMIT trial in the third quarter of 2019; (ii) reporting additional data from the Phase II CONTROL trial in the fourth quarter of 2019; and (iii) receiving regulatory decisions for the extended adjuvant HER2-positive early stage breast cancer indication in additional countries."16:19DXC DXC Technology beats by $0.03, reports revs in-line (51.65 +1.76)Reports Q1 (Jun) earnings of $1.74 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.71; revenues fell 7.4% year/year to $4.89 bln vs the $4.86 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.16:18NRZ New Residential Investment prices $250 mln underwritten public offering of 10,000,000 shares of 7.125% Series B Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (15.27 +0.21)The company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for investments and general corporate purposes.16:18AIMT Aimmune Therapeutics misses by $0.08 (19.34 +0.24)Reports Q2 (Jun) loss of $1.01 per share, $0.08 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.93).Cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $250.3 million on June 30, 2019, compared to $303.9 million on December 31, 2018.

Treasuries started the cash session near their flat lines after futures backed off their highs from last evening. Those highs were registered after Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration is delaying the issuance of licenses that would allow U.S. companies to continue doing business with Huawei. The first hour of the session saw a sideways drift, which was followed by a push to highs after President Trump said that next month's trade talks with officials from China could be cancelled, adding that "we will not do business with Huawei." Treasuries spent the next couple hours in a slow retreat toward their starting levels, slipping to fresh lows after White House officials clarified that President Trump's comment about not doing business with Huawei referred to federal departments only while the Commerce Department will continue processing applications for special licenses from individual companies. Treasuries finished the day on lows, with the 10-yr yield narrowing this week's decline to 12 basis points. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.1% to 97.51, surrendering 0.6% for the week.

The benchmark index is down 1.0% with noticeable weakness in the semiconductor stocks.The Nasdaq Composite is down 1.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 is down 1.4%.President Trump told reporters today that the U.S. will not be doing business with Huawei, which seemed to confirm a Bloomberg report yesterday that the U.S. Commerce Department has been refraining from approving business licenses to work with the Chinese company. The president added that September trade talks could get canceled but are still scheduled for the time being.None of these events has been too surprising for investors, but the prospect of U.S.-China relations further deteriorating has contributed to a steady broad-based decline today.All 11 S&P 500 sectors are down, including eight with losses of at least 1.0%. The information technology sector (-1.5%) is underperforming amid the trade uncertainty, which has also made a noticeable impact on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-2.0%). Many semiconductor companies are heavily exposed to China.Uber (UBER 39.72, -3.23) shares have dropped 7.5% after the company reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss of $5.2 billion. Revenue also missed estimates, but today's loss has simply given back a bulk of yesterday's 8% rally.In other earnings news, shares of DXC Technology (DXC 35.74, -15.90, -30.8%) have plunged over 30% after the company cut its FY20 outlook, while shares of Activision Blizzard (ATVI 47.56, -1.78, -3.6%) trade lower as investors remain underwhelmed by its downside Q3 guidance.The U.S. Treasury market, which has drawn plenty of attention this week, has been muted. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.70%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.2% to 97.43. Interestingly, despite the growth concerns, WTI crude is up 3.7%, or $1.94, to $54.48/bbl.Reviewing today's lone economic report, the Producer Price Index for July:The index for final demand increased 0.2% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, excluding food and energy, decreased 0.1% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). The m/m readings left the index for final demand up 1.7% yr/yr, unchanged from June. The index remains at its lowest level since January 2017. Core PPI was up 2.1% yr/yr, down from 2.3% in June.The key takeaway from the report is that inflationary pressure remains muted.12:53SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: AMRN (20.82 mln -17.35%), NKTR (16.72 mln -33.01%), VRAY (16.28 mln -56.9%)Industrials: GE (47.2 mln -3.06%)Consumer Discretionary: F (25.15 mln -1.36%), FTCH (19.75 mln -41.42%)Information Technology: AMD (54.93 mln +0.88%), NOK (17.11 mln +0.28%), SYMC (15.56 mln +0.57%), DXC (14.71 mln -30.57%), MU (12.35 mln -3.33%), AAPL (11.43 mln -1.13%)Financials: BAC (24.44 mln -1.07%), QQQ (17.87 mln -1.5%), TQQQ (16.4 mln -4.53%), SQQQ (12.92 mln +4.48%)Energy: CHK (27.62 mln +0.34%), RIG (14.88 mln -4.15%)Consumer Staples: ABEV (16.79 mln -0.2%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: VRAY (13.64x -56.9%), NKTR (10.16x -33.01%), SIEN (4.23x +18.94%), NVRO (3.47x +16.54%)Industrials: WAIR (14.57x +6.88%)Consumer Discretionary: FTCH (10.92x -41.42%), WTRH (5.33x -62.1%), QSR (4.44x -3.09%), PLYA (3.69x -2.52%), CHUY (3.58x +10.27%)Information Technology: DXC (6.38x -30.57%), XELA (4.18x -43.08%), CISN (4.1x -23.4%), ALTR (4.07x -15.05%)Financials: PMT (7.44x -3.18%), SMFG (4.36x -1.31%)Energy: PUMP (4.6x -30.59%)Consumer Staples: PRMW (3.67x +7.05%)12:52SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: PBYI (11.1 +20.52%), SIEN (5.94 +18.94%), LXRX (1.5 +17.19%), NVRO (73.82 +16.54%), TXMD (3.04 +15.15%), TRXC (1.02 +13.33%), TRHC (66.44 +12.05%), CYRX (22.39 +10.95%), OMER (17.86 +9.5%), DVAX (3.32 +9.42%), DPLO (5.8 +9.02%)Consumer Discretionary: OSTK (24.12 +13.27%), CHUY (26.3 +10.27%), AGS (9.16 +10.17%), FRGI (10.84 +8.94%)Information Technology: APPN (50.08 +15.82%), PCTY (110.93 +9.41%)Financials: GDOT (29.92 +9.12%), GGAL (38.07 +8.93%)Energy: WFT (0.02 +9.52%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: VRAY (2.91 -56.9%), NKTR (19.81 -33.01%), AMRN (14.72 -17.35%)Industrials: VSLR (7.5 -19.35%), AAXN (57.31 -16.23%), TPC (9.32 -15.7%)Consumer Discretionary: WTRH (1.43 -62.1%), FTCH (10.69 -41.42%), MAT (11.54 -14.07%)Information Technology: XELA (1.39 -43.08%), DXC (35.86 -30.57%), CNDT (6.03 -30.37%), CISN (7.55 -23.4%), VRTU (35.83 -17.8%), ALTR (35.67 -15.05%), DBX (18.65 -13.09%)Energy: PUMP (12.04 -30.59%)12:23LLY Eli Lilly announces favorable U.S. Court of Appeals Alimta ruling (112.66 -1.31)The co announced that the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in favor of Lilly, confirming that the Alimta (pemetrexed for injection) vitamin regimen patent would be infringed by competitors that had stated their intent to market alternative salt forms of pemetrexed prior to the patent's expiration in May 2022. The ruling came in the appeals of U.S. District Court decisions in the cases of Eli Lilly and Company v. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) and Eli Lilly and Company v. Hospira (PFE). Previous rulings in Lilly's favor had precluded the generic companies from launching the alternative salt forms until the patent expires. If the patent is ultimately upheld through all remaining challenges, Alimta would maintain U.S. exclusivity until May 2022, preventing marketing of generic products for as long as the patent remains in force.12:10SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (128) outpacing new lows (110) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ACAD, AEM, AIZ, AJRD, AMT, APPN, AVP, AWK, AWR, AXS, AYX, AZN, AZUL, BAH, BAM, BLDP, BLL, BRFS, CB, CCI, CECO, CIM, CINF, CME, CMG, CMS, COLD, CTAS, CUBE, CYTK, EIX, ELS, ENPH, EQIX, ES, EXR, FLT, FMC, FNF, HAE, HCP, HIG, LHX, HSY, ICE, IDA, KGC, LAUR, LNT, MCD, MELI, MKC, MLM, MODN, NEE, NEO, NTRA, NVCR, NVRO, OAK, PCTY, PODD, PRO, PSA, QTS, RGLD, RLI, RNR, ROKU, RPM, SAM, SBAC, SEDG, SHOP, SHW, SIGI, SO, SRC, STE, STOR, SUI, SVM, SWCH, TERP, TFX, TSN, TTD, VRSK, WEC, WELL, WK, WM, WPC, WPM, EVRG, WST, WTR, ZBH, ZTS, AQN, BHK, BKT, CYRX, EIM, EMB, FNV, FTS, FWONA, FWONK, IIM, IRT, MCR, MVF, MYI, NAC, NAD, NEA, NG, NMZ, NUV, NVG, NZF, OUT, PVG, RNP, RQI, VGM, VMOStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ACRS, ADAP, AEG, AM, AMTD, AR, ASNA, ATI, AXL, B, BRKMY, BCOR, BCS, BIDU, BOX, BT, CCO, CLB, CLVS, CMA, CNDT, COMM, CRESY, CYOU, DLTH, DXC, ENBL, EROS, EXPR, EXTN, FET, FLR, GLNG, GLOG, GMLP, GRPN, GT, GVA, HBM, HIMX, HMHC, HSBC, HSC, ING, JCP, KB, KEP, KMT, KT, LXFR, LYG, M, MAC, MCFT, MIK, MMLP, MMSI, MT, NE, NINE, NKTR, ODP, OEC, OLN, PLT, PRTA, PTEN, PVH, QNST, RGR, RIG, RL, SCHW, SEMG, SIG, SMLP, SSL, SSP, TAST, TECK, TEF, TELL, TGH, TMST, TPC, TRQ, TRUE, TSE, TUSK, VNTR, VRAY, VRTU, VSTO, WETF, WFTIQ, YY, BE, CARS, CEIX, CISN, CLNC, FIXX, FTCH, JHG, KLXE, LTRPA, SDRL, TRIP, WTRH, XELAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AFB, BFK, BUI, KTF, MCA, MQY, NBB, NID, NQP, WIAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: CEA, SHG, SHI, STN, BIOBETFs that traded to 52 week highs: EMB, FXY, IYR, UREETFs that traded to 52 week lows: FXB, XES11:45SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Farfetch (FTCH) sinks following second quarter press -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersAPPN (48.93 +13.16%): Topped consensus for Q2 EPS and revs (+11.7% yr/yr to $66.9 mln); issued mixed guidance for Q3 (sees revs above consensus, EPS below); raised its FY19 revs guidance, increasing its view of both subscription and total revenue for the year.

Posts all-time lows. NKTR (19.73 -33.29%): Reported mixed Q2 results. Co then disclosed a manufacturing issue: a suboptimal batch of in-process intermediate was used to produce two lots of bempegaldesleukin, which ultimately led to the softening of response rates in the PIVOT-02 study. The issue was restricted to the single batch of intermediates using lots two and five. Co has developed a comprehensive control strategy to limit variances in raw materials, intermediates, and the final product going forward. Downgraded at Mizuho, Jefferies, and JP Morgan.

Co's yr/yr decrease in US revenue (fell 2% to $78.1 mln) was associated with customer destocking associated with co's previously announced decision to alter its practice regarding certain high-volume product orders.

WTRH (1.95 -48.14%): Missed consensus for Q2 EPS and revs (+216.7% yr/yr to $51.3 mln) and lowered its FY19 revs view below consensus, citing delays to the roll-out of planned revenue initiatives, additional time needed to integrate the Bite Squad merger, and current competitive dynamics.

The S&P 500 (-0.7%) reclaimed its 50-day moving average during the last few minutes of yesterday's session but the benchmark index finds itself back below that level this morning.Equity futures stumbled after yesterday's cash close, responding to a Bloomberg report, which revealed that the Department of Commerce has yet to begin issuing licenses to U.S. companies that want to resume doing business with Huawei. The decision was reportedly made after the Chinese government ordered state-owned enterprises to stop purchasing agricultural goods from the U.S.Understandably, that revelation is having the biggest impact on chipmakers. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is down 2.0%, returning into negative territory for the week (-1.8% week-to-date). The broader technology sector (-0.9%) trades at the bottom of the leaderboard, while eight out of the remaining ten sectors also trade in the red.The Russell 2000 is down 0.8%; the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.8%; the S&P 500 is down 0.7%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.5%.09:40WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Wall Street opens slightly lower, little changed for the weekThe major averages begin the day slightly lower following a big two-day comeback.

Conversely, the utilities (+0.4%), health care (+0.2%), and real estate (+0.2%) sectors outperform.U.S. Treasuries are little changed.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -40.00.The S&P 500 is up 0.2% for the week, but is on track to lose those slim gains at the open with the S&P 500 futures currently trading ten points, or 0.3%, below fair value.The decline in the futures could be a breather considering that the S&P 500 climbed 112 points, or 4.0%, over a two-day span. Of course, that advance followed a sharp sell-off that had many market participants blaming trade tensions, which are not helpful for economic growth prospects. In either case, the decline is modest and futures do not necessarily predict intraday action.Uber (UBER 40.12, -2.85, -6.7%) shares rose over 8% yesterday heading into its earnings report, which included a $5.2 billion quarterly loss.

The company said that Robb will continue on with the Company for six months and help ensure a seamless transition of his responsibilities.Q3 & Updated FY19 Outlook:Q3: Co sees Platform GMV +30-35% yr/yr, and Adj-EBITDA loss margin of (~18-20%) of Adj-Revenues.FY19: Co sees GMV of ~$2.1 bln (+50% yr/yr), Platform GMV of $1.91-1.95 bln (+37-40% yr/yr vs. previous guidance for +41%), sees Adj-EBITDA loss margin of (~15-17%) (vs. previous guidance of (~16-17%)) of Adj-Revenues.

Biktarvy combines the novel, unboosted integrase strand transfer inhibitor bictegravir with the demonstrated safety and efficacy profile of the Descovy dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone and is the smallest INSTI-based triple-therapy STR available. In China, Biktarvy is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults without present or past evidence of viral resistance to the integrase inhibitor class, emtricitabine or tenofovir.The approval of Biktarvy is supported by data from four ongoing Phase 3 studies: Studies 1489 and 1490 in treatment-nave HIV-1 infected adults, and Studies 1844 and 1878 in virologically suppressed adults. The trials are comprised of a diverse population of 2,414 participants on Biktarvy or an active comparator regimen, including a wide range of adult age groups and races/ethnicities. Biktarvy met its primary efficacy objective of non-inferiority at 48 weeks across all four studies.Biktarvy received marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Commission in 2018. In the United States, Biktarvy has a Boxed Warning in its product label regarding the risk of post-treatment acute exacerbation of hepatitis B.

Before this communication, the FDA had been silent as to whether it would convene an AdCom in connection with its review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. The FDA expressed, based on the timing of its recent decision to convene an AdCom, that November 14th is the earliest date on which it could hold an AdCom due to scheduling constraints for such a meeting.Accordingly, Amarin does not expect the FDA to take action on the sNDA by the previously announced September 28, 2019 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date. Amarin did not receive notice from the FDA of a PDUFA date extension. In light of the tentative AdCom date, Amarin anticipates that the PDUFA date will be extended, assuming a typical three-month extension, to a date in late December 2019. If so, this anticipated revised PDUFA date timing would offset three of the four months that were expected to be gained from FDA's earlier determination to conduct a priority review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. Prior to such determination, Amarin had expected a PDUFA goal date in January 2020, based on a standard 10-month review. Amarin plans to update the investment community after appropriately definitive information is available related to a new PDUFA date.Amarin intends to continue to move forward with its plans to double the size of its sales force to support the launch of Vascepa. Amarin plans to use the anticipated three-month delay in the PDUFA clock to better prepare for the assumed launch of Vascepa including more time to hire and train new sales representatives. To the extent that new sales managers and representatives are hired prior to the expanded label for Vascepa, Amarin intends to have them join the company's existing sales team in promoting Vascepa based on its current indication and existing promotional messaging.16:30EB Eventbrite appoints Lanny Baker as CFO, effective September 3 (17.49 +0.73)Mr. Baker joins Eventbrite from Yelp (YELP) where as CFO he oversaw corporate finance, accounting, investor relations and workplace functions.

Today's rally, however, appeared to be more a continuation from yesterday's big intraday reversal that suggested the recent sharp sell-off may have been excessive.Interestingly, the S&P 500 traded just below its 50-day moving average (2934) for most of the afternoon before finally breaking above the key technical level late in the session. The benchmark index held above the level on a closing basis.All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher by at least 1.0%.

Continuing claims for the week ending July 27 decreased by 15,000 to 1.684 mln.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims continue hovering near multi-decade lows.Wholesale inventories were unchanged in June (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%) on top of an unrevised 0.4% increase in May. Wholesale sales decreased 0.3% in June after decreasing a revised 0.6% (from +0.1%) in May.The key takeaway from the June report and the May revision is that the gap between inventory growth and sales growth is widening, which should exert some pressure on prices.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for July on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +21.2% YTDS&P 500 +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +13.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.1% YTD16:21TSE Trinseo misses by $0.45, misses on revs; guides FY19 EPS below consensus (35.00 +1.81)Reports Q2 (Jun) earnings of $0.99 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.45 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.44; revenues fell 23.0% year/year to $951.8 mln vs the $1.07 bln two analyst estimate.Latex Binders net sales of $230 million for the quarter decreased 18% versus prior year due mainly to the pass through of lower raw material costs.Performance Plastics net sales of $347 million for the quarter were 16% below prior year due mainly to lower prices from the pass through of lower raw material costs.Co issues downside guidance for FY19, sees EPS of $4.15-4.86, excluding non-recurring items, vs. $5.54 S&P Capital IQ Consensus.16:20ROAD Construction Partners beats by $0.04, misses on revs (14.02 +0.20)Reports Q3 (Jun) earnings of $0.33 per share, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.29; revenues rose 16.5% year/year to $227.3 mln vs the $229.67 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Project backlog at June 30, 2019 was $581.1 mln.Adjusted EBITDA was $31.3 mln, up 37.9%.16:19PBYI Puma Biotech. beats by $0.32, reports revs in-line (9.21 +0.40)Reports Q2 (Jun) loss of $0.57 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.32 better than the single analyst estimate of ($0.89); revenues rose 6.1% year/year to $53.9 mln vs the $53.4 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Net NERLYNX revenue in the second quarter of 2019 was $53.8 million, compared to net NERLYNX revenue of $50.8 million in the second quarter of 2018."We anticipate the following key milestones during the remainder of 2019: (i) meeting with the FDA to discuss the clinical development and regulatory strategy for the SUMMIT trial in the third quarter of 2019; (ii) reporting additional data from the Phase II CONTROL trial in the fourth quarter of 2019; and (iii) receiving regulatory decisions for the extended adjuvant HER2-positive early stage breast cancer indication in additional countries."16:19DXC DXC Technology beats by $0.03, reports revs in-line (51.65 +1.76)Reports Q1 (Jun) earnings of $1.74 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.71; revenues fell 7.4% year/year to $4.89 bln vs the $4.86 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.16:18NRZ New Residential Investment prices $250 mln underwritten public offering of 10,000,000 shares of 7.125% Series B Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (15.27 +0.21)The company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for investments and general corporate purposes.16:18AIMT Aimmune Therapeutics misses by $0.08 (19.34 +0.24)Reports Q2 (Jun) loss of $1.01 per share, $0.08 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.93).Cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $250.3 million on June 30, 2019, compared to $303.9 million on December 31, 2018.

Familiar trade concerns appeared to hinder buying conviction after a three-day advance in the benchmark index.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.0%, and the Russell 2000 lost 1.3%.President Trump seemingly fed into the nagging trade angst when he told reporters that the U.S. will not be doing business with Huawei and that September trade talks could get canceled. None of these statements really surprised the market, but the prospect of U.S.-China relations further deteriorating kept some buyers sidelined on Friday.Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower, led by the energy (-1.3%) and information technology (-1.3%) sectors. Energy stocks fell despite the sharp increase in oil prices ($54.61/bbl, +$2.09, +4.0%), while the tech sector was pressured by shares of semiconductor companies, many of which derive substantial revenue from China. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 1.8%.Conversely, the defensive-oriented health care (+0.2%), real estate (+0.1%), and utilities (+0.04%) sectors were the lone sectors that finished higher.Uber (UBER 40.05, -2.92) shares fell 6.8% after the company reported a wider-than-expected $5.2 billion quarterly loss. Revenue also came up short of estimates, but today's decline simply retraced much of yesterday's 8% rally.In other corporate news, Amgen (AMGN 196.25, +11.02) shares spiked 6.0% following a positive ruling regarding its Enbrel business. DXC Technology (DXC 35.91, -15.74, -30.5%) plunged over 30% after it cut its FY20 outlook, while Dropbox (DBX 18.71, -2.75) fell 12.8% despite providing decent results and guidance.U.S. Treasuries finished slightly lower, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points each to 1.63% and 1.73%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 97.54.Reviewing Friday's lone economic report, the Producer Price Index for July:The index for final demand increased 0.2% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, excluding food and energy, decreased 0.1% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). The m/m readings left the index for final demand up 1.7% yr/yr, unchanged from June. The index remains at its lowest level since January 2017. Core PPI was up 2.1% yr/yr, down from 2.3% in June.The key takeaway from the report is that inflationary pressure remains muted.Looking ahead, Monday's economic data will be limited to the Treasury Budget for July.Nasdaq Composite +20.0% YTDS&P 500 +16.4% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +12.7% YTDRussell 2000 +12.2% YTD16:13HVT Haverty Furniture approves new $10.0 mln authorization under its common stock repurchase program and raises quarterly dividend to $0.20/share from $0.18/share (18.06 -0.30)16:05QUOT Quotient authorizes stock buyback program for up to $50.0 mln of its common stock (7.47 -0.02)15:51NVS Novartis AG: Sandoz confirms United States District Court of New Jersey ruled against it in patent litigation concerning the Sandoz biosimilar, Erelzi, for reference medicine Enbrel (90.98 -0.25)The company will appeal the ruling to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and the parties have agreed to an expedited appeal.

Treasuries started the cash session near their flat lines after futures backed off their highs from last evening. Those highs were registered after Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration is delaying the issuance of licenses that would allow U.S. companies to continue doing business with Huawei. The first hour of the session saw a sideways drift, which was followed by a push to highs after President Trump said that next month's trade talks with officials from China could be cancelled, adding that "we will not do business with Huawei." Treasuries spent the next couple hours in a slow retreat toward their starting levels, slipping to fresh lows after White House officials clarified that President Trump's comment about not doing business with Huawei referred to federal departments only while the Commerce Department will continue processing applications for special licenses from individual companies. Treasuries finished the day on lows, with the 10-yr yield narrowing this week's decline to 12 basis points. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.1% to 97.51, surrendering 0.6% for the week.

The benchmark index is down 1.0% with noticeable weakness in the semiconductor stocks.The Nasdaq Composite is down 1.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 is down 1.4%.President Trump told reporters today that the U.S. will not be doing business with Huawei, which seemed to confirm a Bloomberg report yesterday that the U.S. Commerce Department has been refraining from approving business licenses to work with the Chinese company. The president added that September trade talks could get canceled but are still scheduled for the time being.None of these events has been too surprising for investors, but the prospect of U.S.-China relations further deteriorating has contributed to a steady broad-based decline today.All 11 S&P 500 sectors are down, including eight with losses of at least 1.0%. The information technology sector (-1.5%) is underperforming amid the trade uncertainty, which has also made a noticeable impact on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-2.0%). Many semiconductor companies are heavily exposed to China.Uber (UBER 39.72, -3.23) shares have dropped 7.5% after the company reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss of $5.2 billion. Revenue also missed estimates, but today's loss has simply given back a bulk of yesterday's 8% rally.In other earnings news, shares of DXC Technology (DXC 35.74, -15.90, -30.8%) have plunged over 30% after the company cut its FY20 outlook, while shares of Activision Blizzard (ATVI 47.56, -1.78, -3.6%) trade lower as investors remain underwhelmed by its downside Q3 guidance.The U.S. Treasury market, which has drawn plenty of attention this week, has been muted. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.70%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.2% to 97.43. Interestingly, despite the growth concerns, WTI crude is up 3.7%, or $1.94, to $54.48/bbl.Reviewing today's lone economic report, the Producer Price Index for July:The index for final demand increased 0.2% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, excluding food and energy, decreased 0.1% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). The m/m readings left the index for final demand up 1.7% yr/yr, unchanged from June. The index remains at its lowest level since January 2017. Core PPI was up 2.1% yr/yr, down from 2.3% in June.The key takeaway from the report is that inflationary pressure remains muted.12:53SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: AMRN (20.82 mln -17.35%), NKTR (16.72 mln -33.01%), VRAY (16.28 mln -56.9%)Industrials: GE (47.2 mln -3.06%)Consumer Discretionary: F (25.15 mln -1.36%), FTCH (19.75 mln -41.42%)Information Technology: AMD (54.93 mln +0.88%), NOK (17.11 mln +0.28%), SYMC (15.56 mln +0.57%), DXC (14.71 mln -30.57%), MU (12.35 mln -3.33%), AAPL (11.43 mln -1.13%)Financials: BAC (24.44 mln -1.07%), QQQ (17.87 mln -1.5%), TQQQ (16.4 mln -4.53%), SQQQ (12.92 mln +4.48%)Energy: CHK (27.62 mln +0.34%), RIG (14.88 mln -4.15%)Consumer Staples: ABEV (16.79 mln -0.2%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: VRAY (13.64x -56.9%), NKTR (10.16x -33.01%), SIEN (4.23x +18.94%), NVRO (3.47x +16.54%)Industrials: WAIR (14.57x +6.88%)Consumer Discretionary: FTCH (10.92x -41.42%), WTRH (5.33x -62.1%), QSR (4.44x -3.09%), PLYA (3.69x -2.52%), CHUY (3.58x +10.27%)Information Technology: DXC (6.38x -30.57%), XELA (4.18x -43.08%), CISN (4.1x -23.4%), ALTR (4.07x -15.05%)Financials: PMT (7.44x -3.18%), SMFG (4.36x -1.31%)Energy: PUMP (4.6x -30.59%)Consumer Staples: PRMW (3.67x +7.05%)12:52SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: PBYI (11.1 +20.52%), SIEN (5.94 +18.94%), LXRX (1.5 +17.19%), NVRO (73.82 +16.54%), TXMD (3.04 +15.15%), TRXC (1.02 +13.33%), TRHC (66.44 +12.05%), CYRX (22.39 +10.95%), OMER (17.86 +9.5%), DVAX (3.32 +9.42%), DPLO (5.8 +9.02%)Consumer Discretionary: OSTK (24.12 +13.27%), CHUY (26.3 +10.27%), AGS (9.16 +10.17%), FRGI (10.84 +8.94%)Information Technology: APPN (50.08 +15.82%), PCTY (110.93 +9.41%)Financials: GDOT (29.92 +9.12%), GGAL (38.07 +8.93%)Energy: WFT (0.02 +9.52%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: VRAY (2.91 -56.9%), NKTR (19.81 -33.01%), AMRN (14.72 -17.35%)Industrials: VSLR (7.5 -19.35%), AAXN (57.31 -16.23%), TPC (9.32 -15.7%)Consumer Discretionary: WTRH (1.43 -62.1%), FTCH (10.69 -41.42%), MAT (11.54 -14.07%)Information Technology: XELA (1.39 -43.08%), DXC (35.86 -30.57%), CNDT (6.03 -30.37%), CISN (7.55 -23.4%), VRTU (35.83 -17.8%), ALTR (35.67 -15.05%), DBX (18.65 -13.09%)Energy: PUMP (12.04 -30.59%)12:23LLY Eli Lilly announces favorable U.S. Court of Appeals Alimta ruling (112.66 -1.31)The co announced that the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in favor of Lilly, confirming that the Alimta (pemetrexed for injection) vitamin regimen patent would be infringed by competitors that had stated their intent to market alternative salt forms of pemetrexed prior to the patent's expiration in May 2022. The ruling came in the appeals of U.S. District Court decisions in the cases of Eli Lilly and Company v. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) and Eli Lilly and Company v. Hospira (PFE). Previous rulings in Lilly's favor had precluded the generic companies from launching the alternative salt forms until the patent expires. If the patent is ultimately upheld through all remaining challenges, Alimta would maintain U.S. exclusivity until May 2022, preventing marketing of generic products for as long as the patent remains in force.12:10SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (128) outpacing new lows (110) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ACAD, AEM, AIZ, AJRD, AMT, APPN, AVP, AWK, AWR, AXS, AYX, AZN, AZUL, BAH, BAM, BLDP, BLL, BRFS, CB, CCI, CECO, CIM, CINF, CME, CMG, CMS, COLD, CTAS, CUBE, CYTK, EIX, ELS, ENPH, EQIX, ES, EXR, FLT, FMC, FNF, HAE, HCP, HIG, LHX, HSY, ICE, IDA, KGC, LAUR, LNT, MCD, MELI, MKC, MLM, MODN, NEE, NEO, NTRA, NVCR, NVRO, OAK, PCTY, PODD, PRO, PSA, QTS, RGLD, RLI, RNR, ROKU, RPM, SAM, SBAC, SEDG, SHOP, SHW, SIGI, SO, SRC, STE, STOR, SUI, SVM, SWCH, TERP, TFX, TSN, TTD, VRSK, WEC, WELL, WK, WM, WPC, WPM, EVRG, WST, WTR, ZBH, ZTS, AQN, BHK, BKT, CYRX, EIM, EMB, FNV, FTS, FWONA, FWONK, IIM, IRT, MCR, MVF, MYI, NAC, NAD, NEA, NG, NMZ, NUV, NVG, NZF, OUT, PVG, RNP, RQI, VGM, VMOStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ACRS, ADAP, AEG, AM, AMTD, AR, ASNA, ATI, AXL, B, BRKMY, BCOR, BCS, BIDU, BOX, BT, CCO, CLB, CLVS, CMA, CNDT, COMM, CRESY, CYOU, DLTH, DXC, ENBL, EROS, EXPR, EXTN, FET, FLR, GLNG, GLOG, GMLP, GRPN, GT, GVA, HBM, HIMX, HMHC, HSBC, HSC, ING, JCP, KB, KEP, KMT, KT, LXFR, LYG, M, MAC, MCFT, MIK, MMLP, MMSI, MT, NE, NINE, NKTR, ODP, OEC, OLN, PLT, PRTA, PTEN, PVH, QNST, RGR, RIG, RL, SCHW, SEMG, SIG, SMLP, SSL, SSP, TAST, TECK, TEF, TELL, TGH, TMST, TPC, TRQ, TRUE, TSE, TUSK, VNTR, VRAY, VRTU, VSTO, WETF, WFTIQ, YY, BE, CARS, CEIX, CISN, CLNC, FIXX, FTCH, JHG, KLXE, LTRPA, SDRL, TRIP, WTRH, XELAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AFB, BFK, BUI, KTF, MCA, MQY, NBB, NID, NQP, WIAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: CEA, SHG, SHI, STN, BIOBETFs that traded to 52 week highs: EMB, FXY, IYR, UREETFs that traded to 52 week lows: FXB, XES11:45SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Farfetch (FTCH) sinks following second quarter press -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersAPPN (48.93 +13.16%): Topped consensus for Q2 EPS and revs (+11.7% yr/yr to $66.9 mln); issued mixed guidance for Q3 (sees revs above consensus, EPS below); raised its FY19 revs guidance, increasing its view of both subscription and total revenue for the year.

WTRH (1.95 -48.14%): Missed consensus for Q2 EPS and revs (+216.7% yr/yr to $51.3 mln) and lowered its FY19 revs view below consensus, citing delays to the roll-out of planned revenue initiatives, additional time needed to integrate the Bite Squad merger, and current competitive dynamics.

The S&P 500 (-0.7%) reclaimed its 50-day moving average during the last few minutes of yesterday's session but the benchmark index finds itself back below that level this morning.Equity futures stumbled after yesterday's cash close, responding to a Bloomberg report, which revealed that the Department of Commerce has yet to begin issuing licenses to U.S. companies that want to resume doing business with Huawei.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -40.00.The S&P 500 is up 0.2% for the week, but is on track to lose those slim gains at the open with the S&P 500 futures currently trading ten points, or 0.3%, below fair value.The decline in the futures could be a breather considering that the S&P 500 climbed 112 points, or 4.0%, over a two-day span.

Before this communication, the FDA had been silent as to whether it would convene an AdCom in connection with its review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. The FDA expressed, based on the timing of its recent decision to convene an AdCom, that November 14th is the earliest date on which it could hold an AdCom due to scheduling constraints for such a meeting.Accordingly, Amarin does not expect the FDA to take action on the sNDA by the previously announced September 28, 2019 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date. Amarin did not receive notice from the FDA of a PDUFA date extension. In light of the tentative AdCom date, Amarin anticipates that the PDUFA date will be extended, assuming a typical three-month extension, to a date in late December 2019. If so, this anticipated revised PDUFA date timing would offset three of the four months that were expected to be gained from FDA's earlier determination to conduct a priority review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. Prior to such determination, Amarin had expected a PDUFA goal date in January 2020, based on a standard 10-month review. Amarin plans to update the investment community after appropriately definitive information is available related to a new PDUFA date.Amarin intends to continue to move forward with its plans to double the size of its sales force to support the launch of Vascepa.

Today's rally, however, appeared to be more a continuation from yesterday's big intraday reversal that suggested the recent sharp sell-off may have been excessive.Interestingly, the S&P 500 traded just below its 50-day moving average (2934) for most of the afternoon before finally breaking above the key technical level late in the session. The benchmark index held above the level on a closing basis.All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher by at least 1.0%.

Familiar trade concerns appeared to hinder buying conviction after a three-day advance in the benchmark index.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.0%, and the Russell 2000 lost 1.3%.President Trump seemingly fed into the nagging trade angst when he told reporters that the U.S. will not be doing business with Huawei and that September trade talks could get canceled. None of these statements really surprised the market, but the prospect of U.S.-China relations further deteriorating kept some buyers sidelined on Friday.Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower, led by the energy (-1.3%) and information technology (-1.3%) sectors. Energy stocks fell despite the sharp increase in oil prices ($54.61/bbl, +$2.09, +4.0%), while the tech sector was pressured by shares of semiconductor companies, many of which derive substantial revenue from China. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 1.8%.Conversely, the defensive-oriented health care (+0.2%), real estate (+0.1%), and utilities (+0.04%) sectors were the lone sectors that finished higher.Uber (UBER 40.05, -2.92) shares fell 6.8% after the company reported a wider-than-expected $5.2 billion quarterly loss. Revenue also came up short of estimates, but today's decline simply retraced much of yesterday's 8% rally.In other corporate news, Amgen (AMGN 196.25, +11.02) shares spiked 6.0% following a positive ruling regarding its Enbrel business. DXC Technology (DXC 35.91, -15.74, -30.5%) plunged over 30% after it cut its FY20 outlook, while Dropbox (DBX 18.71, -2.75) fell 12.8% despite providing decent results and guidance.U.S. Treasuries finished slightly lower, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points each to 1.63% and 1.73%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 97.54.Reviewing Friday's lone economic report, the Producer Price Index for July:The index for final demand increased 0.2% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, excluding food and energy, decreased 0.1% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). The m/m readings left the index for final demand up 1.7% yr/yr, unchanged from June. The index remains at its lowest level since January 2017. Core PPI was up 2.1% yr/yr, down from 2.3% in June.The key takeaway from the report is that inflationary pressure remains muted.Looking ahead, Monday's economic data will be limited to the Treasury Budget for July.Nasdaq Composite +20.0% YTDS&P 500 +16.4% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +12.7% YTDRussell 2000 +12.2% YTD16:13HVT Haverty Furniture approves new $10.0 mln authorization under its common stock repurchase program and raises quarterly dividend to $0.20/share from $0.18/share (18.06 -0.30)16:05QUOT Quotient authorizes stock buyback program for up to $50.0 mln of its common stock (7.47 -0.02)15:51NVS Novartis AG: Sandoz confirms United States District Court of New Jersey ruled against it in patent litigation concerning the Sandoz biosimilar, Erelzi, for reference medicine Enbrel (90.98 -0.25)The company will appeal the ruling to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and the parties have agreed to an expedited appeal. Sandoz is the first biosimilar company to receive FDA approval for a biosimilar etanercept. Erelzi has been approved for nearly three years, however Sandoz has been unable to launch the medicine due to the ongoing patent litigation from Amgen.15:25BONDX Treasury Market SummaryStrong Week Ends on Down NoteU.S. Treasuries ended a volatile week on a lower note. Treasuries started the cash session near their flat lines after futures backed off their highs from last evening. Those highs were registered after Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration is delaying the issuance of licenses that would allow U.S. companies to continue doing business with Huawei. The first hour of the session saw a sideways drift, which was followed by a push to highs after President Trump said that next month's trade talks with officials from China could be cancelled, adding that "we will not do business with Huawei." Treasuries spent the next couple hours in a slow retreat toward their starting levels, slipping to fresh lows after White House officials clarified that President Trump's comment about not doing business with Huawei referred to federal departments only while the Commerce Department will continue processing applications for special licenses from individual companies. Treasuries finished the day on lows, with the 10-yr yield narrowing this week's decline to 12 basis points. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.1% to 97.51, surrendering 0.6% for the week.

The benchmark index is down 1.0% with noticeable weakness in the semiconductor stocks.The Nasdaq Composite is down 1.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 is down 1.4%.President Trump told reporters today that the U.S. will not be doing business with Huawei, which seemed to confirm a Bloomberg report yesterday that the U.S. Commerce Department has been refraining from approving business licenses to work with the Chinese company. The president added that September trade talks could get canceled but are still scheduled for the time being.None of these events has been too surprising for investors, but the prospect of U.S.-China relations further deteriorating has contributed to a steady broad-based decline today.All 11 S&P 500 sectors are down, including eight with losses of at least 1.0%. The information technology sector (-1.5%) is underperforming amid the trade uncertainty, which has also made a noticeable impact on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-2.0%). Many semiconductor companies are heavily exposed to China.Uber (UBER 39.72, -3.23) shares have dropped 7.5% after the company reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss of $5.2 billion. Revenue also missed estimates, but today's loss has simply given back a bulk of yesterday's 8% rally.In other earnings news, shares of DXC Technology (DXC 35.74, -15.90, -30.8%) have plunged over 30% after the company cut its FY20 outlook, while shares of Activision Blizzard (ATVI 47.56, -1.78, -3.6%) trade lower as investors remain underwhelmed by its downside Q3 guidance.The U.S. Treasury market, which has drawn plenty of attention this week, has been muted. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.70%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.2% to 97.43. Interestingly, despite the growth concerns, WTI crude is up 3.7%, or $1.94, to $54.48/bbl.Reviewing today's lone economic report, the Producer Price Index for July:The index for final demand increased 0.2% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, excluding food and energy, decreased 0.1% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%).

The ruling came in the appeals of U.S. District Court decisions in the cases of Eli Lilly and Company v. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) and Eli Lilly and Company v. Hospira (PFE). Previous rulings in Lilly's favor had precluded the generic companies from launching the alternative salt forms until the patent expires. If the patent is ultimately upheld through all remaining challenges, Alimta would maintain U.S. exclusivity until May 2022, preventing marketing of generic products for as long as the patent remains in force.12:10SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (128) outpacing new lows (110) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ACAD, AEM, AIZ, AJRD, AMT, APPN, AVP, AWK, AWR, AXS, AYX, AZN, AZUL, BAH, BAM, BLDP, BLL, BRFS, CB, CCI, CECO, CIM, CINF, CME, CMG, CMS, COLD, CTAS, CUBE, CYTK, EIX, ELS, ENPH, EQIX, ES, EXR, FLT, FMC, FNF, HAE, HCP, HIG, LHX, HSY, ICE, IDA, KGC, LAUR, LNT, MCD, MELI, MKC, MLM, MODN, NEE, NEO, NTRA, NVCR, NVRO, OAK, PCTY, PODD, PRO, PSA, QTS, RGLD, RLI, RNR, ROKU, RPM, SAM, SBAC, SEDG, SHOP, SHW, SIGI, SO, SRC, STE, STOR, SUI, SVM, SWCH, TERP, TFX, TSN, TTD, VRSK, WEC, WELL, WK, WM, WPC, WPM, EVRG, WST, WTR, ZBH, ZTS, AQN, BHK, BKT, CYRX, EIM, EMB, FNV, FTS, FWONA, FWONK, IIM, IRT, MCR, MVF, MYI, NAC, NAD, NEA, NG, NMZ, NUV, NVG, NZF, OUT, PVG, RNP, RQI, VGM, VMOStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ACRS, ADAP, AEG, AM, AMTD, AR, ASNA, ATI, AXL, B, BRKMY, BCOR, BCS, BIDU, BOX, BT, CCO, CLB, CLVS, CMA, CNDT, COMM, CRESY, CYOU, DLTH, DXC, ENBL, EROS, EXPR, EXTN, FET, FLR, GLNG, GLOG, GMLP, GRPN, GT, GVA, HBM, HIMX, HMHC, HSBC, HSC, ING, JCP, KB, KEP, KMT, KT, LXFR, LYG, M, MAC, MCFT, MIK, MMLP, MMSI, MT, NE, NINE, NKTR, ODP, OEC, OLN, PLT, PRTA, PTEN, PVH, QNST, RGR, RIG, RL, SCHW, SEMG, SIG, SMLP, SSL, SSP, TAST, TECK, TEF, TELL, TGH, TMST, TPC, TRQ, TRUE, TSE, TUSK, VNTR, VRAY, VRTU, VSTO, WETF, WFTIQ, YY, BE, CARS, CEIX, CISN, CLNC, FIXX, FTCH, JHG, KLXE, LTRPA, SDRL, TRIP, WTRH, XELAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AFB, BFK, BUI, KTF, MCA, MQY, NBB, NID, NQP, WIAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: CEA, SHG, SHI, STN, BIOBETFs that traded to 52 week highs: EMB, FXY, IYR, UREETFs that traded to 52 week lows: FXB, XES11:45SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Farfetch (FTCH) sinks following second quarter press -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersAPPN (48.93 +13.16%): Topped consensus for Q2 EPS and revs (+11.7% yr/yr to $66.9 mln); issued mixed guidance for Q3 (sees revs above consensus, EPS below); raised its FY19 revs guidance, increasing its view of both subscription and total revenue for the year.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -40.00.The S&P 500 is up 0.2% for the week, but is on track to lose those slim gains at the open with the S&P 500 futures currently trading ten points, or 0.3%, below fair value.The decline in the futures could be a breather considering that the S&P 500 climbed 112 points, or 4.0%, over a two-day span. Of course, that advance followed a sharp sell-off that had many market participants blaming trade tensions, which are not helpful for economic growth prospects. In either case, the decline is modest and futures do not necessarily predict intraday action.Uber (UBER 40.12, -2.85, -6.7%) shares rose over 8% yesterday heading into its earnings report, which included a $5.2 billion quarterly loss.

Biktarvy combines the novel, unboosted integrase strand transfer inhibitor bictegravir with the demonstrated safety and efficacy profile of the Descovy dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone and is the smallest INSTI-based triple-therapy STR available. In China, Biktarvy is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults without present or past evidence of viral resistance to the integrase inhibitor class, emtricitabine or tenofovir.The approval of Biktarvy is supported by data from four ongoing Phase 3 studies: Studies 1489 and 1490 in treatment-nave HIV-1 infected adults, and Studies 1844 and 1878 in virologically suppressed adults. The trials are comprised of a diverse population of 2,414 participants on Biktarvy or an active comparator regimen, including a wide range of adult age groups and races/ethnicities. Biktarvy met its primary efficacy objective of non-inferiority at 48 weeks across all four studies.Biktarvy received marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Commission in 2018. In the United States, Biktarvy has a Boxed Warning in its product label regarding the risk of post-treatment acute exacerbation of hepatitis B.

Before this communication, the FDA had been silent as to whether it would convene an AdCom in connection with its review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. The FDA expressed, based on the timing of its recent decision to convene an AdCom, that November 14th is the earliest date on which it could hold an AdCom due to scheduling constraints for such a meeting.Accordingly, Amarin does not expect the FDA to take action on the sNDA by the previously announced September 28, 2019 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date. Amarin did not receive notice from the FDA of a PDUFA date extension. In light of the tentative AdCom date, Amarin anticipates that the PDUFA date will be extended, assuming a typical three-month extension, to a date in late December 2019. If so, this anticipated revised PDUFA date timing would offset three of the four months that were expected to be gained from FDA's earlier determination to conduct a priority review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. Prior to such determination, Amarin had expected a PDUFA goal date in January 2020, based on a standard 10-month review. Amarin plans to update the investment community after appropriately definitive information is available related to a new PDUFA date.Amarin intends to continue to move forward with its plans to double the size of its sales force to support the launch of Vascepa. Amarin plans to use the anticipated three-month delay in the PDUFA clock to better prepare for the assumed launch of Vascepa including more time to hire and train new sales representatives. To the extent that new sales managers and representatives are hired prior to the expanded label for Vascepa, Amarin intends to have them join the company's existing sales team in promoting Vascepa based on its current indication and existing promotional messaging.16:30EB Eventbrite appoints Lanny Baker as CFO, effective September 3 (17.49 +0.73)Mr. Baker joins Eventbrite from Yelp (YELP) where as CFO he oversaw corporate finance, accounting, investor relations and workplace functions.

Such an increase in the supply of ships, especially in a segment with a total of 118 vessels on the water and with more than half trading under time charters, has restricted handysize market rates from increasing alongside other sectors.

The S&P 500 advanced 1.9%, which extended its two-day comeback to 112 points, or 4.0%, from its session low on Wednesday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 1.4%, the Nasdaq Composite increased 2.2%, and the Russell 2000 increased 2.1%.Thursday's positive disposition ostensibly formed overnight after China reported a surprise yr/yr increase in July exports while holding its yuan firm, which again signaled goodwill in trade relations. Today's rally, however, appeared to be more a continuation from yesterday's big intraday reversal that suggested the recent sharp sell-off may have been excessive.Interestingly, the S&P 500 traded just below its 50-day moving average (2934) for most of the afternoon before finally breaking above the key technical level late in the session. The benchmark index held above the level on a closing basis.All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher by at least 1.0%. The energy sector (+2.9%) led the advance as oil prices ($52.52/bbl, +$1.38, +2.7%) rebounded, followed by the information technology (+2.4%), communication services (+2.2%), and consumer discretionary (+2.0%) sectors.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 33.92, +4.73, +16.2%) led the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+2.7%) higher after it unveiled its well-received server CPUs that Google and Twitter will reportedly use. Broadcom (AVGO 270.98, +0.93, +0.3%) struggled to participate in the chip rally amid news that it is close to purchasing Symantec's (SYMC 22.92, +2.51, +12.3%) enterprise business for about $10 billion.In earnings news, Booking Holdings (BKNG 1941.01, +119.45, +6.6%), Lyft (LYFT 62.10, +1.81, +3.0%), and Roku (ROKU 122.03, +21.06, +20.9%) outperformed the broader market following positive results and/or upbeat guidance. Kraft Heinz (KHC 28.22, -2.65, -8.6%) disappointed investors with its results.U.S. Treasuries were under noticeable selling pressure today, which sent the 10-yr yield up 11 basis points to 1.79% at one point during the session. Buyers gradually came back, ultimately leaving the benchmark yield up three basis points to 1.72%. The 2-yr yield finished also finished three basis points higher at 1.61%.

Continuing claims for the week ending July 27 decreased by 15,000 to 1.684 mln.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims continue hovering near multi-decade lows.Wholesale inventories were unchanged in June (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%) on top of an unrevised 0.4% increase in May. Wholesale sales decreased 0.3% in June after decreasing a revised 0.6% (from +0.1%) in May.The key takeaway from the June report and the May revision is that the gap between inventory growth and sales growth is widening, which should exert some pressure on prices.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for July on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +21.2% YTDS&P 500 +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +13.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.1% YTD16:21TSE Trinseo misses by $0.45, misses on revs; guides FY19 EPS below consensus (35.00 +1.81)Reports Q2 (Jun) earnings of $0.99 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.45 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.44; revenues fell 23.0% year/year to $951.8 mln vs the $1.07 bln two analyst estimate.Latex Binders net sales of $230 million for the quarter decreased 18% versus prior year due mainly to the pass through of lower raw material costs.Performance Plastics net sales of $347 million for the quarter were 16% below prior year due mainly to lower prices from the pass through of lower raw material costs.Co issues downside guidance for FY19, sees EPS of $4.15-4.86, excluding non-recurring items, vs. $5.54 S&P Capital IQ Consensus.16:20ROAD Construction Partners beats by $0.04, misses on revs (14.02 +0.20)Reports Q3 (Jun) earnings of $0.33 per share, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.29; revenues rose 16.5% year/year to $227.3 mln vs the $229.67 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Project backlog at June 30, 2019 was $581.1 mln.Adjusted EBITDA was $31.3 mln, up 37.9%.16:19PBYI Puma Biotech. beats by $0.32, reports revs in-line (9.21 +0.40)Reports Q2 (Jun) loss of $0.57 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.32 better than the single analyst estimate of ($0.89); revenues rose 6.1% year/year to $53.9 mln vs the $53.4 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Net NERLYNX revenue in the second quarter of 2019 was $53.8 million, compared to net NERLYNX revenue of $50.8 million in the second quarter of 2018."We anticipate the following key milestones during the remainder of 2019: (i) meeting with the FDA to discuss the clinical development and regulatory strategy for the SUMMIT trial in the third quarter of 2019; (ii) reporting additional data from the Phase II CONTROL trial in the fourth quarter of 2019; and (iii) receiving regulatory decisions for the extended adjuvant HER2-positive early stage breast cancer indication in additional countries."16:19DXC DXC Technology beats by $0.03, reports revs in-line (51.65 +1.76)Reports Q1 (Jun) earnings of $1.74 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.71; revenues fell 7.4% year/year to $4.89 bln vs the $4.86 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.16:18NRZ New Residential Investment prices $250 mln underwritten public offering of 10,000,000 shares of 7.125% Series B Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (15.27 +0.21)The company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for investments and general corporate purposes.16:18AIMT Aimmune Therapeutics misses by $0.08 (19.34 +0.24)Reports Q2 (Jun) loss of $1.01 per share, $0.08 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.93).Cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $250.3 million on June 30, 2019, compared to $303.9 million on December 31, 2018.

Familiar trade concerns appeared to hinder buying conviction after a three-day advance in the benchmark index.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.0%, and the Russell 2000 lost 1.3%.President Trump seemingly fed into the nagging trade angst when he told reporters that the U.S. will not be doing business with Huawei and that September trade talks could get canceled. None of these statements really surprised the market, but the prospect of U.S.-China relations further deteriorating kept some buyers sidelined on Friday.Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower, led by the energy (-1.3%) and information technology (-1.3%) sectors. Energy stocks fell despite the sharp increase in oil prices ($54.61/bbl, +$2.09, +4.0%), while the tech sector was pressured by shares of semiconductor companies, many of which derive substantial revenue from China. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 1.8%.Conversely, the defensive-oriented health care (+0.2%), real estate (+0.1%), and utilities (+0.04%) sectors were the lone sectors that finished higher.Uber (UBER 40.05, -2.92) shares fell 6.8% after the company reported a wider-than-expected $5.2 billion quarterly loss. Revenue also came up short of estimates, but today's decline simply retraced much of yesterday's 8% rally.In other corporate news, Amgen (AMGN 196.25, +11.02) shares spiked 6.0% following a positive ruling regarding its Enbrel business. DXC Technology (DXC 35.91, -15.74, -30.5%) plunged over 30% after it cut its FY20 outlook, while Dropbox (DBX 18.71, -2.75) fell 12.8% despite providing decent results and guidance.U.S. Treasuries finished slightly lower, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points each to 1.63% and 1.73%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 97.54.Reviewing Friday's lone economic report, the Producer Price Index for July:The index for final demand increased 0.2% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, excluding food and energy, decreased 0.1% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). The m/m readings left the index for final demand up 1.7% yr/yr, unchanged from June. The index remains at its lowest level since January 2017. Core PPI was up 2.1% yr/yr, down from 2.3% in June.The key takeaway from the report is that inflationary pressure remains muted.Looking ahead, Monday's economic data will be limited to the Treasury Budget for July.Nasdaq Composite +20.0% YTDS&P 500 +16.4% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +12.7% YTDRussell 2000 +12.2% YTD16:13HVT Haverty Furniture approves new $10.0 mln authorization under its common stock repurchase program and raises quarterly dividend to $0.20/share from $0.18/share (18.06 -0.30)16:05QUOT Quotient authorizes stock buyback program for up to $50.0 mln of its common stock (7.47 -0.02)15:51NVS Novartis AG: Sandoz confirms United States District Court of New Jersey ruled against it in patent litigation concerning the Sandoz biosimilar, Erelzi, for reference medicine Enbrel (90.98 -0.25)The company will appeal the ruling to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and the parties have agreed to an expedited appeal.

Erelzi has been approved for nearly three years, however Sandoz has been unable to launch the medicine due to the ongoing patent litigation from Amgen.15:25BONDX Treasury Market SummaryStrong Week Ends on Down NoteU.S. Treasuries ended a volatile week on a lower note. Treasuries started the cash session near their flat lines after futures backed off their highs from last evening. Those highs were registered after Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration is delaying the issuance of licenses that would allow U.S. companies to continue doing business with Huawei. The first hour of the session saw a sideways drift, which was followed by a push to highs after President Trump said that next month's trade talks with officials from China could be cancelled, adding that "we will not do business with Huawei." Treasuries spent the next couple hours in a slow retreat toward their starting levels, slipping to fresh lows after White House officials clarified that President Trump's comment about not doing business with Huawei referred to federal departments only while the Commerce Department will continue processing applications for special licenses from individual companies. Treasuries finished the day on lows, with the 10-yr yield narrowing this week's decline to 12 basis points. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.1% to 97.51, surrendering 0.6% for the week.

The benchmark index is down 1.0% with noticeable weakness in the semiconductor stocks.The Nasdaq Composite is down 1.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 is down 1.4%.President Trump told reporters today that the U.S. will not be doing business with Huawei, which seemed to confirm a Bloomberg report yesterday that the U.S. Commerce Department has been refraining from approving business licenses to work with the Chinese company. The president added that September trade talks could get canceled but are still scheduled for the time being.None of these events has been too surprising for investors, but the prospect of U.S.-China relations further deteriorating has contributed to a steady broad-based decline today.All 11 S&P 500 sectors are down, including eight with losses of at least 1.0%. The information technology sector (-1.5%) is underperforming amid the trade uncertainty, which has also made a noticeable impact on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-2.0%). Many semiconductor companies are heavily exposed to China.Uber (UBER 39.72, -3.23) shares have dropped 7.5% after the company reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss of $5.2 billion. Revenue also missed estimates, but today's loss has simply given back a bulk of yesterday's 8% rally.In other earnings news, shares of DXC Technology (DXC 35.74, -15.90, -30.8%) have plunged over 30% after the company cut its FY20 outlook, while shares of Activision Blizzard (ATVI 47.56, -1.78, -3.6%) trade lower as investors remain underwhelmed by its downside Q3 guidance.The U.S. Treasury market, which has drawn plenty of attention this week, has been muted. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.70%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.2% to 97.43. Interestingly, despite the growth concerns, WTI crude is up 3.7%, or $1.94, to $54.48/bbl.Reviewing today's lone economic report, the Producer Price Index for July:The index for final demand increased 0.2% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, excluding food and energy, decreased 0.1% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). The m/m readings left the index for final demand up 1.7% yr/yr, unchanged from June. The index remains at its lowest level since January 2017. Core PPI was up 2.1% yr/yr, down from 2.3% in June.The key takeaway from the report is that inflationary pressure remains muted.12:53SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: AMRN (20.82 mln -17.35%), NKTR (16.72 mln -33.01%), VRAY (16.28 mln -56.9%)Industrials: GE (47.2 mln -3.06%)Consumer Discretionary: F (25.15 mln -1.36%), FTCH (19.75 mln -41.42%)Information Technology: AMD (54.93 mln +0.88%), NOK (17.11 mln +0.28%), SYMC (15.56 mln +0.57%), DXC (14.71 mln -30.57%), MU (12.35 mln -3.33%), AAPL (11.43 mln -1.13%)Financials: BAC (24.44 mln -1.07%), QQQ (17.87 mln -1.5%), TQQQ (16.4 mln -4.53%), SQQQ (12.92 mln +4.48%)Energy: CHK (27.62 mln +0.34%), RIG (14.88 mln -4.15%)Consumer Staples: ABEV (16.79 mln -0.2%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: VRAY (13.64x -56.9%), NKTR (10.16x -33.01%), SIEN (4.23x +18.94%), NVRO (3.47x +16.54%)Industrials: WAIR (14.57x +6.88%)Consumer Discretionary: FTCH (10.92x -41.42%), WTRH (5.33x -62.1%), QSR (4.44x -3.09%), PLYA (3.69x -2.52%), CHUY (3.58x +10.27%)Information Technology: DXC (6.38x -30.57%), XELA (4.18x -43.08%), CISN (4.1x -23.4%), ALTR (4.07x -15.05%)Financials: PMT (7.44x -3.18%), SMFG (4.36x -1.31%)Energy: PUMP (4.6x -30.59%)Consumer Staples: PRMW (3.67x +7.05%)12:52SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: PBYI (11.1 +20.52%), SIEN (5.94 +18.94%), LXRX (1.5 +17.19%), NVRO (73.82 +16.54%), TXMD (3.04 +15.15%), TRXC (1.02 +13.33%), TRHC (66.44 +12.05%), CYRX (22.39 +10.95%), OMER (17.86 +9.5%), DVAX (3.32 +9.42%), DPLO (5.8 +9.02%)Consumer Discretionary: OSTK (24.12 +13.27%), CHUY (26.3 +10.27%), AGS (9.16 +10.17%), FRGI (10.84 +8.94%)Information Technology: APPN (50.08 +15.82%), PCTY (110.93 +9.41%)Financials: GDOT (29.92 +9.12%), GGAL (38.07 +8.93%)Energy: WFT (0.02 +9.52%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: VRAY (2.91 -56.9%), NKTR (19.81 -33.01%), AMRN (14.72 -17.35%)Industrials: VSLR (7.5 -19.35%), AAXN (57.31 -16.23%), TPC (9.32 -15.7%)Consumer Discretionary: WTRH (1.43 -62.1%), FTCH (10.69 -41.42%), MAT (11.54 -14.07%)Information Technology: XELA (1.39 -43.08%), DXC (35.86 -30.57%), CNDT (6.03 -30.37%), CISN (7.55 -23.4%), VRTU (35.83 -17.8%), ALTR (35.67 -15.05%), DBX (18.65 -13.09%)Energy: PUMP (12.04 -30.59%)12:23LLY Eli Lilly announces favorable U.S. Court of Appeals Alimta ruling (112.66 -1.31)The co announced that the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in favor of Lilly, confirming that the Alimta (pemetrexed for injection) vitamin regimen patent would be infringed by competitors that had stated their intent to market alternative salt forms of pemetrexed prior to the patent's expiration in May 2022. The ruling came in the appeals of U.S. District Court decisions in the cases of Eli Lilly and Company v. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) and Eli Lilly and Company v. Hospira (PFE). Previous rulings in Lilly's favor had precluded the generic companies from launching the alternative salt forms until the patent expires. If the patent is ultimately upheld through all remaining challenges, Alimta would maintain U.S. exclusivity until May 2022, preventing marketing of generic products for as long as the patent remains in force.12:10SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (128) outpacing new lows (110) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ACAD, AEM, AIZ, AJRD, AMT, APPN, AVP, AWK, AWR, AXS, AYX, AZN, AZUL, BAH, BAM, BLDP, BLL, BRFS, CB, CCI, CECO, CIM, CINF, CME, CMG, CMS, COLD, CTAS, CUBE, CYTK, EIX, ELS, ENPH, EQIX, ES, EXR, FLT, FMC, FNF, HAE, HCP, HIG, LHX, HSY, ICE, IDA, KGC, LAUR, LNT, MCD, MELI, MKC, MLM, MODN, NEE, NEO, NTRA, NVCR, NVRO, OAK, PCTY, PODD, PRO, PSA, QTS, RGLD, RLI, RNR, ROKU, RPM, SAM, SBAC, SEDG, SHOP, SHW, SIGI, SO, SRC, STE, STOR, SUI, SVM, SWCH, TERP, TFX, TSN, TTD, VRSK, WEC, WELL, WK, WM, WPC, WPM, EVRG, WST, WTR, ZBH, ZTS, AQN, BHK, BKT, CYRX, EIM, EMB, FNV, FTS, FWONA, FWONK, IIM, IRT, MCR, MVF, MYI, NAC, NAD, NEA, NG, NMZ, NUV, NVG, NZF, OUT, PVG, RNP, RQI, VGM, VMOStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ACRS, ADAP, AEG, AM, AMTD, AR, ASNA, ATI, AXL, B, BRKMY, BCOR, BCS, BIDU, BOX, BT, CCO, CLB, CLVS, CMA, CNDT, COMM, CRESY, CYOU, DLTH, DXC, ENBL, EROS, EXPR, EXTN, FET, FLR, GLNG, GLOG, GMLP, GRPN, GT, GVA, HBM, HIMX, HMHC, HSBC, HSC, ING, JCP, KB, KEP, KMT, KT, LXFR, LYG, M, MAC, MCFT, MIK, MMLP, MMSI, MT, NE, NINE, NKTR, ODP, OEC, OLN, PLT, PRTA, PTEN, PVH, QNST, RGR, RIG, RL, SCHW, SEMG, SIG, SMLP, SSL, SSP, TAST, TECK, TEF, TELL, TGH, TMST, TPC, TRQ, TRUE, TSE, TUSK, VNTR, VRAY, VRTU, VSTO, WETF, WFTIQ, YY, BE, CARS, CEIX, CISN, CLNC, FIXX, FTCH, JHG, KLXE, LTRPA, SDRL, TRIP, WTRH, XELAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AFB, BFK, BUI, KTF, MCA, MQY, NBB, NID, NQP, WIAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: CEA, SHG, SHI, STN, BIOBETFs that traded to 52 week highs: EMB, FXY, IYR, UREETFs that traded to 52 week lows: FXB, XES11:45SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Farfetch (FTCH) sinks following second quarter press -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersAPPN (48.93 +13.16%): Topped consensus for Q2 EPS and revs (+11.7% yr/yr to $66.9 mln); issued mixed guidance for Q3 (sees revs above consensus, EPS below); raised its FY19 revs guidance, increasing its view of both subscription and total revenue for the year.

The S&P 500 (-0.7%) reclaimed its 50-day moving average during the last few minutes of yesterday's session but the benchmark index finds itself back below that level this morning.Equity futures stumbled after yesterday's cash close, responding to a Bloomberg report, which revealed that the Department of Commerce has yet to begin issuing licenses to U.S. companies that want to resume doing business with Huawei. The decision was reportedly made after the Chinese government ordered state-owned enterprises to stop purchasing agricultural goods from the U.S.Understandably, that revelation is having the biggest impact on chipmakers. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is down 2.0%, returning into negative territory for the week (-1.8% week-to-date). The broader technology sector (-0.9%) trades at the bottom of the leaderboard, while eight out of the remaining ten sectors also trade in the red.The Russell 2000 is down 0.8%; the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.8%; the S&P 500 is down 0.7%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.5%.09:40WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Wall Street opens slightly lower, little changed for the weekThe major averages begin the day slightly lower following a big two-day comeback. The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the trade-sensitive materials (-0.6%), industrials (-0.6%), and information technology (-0.5%) sectors underperforming.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -40.00.The S&P 500 is up 0.2% for the week, but is on track to lose those slim gains at the open with the S&P 500 futures currently trading ten points, or 0.3%, below fair value.The decline in the futures could be a breather considering that the S&P 500 climbed 112 points, or 4.0%, over a two-day span.

Before this communication, the FDA had been silent as to whether it would convene an AdCom in connection with its review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. The FDA expressed, based on the timing of its recent decision to convene an AdCom, that November 14th is the earliest date on which it could hold an AdCom due to scheduling constraints for such a meeting.Accordingly, Amarin does not expect the FDA to take action on the sNDA by the previously announced September 28, 2019 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date. Amarin did not receive notice from the FDA of a PDUFA date extension. In light of the tentative AdCom date, Amarin anticipates that the PDUFA date will be extended, assuming a typical three-month extension, to a date in late December 2019. If so, this anticipated revised PDUFA date timing would offset three of the four months that were expected to be gained from FDA's earlier determination to conduct a priority review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. Prior to such determination, Amarin had expected a PDUFA goal date in January 2020, based on a standard 10-month review. Amarin plans to update the investment community after appropriately definitive information is available related to a new PDUFA date.Amarin intends to continue to move forward with its plans to double the size of its sales force to support the launch of Vascepa.

Today's rally, however, appeared to be more a continuation from yesterday's big intraday reversal that suggested the recent sharp sell-off may have been excessive.Interestingly, the S&P 500 traded just below its 50-day moving average (2934) for most of the afternoon before finally breaking above the key technical level late in the session. The benchmark index held above the level on a closing basis.All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher by at least 1.0%.

Familiar trade concerns appeared to hinder buying conviction after a three-day advance in the benchmark index.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.0%, and the Russell 2000 lost 1.3%.President Trump seemingly fed into the nagging trade angst when he told reporters that the U.S. will not be doing business with Huawei and that September trade talks could get canceled. None of these statements really surprised the market, but the prospect of U.S.-China relations further deteriorating kept some buyers sidelined on Friday.Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower, led by the energy (-1.3%) and information technology (-1.3%) sectors. Energy stocks fell despite the sharp increase in oil prices ($54.61/bbl, +$2.09, +4.0%), while the tech sector was pressured by shares of semiconductor companies, many of which derive substantial revenue from China. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 1.8%.Conversely, the defensive-oriented health care (+0.2%), real estate (+0.1%), and utilities (+0.04%) sectors were the lone sectors that finished higher.Uber (UBER 40.05, -2.92) shares fell 6.8% after the company reported a wider-than-expected $5.2 billion quarterly loss. Revenue also came up short of estimates, but today's decline simply retraced much of yesterday's 8% rally.In other corporate news, Amgen (AMGN 196.25, +11.02) shares spiked 6.0% following a positive ruling regarding its Enbrel business. DXC Technology (DXC 35.91, -15.74, -30.5%) plunged over 30% after it cut its FY20 outlook, while Dropbox (DBX 18.71, -2.75) fell 12.8% despite providing decent results and guidance.U.S. Treasuries finished slightly lower, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points each to 1.63% and 1.73%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 97.54.Reviewing Friday's lone economic report, the Producer Price Index for July:The index for final demand increased 0.2% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, excluding food and energy, decreased 0.1% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). The m/m readings left the index for final demand up 1.7% yr/yr, unchanged from June. The index remains at its lowest level since January 2017. Core PPI was up 2.1% yr/yr, down from 2.3% in June.The key takeaway from the report is that inflationary pressure remains muted.Looking ahead, Monday's economic data will be limited to the Treasury Budget for July.Nasdaq Composite +20.0% YTDS&P 500 +16.4% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +12.7% YTDRussell 2000 +12.2% YTD16:13HVT Haverty Furniture approves new $10.0 mln authorization under its common stock repurchase program and raises quarterly dividend to $0.20/share from $0.18/share (18.06 -0.30)16:05QUOT Quotient authorizes stock buyback program for up to $50.0 mln of its common stock (7.47 -0.02)15:51NVS Novartis AG: Sandoz confirms United States District Court of New Jersey ruled against it in patent litigation concerning the Sandoz biosimilar, Erelzi, for reference medicine Enbrel (90.98 -0.25)The company will appeal the ruling to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and the parties have agreed to an expedited appeal. Sandoz is the first biosimilar company to receive FDA approval for a biosimilar etanercept. Erelzi has been approved for nearly three years, however Sandoz has been unable to launch the medicine due to the ongoing patent litigation from Amgen.15:25BONDX Treasury Market SummaryStrong Week Ends on Down NoteU.S. Treasuries ended a volatile week on a lower note. Treasuries started the cash session near their flat lines after futures backed off their highs from last evening. Those highs were registered after Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration is delaying the issuance of licenses that would allow U.S. companies to continue doing business with Huawei. The first hour of the session saw a sideways drift, which was followed by a push to highs after President Trump said that next month's trade talks with officials from China could be cancelled, adding that "we will not do business with Huawei." Treasuries spent the next couple hours in a slow retreat toward their starting levels, slipping to fresh lows after White House officials clarified that President Trump's comment about not doing business with Huawei referred to federal departments only while the Commerce Department will continue processing applications for special licenses from individual companies. Treasuries finished the day on lows, with the 10-yr yield narrowing this week's decline to 12 basis points. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.1% to 97.51, surrendering 0.6% for the week.

The benchmark index is down 1.0% with noticeable weakness in the semiconductor stocks.The Nasdaq Composite is down 1.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 is down 1.4%.President Trump told reporters today that the U.S. will not be doing business with Huawei, which seemed to confirm a Bloomberg report yesterday that the U.S. Commerce Department has been refraining from approving business licenses to work with the Chinese company. The president added that September trade talks could get canceled but are still scheduled for the time being.None of these events has been too surprising for investors, but the prospect of U.S.-China relations further deteriorating has contributed to a steady broad-based decline today.All 11 S&P 500 sectors are down, including eight with losses of at least 1.0%. The information technology sector (-1.5%) is underperforming amid the trade uncertainty, which has also made a noticeable impact on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-2.0%). Many semiconductor companies are heavily exposed to China.Uber (UBER 39.72, -3.23) shares have dropped 7.5% after the company reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss of $5.2 billion. Revenue also missed estimates, but today's loss has simply given back a bulk of yesterday's 8% rally.In other earnings news, shares of DXC Technology (DXC 35.74, -15.90, -30.8%) have plunged over 30% after the company cut its FY20 outlook, while shares of Activision Blizzard (ATVI 47.56, -1.78, -3.6%) trade lower as investors remain underwhelmed by its downside Q3 guidance.The U.S. Treasury market, which has drawn plenty of attention this week, has been muted. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.70%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.2% to 97.43. Interestingly, despite the growth concerns, WTI crude is up 3.7%, or $1.94, to $54.48/bbl.Reviewing today's lone economic report, the Producer Price Index for July:The index for final demand increased 0.2% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, excluding food and energy, decreased 0.1% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%).

The ruling came in the appeals of U.S. District Court decisions in the cases of Eli Lilly and Company v. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) and Eli Lilly and Company v. Hospira (PFE). Previous rulings in Lilly's favor had precluded the generic companies from launching the alternative salt forms until the patent expires. If the patent is ultimately upheld through all remaining challenges, Alimta would maintain U.S. exclusivity until May 2022, preventing marketing of generic products for as long as the patent remains in force.12:10SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (128) outpacing new lows (110) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ACAD, AEM, AIZ, AJRD, AMT, APPN, AVP, AWK, AWR, AXS, AYX, AZN, AZUL, BAH, BAM, BLDP, BLL, BRFS, CB, CCI, CECO, CIM, CINF, CME, CMG, CMS, COLD, CTAS, CUBE, CYTK, EIX, ELS, ENPH, EQIX, ES, EXR, FLT, FMC, FNF, HAE, HCP, HIG, LHX, HSY, ICE, IDA, KGC, LAUR, LNT, MCD, MELI, MKC, MLM, MODN, NEE, NEO, NTRA, NVCR, NVRO, OAK, PCTY, PODD, PRO, PSA, QTS, RGLD, RLI, RNR, ROKU, RPM, SAM, SBAC, SEDG, SHOP, SHW, SIGI, SO, SRC, STE, STOR, SUI, SVM, SWCH, TERP, TFX, TSN, TTD, VRSK, WEC, WELL, WK, WM, WPC, WPM, EVRG, WST, WTR, ZBH, ZTS, AQN, BHK, BKT, CYRX, EIM, EMB, FNV, FTS, FWONA, FWONK, IIM, IRT, MCR, MVF, MYI, NAC, NAD, NEA, NG, NMZ, NUV, NVG, NZF, OUT, PVG, RNP, RQI, VGM, VMOStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ACRS, ADAP, AEG, AM, AMTD, AR, ASNA, ATI, AXL, B, BRKMY, BCOR, BCS, BIDU, BOX, BT, CCO, CLB, CLVS, CMA, CNDT, COMM, CRESY, CYOU, DLTH, DXC, ENBL, EROS, EXPR, EXTN, FET, FLR, GLNG, GLOG, GMLP, GRPN, GT, GVA, HBM, HIMX, HMHC, HSBC, HSC, ING, JCP, KB, KEP, KMT, KT, LXFR, LYG, M, MAC, MCFT, MIK, MMLP, MMSI, MT, NE, NINE, NKTR, ODP, OEC, OLN, PLT, PRTA, PTEN, PVH, QNST, RGR, RIG, RL, SCHW, SEMG, SIG, SMLP, SSL, SSP, TAST, TECK, TEF, TELL, TGH, TMST, TPC, TRQ, TRUE, TSE, TUSK, VNTR, VRAY, VRTU, VSTO, WETF, WFTIQ, YY, BE, CARS, CEIX, CISN, CLNC, FIXX, FTCH, JHG, KLXE, LTRPA, SDRL, TRIP, WTRH, XELAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AFB, BFK, BUI, KTF, MCA, MQY, NBB, NID, NQP, WIAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: CEA, SHG, SHI, STN, BIOBETFs that traded to 52 week highs: EMB, FXY, IYR, UREETFs that traded to 52 week lows: FXB, XES11:45SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Farfetch (FTCH) sinks following second quarter press -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersAPPN (48.93 +13.16%): Topped consensus for Q2 EPS and revs (+11.7% yr/yr to $66.9 mln); issued mixed guidance for Q3 (sees revs above consensus, EPS below); raised its FY19 revs guidance, increasing its view of both subscription and total revenue for the year.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -40.00.The S&P 500 is up 0.2% for the week, but is on track to lose those slim gains at the open with the S&P 500 futures currently trading ten points, or 0.3%, below fair value.The decline in the futures could be a breather considering that the S&P 500 climbed 112 points, or 4.0%, over a two-day span. Of course, that advance followed a sharp sell-off that had many market participants blaming trade tensions, which are not helpful for economic growth prospects. In either case, the decline is modest and futures do not necessarily predict intraday action.Uber (UBER 40.12, -2.85, -6.7%) shares rose over 8% yesterday heading into its earnings report, which included a $5.2 billion quarterly loss.

Biktarvy combines the novel, unboosted integrase strand transfer inhibitor bictegravir with the demonstrated safety and efficacy profile of the Descovy dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone and is the smallest INSTI-based triple-therapy STR available. In China, Biktarvy is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults without present or past evidence of viral resistance to the integrase inhibitor class, emtricitabine or tenofovir.The approval of Biktarvy is supported by data from four ongoing Phase 3 studies: Studies 1489 and 1490 in treatment-nave HIV-1 infected adults, and Studies 1844 and 1878 in virologically suppressed adults. The trials are comprised of a diverse population of 2,414 participants on Biktarvy or an active comparator regimen, including a wide range of adult age groups and races/ethnicities. Biktarvy met its primary efficacy objective of non-inferiority at 48 weeks across all four studies.Biktarvy received marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Commission in 2018. In the United States, Biktarvy has a Boxed Warning in its product label regarding the risk of post-treatment acute exacerbation of hepatitis B.

Before this communication, the FDA had been silent as to whether it would convene an AdCom in connection with its review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. The FDA expressed, based on the timing of its recent decision to convene an AdCom, that November 14th is the earliest date on which it could hold an AdCom due to scheduling constraints for such a meeting.Accordingly, Amarin does not expect the FDA to take action on the sNDA by the previously announced September 28, 2019 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date. Amarin did not receive notice from the FDA of a PDUFA date extension. In light of the tentative AdCom date, Amarin anticipates that the PDUFA date will be extended, assuming a typical three-month extension, to a date in late December 2019. If so, this anticipated revised PDUFA date timing would offset three of the four months that were expected to be gained from FDA's earlier determination to conduct a priority review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. Prior to such determination, Amarin had expected a PDUFA goal date in January 2020, based on a standard 10-month review. Amarin plans to update the investment community after appropriately definitive information is available related to a new PDUFA date.Amarin intends to continue to move forward with its plans to double the size of its sales force to support the launch of Vascepa. Amarin plans to use the anticipated three-month delay in the PDUFA clock to better prepare for the assumed launch of Vascepa including more time to hire and train new sales representatives. To the extent that new sales managers and representatives are hired prior to the expanded label for Vascepa, Amarin intends to have them join the company's existing sales team in promoting Vascepa based on its current indication and existing promotional messaging.16:30EB Eventbrite appoints Lanny Baker as CFO, effective September 3 (17.49 +0.73)Mr. Baker joins Eventbrite from Yelp (YELP) where as CFO he oversaw corporate finance, accounting, investor relations and workplace functions.

Such an increase in the supply of ships, especially in a segment with a total of 118 vessels on the water and with more than half trading under time charters, has restricted handysize market rates from increasing alongside other sectors.

The S&P 500 advanced 1.9%, which extended its two-day comeback to 112 points, or 4.0%, from its session low on Wednesday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 1.4%, the Nasdaq Composite increased 2.2%, and the Russell 2000 increased 2.1%.Thursday's positive disposition ostensibly formed overnight after China reported a surprise yr/yr increase in July exports while holding its yuan firm, which again signaled goodwill in trade relations. Today's rally, however, appeared to be more a continuation from yesterday's big intraday reversal that suggested the recent sharp sell-off may have been excessive.Interestingly, the S&P 500 traded just below its 50-day moving average (2934) for most of the afternoon before finally breaking above the key technical level late in the session. The benchmark index held above the level on a closing basis.All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher by at least 1.0%. The energy sector (+2.9%) led the advance as oil prices ($52.52/bbl, +$1.38, +2.7%) rebounded, followed by the information technology (+2.4%), communication services (+2.2%), and consumer discretionary (+2.0%) sectors.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 33.92, +4.73, +16.2%) led the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+2.7%) higher after it unveiled its well-received server CPUs that Google and Twitter will reportedly use. Broadcom (AVGO 270.98, +0.93, +0.3%) struggled to participate in the chip rally amid news that it is close to purchasing Symantec's (SYMC 22.92, +2.51, +12.3%) enterprise business for about $10 billion.In earnings news, Booking Holdings (BKNG 1941.01, +119.45, +6.6%), Lyft (LYFT 62.10, +1.81, +3.0%), and Roku (ROKU 122.03, +21.06, +20.9%) outperformed the broader market following positive results and/or upbeat guidance. Kraft Heinz (KHC 28.22, -2.65, -8.6%) disappointed investors with its results.U.S. Treasuries were under noticeable selling pressure today, which sent the 10-yr yield up 11 basis points to 1.79% at one point during the session. Buyers gradually came back, ultimately leaving the benchmark yield up three basis points to 1.72%. The 2-yr yield finished also finished three basis points higher at 1.61%.

Continuing claims for the week ending July 27 decreased by 15,000 to 1.684 mln.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims continue hovering near multi-decade lows.Wholesale inventories were unchanged in June (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%) on top of an unrevised 0.4% increase in May. Wholesale sales decreased 0.3% in June after decreasing a revised 0.6% (from +0.1%) in May.The key takeaway from the June report and the May revision is that the gap between inventory growth and sales growth is widening, which should exert some pressure on prices.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for July on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +21.2% YTDS&P 500 +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +13.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.1% YTD16:21TSE Trinseo misses by $0.45, misses on revs; guides FY19 EPS below consensus (35.00 +1.81)Reports Q2 (Jun) earnings of $0.99 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.45 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.44; revenues fell 23.0% year/year to $951.8 mln vs the $1.07 bln two analyst estimate.Latex Binders net sales of $230 million for the quarter decreased 18% versus prior year due mainly to the pass through of lower raw material costs.Performance Plastics net sales of $347 million for the quarter were 16% below prior year due mainly to lower prices from the pass through of lower raw material costs.Co issues downside guidance for FY19, sees EPS of $4.15-4.86, excluding non-recurring items, vs. $5.54 S&P Capital IQ Consensus.16:20ROAD Construction Partners beats by $0.04, misses on revs (14.02 +0.20)Reports Q3 (Jun) earnings of $0.33 per share, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.29; revenues rose 16.5% year/year to $227.3 mln vs the $229.67 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Project backlog at June 30, 2019 was $581.1 mln.Adjusted EBITDA was $31.3 mln, up 37.9%.16:19PBYI Puma Biotech. beats by $0.32, reports revs in-line (9.21 +0.40)Reports Q2 (Jun) loss of $0.57 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.32 better than the single analyst estimate of ($0.89); revenues rose 6.1% year/year to $53.9 mln vs the $53.4 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Net NERLYNX revenue in the second quarter of 2019 was $53.8 million, compared to net NERLYNX revenue of $50.8 million in the second quarter of 2018."We anticipate the following key milestones during the remainder of 2019: (i) meeting with the FDA to discuss the clinical development and regulatory strategy for the SUMMIT trial in the third quarter of 2019; (ii) reporting additional data from the Phase II CONTROL trial in the fourth quarter of 2019; and (iii) receiving regulatory decisions for the extended adjuvant HER2-positive early stage breast cancer indication in additional countries."16:19DXC DXC Technology beats by $0.03, reports revs in-line (51.65 +1.76)Reports Q1 (Jun) earnings of $1.74 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.71; revenues fell 7.4% year/year to $4.89 bln vs the $4.86 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.16:18NRZ New Residential Investment prices $250 mln underwritten public offering of 10,000,000 shares of 7.125% Series B Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (15.27 +0.21)The company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for investments and general corporate purposes.16:18AIMT Aimmune Therapeutics misses by $0.08 (19.34 +0.24)Reports Q2 (Jun) loss of $1.01 per share, $0.08 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.93).Cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $250.3 million on June 30, 2019, compared to $303.9 million on December 31, 2018.

Familiar trade concerns appeared to hinder buying conviction after a three-day advance in the benchmark index.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.0%, and the Russell 2000 lost 1.3%.President Trump seemingly fed into the nagging trade angst when he told reporters that the U.S. will not be doing business with Huawei and that September trade talks could get canceled. None of these statements really surprised the market, but the prospect of U.S.-China relations further deteriorating kept some buyers sidelined on Friday.Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower, led by the energy (-1.3%) and information technology (-1.3%) sectors. Energy stocks fell despite the sharp increase in oil prices ($54.61/bbl, +$2.09, +4.0%), while the tech sector was pressured by shares of semiconductor companies, many of which derive substantial revenue from China. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 1.8%.Conversely, the defensive-oriented health care (+0.2%), real estate (+0.1%), and utilities (+0.04%) sectors were the lone sectors that finished higher.Uber (UBER 40.05, -2.92) shares fell 6.8% after the company reported a wider-than-expected $5.2 billion quarterly loss. Revenue also came up short of estimates, but today's decline simply retraced much of yesterday's 8% rally.In other corporate news, Amgen (AMGN 196.25, +11.02) shares spiked 6.0% following a positive ruling regarding its Enbrel business. DXC Technology (DXC 35.91, -15.74, -30.5%) plunged over 30% after it cut its FY20 outlook, while Dropbox (DBX 18.71, -2.75) fell 12.8% despite providing decent results and guidance.U.S. Treasuries finished slightly lower, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points each to 1.63% and 1.73%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 97.54.Reviewing Friday's lone economic report, the Producer Price Index for July:The index for final demand increased 0.2% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, excluding food and energy, decreased 0.1% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). The m/m readings left the index for final demand up 1.7% yr/yr, unchanged from June. The index remains at its lowest level since January 2017. Core PPI was up 2.1% yr/yr, down from 2.3% in June.The key takeaway from the report is that inflationary pressure remains muted.Looking ahead, Monday's economic data will be limited to the Treasury Budget for July.Nasdaq Composite +20.0% YTDS&P 500 +16.4% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +12.7% YTDRussell 2000 +12.2% YTD16:13HVT Haverty Furniture approves new $10.0 mln authorization under its common stock repurchase program and raises quarterly dividend to $0.20/share from $0.18/share (18.06 -0.30)16:05QUOT Quotient authorizes stock buyback program for up to $50.0 mln of its common stock (7.47 -0.02)15:51NVS Novartis AG: Sandoz confirms United States District Court of New Jersey ruled against it in patent litigation concerning the Sandoz biosimilar, Erelzi, for reference medicine Enbrel (90.98 -0.25)The company will appeal the ruling to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and the parties have agreed to an expedited appeal.

Erelzi has been approved for nearly three years, however Sandoz has been unable to launch the medicine due to the ongoing patent litigation from Amgen.15:25BONDX Treasury Market SummaryStrong Week Ends on Down NoteU.S. Treasuries ended a volatile week on a lower note. Treasuries started the cash session near their flat lines after futures backed off their highs from last evening. Those highs were registered after Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration is delaying the issuance of licenses that would allow U.S. companies to continue doing business with Huawei. The first hour of the session saw a sideways drift, which was followed by a push to highs after President Trump said that next month's trade talks with officials from China could be cancelled, adding that "we will not do business with Huawei." Treasuries spent the next couple hours in a slow retreat toward their starting levels, slipping to fresh lows after White House officials clarified that President Trump's comment about not doing business with Huawei referred to federal departments only while the Commerce Department will continue processing applications for special licenses from individual companies. Treasuries finished the day on lows, with the 10-yr yield narrowing this week's decline to 12 basis points. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.1% to 97.51, surrendering 0.6% for the week.

The benchmark index is down 1.0% with noticeable weakness in the semiconductor stocks.The Nasdaq Composite is down 1.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 is down 1.4%.President Trump told reporters today that the U.S. will not be doing business with Huawei, which seemed to confirm a Bloomberg report yesterday that the U.S. Commerce Department has been refraining from approving business licenses to work with the Chinese company. The president added that September trade talks could get canceled but are still scheduled for the time being.None of these events has been too surprising for investors, but the prospect of U.S.-China relations further deteriorating has contributed to a steady broad-based decline today.All 11 S&P 500 sectors are down, including eight with losses of at least 1.0%. The information technology sector (-1.5%) is underperforming amid the trade uncertainty, which has also made a noticeable impact on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-2.0%). Many semiconductor companies are heavily exposed to China.Uber (UBER 39.72, -3.23) shares have dropped 7.5% after the company reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss of $5.2 billion. Revenue also missed estimates, but today's loss has simply given back a bulk of yesterday's 8% rally.In other earnings news, shares of DXC Technology (DXC 35.74, -15.90, -30.8%) have plunged over 30% after the company cut its FY20 outlook, while shares of Activision Blizzard (ATVI 47.56, -1.78, -3.6%) trade lower as investors remain underwhelmed by its downside Q3 guidance.The U.S. Treasury market, which has drawn plenty of attention this week, has been muted. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.70%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.2% to 97.43. Interestingly, despite the growth concerns, WTI crude is up 3.7%, or $1.94, to $54.48/bbl.Reviewing today's lone economic report, the Producer Price Index for July:The index for final demand increased 0.2% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, excluding food and energy, decreased 0.1% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). The m/m readings left the index for final demand up 1.7% yr/yr, unchanged from June. The index remains at its lowest level since January 2017. Core PPI was up 2.1% yr/yr, down from 2.3% in June.The key takeaway from the report is that inflationary pressure remains muted.12:53SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: AMRN (20.82 mln -17.35%), NKTR (16.72 mln -33.01%), VRAY (16.28 mln -56.9%)Industrials: GE (47.2 mln -3.06%)Consumer Discretionary: F (25.15 mln -1.36%), FTCH (19.75 mln -41.42%)Information Technology: AMD (54.93 mln +0.88%), NOK (17.11 mln +0.28%), SYMC (15.56 mln +0.57%), DXC (14.71 mln -30.57%), MU (12.35 mln -3.33%), AAPL (11.43 mln -1.13%)Financials: BAC (24.44 mln -1.07%), QQQ (17.87 mln -1.5%), TQQQ (16.4 mln -4.53%), SQQQ (12.92 mln +4.48%)Energy: CHK (27.62 mln +0.34%), RIG (14.88 mln -4.15%)Consumer Staples: ABEV (16.79 mln -0.2%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: VRAY (13.64x -56.9%), NKTR (10.16x -33.01%), SIEN (4.23x +18.94%), NVRO (3.47x +16.54%)Industrials: WAIR (14.57x +6.88%)Consumer Discretionary: FTCH (10.92x -41.42%), WTRH (5.33x -62.1%), QSR (4.44x -3.09%), PLYA (3.69x -2.52%), CHUY (3.58x +10.27%)Information Technology: DXC (6.38x -30.57%), XELA (4.18x -43.08%), CISN (4.1x -23.4%), ALTR (4.07x -15.05%)Financials: PMT (7.44x -3.18%), SMFG (4.36x -1.31%)Energy: PUMP (4.6x -30.59%)Consumer Staples: PRMW (3.67x +7.05%)12:52SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: PBYI (11.1 +20.52%), SIEN (5.94 +18.94%), LXRX (1.5 +17.19%), NVRO (73.82 +16.54%), TXMD (3.04 +15.15%), TRXC (1.02 +13.33%), TRHC (66.44 +12.05%), CYRX (22.39 +10.95%), OMER (17.86 +9.5%), DVAX (3.32 +9.42%), DPLO (5.8 +9.02%)Consumer Discretionary: OSTK (24.12 +13.27%), CHUY (26.3 +10.27%), AGS (9.16 +10.17%), FRGI (10.84 +8.94%)Information Technology: APPN (50.08 +15.82%), PCTY (110.93 +9.41%)Financials: GDOT (29.92 +9.12%), GGAL (38.07 +8.93%)Energy: WFT (0.02 +9.52%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: VRAY (2.91 -56.9%), NKTR (19.81 -33.01%), AMRN (14.72 -17.35%)Industrials: VSLR (7.5 -19.35%), AAXN (57.31 -16.23%), TPC (9.32 -15.7%)Consumer Discretionary: WTRH (1.43 -62.1%), FTCH (10.69 -41.42%), MAT (11.54 -14.07%)Information Technology: XELA (1.39 -43.08%), DXC (35.86 -30.57%), CNDT (6.03 -30.37%), CISN (7.55 -23.4%), VRTU (35.83 -17.8%), ALTR (35.67 -15.05%), DBX (18.65 -13.09%)Energy: PUMP (12.04 -30.59%)12:23LLY Eli Lilly announces favorable U.S. Court of Appeals Alimta ruling (112.66 -1.31)The co announced that the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in favor of Lilly, confirming that the Alimta (pemetrexed for injection) vitamin regimen patent would be infringed by competitors that had stated their intent to market alternative salt forms of pemetrexed prior to the patent's expiration in May 2022. The ruling came in the appeals of U.S. District Court decisions in the cases of Eli Lilly and Company v. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) and Eli Lilly and Company v. Hospira (PFE). Previous rulings in Lilly's favor had precluded the generic companies from launching the alternative salt forms until the patent expires. If the patent is ultimately upheld through all remaining challenges, Alimta would maintain U.S. exclusivity until May 2022, preventing marketing of generic products for as long as the patent remains in force.12:10SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (128) outpacing new lows (110) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ACAD, AEM, AIZ, AJRD, AMT, APPN, AVP, AWK, AWR, AXS, AYX, AZN, AZUL, BAH, BAM, BLDP, BLL, BRFS, CB, CCI, CECO, CIM, CINF, CME, CMG, CMS, COLD, CTAS, CUBE, CYTK, EIX, ELS, ENPH, EQIX, ES, EXR, FLT, FMC, FNF, HAE, HCP, HIG, LHX, HSY, ICE, IDA, KGC, LAUR, LNT, MCD, MELI, MKC, MLM, MODN, NEE, NEO, NTRA, NVCR, NVRO, OAK, PCTY, PODD, PRO, PSA, QTS, RGLD, RLI, RNR, ROKU, RPM, SAM, SBAC, SEDG, SHOP, SHW, SIGI, SO, SRC, STE, STOR, SUI, SVM, SWCH, TERP, TFX, TSN, TTD, VRSK, WEC, WELL, WK, WM, WPC, WPM, EVRG, WST, WTR, ZBH, ZTS, AQN, BHK, BKT, CYRX, EIM, EMB, FNV, FTS, FWONA, FWONK, IIM, IRT, MCR, MVF, MYI, NAC, NAD, NEA, NG, NMZ, NUV, NVG, NZF, OUT, PVG, RNP, RQI, VGM, VMOStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ACRS, ADAP, AEG, AM, AMTD, AR, ASNA, ATI, AXL, B, BRKMY, BCOR, BCS, BIDU, BOX, BT, CCO, CLB, CLVS, CMA, CNDT, COMM, CRESY, CYOU, DLTH, DXC, ENBL, EROS, EXPR, EXTN, FET, FLR, GLNG, GLOG, GMLP, GRPN, GT, GVA, HBM, HIMX, HMHC, HSBC, HSC, ING, JCP, KB, KEP, KMT, KT, LXFR, LYG, M, MAC, MCFT, MIK, MMLP, MMSI, MT, NE, NINE, NKTR, ODP, OEC, OLN, PLT, PRTA, PTEN, PVH, QNST, RGR, RIG, RL, SCHW, SEMG, SIG, SMLP, SSL, SSP, TAST, TECK, TEF, TELL, TGH, TMST, TPC, TRQ, TRUE, TSE, TUSK, VNTR, VRAY, VRTU, VSTO, WETF, WFTIQ, YY, BE, CARS, CEIX, CISN, CLNC, FIXX, FTCH, JHG, KLXE, LTRPA, SDRL, TRIP, WTRH, XELAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AFB, BFK, BUI, KTF, MCA, MQY, NBB, NID, NQP, WIAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: CEA, SHG, SHI, STN, BIOBETFs that traded to 52 week highs: EMB, FXY, IYR, UREETFs that traded to 52 week lows: FXB, XES11:45SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Farfetch (FTCH) sinks following second quarter press -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersAPPN (48.93 +13.16%): Topped consensus for Q2 EPS and revs (+11.7% yr/yr to $66.9 mln); issued mixed guidance for Q3 (sees revs above consensus, EPS below); raised its FY19 revs guidance, increasing its view of both subscription and total revenue for the year.

The S&P 500 (-0.7%) reclaimed its 50-day moving average during the last few minutes of yesterday's session but the benchmark index finds itself back below that level this morning.Equity futures stumbled after yesterday's cash close, responding to a Bloomberg report, which revealed that the Department of Commerce has yet to begin issuing licenses to U.S. companies that want to resume doing business with Huawei. The decision was reportedly made after the Chinese government ordered state-owned enterprises to stop purchasing agricultural goods from the U.S.Understandably, that revelation is having the biggest impact on chipmakers. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is down 2.0%, returning into negative territory for the week (-1.8% week-to-date). The broader technology sector (-0.9%) trades at the bottom of the leaderboard, while eight out of the remaining ten sectors also trade in the red.The Russell 2000 is down 0.8%; the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.8%; the S&P 500 is down 0.7%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.5%.09:40WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Wall Street opens slightly lower, little changed for the weekThe major averages begin the day slightly lower following a big two-day comeback. The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the trade-sensitive materials (-0.6%), industrials (-0.6%), and information technology (-0.5%) sectors underperforming.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -40.00.The S&P 500 is up 0.2% for the week, but is on track to lose those slim gains at the open with the S&P 500 futures currently trading ten points, or 0.3%, below fair value.The decline in the futures could be a breather considering that the S&P 500 climbed 112 points, or 4.0%, over a two-day span.

Before this communication, the FDA had been silent as to whether it would convene an AdCom in connection with its review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. The FDA expressed, based on the timing of its recent decision to convene an AdCom, that November 14th is the earliest date on which it could hold an AdCom due to scheduling constraints for such a meeting.Accordingly, Amarin does not expect the FDA to take action on the sNDA by the previously announced September 28, 2019 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date. Amarin did not receive notice from the FDA of a PDUFA date extension. In light of the tentative AdCom date, Amarin anticipates that the PDUFA date will be extended, assuming a typical three-month extension, to a date in late December 2019. If so, this anticipated revised PDUFA date timing would offset three of the four months that were expected to be gained from FDA's earlier determination to conduct a priority review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. Prior to such determination, Amarin had expected a PDUFA goal date in January 2020, based on a standard 10-month review. Amarin plans to update the investment community after appropriately definitive information is available related to a new PDUFA date.Amarin intends to continue to move forward with its plans to double the size of its sales force to support the launch of Vascepa.

Today's rally, however, appeared to be more a continuation from yesterday's big intraday reversal that suggested the recent sharp sell-off may have been excessive.Interestingly, the S&P 500 traded just below its 50-day moving average (2934) for most of the afternoon before finally breaking above the key technical level late in the session. The benchmark index held above the level on a closing basis.All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher by at least 1.0%.

Familiar trade concerns appeared to hinder buying conviction after a three-day advance in the benchmark index.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.0%, and the Russell 2000 lost 1.3%.President Trump seemingly fed into the nagging trade angst when he told reporters that the U.S. will not be doing business with Huawei and that September trade talks could get canceled. None of these statements really surprised the market, but the prospect of U.S.-China relations further deteriorating kept some buyers sidelined on Friday.Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower, led by the energy (-1.3%) and information technology (-1.3%) sectors. Energy stocks fell despite the sharp increase in oil prices ($54.61/bbl, +$2.09, +4.0%), while the tech sector was pressured by shares of semiconductor companies, many of which derive substantial revenue from China. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 1.8%.Conversely, the defensive-oriented health care (+0.2%), real estate (+0.1%), and utilities (+0.04%) sectors were the lone sectors that finished higher.Uber (UBER 40.05, -2.92) shares fell 6.8% after the company reported a wider-than-expected $5.2 billion quarterly loss. Revenue also came up short of estimates, but today's decline simply retraced much of yesterday's 8% rally.In other corporate news, Amgen (AMGN 196.25, +11.02) shares spiked 6.0% following a positive ruling regarding its Enbrel business. DXC Technology (DXC 35.91, -15.74, -30.5%) plunged over 30% after it cut its FY20 outlook, while Dropbox (DBX 18.71, -2.75) fell 12.8% despite providing decent results and guidance.U.S. Treasuries finished slightly lower, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points each to 1.63% and 1.73%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 97.54.Reviewing Friday's lone economic report, the Producer Price Index for July:The index for final demand increased 0.2% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, excluding food and energy, decreased 0.1% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). The m/m readings left the index for final demand up 1.7% yr/yr, unchanged from June. The index remains at its lowest level since January 2017. Core PPI was up 2.1% yr/yr, down from 2.3% in June.The key takeaway from the report is that inflationary pressure remains muted.Looking ahead, Monday's economic data will be limited to the Treasury Budget for July.Nasdaq Composite +20.0% YTDS&P 500 +16.4% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +12.7% YTDRussell 2000 +12.2% YTD16:13HVT Haverty Furniture approves new $10.0 mln authorization under its common stock repurchase program and raises quarterly dividend to $0.20/share from $0.18/share (18.06 -0.30)16:05QUOT Quotient authorizes stock buyback program for up to $50.0 mln of its common stock (7.47 -0.02)15:51NVS Novartis AG: Sandoz confirms United States District Court of New Jersey ruled against it in patent litigation concerning the Sandoz biosimilar, Erelzi, for reference medicine Enbrel (90.98 -0.25)The company will appeal the ruling to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and the parties have agreed to an expedited appeal. Sandoz is the first biosimilar company to receive FDA approval for a biosimilar etanercept. Erelzi has been approved for nearly three years, however Sandoz has been unable to launch the medicine due to the ongoing patent litigation from Amgen.15:25BONDX Treasury Market SummaryStrong Week Ends on Down NoteU.S. Treasuries ended a volatile week on a lower note. Treasuries started the cash session near their flat lines after futures backed off their highs from last evening. Those highs were registered after Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration is delaying the issuance of licenses that would allow U.S. companies to continue doing business with Huawei. The first hour of the session saw a sideways drift, which was followed by a push to highs after President Trump said that next month's trade talks with officials from China could be cancelled, adding that "we will not do business with Huawei." Treasuries spent the next couple hours in a slow retreat toward their starting levels, slipping to fresh lows after White House officials clarified that President Trump's comment about not doing business with Huawei referred to federal departments only while the Commerce Department will continue processing applications for special licenses from individual companies. Treasuries finished the day on lows, with the 10-yr yield narrowing this week's decline to 12 basis points. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.1% to 97.51, surrendering 0.6% for the week.

The benchmark index is down 1.0% with noticeable weakness in the semiconductor stocks.The Nasdaq Composite is down 1.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 is down 1.4%.President Trump told reporters today that the U.S. will not be doing business with Huawei, which seemed to confirm a Bloomberg report yesterday that the U.S. Commerce Department has been refraining from approving business licenses to work with the Chinese company. The president added that September trade talks could get canceled but are still scheduled for the time being.None of these events has been too surprising for investors, but the prospect of U.S.-China relations further deteriorating has contributed to a steady broad-based decline today.All 11 S&P 500 sectors are down, including eight with losses of at least 1.0%. The information technology sector (-1.5%) is underperforming amid the trade uncertainty, which has also made a noticeable impact on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-2.0%). Many semiconductor companies are heavily exposed to China.Uber (UBER 39.72, -3.23) shares have dropped 7.5% after the company reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss of $5.2 billion. Revenue also missed estimates, but today's loss has simply given back a bulk of yesterday's 8% rally.In other earnings news, shares of DXC Technology (DXC 35.74, -15.90, -30.8%) have plunged over 30% after the company cut its FY20 outlook, while shares of Activision Blizzard (ATVI 47.56, -1.78, -3.6%) trade lower as investors remain underwhelmed by its downside Q3 guidance.The U.S. Treasury market, which has drawn plenty of attention this week, has been muted. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.70%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.2% to 97.43. Interestingly, despite the growth concerns, WTI crude is up 3.7%, or $1.94, to $54.48/bbl.Reviewing today's lone economic report, the Producer Price Index for July:The index for final demand increased 0.2% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, excluding food and energy, decreased 0.1% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%).

The ruling came in the appeals of U.S. District Court decisions in the cases of Eli Lilly and Company v. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) and Eli Lilly and Company v. Hospira (PFE). Previous rulings in Lilly's favor had precluded the generic companies from launching the alternative salt forms until the patent expires. If the patent is ultimately upheld through all remaining challenges, Alimta would maintain U.S. exclusivity until May 2022, preventing marketing of generic products for as long as the patent remains in force.12:10SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (128) outpacing new lows (110) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ACAD, AEM, AIZ, AJRD, AMT, APPN, AVP, AWK, AWR, AXS, AYX, AZN, AZUL, BAH, BAM, BLDP, BLL, BRFS, CB, CCI, CECO, CIM, CINF, CME, CMG, CMS, COLD, CTAS, CUBE, CYTK, EIX, ELS, ENPH, EQIX, ES, EXR, FLT, FMC, FNF, HAE, HCP, HIG, LHX, HSY, ICE, IDA, KGC, LAUR, LNT, MCD, MELI, MKC, MLM, MODN, NEE, NEO, NTRA, NVCR, NVRO, OAK, PCTY, PODD, PRO, PSA, QTS, RGLD, RLI, RNR, ROKU, RPM, SAM, SBAC, SEDG, SHOP, SHW, SIGI, SO, SRC, STE, STOR, SUI, SVM, SWCH, TERP, TFX, TSN, TTD, VRSK, WEC, WELL, WK, WM, WPC, WPM, EVRG, WST, WTR, ZBH, ZTS, AQN, BHK, BKT, CYRX, EIM, EMB, FNV, FTS, FWONA, FWONK, IIM, IRT, MCR, MVF, MYI, NAC, NAD, NEA, NG, NMZ, NUV, NVG, NZF, OUT, PVG, RNP, RQI, VGM, VMOStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ACRS, ADAP, AEG, AM, AMTD, AR, ASNA, ATI, AXL, B, BRKMY, BCOR, BCS, BIDU, BOX, BT, CCO, CLB, CLVS, CMA, CNDT, COMM, CRESY, CYOU, DLTH, DXC, ENBL, EROS, EXPR, EXTN, FET, FLR, GLNG, GLOG, GMLP, GRPN, GT, GVA, HBM, HIMX, HMHC, HSBC, HSC, ING, JCP, KB, KEP, KMT, KT, LXFR, LYG, M, MAC, MCFT, MIK, MMLP, MMSI, MT, NE, NINE, NKTR, ODP, OEC, OLN, PLT, PRTA, PTEN, PVH, QNST, RGR, RIG, RL, SCHW, SEMG, SIG, SMLP, SSL, SSP, TAST, TECK, TEF, TELL, TGH, TMST, TPC, TRQ, TRUE, TSE, TUSK, VNTR, VRAY, VRTU, VSTO, WETF, WFTIQ, YY, BE, CARS, CEIX, CISN, CLNC, FIXX, FTCH, JHG, KLXE, LTRPA, SDRL, TRIP, WTRH, XELAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AFB, BFK, BUI, KTF, MCA, MQY, NBB, NID, NQP, WIAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: CEA, SHG, SHI, STN, BIOBETFs that traded to 52 week highs: EMB, FXY, IYR, UREETFs that traded to 52 week lows: FXB, XES11:45SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Farfetch (FTCH) sinks following second quarter press -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersAPPN (48.93 +13.16%): Topped consensus for Q2 EPS and revs (+11.7% yr/yr to $66.9 mln); issued mixed guidance for Q3 (sees revs above consensus, EPS below); raised its FY19 revs guidance, increasing its view of both subscription and total revenue for the year.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -40.00.The S&P 500 is up 0.2% for the week, but is on track to lose those slim gains at the open with the S&P 500 futures currently trading ten points, or 0.3%, below fair value.The decline in the futures could be a breather considering that the S&P 500 climbed 112 points, or 4.0%, over a two-day span. Of course, that advance followed a sharp sell-off that had many market participants blaming trade tensions, which are not helpful for economic growth prospects. In either case, the decline is modest and futures do not necessarily predict intraday action.Uber (UBER 40.12, -2.85, -6.7%) shares rose over 8% yesterday heading into its earnings report, which included a $5.2 billion quarterly loss.

Biktarvy combines the novel, unboosted integrase strand transfer inhibitor bictegravir with the demonstrated safety and efficacy profile of the Descovy dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone and is the smallest INSTI-based triple-therapy STR available. In China, Biktarvy is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults without present or past evidence of viral resistance to the integrase inhibitor class, emtricitabine or tenofovir.The approval of Biktarvy is supported by data from four ongoing Phase 3 studies: Studies 1489 and 1490 in treatment-nave HIV-1 infected adults, and Studies 1844 and 1878 in virologically suppressed adults. The trials are comprised of a diverse population of 2,414 participants on Biktarvy or an active comparator regimen, including a wide range of adult age groups and races/ethnicities. Biktarvy met its primary efficacy objective of non-inferiority at 48 weeks across all four studies.Biktarvy received marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Commission in 2018. In the United States, Biktarvy has a Boxed Warning in its product label regarding the risk of post-treatment acute exacerbation of hepatitis B.

Before this communication, the FDA had been silent as to whether it would convene an AdCom in connection with its review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. The FDA expressed, based on the timing of its recent decision to convene an AdCom, that November 14th is the earliest date on which it could hold an AdCom due to scheduling constraints for such a meeting.Accordingly, Amarin does not expect the FDA to take action on the sNDA by the previously announced September 28, 2019 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date. Amarin did not receive notice from the FDA of a PDUFA date extension. In light of the tentative AdCom date, Amarin anticipates that the PDUFA date will be extended, assuming a typical three-month extension, to a date in late December 2019. If so, this anticipated revised PDUFA date timing would offset three of the four months that were expected to be gained from FDA's earlier determination to conduct a priority review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. Prior to such determination, Amarin had expected a PDUFA goal date in January 2020, based on a standard 10-month review. Amarin plans to update the investment community after appropriately definitive information is available related to a new PDUFA date.Amarin intends to continue to move forward with its plans to double the size of its sales force to support the launch of Vascepa. Amarin plans to use the anticipated three-month delay in the PDUFA clock to better prepare for the assumed launch of Vascepa including more time to hire and train new sales representatives. To the extent that new sales managers and representatives are hired prior to the expanded label for Vascepa, Amarin intends to have them join the company's existing sales team in promoting Vascepa based on its current indication and existing promotional messaging.16:30EB Eventbrite appoints Lanny Baker as CFO, effective September 3 (17.49 +0.73)Mr. Baker joins Eventbrite from Yelp (YELP) where as CFO he oversaw corporate finance, accounting, investor relations and workplace functions.

Such an increase in the supply of ships, especially in a segment with a total of 118 vessels on the water and with more than half trading under time charters, has restricted handysize market rates from increasing alongside other sectors.

The S&P 500 advanced 1.9%, which extended its two-day comeback to 112 points, or 4.0%, from its session low on Wednesday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 1.4%, the Nasdaq Composite increased 2.2%, and the Russell 2000 increased 2.1%.Thursday's positive disposition ostensibly formed overnight after China reported a surprise yr/yr increase in July exports while holding its yuan firm, which again signaled goodwill in trade relations. Today's rally, however, appeared to be more a continuation from yesterday's big intraday reversal that suggested the recent sharp sell-off may have been excessive.Interestingly, the S&P 500 traded just below its 50-day moving average (2934) for most of the afternoon before finally breaking above the key technical level late in the session. The benchmark index held above the level on a closing basis.All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher by at least 1.0%. The energy sector (+2.9%) led the advance as oil prices ($52.52/bbl, +$1.38, +2.7%) rebounded, followed by the information technology (+2.4%), communication services (+2.2%), and consumer discretionary (+2.0%) sectors.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 33.92, +4.73, +16.2%) led the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+2.7%) higher after it unveiled its well-received server CPUs that Google and Twitter will reportedly use. Broadcom (AVGO 270.98, +0.93, +0.3%) struggled to participate in the chip rally amid news that it is close to purchasing Symantec's (SYMC 22.92, +2.51, +12.3%) enterprise business for about $10 billion.In earnings news, Booking Holdings (BKNG 1941.01, +119.45, +6.6%), Lyft (LYFT 62.10, +1.81, +3.0%), and Roku (ROKU 122.03, +21.06, +20.9%) outperformed the broader market following positive results and/or upbeat guidance. Kraft Heinz (KHC 28.22, -2.65, -8.6%) disappointed investors with its results.U.S. Treasuries were under noticeable selling pressure today, which sent the 10-yr yield up 11 basis points to 1.79% at one point during the session. Buyers gradually came back, ultimately leaving the benchmark yield up three basis points to 1.72%. The 2-yr yield finished also finished three basis points higher at 1.61%.

Continuing claims for the week ending July 27 decreased by 15,000 to 1.684 mln.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims continue hovering near multi-decade lows.Wholesale inventories were unchanged in June (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%) on top of an unrevised 0.4% increase in May. Wholesale sales decreased 0.3% in June after decreasing a revised 0.6% (from +0.1%) in May.The key takeaway from the June report and the May revision is that the gap between inventory growth and sales growth is widening, which should exert some pressure on prices.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for July on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +21.2% YTDS&P 500 +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +13.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.1% YTD16:21TSE Trinseo misses by $0.45, misses on revs; guides FY19 EPS below consensus (35.00 +1.81)Reports Q2 (Jun) earnings of $0.99 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.45 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.44; revenues fell 23.0% year/year to $951.8 mln vs the $1.07 bln two analyst estimate.Latex Binders net sales of $230 million for the quarter decreased 18% versus prior year due mainly to the pass through of lower raw material costs.Performance Plastics net sales of $347 million for the quarter were 16% below prior year due mainly to lower prices from the pass through of lower raw material costs.Co issues downside guidance for FY19, sees EPS of $4.15-4.86, excluding non-recurring items, vs. $5.54 S&P Capital IQ Consensus.16:20ROAD Construction Partners beats by $0.04, misses on revs (14.02 +0.20)Reports Q3 (Jun) earnings of $0.33 per share, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.29; revenues rose 16.5% year/year to $227.3 mln vs the $229.67 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Project backlog at June 30, 2019 was $581.1 mln.Adjusted EBITDA was $31.3 mln, up 37.9%.16:19PBYI Puma Biotech. beats by $0.32, reports revs in-line (9.21 +0.40)Reports Q2 (Jun) loss of $0.57 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.32 better than the single analyst estimate of ($0.89); revenues rose 6.1% year/year to $53.9 mln vs the $53.4 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Net NERLYNX revenue in the second quarter of 2019 was $53.8 million, compared to net NERLYNX revenue of $50.8 million in the second quarter of 2018."We anticipate the following key milestones during the remainder of 2019: (i) meeting with the FDA to discuss the clinical development and regulatory strategy for the SUMMIT trial in the third quarter of 2019; (ii) reporting additional data from the Phase II CONTROL trial in the fourth quarter of 2019; and (iii) receiving regulatory decisions for the extended adjuvant HER2-positive early stage breast cancer indication in additional countries."16:19DXC DXC Technology beats by $0.03, reports revs in-line (51.65 +1.76)Reports Q1 (Jun) earnings of $1.74 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.71; revenues fell 7.4% year/year to $4.89 bln vs the $4.86 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.16:18NRZ New Residential Investment prices $250 mln underwritten public offering of 10,000,000 shares of 7.125% Series B Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (15.27 +0.21)The company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for investments and general corporate purposes.16:18AIMT Aimmune Therapeutics misses by $0.08 (19.34 +0.24)Reports Q2 (Jun) loss of $1.01 per share, $0.08 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.93).Cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $250.3 million on June 30, 2019, compared to $303.9 million on December 31, 2018.

Familiar trade concerns appeared to hinder buying conviction after a three-day advance in the benchmark index.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.0%, and the Russell 2000 lost 1.3%.President Trump seemingly fed into the nagging trade angst when he told reporters that the U.S. will not be doing business with Huawei and that September trade talks could get canceled. None of these statements really surprised the market, but the prospect of U.S.-China relations further deteriorating kept some buyers sidelined on Friday.Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower, led by the energy (-1.3%) and information technology (-1.3%) sectors. Energy stocks fell despite the sharp increase in oil prices ($54.61/bbl, +$2.09, +4.0%), while the tech sector was pressured by shares of semiconductor companies, many of which derive substantial revenue from China. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 1.8%.Conversely, the defensive-oriented health care (+0.2%), real estate (+0.1%), and utilities (+0.04%) sectors were the lone sectors that finished higher.Uber (UBER 40.05, -2.92) shares fell 6.8% after the company reported a wider-than-expected $5.2 billion quarterly loss. Revenue also came up short of estimates, but today's decline simply retraced much of yesterday's 8% rally.In other corporate news, Amgen (AMGN 196.25, +11.02) shares spiked 6.0% following a positive ruling regarding its Enbrel business. DXC Technology (DXC 35.91, -15.74, -30.5%) plunged over 30% after it cut its FY20 outlook, while Dropbox (DBX 18.71, -2.75) fell 12.8% despite providing decent results and guidance.U.S. Treasuries finished slightly lower, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points each to 1.63% and 1.73%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 97.54.Reviewing Friday's lone economic report, the Producer Price Index for July:The index for final demand increased 0.2% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, excluding food and energy, decreased 0.1% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). The m/m readings left the index for final demand up 1.7% yr/yr, unchanged from June. The index remains at its lowest level since January 2017. Core PPI was up 2.1% yr/yr, down from 2.3% in June.The key takeaway from the report is that inflationary pressure remains muted.Looking ahead, Monday's economic data will be limited to the Treasury Budget for July.Nasdaq Composite +20.0% YTDS&P 500 +16.4% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +12.7% YTDRussell 2000 +12.2% YTD16:13HVT Haverty Furniture approves new $10.0 mln authorization under its common stock repurchase program and raises quarterly dividend to $0.20/share from $0.18/share (18.06 -0.30)16:05QUOT Quotient authorizes stock buyback program for up to $50.0 mln of its common stock (7.47 -0.02)15:51NVS Novartis AG: Sandoz confirms United States District Court of New Jersey ruled against it in patent litigation concerning the Sandoz biosimilar, Erelzi, for reference medicine Enbrel (90.98 -0.25)The company will appeal the ruling to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and the parties have agreed to an expedited appeal.

Erelzi has been approved for nearly three years, however Sandoz has been unable to launch the medicine due to the ongoing patent litigation from Amgen.15:25BONDX Treasury Market SummaryStrong Week Ends on Down NoteU.S. Treasuries ended a volatile week on a lower note. Treasuries started the cash session near their flat lines after futures backed off their highs from last evening. Those highs were registered after Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration is delaying the issuance of licenses that would allow U.S. companies to continue doing business with Huawei. The first hour of the session saw a sideways drift, which was followed by a push to highs after President Trump said that next month's trade talks with officials from China could be cancelled, adding that "we will not do business with Huawei." Treasuries spent the next couple hours in a slow retreat toward their starting levels, slipping to fresh lows after White House officials clarified that President Trump's comment about not doing business with Huawei referred to federal departments only while the Commerce Department will continue processing applications for special licenses from individual companies. Treasuries finished the day on lows, with the 10-yr yield narrowing this week's decline to 12 basis points. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.1% to 97.51, surrendering 0.6% for the week.

The benchmark index is down 1.0% with noticeable weakness in the semiconductor stocks.The Nasdaq Composite is down 1.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 is down 1.4%.President Trump told reporters today that the U.S. will not be doing business with Huawei, which seemed to confirm a Bloomberg report yesterday that the U.S. Commerce Department has been refraining from approving business licenses to work with the Chinese company. The president added that September trade talks could get canceled but are still scheduled for the time being.None of these events has been too surprising for investors, but the prospect of U.S.-China relations further deteriorating has contributed to a steady broad-based decline today.All 11 S&P 500 sectors are down, including eight with losses of at least 1.0%. The information technology sector (-1.5%) is underperforming amid the trade uncertainty, which has also made a noticeable impact on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-2.0%). Many semiconductor companies are heavily exposed to China.Uber (UBER 39.72, -3.23) shares have dropped 7.5% after the company reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss of $5.2 billion. Revenue also missed estimates, but today's loss has simply given back a bulk of yesterday's 8% rally.In other earnings news, shares of DXC Technology (DXC 35.74, -15.90, -30.8%) have plunged over 30% after the company cut its FY20 outlook, while shares of Activision Blizzard (ATVI 47.56, -1.78, -3.6%) trade lower as investors remain underwhelmed by its downside Q3 guidance.The U.S. Treasury market, which has drawn plenty of attention this week, has been muted. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.70%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.2% to 97.43. Interestingly, despite the growth concerns, WTI crude is up 3.7%, or $1.94, to $54.48/bbl.Reviewing today's lone economic report, the Producer Price Index for July:The index for final demand increased 0.2% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, excluding food and energy, decreased 0.1% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). The m/m readings left the index for final demand up 1.7% yr/yr, unchanged from June. The index remains at its lowest level since January 2017. Core PPI was up 2.1% yr/yr, down from 2.3% in June.The key takeaway from the report is that inflationary pressure remains muted.12:53SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: AMRN (20.82 mln -17.35%), NKTR (16.72 mln -33.01%), VRAY (16.28 mln -56.9%)Industrials: GE (47.2 mln -3.06%)Consumer Discretionary: F (25.15 mln -1.36%), FTCH (19.75 mln -41.42%)Information Technology: AMD (54.93 mln +0.88%), NOK (17.11 mln +0.28%), SYMC (15.56 mln +0.57%), DXC (14.71 mln -30.57%), MU (12.35 mln -3.33%), AAPL (11.43 mln -1.13%)Financials: BAC (24.44 mln -1.07%), QQQ (17.87 mln -1.5%), TQQQ (16.4 mln -4.53%), SQQQ (12.92 mln +4.48%)Energy: CHK (27.62 mln +0.34%), RIG (14.88 mln -4.15%)Consumer Staples: ABEV (16.79 mln -0.2%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: VRAY (13.64x -56.9%), NKTR (10.16x -33.01%), SIEN (4.23x +18.94%), NVRO (3.47x +16.54%)Industrials: WAIR (14.57x +6.88%)Consumer Discretionary: FTCH (10.92x -41.42%), WTRH (5.33x -62.1%), QSR (4.44x -3.09%), PLYA (3.69x -2.52%), CHUY (3.58x +10.27%)Information Technology: DXC (6.38x -30.57%), XELA (4.18x -43.08%), CISN (4.1x -23.4%), ALTR (4.07x -15.05%)Financials: PMT (7.44x -3.18%), SMFG (4.36x -1.31%)Energy: PUMP (4.6x -30.59%)Consumer Staples: PRMW (3.67x +7.05%)12:52SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: PBYI (11.1 +20.52%), SIEN (5.94 +18.94%), LXRX (1.5 +17.19%), NVRO (73.82 +16.54%), TXMD (3.04 +15.15%), TRXC (1.02 +13.33%), TRHC (66.44 +12.05%), CYRX (22.39 +10.95%), OMER (17.86 +9.5%), DVAX (3.32 +9.42%), DPLO (5.8 +9.02%)Consumer Discretionary: OSTK (24.12 +13.27%), CHUY (26.3 +10.27%), AGS (9.16 +10.17%), FRGI (10.84 +8.94%)Information Technology: APPN (50.08 +15.82%), PCTY (110.93 +9.41%)Financials: GDOT (29.92 +9.12%), GGAL (38.07 +8.93%)Energy: WFT (0.02 +9.52%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: VRAY (2.91 -56.9%), NKTR (19.81 -33.01%), AMRN (14.72 -17.35%)Industrials: VSLR (7.5 -19.35%), AAXN (57.31 -16.23%), TPC (9.32 -15.7%)Consumer Discretionary: WTRH (1.43 -62.1%), FTCH (10.69 -41.42%), MAT (11.54 -14.07%)Information Technology: XELA (1.39 -43.08%), DXC (35.86 -30.57%), CNDT (6.03 -30.37%), CISN (7.55 -23.4%), VRTU (35.83 -17.8%), ALTR (35.67 -15.05%), DBX (18.65 -13.09%)Energy: PUMP (12.04 -30.59%)12:23LLY Eli Lilly announces favorable U.S. Court of Appeals Alimta ruling (112.66 -1.31)The co announced that the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in favor of Lilly, confirming that the Alimta (pemetrexed for injection) vitamin regimen patent would be infringed by competitors that had stated their intent to market alternative salt forms of pemetrexed prior to the patent's expiration in May 2022. The ruling came in the appeals of U.S. District Court decisions in the cases of Eli Lilly and Company v. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) and Eli Lilly and Company v. Hospira (PFE). Previous rulings in Lilly's favor had precluded the generic companies from launching the alternative salt forms until the patent expires. If the patent is ultimately upheld through all remaining challenges, Alimta would maintain U.S. exclusivity until May 2022, preventing marketing of generic products for as long as the patent remains in force.12:10SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (128) outpacing new lows (110) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ACAD, AEM, AIZ, AJRD, AMT, APPN, AVP, AWK, AWR, AXS, AYX, AZN, AZUL, BAH, BAM, BLDP, BLL, BRFS, CB, CCI, CECO, CIM, CINF, CME, CMG, CMS, COLD, CTAS, CUBE, CYTK, EIX, ELS, ENPH, EQIX, ES, EXR, FLT, FMC, FNF, HAE, HCP, HIG, LHX, HSY, ICE, IDA, KGC, LAUR, LNT, MCD, MELI, MKC, MLM, MODN, NEE, NEO, NTRA, NVCR, NVRO, OAK, PCTY, PODD, PRO, PSA, QTS, RGLD, RLI, RNR, ROKU, RPM, SAM, SBAC, SEDG, SHOP, SHW, SIGI, SO, SRC, STE, STOR, SUI, SVM, SWCH, TERP, TFX, TSN, TTD, VRSK, WEC, WELL, WK, WM, WPC, WPM, EVRG, WST, WTR, ZBH, ZTS, AQN, BHK, BKT, CYRX, EIM, EMB, FNV, FTS, FWONA, FWONK, IIM, IRT, MCR, MVF, MYI, NAC, NAD, NEA, NG, NMZ, NUV, NVG, NZF, OUT, PVG, RNP, RQI, VGM, VMOStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ACRS, ADAP, AEG, AM, AMTD, AR, ASNA, ATI, AXL, B, BRKMY, BCOR, BCS, BIDU, BOX, BT, CCO, CLB, CLVS, CMA, CNDT, COMM, CRESY, CYOU, DLTH, DXC, ENBL, EROS, EXPR, EXTN, FET, FLR, GLNG, GLOG, GMLP, GRPN, GT, GVA, HBM, HIMX, HMHC, HSBC, HSC, ING, JCP, KB, KEP, KMT, KT, LXFR, LYG, M, MAC, MCFT, MIK, MMLP, MMSI, MT, NE, NINE, NKTR, ODP, OEC, OLN, PLT, PRTA, PTEN, PVH, QNST, RGR, RIG, RL, SCHW, SEMG, SIG, SMLP, SSL, SSP, TAST, TECK, TEF, TELL, TGH, TMST, TPC, TRQ, TRUE, TSE, TUSK, VNTR, VRAY, VRTU, VSTO, WETF, WFTIQ, YY, BE, CARS, CEIX, CISN, CLNC, FIXX, FTCH, JHG, KLXE, LTRPA, SDRL, TRIP, WTRH, XELAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AFB, BFK, BUI, KTF, MCA, MQY, NBB, NID, NQP, WIAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: CEA, SHG, SHI, STN, BIOBETFs that traded to 52 week highs: EMB, FXY, IYR, UREETFs that traded to 52 week lows: FXB, XES11:45SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Farfetch (FTCH) sinks following second quarter press -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersAPPN (48.93 +13.16%): Topped consensus for Q2 EPS and revs (+11.7% yr/yr to $66.9 mln); issued mixed guidance for Q3 (sees revs above consensus, EPS below); raised its FY19 revs guidance, increasing its view of both subscription and total revenue for the year.

The S&P 500 (-0.7%) reclaimed its 50-day moving average during the last few minutes of yesterday's session but the benchmark index finds itself back below that level this morning.Equity futures stumbled after yesterday's cash close, responding to a Bloomberg report, which revealed that the Department of Commerce has yet to begin issuing licenses to U.S. companies that want to resume doing business with Huawei. The decision was reportedly made after the Chinese government ordered state-owned enterprises to stop purchasing agricultural goods from the U.S.Understandably, that revelation is having the biggest impact on chipmakers. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is down 2.0%, returning into negative territory for the week (-1.8% week-to-date). The broader technology sector (-0.9%) trades at the bottom of the leaderboard, while eight out of the remaining ten sectors also trade in the red.The Russell 2000 is down 0.8%; the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.8%; the S&P 500 is down 0.7%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.5%.09:40WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Wall Street opens slightly lower, little changed for the weekThe major averages begin the day slightly lower following a big two-day comeback. The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the trade-sensitive materials (-0.6%), industrials (-0.6%), and information technology (-0.5%) sectors underperforming.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -40.00.The S&P 500 is up 0.2% for the week, but is on track to lose those slim gains at the open with the S&P 500 futures currently trading ten points, or 0.3%, below fair value.The decline in the futures could be a breather considering that the S&P 500 climbed 112 points, or 4.0%, over a two-day span.

Before this communication, the FDA had been silent as to whether it would convene an AdCom in connection with its review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. The FDA expressed, based on the timing of its recent decision to convene an AdCom, that November 14th is the earliest date on which it could hold an AdCom due to scheduling constraints for such a meeting.Accordingly, Amarin does not expect the FDA to take action on the sNDA by the previously announced September 28, 2019 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date. Amarin did not receive notice from the FDA of a PDUFA date extension. In light of the tentative AdCom date, Amarin anticipates that the PDUFA date will be extended, assuming a typical three-month extension, to a date in late December 2019. If so, this anticipated revised PDUFA date timing would offset three of the four months that were expected to be gained from FDA's earlier determination to conduct a priority review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. Prior to such determination, Amarin had expected a PDUFA goal date in January 2020, based on a standard 10-month review. Amarin plans to update the investment community after appropriately definitive information is available related to a new PDUFA date.Amarin intends to continue to move forward with its plans to double the size of its sales force to support the launch of Vascepa.

Today's rally, however, appeared to be more a continuation from yesterday's big intraday reversal that suggested the recent sharp sell-off may have been excessive.Interestingly, the S&P 500 traded just below its 50-day moving average (2934) for most of the afternoon before finally breaking above the key technical level late in the session. The benchmark index held above the level on a closing basis.All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher by at least 1.0%.

Familiar trade concerns appeared to hinder buying conviction after a three-day advance in the benchmark index.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.0%, and the Russell 2000 lost 1.3%.President Trump seemingly fed into the nagging trade angst when he told reporters that the U.S. will not be doing business with Huawei and that September trade talks could get canceled. None of these statements really surprised the market, but the prospect of U.S.-China relations further deteriorating kept some buyers sidelined on Friday.Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower, led by the energy (-1.3%) and information technology (-1.3%) sectors. Energy stocks fell despite the sharp increase in oil prices ($54.61/bbl, +$2.09, +4.0%), while the tech sector was pressured by shares of semiconductor companies, many of which derive substantial revenue from China. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 1.8%.Conversely, the defensive-oriented health care (+0.2%), real estate (+0.1%), and utilities (+0.04%) sectors were the lone sectors that finished higher.Uber (UBER 40.05, -2.92) shares fell 6.8% after the company reported a wider-than-expected $5.2 billion quarterly loss. Revenue also came up short of estimates, but today's decline simply retraced much of yesterday's 8% rally.In other corporate news, Amgen (AMGN 196.25, +11.02) shares spiked 6.0% following a positive ruling regarding its Enbrel business. DXC Technology (DXC 35.91, -15.74, -30.5%) plunged over 30% after it cut its FY20 outlook, while Dropbox (DBX 18.71, -2.75) fell 12.8% despite providing decent results and guidance.U.S. Treasuries finished slightly lower, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points each to 1.63% and 1.73%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 97.54.Reviewing Friday's lone economic report, the Producer Price Index for July:The index for final demand increased 0.2% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, excluding food and energy, decreased 0.1% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). The m/m readings left the index for final demand up 1.7% yr/yr, unchanged from June. The index remains at its lowest level since January 2017. Core PPI was up 2.1% yr/yr, down from 2.3% in June.The key takeaway from the report is that inflationary pressure remains muted.Looking ahead, Monday's economic data will be limited to the Treasury Budget for July.Nasdaq Composite +20.0% YTDS&P 500 +16.4% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +12.7% YTDRussell 2000 +12.2% YTD16:13HVT Haverty Furniture approves new $10.0 mln authorization under its common stock repurchase program and raises quarterly dividend to $0.20/share from $0.18/share (18.06 -0.30)16:05QUOT Quotient authorizes stock buyback program for up to $50.0 mln of its common stock (7.47 -0.02)15:51NVS Novartis AG: Sandoz confirms United States District Court of New Jersey ruled against it in patent litigation concerning the Sandoz biosimilar, Erelzi, for reference medicine Enbrel (90.98 -0.25)The company will appeal the ruling to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and the parties have agreed to an expedited appeal. Sandoz is the first biosimilar company to receive FDA approval for a biosimilar etanercept. Erelzi has been approved for nearly three years, however Sandoz has been unable to launch the medicine due to the ongoing patent litigation from Amgen.15:25BONDX Treasury Market SummaryStrong Week Ends on Down NoteU.S. Treasuries ended a volatile week on a lower note. Treasuries started the cash session near their flat lines after futures backed off their highs from last evening. Those highs were registered after Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration is delaying the issuance of licenses that would allow U.S. companies to continue doing business with Huawei. The first hour of the session saw a sideways drift, which was followed by a push to highs after President Trump said that next month's trade talks with officials from China could be cancelled, adding that "we will not do business with Huawei." Treasuries spent the next couple hours in a slow retreat toward their starting levels, slipping to fresh lows after White House officials clarified that President Trump's comment about not doing business with Huawei referred to federal departments only while the Commerce Department will continue processing applications for special licenses from individual companies. Treasuries finished the day on lows, with the 10-yr yield narrowing this week's decline to 12 basis points. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.1% to 97.51, surrendering 0.6% for the week.

The benchmark index is down 1.0% with noticeable weakness in the semiconductor stocks.The Nasdaq Composite is down 1.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 is down 1.4%.President Trump told reporters today that the U.S. will not be doing business with Huawei, which seemed to confirm a Bloomberg report yesterday that the U.S. Commerce Department has been refraining from approving business licenses to work with the Chinese company. The president added that September trade talks could get canceled but are still scheduled for the time being.None of these events has been too surprising for investors, but the prospect of U.S.-China relations further deteriorating has contributed to a steady broad-based decline today.All 11 S&P 500 sectors are down, including eight with losses of at least 1.0%. The information technology sector (-1.5%) is underperforming amid the trade uncertainty, which has also made a noticeable impact on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-2.0%). Many semiconductor companies are heavily exposed to China.Uber (UBER 39.72, -3.23) shares have dropped 7.5% after the company reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss of $5.2 billion. Revenue also missed estimates, but today's loss has simply given back a bulk of yesterday's 8% rally.In other earnings news, shares of DXC Technology (DXC 35.74, -15.90, -30.8%) have plunged over 30% after the company cut its FY20 outlook, while shares of Activision Blizzard (ATVI 47.56, -1.78, -3.6%) trade lower as investors remain underwhelmed by its downside Q3 guidance.The U.S. Treasury market, which has drawn plenty of attention this week, has been muted. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.70%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.2% to 97.43. Interestingly, despite the growth concerns, WTI crude is up 3.7%, or $1.94, to $54.48/bbl.Reviewing today's lone economic report, the Producer Price Index for July:The index for final demand increased 0.2% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, excluding food and energy, decreased 0.1% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%).

The ruling came in the appeals of U.S. District Court decisions in the cases of Eli Lilly and Company v. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) and Eli Lilly and Company v. Hospira (PFE). Previous rulings in Lilly's favor had precluded the generic companies from launching the alternative salt forms until the patent expires. If the patent is ultimately upheld through all remaining challenges, Alimta would maintain U.S. exclusivity until May 2022, preventing marketing of generic products for as long as the patent remains in force.12:10SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (128) outpacing new lows (110) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ACAD, AEM, AIZ, AJRD, AMT, APPN, AVP, AWK, AWR, AXS, AYX, AZN, AZUL, BAH, BAM, BLDP, BLL, BRFS, CB, CCI, CECO, CIM, CINF, CME, CMG, CMS, COLD, CTAS, CUBE, CYTK, EIX, ELS, ENPH, EQIX, ES, EXR, FLT, FMC, FNF, HAE, HCP, HIG, LHX, HSY, ICE, IDA, KGC, LAUR, LNT, MCD, MELI, MKC, MLM, MODN, NEE, NEO, NTRA, NVCR, NVRO, OAK, PCTY, PODD, PRO, PSA, QTS, RGLD, RLI, RNR, ROKU, RPM, SAM, SBAC, SEDG, SHOP, SHW, SIGI, SO, SRC, STE, STOR, SUI, SVM, SWCH, TERP, TFX, TSN, TTD, VRSK, WEC, WELL, WK, WM, WPC, WPM, EVRG, WST, WTR, ZBH, ZTS, AQN, BHK, BKT, CYRX, EIM, EMB, FNV, FTS, FWONA, FWONK, IIM, IRT, MCR, MVF, MYI, NAC, NAD, NEA, NG, NMZ, NUV, NVG, NZF, OUT, PVG, RNP, RQI, VGM, VMOStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ACRS, ADAP, AEG, AM, AMTD, AR, ASNA, ATI, AXL, B, BRKMY, BCOR, BCS, BIDU, BOX, BT, CCO, CLB, CLVS, CMA, CNDT, COMM, CRESY, CYOU, DLTH, DXC, ENBL, EROS, EXPR, EXTN, FET, FLR, GLNG, GLOG, GMLP, GRPN, GT, GVA, HBM, HIMX, HMHC, HSBC, HSC, ING, JCP, KB, KEP, KMT, KT, LXFR, LYG, M, MAC, MCFT, MIK, MMLP, MMSI, MT, NE, NINE, NKTR, ODP, OEC, OLN, PLT, PRTA, PTEN, PVH, QNST, RGR, RIG, RL, SCHW, SEMG, SIG, SMLP, SSL, SSP, TAST, TECK, TEF, TELL, TGH, TMST, TPC, TRQ, TRUE, TSE, TUSK, VNTR, VRAY, VRTU, VSTO, WETF, WFTIQ, YY, BE, CARS, CEIX, CISN, CLNC, FIXX, FTCH, JHG, KLXE, LTRPA, SDRL, TRIP, WTRH, XELAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AFB, BFK, BUI, KTF, MCA, MQY, NBB, NID, NQP, WIAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: CEA, SHG, SHI, STN, BIOBETFs that traded to 52 week highs: EMB, FXY, IYR, UREETFs that traded to 52 week lows: FXB, XES11:45SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Farfetch (FTCH) sinks following second quarter press -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersAPPN (48.93 +13.16%): Topped consensus for Q2 EPS and revs (+11.7% yr/yr to $66.9 mln); issued mixed guidance for Q3 (sees revs above consensus, EPS below); raised its FY19 revs guidance, increasing its view of both subscription and total revenue for the year.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -40.00.The S&P 500 is up 0.2% for the week, but is on track to lose those slim gains at the open with the S&P 500 futures currently trading ten points, or 0.3%, below fair value.The decline in the futures could be a breather considering that the S&P 500 climbed 112 points, or 4.0%, over a two-day span. Of course, that advance followed a sharp sell-off that had many market participants blaming trade tensions, which are not helpful for economic growth prospects. In either case, the decline is modest and futures do not necessarily predict intraday action.Uber (UBER 40.12, -2.85, -6.7%) shares rose over 8% yesterday heading into its earnings report, which included a $5.2 billion quarterly loss.

Biktarvy combines the novel, unboosted integrase strand transfer inhibitor bictegravir with the demonstrated safety and efficacy profile of the Descovy dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone and is the smallest INSTI-based triple-therapy STR available. In China, Biktarvy is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults without present or past evidence of viral resistance to the integrase inhibitor class, emtricitabine or tenofovir.The approval of Biktarvy is supported by data from four ongoing Phase 3 studies: Studies 1489 and 1490 in treatment-nave HIV-1 infected adults, and Studies 1844 and 1878 in virologically suppressed adults. The trials are comprised of a diverse population of 2,414 participants on Biktarvy or an active comparator regimen, including a wide range of adult age groups and races/ethnicities. Biktarvy met its primary efficacy objective of non-inferiority at 48 weeks across all four studies.Biktarvy received marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Commission in 2018. In the United States, Biktarvy has a Boxed Warning in its product label regarding the risk of post-treatment acute exacerbation of hepatitis B.

Before this communication, the FDA had been silent as to whether it would convene an AdCom in connection with its review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. The FDA expressed, based on the timing of its recent decision to convene an AdCom, that November 14th is the earliest date on which it could hold an AdCom due to scheduling constraints for such a meeting.Accordingly, Amarin does not expect the FDA to take action on the sNDA by the previously announced September 28, 2019 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date. Amarin did not receive notice from the FDA of a PDUFA date extension. In light of the tentative AdCom date, Amarin anticipates that the PDUFA date will be extended, assuming a typical three-month extension, to a date in late December 2019. If so, this anticipated revised PDUFA date timing would offset three of the four months that were expected to be gained from FDA's earlier determination to conduct a priority review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. Prior to such determination, Amarin had expected a PDUFA goal date in January 2020, based on a standard 10-month review. Amarin plans to update the investment community after appropriately definitive information is available related to a new PDUFA date.Amarin intends to continue to move forward with its plans to double the size of its sales force to support the launch of Vascepa. Amarin plans to use the anticipated three-month delay in the PDUFA clock to better prepare for the assumed launch of Vascepa including more time to hire and train new sales representatives. To the extent that new sales managers and representatives are hired prior to the expanded label for Vascepa, Amarin intends to have them join the company's existing sales team in promoting Vascepa based on its current indication and existing promotional messaging.16:30EB Eventbrite appoints Lanny Baker as CFO, effective September 3 (17.49 +0.73)Mr. Baker joins Eventbrite from Yelp (YELP) where as CFO he oversaw corporate finance, accounting, investor relations and workplace functions.

Such an increase in the supply of ships, especially in a segment with a total of 118 vessels on the water and with more than half trading under time charters, has restricted handysize market rates from increasing alongside other sectors.

The S&P 500 advanced 1.9%, which extended its two-day comeback to 112 points, or 4.0%, from its session low on Wednesday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 1.4%, the Nasdaq Composite increased 2.2%, and the Russell 2000 increased 2.1%.Thursday's positive disposition ostensibly formed overnight after China reported a surprise yr/yr increase in July exports while holding its yuan firm, which again signaled goodwill in trade relations. Today's rally, however, appeared to be more a continuation from yesterday's big intraday reversal that suggested the recent sharp sell-off may have been excessive.Interestingly, the S&P 500 traded just below its 50-day moving average (2934) for most of the afternoon before finally breaking above the key technical level late in the session. The benchmark index held above the level on a closing basis.All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher by at least 1.0%. The energy sector (+2.9%) led the advance as oil prices ($52.52/bbl, +$1.38, +2.7%) rebounded, followed by the information technology (+2.4%), communication services (+2.2%), and consumer discretionary (+2.0%) sectors.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 33.92, +4.73, +16.2%) led the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+2.7%) higher after it unveiled its well-received server CPUs that Google and Twitter will reportedly use. Broadcom (AVGO 270.98, +0.93, +0.3%) struggled to participate in the chip rally amid news that it is close to purchasing Symantec's (SYMC 22.92, +2.51, +12.3%) enterprise business for about $10 billion.In earnings news, Booking Holdings (BKNG 1941.01, +119.45, +6.6%), Lyft (LYFT 62.10, +1.81, +3.0%), and Roku (ROKU 122.03, +21.06, +20.9%) outperformed the broader market following positive results and/or upbeat guidance. Kraft Heinz (KHC 28.22, -2.65, -8.6%) disappointed investors with its results.U.S. Treasuries were under noticeable selling pressure today, which sent the 10-yr yield up 11 basis points to 1.79% at one point during the session. Buyers gradually came back, ultimately leaving the benchmark yield up three basis points to 1.72%. The 2-yr yield finished also finished three basis points higher at 1.61%.

Continuing claims for the week ending July 27 decreased by 15,000 to 1.684 mln.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims continue hovering near multi-decade lows.Wholesale inventories were unchanged in June (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%) on top of an unrevised 0.4% increase in May. Wholesale sales decreased 0.3% in June after decreasing a revised 0.6% (from +0.1%) in May.The key takeaway from the June report and the May revision is that the gap between inventory growth and sales growth is widening, which should exert some pressure on prices.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for July on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +21.2% YTDS&P 500 +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +13.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.1% YTD16:21TSE Trinseo misses by $0.45, misses on revs; guides FY19 EPS below consensus (35.00 +1.81)Reports Q2 (Jun) earnings of $0.99 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.45 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.44; revenues fell 23.0% year/year to $951.8 mln vs the $1.07 bln two analyst estimate.Latex Binders net sales of $230 million for the quarter decreased 18% versus prior year due mainly to the pass through of lower raw material costs.Performance Plastics net sales of $347 million for the quarter were 16% below prior year due mainly to lower prices from the pass through of lower raw material costs.Co issues downside guidance for FY19, sees EPS of $4.15-4.86, excluding non-recurring items, vs. $5.54 S&P Capital IQ Consensus.16:20ROAD Construction Partners beats by $0.04, misses on revs (14.02 +0.20)Reports Q3 (Jun) earnings of $0.33 per share, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.29; revenues rose 16.5% year/year to $227.3 mln vs the $229.67 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Project backlog at June 30, 2019 was $581.1 mln.Adjusted EBITDA was $31.3 mln, up 37.9%.16:19PBYI Puma Biotech. beats by $0.32, reports revs in-line (9.21 +0.40)Reports Q2 (Jun) loss of $0.57 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.32 better than the single analyst estimate of ($0.89); revenues rose 6.1% year/year to $53.9 mln vs the $53.4 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Net NERLYNX revenue in the second quarter of 2019 was $53.8 million, compared to net NERLYNX revenue of $50.8 million in the second quarter of 2018."We anticipate the following key milestones during the remainder of 2019: (i) meeting with the FDA to discuss the clinical development and regulatory strategy for the SUMMIT trial in the third quarter of 2019; (ii) reporting additional data from the Phase II CONTROL trial in the fourth quarter of 2019; and (iii) receiving regulatory decisions for the extended adjuvant HER2-positive early stage breast cancer indication in additional countries."16:19DXC DXC Technology beats by $0.03, reports revs in-line (51.65 +1.76)Reports Q1 (Jun) earnings of $1.74 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.71; revenues fell 7.4% year/year to $4.89 bln vs the $4.86 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.16:18NRZ New Residential Investment prices $250 mln underwritten public offering of 10,000,000 shares of 7.125% Series B Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (15.27 +0.21)The company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for investments and general corporate purposes.16:18AIMT Aimmune Therapeutics misses by $0.08 (19.34 +0.24)Reports Q2 (Jun) loss of $1.01 per share, $0.08 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.93).Cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $250.3 million on June 30, 2019, compared to $303.9 million on December 31, 2018.

Familiar trade concerns appeared to hinder buying conviction after a three-day advance in the benchmark index.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.0%, and the Russell 2000 lost 1.3%.President Trump seemingly fed into the nagging trade angst when he told reporters that the U.S. will not be doing business with Huawei and that September trade talks could get canceled. None of these statements really surprised the market, but the prospect of U.S.-China relations further deteriorating kept some buyers sidelined on Friday.Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower, led by the energy (-1.3%) and information technology (-1.3%) sectors. Energy stocks fell despite the sharp increase in oil prices ($54.61/bbl, +$2.09, +4.0%), while the tech sector was pressured by shares of semiconductor companies, many of which derive substantial revenue from China. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 1.8%.Conversely, the defensive-oriented health care (+0.2%), real estate (+0.1%), and utilities (+0.04%) sectors were the lone sectors that finished higher.Uber (UBER 40.05, -2.92) shares fell 6.8% after the company reported a wider-than-expected $5.2 billion quarterly loss. Revenue also came up short of estimates, but today's decline simply retraced much of yesterday's 8% rally.In other corporate news, Amgen (AMGN 196.25, +11.02) shares spiked 6.0% following a positive ruling regarding its Enbrel business. DXC Technology (DXC 35.91, -15.74, -30.5%) plunged over 30% after it cut its FY20 outlook, while Dropbox (DBX 18.71, -2.75) fell 12.8% despite providing decent results and guidance.U.S. Treasuries finished slightly lower, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points each to 1.63% and 1.73%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 97.54.Reviewing Friday's lone economic report, the Producer Price Index for July:The index for final demand increased 0.2% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, excluding food and energy, decreased 0.1% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). The m/m readings left the index for final demand up 1.7% yr/yr, unchanged from June. The index remains at its lowest level since January 2017.

Erelzi has been approved for nearly three years, however Sandoz has been unable to launch the medicine due to the ongoing patent litigation from Amgen.15:25BONDX Treasury Market SummaryStrong Week Ends on Down NoteU.S. Treasuries ended a volatile week on a lower note. Treasuries started the cash session near their flat lines after futures backed off their highs from last evening. Those highs were registered after Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration is delaying the issuance of licenses that would allow U.S. companies to continue doing business with Huawei. The first hour of the session saw a sideways drift, which was followed by a push to highs after President Trump said that next month's trade talks with officials from China could be cancelled, adding that "we will not do business with Huawei." Treasuries spent the next couple hours in a slow retreat toward their starting levels, slipping to fresh lows after White House officials clarified that President Trump's comment about not doing business with Huawei referred to federal departments only while the Commerce Department will continue processing applications for special licenses from individual companies. Treasuries finished the day on lows, with the 10-yr yield narrowing this week's decline to 12 basis points. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.1% to 97.51, surrendering 0.6% for the week.

The benchmark index is down 1.0% with noticeable weakness in the semiconductor stocks.The Nasdaq Composite is down 1.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 is down 1.4%.President Trump told reporters today that the U.S. will not be doing business with Huawei, which seemed to confirm a Bloomberg report yesterday that the U.S. Commerce Department has been refraining from approving business licenses to work with the Chinese company. The president added that September trade talks could get canceled but are still scheduled for the time being.None of these events has been too surprising for investors, but the prospect of U.S.-China relations further deteriorating has contributed to a steady broad-based decline today.All 11 S&P 500 sectors are down, including eight with losses of at least 1.0%. The information technology sector (-1.5%) is underperforming amid the trade uncertainty, which has also made a noticeable impact on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-2.0%). Many semiconductor companies are heavily exposed to China.Uber (UBER 39.72, -3.23) shares have dropped 7.5% after the company reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss of $5.2 billion. Revenue also missed estimates, but today's loss has simply given back a bulk of yesterday's 8% rally.In other earnings news, shares of DXC Technology (DXC 35.74, -15.90, -30.8%) have plunged over 30% after the company cut its FY20 outlook, while shares of Activision Blizzard (ATVI 47.56, -1.78, -3.6%) trade lower as investors remain underwhelmed by its downside Q3 guidance.The U.S. Treasury market, which has drawn plenty of attention this week, has been muted. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.70%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.2% to 97.43. Interestingly, despite the growth concerns, WTI crude is up 3.7%, or $1.94, to $54.48/bbl.Reviewing today's lone economic report, the Producer Price Index for July:The index for final demand increased 0.2% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, excluding food and energy, decreased 0.1% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). The m/m readings left the index for final demand up 1.7% yr/yr, unchanged from June. The index remains at its lowest level since January 2017. Core PPI was up 2.1% yr/yr, down from 2.3% in June.The key takeaway from the report is that inflationary pressure remains muted.12:53SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: AMRN (20.82 mln -17.35%), NKTR (16.72 mln -33.01%), VRAY (16.28 mln -56.9%)Industrials: GE (47.2 mln -3.06%)Consumer Discretionary: F (25.15 mln -1.36%), FTCH (19.75 mln -41.42%)Information Technology: AMD (54.93 mln +0.88%), NOK (17.11 mln +0.28%), SYMC (15.56 mln +0.57%), DXC (14.71 mln -30.57%), MU (12.35 mln -3.33%), AAPL (11.43 mln -1.13%)Financials: BAC (24.44 mln -1.07%), QQQ (17.87 mln -1.5%), TQQQ (16.4 mln -4.53%), SQQQ (12.92 mln +4.48%)Energy: CHK (27.62 mln +0.34%), RIG (14.88 mln -4.15%)Consumer Staples: ABEV (16.79 mln -0.2%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: VRAY (13.64x -56.9%), NKTR (10.16x -33.01%), SIEN (4.23x +18.94%), NVRO (3.47x +16.54%)Industrials: WAIR (14.57x +6.88%)Consumer Discretionary: FTCH (10.92x -41.42%), WTRH (5.33x -62.1%), QSR (4.44x -3.09%), PLYA (3.69x -2.52%), CHUY (3.58x +10.27%)Information Technology: DXC (6.38x -30.57%), XELA (4.18x -43.08%), CISN (4.1x -23.4%), ALTR (4.07x -15.05%)Financials: PMT (7.44x -3.18%), SMFG (4.36x -1.31%)Energy: PUMP (4.6x -30.59%)Consumer Staples: PRMW (3.67x +7.05%)12:52SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: PBYI (11.1 +20.52%), SIEN (5.94 +18.94%), LXRX (1.5 +17.19%), NVRO (73.82 +16.54%), TXMD (3.04 +15.15%), TRXC (1.02 +13.33%), TRHC (66.44 +12.05%), CYRX (22.39 +10.95%), OMER (17.86 +9.5%), DVAX (3.32 +9.42%), DPLO (5.8 +9.02%)Consumer Discretionary: OSTK (24.12 +13.27%), CHUY (26.3 +10.27%), AGS (9.16 +10.17%), FRGI (10.84 +8.94%)Information Technology: APPN (50.08 +15.82%), PCTY (110.93 +9.41%)Financials: GDOT (29.92 +9.12%), GGAL (38.07 +8.93%)Energy: WFT (0.02 +9.52%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: VRAY (2.91 -56.9%), NKTR (19.81 -33.01%), AMRN (14.72 -17.35%)Industrials: VSLR (7.5 -19.35%), AAXN (57.31 -16.23%), TPC (9.32 -15.7%)Consumer Discretionary: WTRH (1.43 -62.1%), FTCH (10.69 -41.42%), MAT (11.54 -14.07%)Information Technology: XELA (1.39 -43.08%), DXC (35.86 -30.57%), CNDT (6.03 -30.37%), CISN (7.55 -23.4%), VRTU (35.83 -17.8%), ALTR (35.67 -15.05%), DBX (18.65 -13.09%)Energy: PUMP (12.04 -30.59%)12:23LLY Eli Lilly announces favorable U.S. Court of Appeals Alimta ruling (112.66 -1.31)The co announced that the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in favor of Lilly, confirming that the Alimta (pemetrexed for injection) vitamin regimen patent would be infringed by competitors that had stated their intent to market alternative salt forms of pemetrexed prior to the patent's expiration in May 2022. The ruling came in the appeals of U.S. District Court decisions in the cases of Eli Lilly and Company v. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) and Eli Lilly and Company v. Hospira (PFE). Previous rulings in Lilly's favor had precluded the generic companies from launching the alternative salt forms until the patent expires. If the patent is ultimately upheld through all remaining challenges, Alimta would maintain U.S. exclusivity until May 2022, preventing marketing of generic products for as long as the patent remains in force.12:10SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (128) outpacing new lows (110) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ACAD, AEM, AIZ, AJRD, AMT, APPN, AVP, AWK, AWR, AXS, AYX, AZN, AZUL, BAH, BAM, BLDP, BLL, BRFS, CB, CCI, CECO, CIM, CINF, CME, CMG, CMS, COLD, CTAS, CUBE, CYTK, EIX, ELS, ENPH, EQIX, ES, EXR, FLT, FMC, FNF, HAE, HCP, HIG, LHX, HSY, ICE, IDA, KGC, LAUR, LNT, MCD, MELI, MKC, MLM, MODN, NEE, NEO, NTRA, NVCR, NVRO, OAK, PCTY, PODD, PRO, PSA, QTS, RGLD, RLI, RNR, ROKU, RPM, SAM, SBAC, SEDG, SHOP, SHW, SIGI, SO, SRC, STE, STOR, SUI, SVM, SWCH, TERP, TFX, TSN, TTD, VRSK, WEC, WELL, WK, WM, WPC, WPM, EVRG, WST, WTR, ZBH, ZTS, AQN, BHK, BKT, CYRX, EIM, EMB, FNV, FTS, FWONA, FWONK, IIM, IRT, MCR, MVF, MYI, NAC, NAD, NEA, NG, NMZ, NUV, NVG, NZF, OUT, PVG, RNP, RQI, VGM, VMOStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ACRS, ADAP, AEG, AM, AMTD, AR, ASNA, ATI, AXL, B, BRKMY, BCOR, BCS, BIDU, BOX, BT, CCO, CLB, CLVS, CMA, CNDT, COMM, CRESY, CYOU, DLTH, DXC, ENBL, EROS, EXPR, EXTN, FET, FLR, GLNG, GLOG, GMLP, GRPN, GT, GVA, HBM, HIMX, HMHC, HSBC, HSC, ING, JCP, KB, KEP, KMT, KT, LXFR, LYG, M, MAC, MCFT, MIK, MMLP, MMSI, MT, NE, NINE, NKTR, ODP, OEC, OLN, PLT, PRTA, PTEN, PVH, QNST, RGR, RIG, RL, SCHW, SEMG, SIG, SMLP, SSL, SSP, TAST, TECK, TEF, TELL, TGH, TMST, TPC, TRQ, TRUE, TSE, TUSK, VNTR, VRAY, VRTU, VSTO, WETF, WFTIQ, YY, BE, CARS, CEIX, CISN, CLNC, FIXX, FTCH, JHG, KLXE, LTRPA, SDRL, TRIP, WTRH, XELAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AFB, BFK, BUI, KTF, MCA, MQY, NBB, NID, NQP, WIAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: CEA, SHG, SHI, STN, BIOBETFs that traded to 52 week highs: EMB, FXY, IYR, UREETFs that traded to 52 week lows: FXB, XES11:45SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Farfetch (FTCH) sinks following second quarter press -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersAPPN (48.93 +13.16%): Topped consensus for Q2 EPS and revs (+11.7% yr/yr to $66.9 mln); issued mixed guidance for Q3 (sees revs above consensus, EPS below); raised its FY19 revs guidance, increasing its view of both subscription and total revenue for the year.

The S&P 500 (-0.7%) reclaimed its 50-day moving average during the last few minutes of yesterday's session but the benchmark index finds itself back below that level this morning.Equity futures stumbled after yesterday's cash close, responding to a Bloomberg report, which revealed that the Department of Commerce has yet to begin issuing licenses to U.S. companies that want to resume doing business with Huawei. The decision was reportedly made after the Chinese government ordered state-owned enterprises to stop purchasing agricultural goods from the U.S.Understandably, that revelation is having the biggest impact on chipmakers. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is down 2.0%, returning into negative territory for the week (-1.8% week-to-date). The broader technology sector (-0.9%) trades at the bottom of the leaderboard, while eight out of the remaining ten sectors also trade in the red.The Russell 2000 is down 0.8%; the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.8%; the S&P 500 is down 0.7%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.5%.09:40WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Wall Street opens slightly lower, little changed for the weekThe major averages begin the day slightly lower following a big two-day comeback. The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the trade-sensitive materials (-0.6%), industrials (-0.6%), and information technology (-0.5%) sectors underperforming.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -40.00.The S&P 500 is up 0.2% for the week, but is on track to lose those slim gains at the open with the S&P 500 futures currently trading ten points, or 0.3%, below fair value.The decline in the futures could be a breather considering that the S&P 500 climbed 112 points, or 4.0%, over a two-day span.

Before this communication, the FDA had been silent as to whether it would convene an AdCom in connection with its review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. The FDA expressed, based on the timing of its recent decision to convene an AdCom, that November 14th is the earliest date on which it could hold an AdCom due to scheduling constraints for such a meeting.Accordingly, Amarin does not expect the FDA to take action on the sNDA by the previously announced September 28, 2019 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date. Amarin did not receive notice from the FDA of a PDUFA date extension. In light of the tentative AdCom date, Amarin anticipates that the PDUFA date will be extended, assuming a typical three-month extension, to a date in late December 2019. If so, this anticipated revised PDUFA date timing would offset three of the four months that were expected to be gained from FDA's earlier determination to conduct a priority review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. Prior to such determination, Amarin had expected a PDUFA goal date in January 2020, based on a standard 10-month review. Amarin plans to update the investment community after appropriately definitive information is available related to a new PDUFA date.Amarin intends to continue to move forward with its plans to double the size of its sales force to support the launch of Vascepa.

Today's rally, however, appeared to be more a continuation from yesterday's big intraday reversal that suggested the recent sharp sell-off may have been excessive.Interestingly, the S&P 500 traded just below its 50-day moving average (2934) for most of the afternoon before finally breaking above the key technical level late in the session. The benchmark index held above the level on a closing basis.All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher by at least 1.0%.

He says such a move would make the U.S. economy even better and would also "greatly and quickly" enhance the global economy.___74% of economists in survey see US recession by end of 2021WASHINGTON (AP) - A strong majority, 74%, of U.S. business economists appear sufficiently concerned about the risks of some of President Donald Trump's economic policies that they expect a recession in the U.S. by the end of 2021. The economists surveyed by the National Association for Business Economics, in a report released Monday, mostly didn't share Trump's optimistic outlook for the economy, though they generally saw recession coming later than they did in a survey taken in February.___US extends limited reprieve on tech sales to China's HuaweiWASHINGTON (AP) - The Trump administration has extended a limited reprieve on U.S. technology sales to Huawei. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says the main aim is to give smaller U.S. internet and wireless companies that rely on Huawei more time to wean themselves off. Yet questions remain over how much of an effect broader sanctions are having on the Chinese technology giant.___Wide implications as Germany teeters toward recessionBERLIN (AP) - Germany's central bank has raised the possibility that Europe's industrial powerhouse and biggest economy is entering a recession. That could have repercussions for the rest of the eurozone and the United States, especially if it dampens demand in Germany for those countries' exports.___Top US CEOs rethink the meaning of shareholder valueNEW YORK (AP) - "The shareholder comes first" has for years been the mantra of the Business Roundtable, a group representing the most powerful CEOs in America. The group on Monday released a new mission statement that implies a foundational shift: a step back from shareholder primacy. The new mission statement on "the purpose of a corporation" emphasizes that all stakeholders are important and that includes workers, suppliers, customers and the communities where corporations operate.___Technology companies drive a broad rally on Wall StreetNEW YORK (AP) - Technology companies powered a broad rally on Wall Street Monday that gave the market its third straight gain. The surge in tech stocks followed a decision by the U.S. to give Chinese telecom giant Huawei another 90 days to buy equipment from American suppliers. The decision appeared to put investors eager for any signs of progress in the trade war between the U.S. and China in a buying mood. Stocks were coming off their third weekly loss in a row. Bond prices fell, sending yields higher.___Where'd all the stocks go? Nasdaq's CEO on shrinking marketNEW YORK (AP) - The U.S. stock market has thousands fewer companies to choose from, and that's doing a disservice to regular investors, says Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman. In a recent conversation with the AP, she discussed what's behind the trend and how it could be exacerbating income inequality. She also touched on how trading markets are striving to open up to the world, even as politicians push for more insularity.___Brand-name drug prices rising at slower pace, lower amountsTRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Prices for brand-name prescription medicines are still climbing, just not quite as much. After years of frequent list price hikes, many drugmakers are showing some restraint. New figures from health data firm Elsevier analyzed by The Associated Press show fewer and smaller price hikes so far this year.___'Codfather' settlement means magnate will never fish againThe federal government says it has settled its civil case against a fishing magnate known as the Codfather, saying he will never be allowed to return to U.S. fisheries. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Monday its settlement with Carlos Rafael and his fishing captains will clear the way for Rafael's assets to be divested. Those assets are embroiled in litigation. Rafael's attorney did not return a phone call seeking comment.___Top US CEOs rethink the meaning of shareholder valueNEW YORK (AP) - The shareholder comes first has for years been the mantra of the Business Roundtable, a group representing the most powerful CEOs in America. The group on Monday released a new mission statement that implies a foundational shift; a step back from shareholder primacy. The new mission statement on "the purpose of a corporation" emphasizes that all stakeholders are important and that includes workers, suppliers, customers and the communities where corporations operate.___Twitter shuts Chinese accounts targeting Hong Kong protestsWASHINGTON (AP) - Twitter has suspended more than 200,000 accounts that it believes were linked to the Chinese government and a disinformation campaign targeting the protests in Hong Kong. The company also says it will prohibit state-sponsored ads that have amounted to propaganda. A senior Twitter official tells The Associated Press that both actions are part of a company effort to halt malicious political activity on the widely used platform.___The S&P 500 climbed 34.97 points, or 1.2%, to 2,923.65. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 249.78 points, or 1%, to 26,135.79. The Nasdaq rose 106.82 points, or 1.3%, to 8,002.81. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks gained 15.21 points, or 1%, to 1,508.85.Load-Date: August 20, 2019End of Document

Amarin also may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire strategic assets, although it currently has no agreements or commitments in this regard. Separately, in a regulatory filing, the company disclosed that the FDA has still not informed Amarin whether it plans to hold an AdCom meeting to discuss the sNDA seeking an expanded indication for Vascepa in the United States based on the results of the REDUCE-IT study, nor has the FDA informed the company of the subject matter intended to be the focus of a potential AdCom meeting if one were to be scheduled. At the same time, the company affirmed that the FDA is not required to inform sponsor companies that it does not intend to hold an AdCom. As announced in May, the FDA accepted the sNDA for filing and granted Priority Review designation with an assigned PDUFA goal date of September 28, 2019.17:17AUTL Autolus Therapeutics files for $300 mln mixed securities shelf offering (15.91 -0.04)17:04CCK Crown misses by $0.01, reports revs in-line; guides Q3 EPS below consensus; lowers FY19 EPS to below consensus (59.38 -0.84)Reports Q2 (Jun) earnings of $1.46 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.01 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.47; revenues fell 0.4% year/year to $3.04 bln vs the $3.04 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Co sees Q3 EPS of $1.50 to $1.60, excluding non-recurring items, vs. $1.70 S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Co sees FY19 EPS of $5.05 to $5.20, excluding non-recurring items, vs. $5.28 S&P Capital IQ Consensus. The revision compared to the previous full year earnings estimate of $5.20-$5.40 per share is primarily due to lower projected full year results than expected in European Food and Transit Packaging. While the second half of 2019 is expected to be somewhat better than the same period in 2018, European Food will not fully recover shortfalls experienced in the first half. In Transit Packaging, the Company is now expecting that second half performance will trail the prior year based on recent market sentiment. Adjusted free cash flow, as defined below, is currently expected to be approximately $725 million to $750 million for 2019."To meet volume requirements in our North American beverage can business, we have begun the construction of a third high-speed line at our Nichols, New York facility which will begin production during the second quarter of 2020. Also to support demand growth and targeted for a first quarter 2020 start-up, we will convert an existing two-piece steel food can production line at our Weston, Ontario plant to produce aluminum beverage cans."17:02W Wayfair announces retirement of COO James Savarese; appoints Thomas Netzer as successor (152.00 +2.05)Mr. Savarese, Chief Operating Officer, and John Mulliken, Chief Technology Officer, will retire from the company in 2019.

Mr. Mulliken will remain to support the transition through October 15.17:01ASH Ashland warns about third quarter results in personal care and certain industrial end markets within the Specialty Ingredients segment; lowers FY19 EBITDA guidance (77.67 -0.71)Sees Q3 adj. EPS $0.76-0.78 vs. $0.86 consensus. EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $138 million to $142 million. For the fiscal third quarter, lower-than-anticipated sales in personal care and certain industrial end markets within Specialty Ingredients led to weaker-than- expected results for Ashland. In this context, production volumes were reduced to match demand. As a result of the weaker-than-expected market conditions globally, Ashland now expects fiscal year 2019 Adjusted EBITDA for Specialty Ingredients to be in the range of $560 million to $570 million, down from 585-610 mln. We expect a more normalized growth environment to resume during the first half of fiscal year 2020.

Sonoco made a contribution earlier this year, bringing the funded level of the Inactive Plan to 97%, and the remaining funding of the Inactive Plan is expected to occur by the end of 2020.16:23WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryThe S&P 500 lost 0.6% on Wednesday, pressured by noticeable losses in the transport stocks after CSX Corp. (CSX 71.38, -8.17, -10.3%) provided disappointing earnings results and guidance. The broader market traded modestly lower for most of the day with losses accelerating into the close.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5%, the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.5%, and the Russell 2000 lost 0.7%.CSX was presumably the biggest influence on the transports, but earnings warnings from trucking companies Knight-Swift (KNX 35.08, -0.81, -2.3%) and Covenant Transport (CVTI 14.65, -0.51, -3.4%) also contributed to the negative sentiment. Strikingly, the transports were among the best performers yesterday amid easing concerns about a downturn in the sector.Evidently, the negative-minded guidance brought out the naysayers, yielding losses across the space and big losses in shares of road and rail companies like Union Pacific (UNP 164.55, -10.60, -6.1%) and Norfolk Southern (NSC 191.02, -15.44, -7.5%). The Dow Jones Transportation Average lost 3.6%, wiping out its monthly advance.The S&P 500 industrials sector (-2.2%) was Wednesday's outright laggard, nearly doubling the losses of the second-worst performing energy sector (-1.2%). There were some bright spots in the space, though. Top-weighted component Boeing (BA 369.52, +6.77) rose 1.9% on no specific news catalyst, while United Airlines (UAL 94.78, +0.86, +0.9%) and Cintas (CTAS 260.37, +20.93, +8.7%) advanced on better-than-expected earnings results.The S&P 500 utilities (+0.4%) and health care (+0.02%) sectors were the lone sectors that finished higher. Abbott Labs (ABT 85.76, +2.60, +3.3%) gave the health care sector some support after pleasing investors with its earnings results.Despite earnings-related gains in Bank of America (BAC 29.19, +0.20, +0.7%) and U.S. Bancorp (USB 54.22, +1.18, +2.2%), the S&P 500 financial sector (-0.9%) was unable to gain any ground. Most components finished lower, as the decline in U.S. Treasury yields, and some curve-flattening, weighed on the sector.The 2-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield declined six basis points to 2.06%. The U.S. Dollar Index lost 0.2% to 97.21. WTI crude lost 1.4% to $56.78/bbl.Separately, The Wall Street Journal published a report right before the close, indicating that the U.S. and China remain conflicted about restrictions on Huawei Technologies. The report may have contributed to the increased selling into the close.Reviewing Wednesday's economic data, which included Housing Starts and Building Permits for June, the Fed's Beige Book for July, and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index:Housing starts declined 0.9% m/m in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.253 million units (Briefing.com consensus 1.270 million) while building permits declined 6.1% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.220 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million).The key takeaway from the report is that the single-family supply dynamic will remain a limiting issue for the overall housing market as single-family starts were down 0.8% yr/yr while single-family permits were down 4.7% yr/yr.The Federal Reserve's Beige Book for July described the expansion of overall economic activity as "modest." Most Districts reported a slight increase in sales of retail goods while vehicle sales were little changed. Tourism was described as "broadly solid" while reports concerning the transportation sector were mixed. Home sales increased slightly while construction was little changed. Loan demand increased in all but two Districts.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index declined 1.1% following a 2.4% decline in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the Philadelphia Fed Index for July, and the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index for June on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +23.4% YTDS&P 500 +19.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +16.7% YTDRussell 2000 +15.0% YTD16:22EBAY eBay beats by $0.06, reports revs in-line; guides Q3 EPS in-line, revs below consensus; raises FY19 EPS guidance for the second quarter in a row, lowers revs guidance (39.03 -0.89)Reports Q2 (Jun) earnings of $0.68 per share, $0.06 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.62; revenues rose 1.8% year/year to $2.69 bln vs the $2.67 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

On a pro forma basis, fleet productivity increased 0.7%, reflecting improvements in rental rates and fleet mix, partially offset by lower time utilization, primarily due to acquisition integration activities and adverse weather. Co lowers guidance for FY19, sees FY19 revs of $9.15-9.45 bln (Prior $9.15-9.55 bln) vs. $9.36 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Adj-EBITDA of $4.35-4.5 bln (Prior $4.35-4.55 bln)"Our updates to guidance reflect a slightly slower than expected pace for the BlueLine integration, as well as historically bad weather in several key regions this past quarter.

In Q3, co expects benefits from higher volumes and lower costs for raw materials and maintenance in the Alumina and Bauxite segments. In the Aluminum segment, co expects improvements primarily from lower alumina costs. Co continues to project a global aluminum deficit, ranging 1.0-1.4 mln metric tons, down from last quarter's estimate of a deficit of 1.5-1.9 mln metric tons. Global aluminum demand growth for 2019 is estimated to range between +1.25-2.25%, down from +2-3% in the previous quarter, driven by lower demand in both China and the world ex-China due to trade tensions and macroeconomic headwinds. Even so, aluminum inventories, measured in days of consumption, continue to decline and are expected by year's end to reach levels not seen in more than a decade.16:16IBM IBM beats by $0.09, reports revs in-line; reaffirms FY19 EPS guidance of at least $13.90 (143.09 -0.40)Reports Q2 (Jun) earnings of $3.17 per share, $0.09 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $3.08; revenues fell 4.0% year/year to $19.2 bln vs the $19.2 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Reports Cloud & Cognitive Software up 3.2% (up 5.4% adjusting for currency); Global Business Services up 0.5% (up 3.4% adjusting for currency).Gross profit margin up 100 basis points to 47%, largest yr/yr expansion in more than 5 years.Continues to expect Red Hat, including related activity, to be accretive to free cash flow in the first year, and accretive to operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share by the end of the second year after closing, as previously stated.Co reaffirms guidance for FY19, sees EPS of at least $13.90 vs. $13.90 S&P Capital IQ Consensus.16:13NFLX Netflix beats by $0.05, reports revs in-line, misses subscriber forecast; guides Q3 EPS and revs in-line, subs just above estimates; reaffirms FCF, operating margin (362.44 -3.55)Reports Q2 (Jun) earnings of $0.60 per share, $0.05 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.55; revenues rose 26.0% year/year to $4.92 bln vs the $4.93 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

We don't believe competition was a factor since there wasn't a material change in the competitive landscape during Q2, and competitive intensity and our penetration is varied across regions (while our over-forecast was in every region). Rather, we think Q2's content slate drove less growth in paid net adds than we anticipated.

While our US paid membership was essentially flat in Q2, we expect it to return to more typical growth in Q3, and are seeing that in these early weeks of Q3. We forecast Q3 global paid net adds of 7.0m, up vs. 6.1m in Q3'18, with 0.8m in the US and 6.2m internationally.

DCF is expected to be on budget as lower interest expense offsets the slightly lower Adjusted EBITDA. KMI budgeted to invest $3.1 billion in growth projects and contributions to joint ventures during 2019KMI now expects to be slightly below that amount due to lower capital expenditures in the CO2 segment. KMI expects to use internally generated cash flow to fund the vast majority of its 2019 discretionary spending, without the need to access equity markets. Due to the Adjusted EBITDA impact discussed above, KMI now expects to end 2019 with a Net Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio of ~4.6 times.16:10EFC Ellington Financial commenced an underwritten public offering of 3,500,000 shares of common stock (18.30 +0.06)16:10EGHT 8x8 acquires privately-held Wavecell for $125 mln in cash and stock (24.62 -0.42)Wavecell Pte. is a Singapore-based global Communications Platform-as-a-Service (CPaaS) provider. The acquisition provides 8x8 with an established technology platform and high-growth revenue business to pursue CPaaS globally and represents a natural expansion of 8x8's cloud business into the CPaaS market.8x8 acquired Wavecell for total consideration of approx. USD $125 mln, which represents a multiple of less than 4x anticipated Wavecell CY19 revenue. This is comprised of approx. $69 mln in cash and approx. $56 mln in 8x8 common stock, of which approx. $12 mln of common stock is subject to certain vesting restrictions over a three-year period, for a net U.S. GAAP purchase price of approx.

Data show that AL001 elicited a dose-dependent increase in PGRN levels in both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of healthy volunteers and FTD-GRN patients. Specifically, AL001 tripled the level of PGRN in the plasma and doubled the level of PGRN in the CSF of both asymptomatic and symptomatic FTD-GRN patients, restoring the level of PGRN back to the normal range. A Phase 2 clinical trial in FTD-GRN patients is expected to start in the second half of 2019.16:06MGNX MacroGenics provides update on program for flotetuzumab in acute myeloid leukemia (15.17 -0.04)MacroGenics announced that it plans to advance the development of flotetuzumab, its investigational bispecific CD123 x CD3 DART molecule, in patients with primary refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a difficult-to-treat patient population.To date, MacroGenics has enrolled 50 patients at the recommended Phase 2 dose in the Phase 1 monotherapy study, including 30 patients with primary refractory AML. Updated data from this study will be submitted for presentation at the 2019 American Society for Hematology Annual Meeting. MacroGenics plans to meet with the FDA in Q3 to discuss future development of flotetuzumab and to define a potential registration path for this molecule as monotherapy. In parallel, MacroGenics plans to initiate a study in relapsed or refractory AML patients combining flotetuzumab with MGA012, a proprietary anti-PD-1 antibody, as a potential means to both broaden and lengthen the duration of response of AML patients on flotetuzumab; the company is positioned to begin to enroll patients immediately.MacroGenics and Laboratoires Servier will terminate their collaboration and license agreement, with an effective date of January 15, 2020, unless sooner agreed to by the parties. As a result, MacroGenics will regain full global rights to develop and commercialize flotetuzumab.16:06LLNW Limelight Networks misses by $0.01, misses on revs; lowers FY19 EPS and revs guidance (2.75 +0.16)Reports Q2 (Jun) loss of $(0.03) per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.01 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.02); revenues fell 8.6% year/year to $45.9 mln vs the $46.4 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

ASML (218.66 +6.66%): Co's Q2 EPS beat consensus; sales increased +15% yr/yr, in-line with consensus. Co's Q2 results were helped by improved results in EUV manufacturing and higher field upgrade sales, helping to compensate for negative mix effect in comparison with Q1; co sees weakness continuing in Memory for the remainder of the year but expects increased demand in Logic, driven by accelerated investments in 7 nm nodes and beyond. Guided Q3 net sales below consensus. At highest level in almost a year.Large Cap LosersERIC (8.55 -10.84%): Missed consensus for Q2 EPS while beating on revs, which rose +10.0% yr/yr to $54.8 bln.

Co sees 5G momentum increasing. Organic sales declined 3% yr/yr in Digital Services, resulting from "rapid decline in legacy product," while segment gross margin declined in connection with a change in sales mix. Posts its lowest levels since January.CSX (71.86 -9.67%): Co's Q2 EPS and revs each missed consensus. Co's revenue decline (fell 1.4% yr/yr to $3.06 bln) was connected to weakness in its Intermodal category.

The S&P 500 is currently at its lows for the session. The biggest drag on the proceedings have been the transportation stocks, evidenced by the 3.4% decline in the Dow Jones Transportation Average.Transports have been broadsided by the disappointing results and guidance from railroad operator CSX Corp. (CSX 71.75, -7.80, -9.8%), as well as earnings warnings from truckers Knight-Swift (KNX 35.03, -0.86, -2.4%) and Covenant Transport (CVTI 14.51, -0.65, -4.3%), which have overshadowed the encouraging report from United Airlines (UAL 94.53, +0.61, +0.7%).The weight of the transports has taken the S&P 500 industrials sector (-2.0%) noticeably lower. This sector, however, is the only sector that has declined at least 1.0%, which also goes to show that this is far from a washout day.Separately, the financial sector (-0.7%) has been on the defensive despite the gain registered by Bank of America (BAC 29.45, +0.46, +1.6%) following its earnings report. Weakness in the regional banks following a miss by Comerica (CMA 69.36, -2.39, -3.3%), and a drop in market rates that has led to some curve-flattening action in the Treasury market, have been pressure points.The Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.3%; the S&P 500 is down 0.5%; and the Russell 2000 is down 0.8%.15:29SUMRX Earnings out this afternoon/tomorrow morningThis afternoon: AA ADTN BXS CATY CCI CCK CNS EBAY EGBN IBM KMI LLNW NFLX PLXS SLG TBK TCBI UMPQ URI Tomorrow morning: ADS ALLY BBT BMI BX DHR DOV EWBC GATX GPC GTLS HOMB HON IIIN MS MTB NUE NVS PM POOL PPG SAP SASR SBNY SNA SON STI TSM UNH UNP WBS WNS WSO15:24NFLX Netflix will report second quarter results this afternoon (362.95 -3.04)Netflix (NFLX) will report second quarter results in a Letter to Shareholders on its website soon after the bell. The earnings interview with management including Chief Executive Reed Hastings starts at 18:00 ET.Netflix has guided for second quarter EPS of $0.55 (vs. $0.85 last year) with an operating margin of 12.5% (+70 basis points yr/yr) and revenue up 26% to $4.93 bln. Estimates are in-line with guidance.Netflix also guided for 5 mln global paid net subscriber additions (4.7 mln internal and 300K in a saturated US market) vs. 9.6 mln adds in the seasonally strong first quarter 5.45 mln adds in the second quarter of 2018. That would result in almost 154 mln paid subs globally, up 24% yr/yr. Last cquarter, the company beat its first quarter subscriber outlook, guided second quarter revenue and subscribers in-line with estimates but EPS below as content spend shifted into the second quarter.The company guided for an operating margin up 300 bps to 13% in 2019. Netflix expects to burn $3.5 bln in free cash flow (FCF) this year (vs. -$3 bln last year) with improvement each year thereafter, driven by higher subscribers and operating margin expansion. S&P Capital IQ Consensus expects FY19 EPS to grow 26% to $3.40. The Street expects FCF to turn positive in 2022.Guidance for third quarter subscribers will be key; expectations for 6.3 million net subscriber additions would put total paid subscribers at 160 mln. Analysts expect Q3 EPS up 17% to $1.04 with revenue up 31% to $5.24 bln.Some are concerned about competition as Disney+ will launch in November and AT&T's streaming service HBO Max will launch in the Spring of next year. Last quarter, Netflix said that it does not anticipate that new streaming competition from Disney+ (or anyone else like Apple) to materially affect growth "because the transition from linear to on demand entertainment is so massive and because of the differing nature of our content offerings."The loss impending loss of Friends and The Office in Netflix's library have spurred content competition concerns because those two popular shows account for a disproportionate amount of time spent on Netflix.A strong content slate at Netflix offsets these concerns for analysts. Last week, Netflix said Stranger Things 3 broke records with 40.7 mln household accounts watching the show in its first four days. A new season of Orange is the New Black and Martin Scorsese's The Irishman are in the queue.The majority of subscriber growth will come from overseas going forward, so the question in the US is whether domestic subscribers will actual cancel their Netflix subscription. This seems unlikely for most customers.The stock has traded in a fairly narrow range so far this year.Netflix has a ~$160 bln market value and trades at ~55x EBITDA estimates, ~100x EPS estimates and ~8x revenue estimates for 2019. The agressive valuation metrics reflect the company's strong market position ans subscriber growth outlook as the leader in streaming. Netflix has become ubiquitous with its massive subscriber base over 150 million that has essentially supplanted the traditional cable bundle for younger audiences, disrupting the media sector. Investors still see opportunity within the long-term outlook for subscriber growth coupled with more operating leverage down the road. The options market implies a ~7% move in the stock by Friday.15:11BONDX Treasury Market SummaryLonger Tenors Pace Midweek RallyLonger-dated U.S. Treasuries spent the midweek session in a steady ascent while shorter tenors followed with some reluctance. The overall pace of the advance was not very rapid, but longer-dated Treasury futures began inching higher last evening and continued their push today. The overnight session featured another reminder about the deteriorating global trade backdrop, as Singapore reported a 17.3% yr/yr decrease in non-oil exports in June while exports of electronics plunged 31.9% yr/yr. Treasuries padded their early gains after the release of a weaker than expected report on July housing starts and building permits. The first hour of the cash session included an attempted pullback, but Treasuries quickly found support at their starting levels, and headed higher into the early afternoon. 10s and 30s set fresh highs shortly ahead of the close while the 2-yr note spent the day near its morning high. There was an increase in expectations for a 50-bps rate cut on July 31, as the implied probability of such a move increased to 32.8% from 27.1% yesterday. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.2% to 97.22, pausing just above its 50-day moving average (97.19).

House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said she would like the vote on the debt ceiling to take place by next Thursday, ahead of the August recess. Kansas City Fed President and FOMC voter, Esther George, said that she is willing to adjust her view on rates due to growing trade-related uncertainties and weaker growth abroad, according to Reuters. Yonhap reported that the U.S. and South Korea are preparing for a joint military exercise. The preparations have been criticized by North Korea's Foreign Ministry. Eurozone's June CPI increased 0.2% m/m (expected 0.1%; last 0.1%), growing 1.3% yr/yr (expected 1.2%; last 1.2%). June Core CPI increased 0.4% m/m (expected 0.3%; last 0.3%), rising 1.1% yr/yr (expected 1.1%; last 0.8%). U.K.'s June CPI was unchanged m/m (expected 0.3%; last 0.3%), but increased 2.0% yr/yr, as expected (last 2.0%). June Core CPI increased 1.8% yr/yr, as expected (last 1.7%). June House Price Index increased 1.2% yr/yr, as expected (last 1.5%). Italy's May Industrial New Orders increased 2.5% m/m (expected -1.4%; last -2.2%) but fell 2.5% yr/yr (expected -4.2%; last -0.2%). May Industrial Sales increased 1.6% m/m (expected -0.5%; last -1.1%), growing 0.3% yr/yr (expected -2.5%; last -0.8%). Today's Data: Housing starts declined 0.9% m/m in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.253 million units (Briefing.com consensus 1.270 million) while building permits declined 6.1% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.220 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million). In both cases, the weakness was driven by multi-unit dwellings. Single-family starts were actually up 3.5% m/m to 847,000 while single-family permits increased 0.4% m/m. The key takeaway from the report is that the single-family supply dynamic will remain a limiting issue for the overall housing market as single-family starts were down 0.8% yr/yr while single-family permits were down 4.7% yr/yr. The Federal Reserve's Beige Book for July described the expansion of overall economic activity as "modest." Most Districts reported a slight increase in sales of retail goods while vehicle sales were little changed. Tourism was described as "broadly solid" while reports concerning the transportation sector were mixed. Home sales increased slightly while construction was little changed. Loan demand increased in all but two Districts. The weekly MBA Mortgage Index decreased 1.1% after decreasing by 2.4% during the previous week.

The street is looking for Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $1.28 and revenue of $6.00 bln. On June 17, NUE guided to EPS of $1.20-1.25, which was below consensus at the time. Nucor said it was seeing stable end use markets, although some softening in automotive.In terms of key recent developments, in late June, Nucor announced a $40 per ton price increase, effective immediately, on all flat-rolled products, according to Steel Market Update. We are a bit skeptical if this price increase can hold in light of the difficult market conditions. But any color on this issue during the call will be key.Another key item to look for is whether customers are actually buying new steel rather than just working down existing inventories. That has been a problem in the market as steel buyers seem confident that steel prices are going to fall further so they are waiting it out. Also, scrap prices have been falling (a key raw material to make new steel) and steel buyers know that if scrap prices fall then end steel prices are likely to fall also.In terms of end markets, in its mid-June guidance, Nucor said end demand was stable across most markets. However, automotive is seeing some softening. The bigger issue is that steel service centers are destocking inventory rather than buying new steel.Given its large size and early reporting date, Nucor is seen as a key barometer for other steel producers and their upcoming reports. Steel Dynamics (STLD) is NUE's closest competitor (STLD reports on July 22 after the close). Other names to watch include steel producers (AKS, CMC, GGB, MT, PKX, SCHN, X) and steel processors (ROCK, RS, RYI, WOR, ZEUS).14:41SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Nu Skin (NUS) falls on downside guidance -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersPAAS (15 +7.07%): Silver and gold stocks outperform; co's stock sees its highest levels in almost five months, and the Global X Silver Miners ETF (SIL) adds gains of circa +4% to recent strength to reach its highest level in almost a year.MDB (161.27 +6.36%): Trades higher alongside a number of software peers; reaches up from its recent range to touch its new highest level for July.

Co noted that the Chinese government's 100-day campaign implemented earlier this year to review the industry restricted co's sales meetings -- impacting Q2 more than co had foreseen, as approvals for meetings ultimately remained more limited than co had expected -- and led to increased media scrutiny, which has imparted negative influence on consumer sentiment.

Activity in the nonfinancial services sector rose further. Although some Districts continued to report healthy expansion in the transportation sector, others noted that activity declined modestly. On balance, home sales picked up somewhat, but residential construction activity was flat. Nonresidential construction activity increased or remained strong in most reporting Districts, and commercial rents rose. Manufacturing production was generally flat, but a few Districts noted a modest pickup in activity since the last reporting period. Agricultural output declined modestly following unusually heavy rainfall in some areas, and oil and gas production fell somewhat.Increased demand for loans was broad-based, with all but two Districts noting some growth in financing activity. The outlook generally was positive for the coming months, with expectations of continued modest growth, despite widespread concerns about the possible negative impact of trade-related uncertainty.Employment and WagesOn balance, employment grew at a modest pace, slightly slower than the previous reporting period. The reports noted continued worker shortages across most sectors, especially in construction, information technology, and health care. However, some manufacturing and information technology firms in the Northeast reduced their number of workers. A few reports highlighted concerns about securing and renewing work visas, flagging this as a source of uncertainty for continued employment growth. Compensation grew at a modest-to-moderate pace, similar to the last reporting period, although some contacts emphasized significant increases in entry-level wages. Most District reports also noted that employers expanded benefit packages in response to the tight labor market conditions.PricesThe reports indicated that the rate of price inflation was stable to down slightly from the prior reporting period.Districts generally saw some increases in input costs, stemming from higher tariffs and rising labor costs. However, firms' ability to pass on cost increases to final prices was restrained by brisk competition.Reduced supply boosted prices for some agricultural goods. Reports on transportation costs were mixed, with some Districts noting increased upward pricing pressures, while others highlighted price declines due to reduced demand for shipping services. Prices for professional and business services fell slightly, and steel and lumber prices softened due to lower demand.14:00ECONX Fed Beige Book- Economic activity expanding at a modest pace; little change from prior period13:49UNH UnitedHealth Second Quarter Earnings Preview (267.48 +2.82)United Healthcare (UNH) will report earnings tomorrow before the open. There is a conference call scheduled for 8:45 ET. Q2 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $3.46 (+10.2% yr/yr) on revenue of $60.6 bln (+8% yr/yr). The company will also update its guidance for FY19 which currently stands at $14.50-14.75. FY19 Capital IQ consensus stands at $14.73 (+14% yr/yr). Looking back, UNH has not missed on EPS in several years, and only missed on revenues 2 times over the past 3 years. The operating cost ratio of 14.1% in first quarter 2019 improved 130 basis points from its first quarter 2018 level, due to the deferral of the health insurance tax and strong cost management disciplines. UNH shares initially rallied following earnings last quarter, but the reversed after the company acknowledged on a conference call that "Medicare For All" being proposed by Democrats would destabilize the health care system. However, only 4 out of the 20 Democratic candidates in a recent debate showed support for abolishing private health insurance in favor of a government run health insurance plan. Any such policy action would require a simple majority in the House, 60 votes in the Senate, and a President's signature. Some of the candidates who did not support such a policy are sitting Democratic Senators or Congressional lawmakers. UNH shares have since rallied 24% since Q1 conference call vs gain in the S&P of 3%.In addition, health insurers and hospital stocks are awaiting a ruling from the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in Louisiana. The NY Times reported that the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals appears likely to uphold Texas ruling that the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional, but are still in question about voiding the entire law. Ultimately, this case would end up at the Supreme Court in 2020.Based on the UNH Jul $260 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~3% in either direction by July expiration (Friday, July 19).On a positive report, look for resistance near the $268-272 area, while support sits near the $248-250. UNH has a market cap of $248 billion and trades at 17 times earnings vs HUM at 16 times and CI at 11 times earnings.13:45PM Philip Morris International Second Quarter Earnings Preview (81.08 -0.50)Phillip Morris (PM) is expected to report second quarter earnings tomorrow before the open. Q2 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $1.33 (-6.8% yr/yr) on revenue of $7.42 bln (-3.9% yr/yr). The company is expected to update its guidance for FY19 which currently stands at $5.15 vs $5.14 Capital IQ consensus (roughly in line with FY18). Phillip Morris is 100% international. Therefore, FDA regulation has no impact on the company. Earlier this year, PM made an urgent call to action to smokers, nonsmokers, regulators and agents of change across the world to drive a better future for the world's 1.1 bln smokers and their families, loved ones and communities. They said if you do not smoke you shouldn't start, and if you smoke you should quit.Looking back, PM has not missed on EPS since Q4 of 2017, but they missed once on revenues (last quarter) out of the last 4 quarters. Q1 cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume of 175.8 bln units, up by 1.1%, reflecting: Flat cigarette shipment volume of 164.3 bln units Heated tobacco unit shipment volume of 11.5 bln units, up by 1.9 bln units or 20.2.Based on the PM Jul $81.0 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~4% in either direction by July expiration (Friday, July 19).On a positive report, look for resistance near the $86.50-87.00 area, while support sits near the $79.00-79.50 vicinity.Phillip Morris has a market cap of ~$127 bln and trades at 16x earnings versus Atria (MO) at 14x earnings.13:27AA Alcoa: Earnings Preview -- Aluminum prices have been sluggish which has weighed on the stock (23.16 -0.17)Alcoa (AA), a major aluminum producer, is set to report Q2 results today after the close with a call at 5pm ET. Last quarter, Alcoa reported at 16:10 ET, or 10 minutes after the close, so it should be around then.The street is looking for a Q2 loss of $(0.02) per share and revenue of $2.78 bln. Consensus for Adjusted EBITDA is approximately $436 mln for Q2 and for the full year consensus is $1.86 bln. What's notable to us is that Alcoa has provided a full year Adjusted EBITDA outlook in the past. However, due to unprecedented market volatility, Alcoa has decided not to provide the guidance. While not providing specific Q2 guidance, Alcoa has said that it expects favorable improvements in Q2 from third-party energy sales in Brazil and lower alumina costs to the Aluminum segment. In addition, the company expects moderate benefits from declines in raw material prices, primarily in the Alumina segment. Last quarter, Alcoa lowered its aluminum demand outlook for 2019 to +2-3% from +3-4%, predominantly due to lower demand growth in China. Alcoa said it continues to project a balanced market in China and maintains a deficit estimate for the rest of the world between 1.7-1.9 mln metric tons, as lower demand growth is offset by lower production expectations in Europe and South America. Alcoa also described a frustrating trend. Basically, there has been a consistent decline in global inventories over the last decade with days of consumption now approaching pre-crisis levels and it has been accelerating the last two years. Aluminum prices, however, have remained stubbornly unreactive thus far due to the volume of Chinese aluminum exports hitting the global market. Partly because it does not guide and partly because aluminum is a difficult market to predict (aluminum prices move around a lot as does alumina raw material costs), Alcoa tends to be pretty volatile relative to consensus estimates. After two misses in 3Q17 and 4Q17, Alcoa posted sizeable EPS beats in each of the four quarters in 2018, by a range of $0.09-0.29 per share. However, it reported a $0.10 miss in Q1, so it's all over the map. On a final note, the stock has been roughly cut in half over the past year as sluggish aluminum prices weigh on Alcoa. The good news is that the stock has stabilized over the past two months as investors wait to hear AA's outlook for 2H19 before deciding what to do with the stock.

Earnings have come in mostly better-than-expected, but there appears to be a lack of conviction among investors for a market that isn't too far from record highs.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%, the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%, and the Russell 2000 is down 0.4%.The S&P 500 industrials sector (-1.7%) has been a noticeable drag on the broader market as transport stocks fall on disappointing results and guidance from CSX Corp. (CSX 70.99, -8.56, -10.8%). The Dow Jones Transportation Average is down 3.1% amid losses in all but one component, namely United Airlines (UAL 94.58, +0.70, +0.7%) after it beat earnings expectations.Despite the overall weakness in the industrials sector, there are still some notable gainers, including Boeing (BA 366.83, +4.08, +1.1%) and Cintas (CTAS 257.85, +18.41, +7.7%). Cintas is up big after pleasing investors with positive earnings results.Similarly, the positive reactions to earnings from Bank of America (BAC 29.49, +0.49, +1.7%), U.S. Bancorp (UBS 54.55, +1.52, +2.9%), and PNC (PNC 141.27, +2.51, +1.8%) have helped the financial sector (-0.4%) come off its session lows (-1.0%).Elsewhere, the S&P 500 information technology sector (+0.2%) is getting some help from the semiconductor stocks. The health care sector (+0.4%) is receiving some support from Abbott Labs (ABT 86.19, +3.03, +3.6%) following its earnings report. The utilities sector (+0.7%) is benefiting from lower U.S. Treasury yields.Currently, the 2-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield is down six basis points to 2.06%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.2% to 97.19. WTI crude is down 0.7% to $57.22/bbl.Reviewing today's economic data, which included Housing Starts and Building Permits for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index:Housing starts declined 0.9% m/m in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.253 million units (Briefing.com consensus 1.270 million) while building permits declined 6.1% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.220 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million).The key takeaway from the report is that the single-family supply dynamic will remain a limiting issue for the overall housing market as single-family starts were down 0.8% yr/yr while single-family permits were down 4.7% yr/yr.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index declined 1.1% following a 2.4% decline in the prior week.As a reminder, the Fed's Beige Book for July will be released at 2:00 p.m. ET.12:56HON Honeywell to report Q2 results tomorrow morning (170.19 -4.60)Honeywell (HON 170.19, -4.60, -2.6%) will report its Q2 results tomorrow morning, followed by a conference call at 8:30 ET.The Capital IQ consensus expects the industrial conglomerate to report a yr/yr EPS contraction of 1.9% to $2.08 on a 14.2% yr/yr decrease in revenue to $9.37 bln. The company has surpassed EPS and revenue estimates for nine consecutive quarters. In addition to beating Q1 estimates in April, the company increased its EPS (to $7.90-8.15 from $7.80-8.10) and revenue guidance (from $36.5 bln-$37.2 bln to $36.0 bln to $36.9 bln) for FY19. The improved guidance was reaffirmed on May 14. Honeywell's improved outlook helped shares maintain an upward bias over the past three months, with a fresh record high being notched on July 3. On April 29, Honeywell's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 bln of common stock. The $10 bln authorization includes $2.3 bln that the company had remaining under its previous buyback authorization. Investors will be curious to hear if the company maintains its guidance for FY19, considering there has been no progress in trade talks with China since Honeywell reaffirmed its outlook in mid-May. Meanwhile, concerns about the health of the global economy have remained in place.Shares of Honeywell slid below their 50-day moving average (171.73) today, suggesting some caution is being employed ahead of tomorrow's release of Q2 results. The stock trades at 20.5x forward earnings expectations, which represents a healthy premium to United Technologies' (UTX 131.24, -1.95, -1.5%) 15.9x and a smaller premium relative to 3M's (MMM 175.72, -0.77, -0.4%) 18.0x forward multiple.12:39XRT 52-week highs/lows among retailers (42.74 -0.39)All-time highs: ULTA +1.8%, COST +0.2%, DG +0.0% 52-week lows: LEVI -5.5%, BBBY -5.5%, HOME -5%, GME -5%, JWN -3%12:00SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (79) outpacing new lows (38) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ACC, ACGL, ACIA, APLS, ATNX, AZO, BMA, CMG, COST, CPT, CUBE, CVI, DRE, EGP, EHTH, ELS, ENPH, ESS, FICO, FIS, FR, FSLR, GGAL, GPN, GWR, HLNE, IPHI, KAR, LBRDA, LII, LPG, LPT, LSCC, MA, MAA, MDC, MTH, NGL, NOW, OTEX, PAGS, PAYC, PI, PSA, RE, REXR, RGLD, RPD, SAGE, SE, SNAP, SNPS, SPWR, STAR, SUI, TEAM, TLK, TSS, V, VEON, WELL, WK, WMT, WP, AWF, DNP, JPC, JPS, LBRDK, NAC, NAD, NMZ, NVG, PARR, PLAN, SMAR, TWNK, UTF, VGMStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ABEO, AERI, AHT, AKBA, AMC, AR, CAL, CBB, CC, COHU, CRCM, MR, FET, FPRX, GPOR, GTE, INFN, INGN, LE, LMNX, NLS, NOAH, PETS, RES, RRC, RYAM, SBH, SPN, SSL, SWN, TEN, TUP, USNA, WFTIQ, ALTM, AVYA, GTT, NOGThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: ADUS, ARD, BFZ, HPS, HTD, JPI, LEO, MUC, NKX, VKIThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: CEL, SHIETFs that traded to 52 week highs: DIA, ENZL, EWZ, FDN, ICF, IGV, IHI, IWF, IYF, KIE, MUB, OEF, PBW, QQQ, RSX, RTH, SPY, UYG, VTI, XLK, XLY11:59SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Inovio Pharma (INO) sinks on realignment initiatives -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersAVRO (22.39 +16.86%): The stock rallies for a third consecutive session following positive data from its trials of AVR-RD-01 investigational gene therapy in Fabry disease, today setting three-month highs -- up circa +57% this week -- even after announcing a public offering of 6.5 mln shares of its common stock, priced at $18.50/share, with proceeds intended to support co's current programs in Fabry disease, Gaucher disease, cystinosis, and Pompe disease, among other items.FSM (3.54 +11.32%): Continued rally for co and the silver space more broadly; gold stocks also largely push higher. (Related: SVM, AG...)MTSI (17.01 +9.39%): Upgraded to Overweight from Neutral and price target raised to $21 at Piper Jaffray.Small Cap LosersINO (2.65 -11.83%): Co, opting to focus on developing its late-stage HPV assets and to reallocate capital toward fast-to-market product candidates, has cut selected early-stage R&D programs and discontinued further development of its Phase 1/2 study in advanced bladder cancer. The cost-cutting move will reduce co's annual burn-rate by 25% and its workforce by 28%. Co continues to expect near-term value drivers later this year that include interim data from Phase 2 studies targeting HPV-related vulvar and anal dysplasia and from its Phase 2 GBM study.FTSV (8.93 -11.76%): Commenced public offering of $75 mln of shares of its common stock.

Results revealed that patients treated with ANAVEX2-73 had high levels of two gut microbiota families, Ruminococcaceae and Porphyromonadaceae, which were associated with improved activities of daily living (ADCS-ADL) at week 148 (p<0.01 and p<0.04, respectively).Communication between gut microbiota and the brain has been shown to be a critical requirement of a healthy brain function. The reduction in gut microbiota diversity has become one of the hallmarks of aging, and disturbances in its composition are associated with several age-related neurological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease. These changes in the gut microbiota composition induce increased permeability of the gut barrier and immune activation leading to systemic inflammation, which in turn may impair the blood-brain barrier and promote neuroinflammation, neural injury, and ultimately neurodegeneration.11:34MS Morgan Stanley Earnings Preview (43.93 -0.50)Morgan Stanley will report its Q2 earnings tomorrow before the market opens with a conference call to follow at 8:30am ET.Current Capital IQ consensus stands at EPS of $1.16, Net Income of $2.33 bln, on Revenue of $10.02 bln. Morgan Stanley is the last of the major money centers to report Q2 results. Results from peers have been under whelming but expectations had been lowered to an extent that the results are being taken in stride. A strong consumer has led to better performance which may not bode as well for MS and its Investment Banking focus. On the Investment Banking side, peers have continued to see a year over year decline in its trading business with the majority seeing declines in its Fixed Income Currency and Commodity business as well as the equity side. Of note, Goldman Sachs (GS) was able to post a 6% revenue increase in its Equity unit which will have investors closely watching MS' performance in the space. At the firm's annual financial services conference, CEO James Gorman said that Q2 results were unlikely to beat Q1 numbers. Shares of MS have recently crossed across its 200-sma ($43.55) ahead of the Q2 report. The stock has rallied approximately 8% since hitting June lows. It has not been able to press above its $45 level which will line up as a key area of resistance if there is any upside surprise.Capital Return PlanThe capital plan includes the repurchase of up to $6.0 billion of outstanding common stock for the four quarters, beginning in the third quarter of 2019 through the end of the second quarter of 2020, an increase from $4.7 billion for the comparable four quarter period in the 2018 Capital Plan, as well as an increase in the Firm's quarterly common stock dividend to $0.35 per share from the current $0.30 per share, beginning with the common dividend expected to be declared by the Firm's Board of Directors in the third quarter of 2019.Q1 RecapMS reported Q1 (Mar) earnings of $1.33 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.16 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.17. Revenues fell 7.1% year/year to $10.29 bln vs the $9.96 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Equity sales and trading net revenues decreased 21% reflecting declines in prime brokerage driven by lower client balances and decreases in derivatives and cash equities on lower client activity compared with a year ago.Q2 Peer Comps11:27GLW Corning affirms $0.20/share quarterly dividend, announces new $5 bln share-repurchase authorization (32.97 -0.33)11:25DOYU DouYu opened for trading at $11.02 after pricing IPO at $11.5010:42SUMRX Morning Commodities: Oil prices mostly muted following EIA dataCommodities are higher (+0.3% at 79.88 as measured by the Bloomberg Commodity Index)Dollar index is lower (-0.1% at 97.29)Looking at energy:Aug WTI crude oil futures are now +$0.21 (+0.4%) at $57.83/barrel... oil is mostly muted following EIA dataEIA petroleum data for the week ended July 12Crude oil inventories had a draw of 3.1 mln from the prior weekPrior week showed a draw of 9.5 mlnGasoline Inventories had a build of 3.6 mln barrelPrior week had a draw of 1.5 mln barrelDistillate Inventories had a build of 5.7 mlnPrior week had a build of 3.7 mln EIA reportedU.S. oil production fell 300K barrels per day (bpd) to 12.00 mln bpdWe knew there would be some kind of a decline in production since 73% of Gulf oil production was shut down temporarily following Tropical Storm BarryIn other energy, Aug natural gas is +$0.02 (+1.0%) at $2.33/MMBtuMoving on to metals:Aug gold is currently +$4.55 (+0.3%) at $1415.75/oz, while Jul silver is +$0.19 (+1.2%) at $15.86/ozSept copper is now -$0.005 at $2.695/lb10:38TALKX Market Briefing: Industrials, financials, and energy weighing on broader marketThe financial (-0.5%) and energy (-0.6%) sectors are relatively weak today, so it is not surprising to see the Russell 2000 (-0.7%), which is home to many financial and energy stocks, underperform the other major indices. Overall, though, buyers are not an engaged group right now as the indices have drifted lower in the early going.The industrials sector (-1.3%) is the main pocket of weakness as railroad operator CSX Corp.'s (CSX 70.39, -9.16, -11.5%) disappointing earnings report and guidance, along with a Q2 and Q3 earnings warning from trucker Knight-Swift (KNX 35.31, -0.58, -1.6%), have weighed heavily on the transport stocks. Separately, Textron (TXT 50.49, -3.54, -6.6%), which had risen as much as 19% since the end of May, has been hit hard after coming up short of Q2 revenue expectations.The combined weakness of the financial, energy, and industrials sectors has paced a downturn that has taken the S&P 500 back below 3,000. Most sectors, though, are playing a part.Currently, only three sectors -- utilities (+0.4%), health care (+0.4%), and information technology (+0.2%) -- are in positive territory.The Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%; the S&P 500 is down 0.2%; and the Russell 2000 is down 0.7%.10:36IBM IBM Q2 Earnings Preview; Investors Will Have To Wait On Red Hat Comments (142.57 -0.96)Information technology giant IBM is slated to release Q2 results tonight after the bell with a conference call scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. ET.As it stands the current Capital IQ Consensus Estimate calls for Q2 EPS of $3.08 (vs $3.08 a year ago) on revenue declines of 4.0% to $19.20 billion.On last quarter's conference call management offered their view of earnings per share for the year, wherein they assume they'll deliver about 22% in the second quarter, in line with the last couple of years. And then looking at the second half, IBM would expect the growth in EPS to be skewed to the fourth quarter. This assumes the company will close the software divestitures in the second quarter with the gain effectively offset by the foregone profit and the charges for actions to address the structure and stranded costs. In other words, IBM management expects essentially no impact to the second quarter. IBM's FY19 EPS guidance sits at 'at least' $13.90.The big ticket item this quarter is IBM's recently closed deal with software giant Red Hat. IBM's doesn't plan on making comments on the Red Hat deal on this quarter's conference call, instead opting to reveal initial EPS/FCF guidance for the combined entity at an August 2 investor briefing.We'd point out that the revenue from the Red Hat business won't be reflected in this quarterly print as the deal closed after the books were finalized on Q2. As to the Red Hat business, IBM just yesterday announced a potentially deal with AT&T (T) worth "billions" whereby AT&T Communications would use IBM's expertise to modernize AT&T Business Solutions' internal software applications, enabling migrations to the IBM Cloud. In addition, IBM will provide infrastructure to support AT&T Business's applications. AT&T Business will utilize Red Hat's open source platform to manage workloads and applications. The two companies also announced a collaboration on edge computing platforms.Red Hat is primarily a cloud software business, and as such the integration is expected to have a significant impact on the hybrid cloud business which still plays third-fiddle to the likes of Amazon's (AMZN) Wed Services business and Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure.Recent sales declines have reset investor expectations for IBM (3Q18 -- -2.1%, 4Q18 -- -3.5%, and 1Q19 -- -4.7%). Into the Q2 print Wall Street expects falling sales trend to continue. IBM's current market cap sits near $126 bln and trades at about 10.3x its 2019 earnings estimates10:24OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:BIG Jul 25 calls are seeing interest with 1600 contracts trading vs. open int of 30, pushing implied vol up around 4 points to ~48%.

Intermodal revenue fell 11%, primarily due to lane rationalizations. The company cut FY19 revenue guidance to a 1-2% decline from low single digit growth. Chief Executive James Foote referred to the current economic backdrop as puzzling, noting clarity on trade/tariffs would help in the back half of the year.

Transportation stocks tend to be a leading indicator; their recent underperformance relative to the indices at new highs has concerned investors. Economic uncertainty does not bode well for the sector.10:01WIT Wipro Correction: Co beat by INR 0.12; revs in line; guides for Q2 revs from IT services in US dollars (4.22 +0.65)Reports Q1 (Jun) earnings of INR 3.97 per share, INR 0.12 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of INR 3.85; revenues fell 5.0% year/year to INR 147.2 bln vs the INR 147.23 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Co sees Q2 revs from IT services to be $2.04-2.08 bln.Previous comment showed that the company missed on revenues and that comment has been removed.09:44WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Wall Street opens little changed as investors digest earningsThe major averages begin the day little changed as investors digest the latest round of earnings reports. The S&P 500 is flat, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%.An early look inside the S&P 500 shows industrials (-0.8%) underperforming amid weakness in the transport stocks following disappointing results and guidance from CSX Corporation (CSX 72.96, -6.60, -8.3%). Conversely, the defensive-oriented utilities (+0.6%), real estate (+0.4%), and health care (+0.3%) sectors outperform.U.S. Treasuries are slightly higher, pushing yields lower. The 2-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.85%, and the 10-yr yield is down three basis points to 2.09%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 97.34. WTI crude is up 0.8% to $58.10/bbl.09:36CTK CooTek says aware that some of its global portfolio of apps have been temporarily disabled by Google from the Google Play Store and Google Admob (8.11 -1.05)"CooTek takes the matter very seriously and is in continuous communication with Google to clarify the potential misunderstandings. The matter, however, will not affect CooTek's existing users' use of the relevant apps. CooTek also denied allegations by a certain media outlet that 58 of its apps submitted to Google Play in June 2019 engaged in malicious ad activity. CooTek investigated internally, reexamined its apps and found no evidence to support the allegations. The Company confirms that the updated apps it submitted to Google Play in June did not engage in any malicious ad activity. CooTek remains committed to upholding the highest standards in the industry and complying with Google Play developer policies. The Company's priority has always been to protect the interests of its users and enhance the user experience. Pending the restoration of access for some of its global portfolio of apps, CooTek's ability to attract new users and generate revenue from Google Admob may be adversely affected. The actions taken by Google will not affect CooTek's existing users or their ability to use the apps."09:33SCANX Earnings/guidance moversSGEN +11.13% CTAS +6.64% ASML +5.83% ABT +3.37% AMX +3.03% HWC +1.06% BK +2.39% PNC +1.68% BHP +0.97% FNF +0.95% BAC +0.57% WIT +0.48% PNFP +0.18% USB +0.15%NUS -21.14% ERIC -8.24% CSX -8.08% GWB -5.60% CMA -4.46% PGR -3.08% TXT -3.04% KNX -2.79% HOPE -1.29% OMC -1.11% FULT -0.37% UAL -0.40% LFUS -0.26%09:27WIRES On The WiresBlackstone's (BX) secondary and fund solutions business Strategic Partners announced today the final close on over $11 bln for Strategic Partners VIII L.P. and its related committed program vehicles.

The benchmark index is down 1.0% with noticeable weakness in the semiconductor stocks.The Nasdaq Composite is down 1.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 is down 1.4%.President Trump told reporters today that the U.S. will not be doing business with Huawei, which seemed to confirm a Bloomberg report yesterday that the U.S. Commerce Department has been refraining from approving business licenses to work with the Chinese company. The president added that September trade talks could get canceled but are still scheduled for the time being.None of these events has been too surprising for investors, but the prospect of U.S.-China relations further deteriorating has contributed to a steady broad-based decline today.All 11 S&P 500 sectors are down, including eight with losses of at least 1.0%. The information technology sector (-1.5%) is underperforming amid the trade uncertainty, which has also made a noticeable impact on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-2.0%). Many semiconductor companies are heavily exposed to China.Uber (UBER 39.72, -3.23) shares have dropped 7.5% after the company reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss of $5.2 billion. Revenue also missed estimates, but today's loss has simply given back a bulk of yesterday's 8% rally.In other earnings news, shares of DXC Technology (DXC 35.74, -15.90, -30.8%) have plunged over 30% after the company cut its FY20 outlook, while shares of Activision Blizzard (ATVI 47.56, -1.78, -3.6%) trade lower as investors remain underwhelmed by its downside Q3 guidance.The U.S. Treasury market, which has drawn plenty of attention this week, has been muted. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.70%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.2% to 97.43. Interestingly, despite the growth concerns, WTI crude is up 3.7%, or $1.94, to $54.48/bbl.Reviewing today's lone economic report, the Producer Price Index for July:The index for final demand increased 0.2% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, excluding food and energy, decreased 0.1% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). The m/m readings left the index for final demand up 1.7% yr/yr, unchanged from June. The index remains at its lowest level since January 2017. Core PPI was up 2.1% yr/yr, down from 2.3% in June.The key takeaway from the report is that inflationary pressure remains muted.12:53SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: AMRN (20.82 mln -17.35%), NKTR (16.72 mln -33.01%), VRAY (16.28 mln -56.9%)Industrials: GE (47.2 mln -3.06%)Consumer Discretionary: F (25.15 mln -1.36%), FTCH (19.75 mln -41.42%)Information Technology: AMD (54.93 mln +0.88%), NOK (17.11 mln +0.28%), SYMC (15.56 mln +0.57%), DXC (14.71 mln -30.57%), MU (12.35 mln -3.33%), AAPL (11.43 mln -1.13%)Financials: BAC (24.44 mln -1.07%), QQQ (17.87 mln -1.5%), TQQQ (16.4 mln -4.53%), SQQQ (12.92 mln +4.48%)Energy: CHK (27.62 mln +0.34%), RIG (14.88 mln -4.15%)Consumer Staples: ABEV (16.79 mln -0.2%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: VRAY (13.64x -56.9%), NKTR (10.16x -33.01%), SIEN (4.23x +18.94%), NVRO (3.47x +16.54%)Industrials: WAIR (14.57x +6.88%)Consumer Discretionary: FTCH (10.92x -41.42%), WTRH (5.33x -62.1%), QSR (4.44x -3.09%), PLYA (3.69x -2.52%), CHUY (3.58x +10.27%)Information Technology: DXC (6.38x -30.57%), XELA (4.18x -43.08%), CISN (4.1x -23.4%), ALTR (4.07x -15.05%)Financials: PMT (7.44x -3.18%), SMFG (4.36x -1.31%)Energy: PUMP (4.6x -30.59%)Consumer Staples: PRMW (3.67x +7.05%)12:52SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: PBYI (11.1 +20.52%), SIEN (5.94 +18.94%), LXRX (1.5 +17.19%), NVRO (73.82 +16.54%), TXMD (3.04 +15.15%), TRXC (1.02 +13.33%), TRHC (66.44 +12.05%), CYRX (22.39 +10.95%), OMER (17.86 +9.5%), DVAX (3.32 +9.42%), DPLO (5.8 +9.02%)Consumer Discretionary: OSTK (24.12 +13.27%), CHUY (26.3 +10.27%), AGS (9.16 +10.17%), FRGI (10.84 +8.94%)Information Technology: APPN (50.08 +15.82%), PCTY (110.93 +9.41%)Financials: GDOT (29.92 +9.12%), GGAL (38.07 +8.93%)Energy: WFT (0.02 +9.52%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: VRAY (2.91 -56.9%), NKTR (19.81 -33.01%), AMRN (14.72 -17.35%)Industrials: VSLR (7.5 -19.35%), AAXN (57.31 -16.23%), TPC (9.32 -15.7%)Consumer Discretionary: WTRH (1.43 -62.1%), FTCH (10.69 -41.42%), MAT (11.54 -14.07%)Information Technology: XELA (1.39 -43.08%), DXC (35.86 -30.57%), CNDT (6.03 -30.37%), CISN (7.55 -23.4%), VRTU (35.83 -17.8%), ALTR (35.67 -15.05%), DBX (18.65 -13.09%)Energy: PUMP (12.04 -30.59%)12:23LLY Eli Lilly announces favorable U.S. Court of Appeals Alimta ruling (112.66 -1.31)The co announced that the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in favor of Lilly, confirming that the Alimta (pemetrexed for injection) vitamin regimen patent would be infringed by competitors that had stated their intent to market alternative salt forms of pemetrexed prior to the patent's expiration in May 2022. The ruling came in the appeals of U.S. District Court decisions in the cases of Eli Lilly and Company v. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) and Eli Lilly and Company v. Hospira (PFE). Previous rulings in Lilly's favor had precluded the generic companies from launching the alternative salt forms until the patent expires. If the patent is ultimately upheld through all remaining challenges, Alimta would maintain U.S. exclusivity until May 2022, preventing marketing of generic products for as long as the patent remains in force.12:10SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (128) outpacing new lows (110) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ACAD, AEM, AIZ, AJRD, AMT, APPN, AVP, AWK, AWR, AXS, AYX, AZN, AZUL, BAH, BAM, BLDP, BLL, BRFS, CB, CCI, CECO, CIM, CINF, CME, CMG, CMS, COLD, CTAS, CUBE, CYTK, EIX, ELS, ENPH, EQIX, ES, EXR, FLT, FMC, FNF, HAE, HCP, HIG, LHX, HSY, ICE, IDA, KGC, LAUR, LNT, MCD, MELI, MKC, MLM, MODN, NEE, NEO, NTRA, NVCR, NVRO, OAK, PCTY, PODD, PRO, PSA, QTS, RGLD, RLI, RNR, ROKU, RPM, SAM, SBAC, SEDG, SHOP, SHW, SIGI, SO, SRC, STE, STOR, SUI, SVM, SWCH, TERP, TFX, TSN, TTD, VRSK, WEC, WELL, WK, WM, WPC, WPM, EVRG, WST, WTR, ZBH, ZTS, AQN, BHK, BKT, CYRX, EIM, EMB, FNV, FTS, FWONA, FWONK, IIM, IRT, MCR, MVF, MYI, NAC, NAD, NEA, NG, NMZ, NUV, NVG, NZF, OUT, PVG, RNP, RQI, VGM, VMOStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ACRS, ADAP, AEG, AM, AMTD, AR, ASNA, ATI, AXL, B, BRKMY, BCOR, BCS, BIDU, BOX, BT, CCO, CLB, CLVS, CMA, CNDT, COMM, CRESY, CYOU, DLTH, DXC, ENBL, EROS, EXPR, EXTN, FET, FLR, GLNG, GLOG, GMLP, GRPN, GT, GVA, HBM, HIMX, HMHC, HSBC, HSC, ING, JCP, KB, KEP, KMT, KT, LXFR, LYG, M, MAC, MCFT, MIK, MMLP, MMSI, MT, NE, NINE, NKTR, ODP, OEC, OLN, PLT, PRTA, PTEN, PVH, QNST, RGR, RIG, RL, SCHW, SEMG, SIG, SMLP, SSL, SSP, TAST, TECK, TEF, TELL, TGH, TMST, TPC, TRQ, TRUE, TSE, TUSK, VNTR, VRAY, VRTU, VSTO, WETF, WFTIQ, YY, BE, CARS, CEIX, CISN, CLNC, FIXX, FTCH, JHG, KLXE, LTRPA, SDRL, TRIP, WTRH, XELAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AFB, BFK, BUI, KTF, MCA, MQY, NBB, NID, NQP, WIAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: CEA, SHG, SHI, STN, BIOBETFs that traded to 52 week highs: EMB, FXY, IYR, UREETFs that traded to 52 week lows: FXB, XES11:45SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Farfetch (FTCH) sinks following second quarter press -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersAPPN (48.93 +13.16%): Topped consensus for Q2 EPS and revs (+11.7% yr/yr to $66.9 mln); issued mixed guidance for Q3 (sees revs above consensus, EPS below); raised its FY19 revs guidance, increasing its view of both subscription and total revenue for the year.

Posts all-time lows. NKTR (19.73 -33.29%): Reported mixed Q2 results. Co then disclosed a manufacturing issue: a suboptimal batch of in-process intermediate was used to produce two lots of bempegaldesleukin, which ultimately led to the softening of response rates in the PIVOT-02 study. The issue was restricted to the single batch of intermediates using lots two and five. Co has developed a comprehensive control strategy to limit variances in raw materials, intermediates, and the final product going forward. Downgraded at Mizuho, Jefferies, and JP Morgan.

Co's yr/yr decrease in US revenue (fell 2% to $78.1 mln) was associated with customer destocking associated with co's previously announced decision to alter its practice regarding certain high-volume product orders. Patient trial procedures increased +15% yr/yr while permanent implant procedures increased +10%.Small Cap LosersVRAY (3.25 -51.78%): Reported below consensus Q2 EPS and upside revs (+83.5% yr/yr to $30.17 mln).

WTRH (1.95 -48.14%): Missed consensus for Q2 EPS and revs (+216.7% yr/yr to $51.3 mln) and lowered its FY19 revs view below consensus, citing delays to the roll-out of planned revenue initiatives, additional time needed to integrate the Bite Squad merger, and current competitive dynamics.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -40.00.The S&P 500 is up 0.2% for the week, but is on track to lose those slim gains at the open with the S&P 500 futures currently trading ten points, or 0.3%, below fair value.The decline in the futures could be a breather considering that the S&P 500 climbed 112 points, or 4.0%, over a two-day span. Of course, that advance followed a sharp sell-off that had many market participants blaming trade tensions, which are not helpful for economic growth prospects. In either case, the decline is modest and futures do not necessarily predict intraday action.Uber (UBER 40.12, -2.85, -6.7%) shares rose over 8% yesterday heading into its earnings report, which included a $5.2 billion quarterly loss.

Before this communication, the FDA had been silent as to whether it would convene an AdCom in connection with its review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. The FDA expressed, based on the timing of its recent decision to convene an AdCom, that November 14th is the earliest date on which it could hold an AdCom due to scheduling constraints for such a meeting.Accordingly, Amarin does not expect the FDA to take action on the sNDA by the previously announced September 28, 2019 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date. Amarin did not receive notice from the FDA of a PDUFA date extension. In light of the tentative AdCom date, Amarin anticipates that the PDUFA date will be extended, assuming a typical three-month extension, to a date in late December 2019. If so, this anticipated revised PDUFA date timing would offset three of the four months that were expected to be gained from FDA's earlier determination to conduct a priority review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. Prior to such determination, Amarin had expected a PDUFA goal date in January 2020, based on a standard 10-month review. Amarin plans to update the investment community after appropriately definitive information is available related to a new PDUFA date.Amarin intends to continue to move forward with its plans to double the size of its sales force to support the launch of Vascepa. Amarin plans to use the anticipated three-month delay in the PDUFA clock to better prepare for the assumed launch of Vascepa including more time to hire and train new sales representatives. To the extent that new sales managers and representatives are hired prior to the expanded label for Vascepa, Amarin intends to have them join the company's existing sales team in promoting Vascepa based on its current indication and existing promotional messaging.16:30EB Eventbrite appoints Lanny Baker as CFO, effective September 3 (17.49 +0.73)Mr. Baker joins Eventbrite from Yelp (YELP) where as CFO he oversaw corporate finance, accounting, investor relations and workplace functions.

Such an increase in the supply of ships, especially in a segment with a total of 118 vessels on the water and with more than half trading under time charters, has restricted handysize market rates from increasing alongside other sectors.

The benchmark index is down 1.0% with noticeable weakness in the semiconductor stocks.The Nasdaq Composite is down 1.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 is down 1.4%.President Trump told reporters today that the U.S. will not be doing business with Huawei, which seemed to confirm a Bloomberg report yesterday that the U.S. Commerce Department has been refraining from approving business licenses to work with the Chinese company. The president added that September trade talks could get canceled but are still scheduled for the time being.None of these events has been too surprising for investors, but the prospect of U.S.-China relations further deteriorating has contributed to a steady broad-based decline today.All 11 S&P 500 sectors are down, including eight with losses of at least 1.0%. The information technology sector (-1.5%) is underperforming amid the trade uncertainty, which has also made a noticeable impact on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-2.0%). Many semiconductor companies are heavily exposed to China.Uber (UBER 39.72, -3.23) shares have dropped 7.5% after the company reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss of $5.2 billion. Revenue also missed estimates, but today's loss has simply given back a bulk of yesterday's 8% rally.In other earnings news, shares of DXC Technology (DXC 35.74, -15.90, -30.8%) have plunged over 30% after the company cut its FY20 outlook, while shares of Activision Blizzard (ATVI 47.56, -1.78, -3.6%) trade lower as investors remain underwhelmed by its downside Q3 guidance.The U.S. Treasury market, which has drawn plenty of attention this week, has been muted. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.70%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.2% to 97.43. Interestingly, despite the growth concerns, WTI crude is up 3.7%, or $1.94, to $54.48/bbl.Reviewing today's lone economic report, the Producer Price Index for July:The index for final demand increased 0.2% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, excluding food and energy, decreased 0.1% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). The m/m readings left the index for final demand up 1.7% yr/yr, unchanged from June. The index remains at its lowest level since January 2017. Core PPI was up 2.1% yr/yr, down from 2.3% in June.The key takeaway from the report is that inflationary pressure remains muted.12:53SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: AMRN (20.82 mln -17.35%), NKTR (16.72 mln -33.01%), VRAY (16.28 mln -56.9%)Industrials: GE (47.2 mln -3.06%)Consumer Discretionary: F (25.15 mln -1.36%), FTCH (19.75 mln -41.42%)Information Technology: AMD (54.93 mln +0.88%), NOK (17.11 mln +0.28%), SYMC (15.56 mln +0.57%), DXC (14.71 mln -30.57%), MU (12.35 mln -3.33%), AAPL (11.43 mln -1.13%)Financials: BAC (24.44 mln -1.07%), QQQ (17.87 mln -1.5%), TQQQ (16.4 mln -4.53%), SQQQ (12.92 mln +4.48%)Energy: CHK (27.62 mln +0.34%), RIG (14.88 mln -4.15%)Consumer Staples: ABEV (16.79 mln -0.2%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: VRAY (13.64x -56.9%), NKTR (10.16x -33.01%), SIEN (4.23x +18.94%), NVRO (3.47x +16.54%)Industrials: WAIR (14.57x +6.88%)Consumer Discretionary: FTCH (10.92x -41.42%), WTRH (5.33x -62.1%), QSR (4.44x -3.09%), PLYA (3.69x -2.52%), CHUY (3.58x +10.27%)Information Technology: DXC (6.38x -30.57%), XELA (4.18x -43.08%), CISN (4.1x -23.4%), ALTR (4.07x -15.05%)Financials: PMT (7.44x -3.18%), SMFG (4.36x -1.31%)Energy: PUMP (4.6x -30.59%)Consumer Staples: PRMW (3.67x +7.05%)12:52SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: PBYI (11.1 +20.52%), SIEN (5.94 +18.94%), LXRX (1.5 +17.19%), NVRO (73.82 +16.54%), TXMD (3.04 +15.15%), TRXC (1.02 +13.33%), TRHC (66.44 +12.05%), CYRX (22.39 +10.95%), OMER (17.86 +9.5%), DVAX (3.32 +9.42%), DPLO (5.8 +9.02%)Consumer Discretionary: OSTK (24.12 +13.27%), CHUY (26.3 +10.27%), AGS (9.16 +10.17%), FRGI (10.84 +8.94%)Information Technology: APPN (50.08 +15.82%), PCTY (110.93 +9.41%)Financials: GDOT (29.92 +9.12%), GGAL (38.07 +8.93%)Energy: WFT (0.02 +9.52%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: VRAY (2.91 -56.9%), NKTR (19.81 -33.01%), AMRN (14.72 -17.35%)Industrials: VSLR (7.5 -19.35%), AAXN (57.31 -16.23%), TPC (9.32 -15.7%)Consumer Discretionary: WTRH (1.43 -62.1%), FTCH (10.69 -41.42%), MAT (11.54 -14.07%)Information Technology: XELA (1.39 -43.08%), DXC (35.86 -30.57%), CNDT (6.03 -30.37%), CISN (7.55 -23.4%), VRTU (35.83 -17.8%), ALTR (35.67 -15.05%), DBX (18.65 -13.09%)Energy: PUMP (12.04 -30.59%)12:23LLY Eli Lilly announces favorable U.S. Court of Appeals Alimta ruling (112.66 -1.31)The co announced that the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in favor of Lilly, confirming that the Alimta (pemetrexed for injection) vitamin regimen patent would be infringed by competitors that had stated their intent to market alternative salt forms of pemetrexed prior to the patent's expiration in May 2022. The ruling came in the appeals of U.S. District Court decisions in the cases of Eli Lilly and Company v. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) and Eli Lilly and Company v. Hospira (PFE). Previous rulings in Lilly's favor had precluded the generic companies from launching the alternative salt forms until the patent expires. If the patent is ultimately upheld through all remaining challenges, Alimta would maintain U.S. exclusivity until May 2022, preventing marketing of generic products for as long as the patent remains in force.12:10SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (128) outpacing new lows (110) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ACAD, AEM, AIZ, AJRD, AMT, APPN, AVP, AWK, AWR, AXS, AYX, AZN, AZUL, BAH, BAM, BLDP, BLL, BRFS, CB, CCI, CECO, CIM, CINF, CME, CMG, CMS, COLD, CTAS, CUBE, CYTK, EIX, ELS, ENPH, EQIX, ES, EXR, FLT, FMC, FNF, HAE, HCP, HIG, LHX, HSY, ICE, IDA, KGC, LAUR, LNT, MCD, MELI, MKC, MLM, MODN, NEE, NEO, NTRA, NVCR, NVRO, OAK, PCTY, PODD, PRO, PSA, QTS, RGLD, RLI, RNR, ROKU, RPM, SAM, SBAC, SEDG, SHOP, SHW, SIGI, SO, SRC, STE, STOR, SUI, SVM, SWCH, TERP, TFX, TSN, TTD, VRSK, WEC, WELL, WK, WM, WPC, WPM, EVRG, WST, WTR, ZBH, ZTS, AQN, BHK, BKT, CYRX, EIM, EMB, FNV, FTS, FWONA, FWONK, IIM, IRT, MCR, MVF, MYI, NAC, NAD, NEA, NG, NMZ, NUV, NVG, NZF, OUT, PVG, RNP, RQI, VGM, VMOStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ACRS, ADAP, AEG, AM, AMTD, AR, ASNA, ATI, AXL, B, BRKMY, BCOR, BCS, BIDU, BOX, BT, CCO, CLB, CLVS, CMA, CNDT, COMM, CRESY, CYOU, DLTH, DXC, ENBL, EROS, EXPR, EXTN, FET, FLR, GLNG, GLOG, GMLP, GRPN, GT, GVA, HBM, HIMX, HMHC, HSBC, HSC, ING, JCP, KB, KEP, KMT, KT, LXFR, LYG, M, MAC, MCFT, MIK, MMLP, MMSI, MT, NE, NINE, NKTR, ODP, OEC, OLN, PLT, PRTA, PTEN, PVH, QNST, RGR, RIG, RL, SCHW, SEMG, SIG, SMLP, SSL, SSP, TAST, TECK, TEF, TELL, TGH, TMST, TPC, TRQ, TRUE, TSE, TUSK, VNTR, VRAY, VRTU, VSTO, WETF, WFTIQ, YY, BE, CARS, CEIX, CISN, CLNC, FIXX, FTCH, JHG, KLXE, LTRPA, SDRL, TRIP, WTRH, XELAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AFB, BFK, BUI, KTF, MCA, MQY, NBB, NID, NQP, WIAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: CEA, SHG, SHI, STN, BIOBETFs that traded to 52 week highs: EMB, FXY, IYR, UREETFs that traded to 52 week lows: FXB, XES11:45SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Farfetch (FTCH) sinks following second quarter press -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersAPPN (48.93 +13.16%): Topped consensus for Q2 EPS and revs (+11.7% yr/yr to $66.9 mln); issued mixed guidance for Q3 (sees revs above consensus, EPS below); raised its FY19 revs guidance, increasing its view of both subscription and total revenue for the year.

WTRH (1.95 -48.14%): Missed consensus for Q2 EPS and revs (+216.7% yr/yr to $51.3 mln) and lowered its FY19 revs view below consensus, citing delays to the roll-out of planned revenue initiatives, additional time needed to integrate the Bite Squad merger, and current competitive dynamics.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -40.00.The S&P 500 is up 0.2% for the week, but is on track to lose those slim gains at the open with the S&P 500 futures currently trading ten points, or 0.3%, below fair value.The decline in the futures could be a breather considering that the S&P 500 climbed 112 points, or 4.0%, over a two-day span. Of course, that advance followed a sharp sell-off that had many market participants blaming trade tensions, which are not helpful for economic growth prospects. In either case, the decline is modest and futures do not necessarily predict intraday action.Uber (UBER 40.12, -2.85, -6.7%) shares rose over 8% yesterday heading into its earnings report, which included a $5.2 billion quarterly loss.

Before this communication, the FDA had been silent as to whether it would convene an AdCom in connection with its review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. The FDA expressed, based on the timing of its recent decision to convene an AdCom, that November 14th is the earliest date on which it could hold an AdCom due to scheduling constraints for such a meeting.Accordingly, Amarin does not expect the FDA to take action on the sNDA by the previously announced September 28, 2019 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date. Amarin did not receive notice from the FDA of a PDUFA date extension. In light of the tentative AdCom date, Amarin anticipates that the PDUFA date will be extended, assuming a typical three-month extension, to a date in late December 2019. If so, this anticipated revised PDUFA date timing would offset three of the four months that were expected to be gained from FDA's earlier determination to conduct a priority review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. Prior to such determination, Amarin had expected a PDUFA goal date in January 2020, based on a standard 10-month review.

Today's rally, however, appeared to be more a continuation from yesterday's big intraday reversal that suggested the recent sharp sell-off may have been excessive.Interestingly, the S&P 500 traded just below its 50-day moving average (2934) for most of the afternoon before finally breaking above the key technical level late in the session. The benchmark index held above the level on a closing basis.All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher by at least 1.0%.

The benchmark index is down 1.0% with noticeable weakness in the semiconductor stocks.The Nasdaq Composite is down 1.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 is down 1.4%.President Trump told reporters today that the U.S. will not be doing business with Huawei, which seemed to confirm a Bloomberg report yesterday that the U.S. Commerce Department has been refraining from approving business licenses to work with the Chinese company. The president added that September trade talks could get canceled but are still scheduled for the time being.None of these events has been too surprising for investors, but the prospect of U.S.-China relations further deteriorating has contributed to a steady broad-based decline today.All 11 S&P 500 sectors are down, including eight with losses of at least 1.0%. The information technology sector (-1.5%) is underperforming amid the trade uncertainty, which has also made a noticeable impact on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-2.0%). Many semiconductor companies are heavily exposed to China.Uber (UBER 39.72, -3.23) shares have dropped 7.5% after the company reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss of $5.2 billion. Revenue also missed estimates, but today's loss has simply given back a bulk of yesterday's 8% rally.In other earnings news, shares of DXC Technology (DXC 35.74, -15.90, -30.8%) have plunged over 30% after the company cut its FY20 outlook, while shares of Activision Blizzard (ATVI 47.56, -1.78, -3.6%) trade lower as investors remain underwhelmed by its downside Q3 guidance.The U.S. Treasury market, which has drawn plenty of attention this week, has been muted. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.70%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.2% to 97.43. Interestingly, despite the growth concerns, WTI crude is up 3.7%, or $1.94, to $54.48/bbl.Reviewing today's lone economic report, the Producer Price Index for July:The index for final demand increased 0.2% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, excluding food and energy, decreased 0.1% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). The m/m readings left the index for final demand up 1.7% yr/yr, unchanged from June. The index remains at its lowest level since January 2017. Core PPI was up 2.1% yr/yr, down from 2.3% in June.The key takeaway from the report is that inflationary pressure remains muted.12:53SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: AMRN (20.82 mln -17.35%), NKTR (16.72 mln -33.01%), VRAY (16.28 mln -56.9%)Industrials: GE (47.2 mln -3.06%)Consumer Discretionary: F (25.15 mln -1.36%), FTCH (19.75 mln -41.42%)Information Technology: AMD (54.93 mln +0.88%), NOK (17.11 mln +0.28%), SYMC (15.56 mln +0.57%), DXC (14.71 mln -30.57%), MU (12.35 mln -3.33%), AAPL (11.43 mln -1.13%)Financials: BAC (24.44 mln -1.07%), QQQ (17.87 mln -1.5%), TQQQ (16.4 mln -4.53%), SQQQ (12.92 mln +4.48%)Energy: CHK (27.62 mln +0.34%), RIG (14.88 mln -4.15%)Consumer Staples: ABEV (16.79 mln -0.2%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: VRAY (13.64x -56.9%), NKTR (10.16x -33.01%), SIEN (4.23x +18.94%), NVRO (3.47x +16.54%)Industrials: WAIR (14.57x +6.88%)Consumer Discretionary: FTCH (10.92x -41.42%), WTRH (5.33x -62.1%), QSR (4.44x -3.09%), PLYA (3.69x -2.52%), CHUY (3.58x +10.27%)Information Technology: DXC (6.38x -30.57%), XELA (4.18x -43.08%), CISN (4.1x -23.4%), ALTR (4.07x -15.05%)Financials: PMT (7.44x -3.18%), SMFG (4.36x -1.31%)Energy: PUMP (4.6x -30.59%)Consumer Staples: PRMW (3.67x +7.05%)12:52SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: PBYI (11.1 +20.52%), SIEN (5.94 +18.94%), LXRX (1.5 +17.19%), NVRO (73.82 +16.54%), TXMD (3.04 +15.15%), TRXC (1.02 +13.33%), TRHC (66.44 +12.05%), CYRX (22.39 +10.95%), OMER (17.86 +9.5%), DVAX (3.32 +9.42%), DPLO (5.8 +9.02%)Consumer Discretionary: OSTK (24.12 +13.27%), CHUY (26.3 +10.27%), AGS (9.16 +10.17%), FRGI (10.84 +8.94%)Information Technology: APPN (50.08 +15.82%), PCTY (110.93 +9.41%)Financials: GDOT (29.92 +9.12%), GGAL (38.07 +8.93%)Energy: WFT (0.02 +9.52%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: VRAY (2.91 -56.9%), NKTR (19.81 -33.01%), AMRN (14.72 -17.35%)Industrials: VSLR (7.5 -19.35%), AAXN (57.31 -16.23%), TPC (9.32 -15.7%)Consumer Discretionary: WTRH (1.43 -62.1%), FTCH (10.69 -41.42%), MAT (11.54 -14.07%)Information Technology: XELA (1.39 -43.08%), DXC (35.86 -30.57%), CNDT (6.03 -30.37%), CISN (7.55 -23.4%), VRTU (35.83 -17.8%), ALTR (35.67 -15.05%), DBX (18.65 -13.09%)Energy: PUMP (12.04 -30.59%)12:23LLY Eli Lilly announces favorable U.S. Court of Appeals Alimta ruling (112.66 -1.31)The co announced that the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in favor of Lilly, confirming that the Alimta (pemetrexed for injection) vitamin regimen patent would be infringed by competitors that had stated their intent to market alternative salt forms of pemetrexed prior to the patent's expiration in May 2022. The ruling came in the appeals of U.S. District Court decisions in the cases of Eli Lilly and Company v. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) and Eli Lilly and Company v. Hospira (PFE). Previous rulings in Lilly's favor had precluded the generic companies from launching the alternative salt forms until the patent expires. If the patent is ultimately upheld through all remaining challenges, Alimta would maintain U.S. exclusivity until May 2022, preventing marketing of generic products for as long as the patent remains in force.12:10SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (128) outpacing new lows (110) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ACAD, AEM, AIZ, AJRD, AMT, APPN, AVP, AWK, AWR, AXS, AYX, AZN, AZUL, BAH, BAM, BLDP, BLL, BRFS, CB, CCI, CECO, CIM, CINF, CME, CMG, CMS, COLD, CTAS, CUBE, CYTK, EIX, ELS, ENPH, EQIX, ES, EXR, FLT, FMC, FNF, HAE, HCP, HIG, LHX, HSY, ICE, IDA, KGC, LAUR, LNT, MCD, MELI, MKC, MLM, MODN, NEE, NEO, NTRA, NVCR, NVRO, OAK, PCTY, PODD, PRO, PSA, QTS, RGLD, RLI, RNR, ROKU, RPM, SAM, SBAC, SEDG, SHOP, SHW, SIGI, SO, SRC, STE, STOR, SUI, SVM, SWCH, TERP, TFX, TSN, TTD, VRSK, WEC, WELL, WK, WM, WPC, WPM, EVRG, WST, WTR, ZBH, ZTS, AQN, BHK, BKT, CYRX, EIM, EMB, FNV, FTS, FWONA, FWONK, IIM, IRT, MCR, MVF, MYI, NAC, NAD, NEA, NG, NMZ, NUV, NVG, NZF, OUT, PVG, RNP, RQI, VGM, VMOStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ACRS, ADAP, AEG, AM, AMTD, AR, ASNA, ATI, AXL, B, BRKMY, BCOR, BCS, BIDU, BOX, BT, CCO, CLB, CLVS, CMA, CNDT, COMM, CRESY, CYOU, DLTH, DXC, ENBL, EROS, EXPR, EXTN, FET, FLR, GLNG, GLOG, GMLP, GRPN, GT, GVA, HBM, HIMX, HMHC, HSBC, HSC, ING, JCP, KB, KEP, KMT, KT, LXFR, LYG, M, MAC, MCFT, MIK, MMLP, MMSI, MT, NE, NINE, NKTR, ODP, OEC, OLN, PLT, PRTA, PTEN, PVH, QNST, RGR, RIG, RL, SCHW, SEMG, SIG, SMLP, SSL, SSP, TAST, TECK, TEF, TELL, TGH, TMST, TPC, TRQ, TRUE, TSE, TUSK, VNTR, VRAY, VRTU, VSTO, WETF, WFTIQ, YY, BE, CARS, CEIX, CISN, CLNC, FIXX, FTCH, JHG, KLXE, LTRPA, SDRL, TRIP, WTRH, XELAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AFB, BFK, BUI, KTF, MCA, MQY, NBB, NID, NQP, WIAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: CEA, SHG, SHI, STN, BIOBETFs that traded to 52 week highs: EMB, FXY, IYR, UREETFs that traded to 52 week lows: FXB, XES11:45SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Farfetch (FTCH) sinks following second quarter press -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersAPPN (48.93 +13.16%): Topped consensus for Q2 EPS and revs (+11.7% yr/yr to $66.9 mln); issued mixed guidance for Q3 (sees revs above consensus, EPS below); raised its FY19 revs guidance, increasing its view of both subscription and total revenue for the year.

WTRH (1.95 -48.14%): Missed consensus for Q2 EPS and revs (+216.7% yr/yr to $51.3 mln) and lowered its FY19 revs view below consensus, citing delays to the roll-out of planned revenue initiatives, additional time needed to integrate the Bite Squad merger, and current competitive dynamics.

The S&P 500 (-0.7%) reclaimed its 50-day moving average during the last few minutes of yesterday's session but the benchmark index finds itself back below that level this morning.Equity futures stumbled after yesterday's cash close, responding to a Bloomberg report, which revealed that the Department of Commerce has yet to begin issuing licenses to U.S. companies that want to resume doing business with Huawei. The decision was reportedly made after the Chinese government ordered state-owned enterprises to stop purchasing agricultural goods from the U.S.Understandably, that revelation is having the biggest impact on chipmakers. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is down 2.0%, returning into negative territory for the week (-1.8% week-to-date).

Conversely, the utilities (+0.4%), health care (+0.2%), and real estate (+0.2%) sectors outperform.U.S. Treasuries are little changed. The 2-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.60%, and the 10-yr yield is unchanged at 1.71%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 97.55.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -40.00.The S&P 500 is up 0.2% for the week, but is on track to lose those slim gains at the open with the S&P 500 futures currently trading ten points, or 0.3%, below fair value.The decline in the futures could be a breather considering that the S&P 500 climbed 112 points, or 4.0%, over a two-day span. Of course, that advance followed a sharp sell-off that had many market participants blaming trade tensions, which are not helpful for economic growth prospects. In either case, the decline is modest and futures do not necessarily predict intraday action.Uber (UBER 40.12, -2.85, -6.7%) shares rose over 8% yesterday heading into its earnings report, which included a $5.2 billion quarterly loss.

In China, Biktarvy is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults without present or past evidence of viral resistance to the integrase inhibitor class, emtricitabine or tenofovir.The approval of Biktarvy is supported by data from four ongoing Phase 3 studies: Studies 1489 and 1490 in treatment-nave HIV-1 infected adults, and Studies 1844 and 1878 in virologically suppressed adults. The trials are comprised of a diverse population of 2,414 participants on Biktarvy or an active comparator regimen, including a wide range of adult age groups and races/ethnicities. Biktarvy met its primary efficacy objective of non-inferiority at 48 weeks across all four studies.Biktarvy received marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Commission in 2018.

Before this communication, the FDA had been silent as to whether it would convene an AdCom in connection with its review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. The FDA expressed, based on the timing of its recent decision to convene an AdCom, that November 14th is the earliest date on which it could hold an AdCom due to scheduling constraints for such a meeting.Accordingly, Amarin does not expect the FDA to take action on the sNDA by the previously announced September 28, 2019 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date. Amarin did not receive notice from the FDA of a PDUFA date extension. In light of the tentative AdCom date, Amarin anticipates that the PDUFA date will be extended, assuming a typical three-month extension, to a date in late December 2019. If so, this anticipated revised PDUFA date timing would offset three of the four months that were expected to be gained from FDA's earlier determination to conduct a priority review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. Prior to such determination, Amarin had expected a PDUFA goal date in January 2020, based on a standard 10-month review. Amarin plans to update the investment community after appropriately definitive information is available related to a new PDUFA date.Amarin intends to continue to move forward with its plans to double the size of its sales force to support the launch of Vascepa. Amarin plans to use the anticipated three-month delay in the PDUFA clock to better prepare for the assumed launch of Vascepa including more time to hire and train new sales representatives. To the extent that new sales managers and representatives are hired prior to the expanded label for Vascepa, Amarin intends to have them join the company's existing sales team in promoting Vascepa based on its current indication and existing promotional messaging.16:30EB Eventbrite appoints Lanny Baker as CFO, effective September 3 (17.49 +0.73)Mr. Baker joins Eventbrite from Yelp (YELP) where as CFO he oversaw corporate finance, accounting, investor relations and workplace functions.

Symantec expects to return approximately 100% of its after-tax cash proceeds in the form of a $12.00 per share special dividend to shareholders after the close of the transaction. We expect to pay the special dividend in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 and will update the expected dividend timing on our next quarterly earnings call. In addition, we expect to increase our regular dividend by 67% to $0.125 per share in the quarter following the close. The Board of Directors has approved an increase to our existing share repurchase authorization up to $1.6 bln.

Today's rally, however, appeared to be more a continuation from yesterday's big intraday reversal that suggested the recent sharp sell-off may have been excessive.Interestingly, the S&P 500 traded just below its 50-day moving average (2934) for most of the afternoon before finally breaking above the key technical level late in the session. The benchmark index held above the level on a closing basis.All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher by at least 1.0%.

The benchmark index is down 1.0% with noticeable weakness in the semiconductor stocks.The Nasdaq Composite is down 1.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 is down 1.4%.President Trump told reporters today that the U.S. will not be doing business with Huawei, which seemed to confirm a Bloomberg report yesterday that the U.S. Commerce Department has been refraining from approving business licenses to work with the Chinese company. The president added that September trade talks could get canceled but are still scheduled for the time being.None of these events has been too surprising for investors, but the prospect of U.S.-China relations further deteriorating has contributed to a steady broad-based decline today.All 11 S&P 500 sectors are down, including eight with losses of at least 1.0%. The information technology sector (-1.5%) is underperforming amid the trade uncertainty, which has also made a noticeable impact on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-2.0%). Many semiconductor companies are heavily exposed to China.Uber (UBER 39.72, -3.23) shares have dropped 7.5% after the company reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss of $5.2 billion. Revenue also missed estimates, but today's loss has simply given back a bulk of yesterday's 8% rally.In other earnings news, shares of DXC Technology (DXC 35.74, -15.90, -30.8%) have plunged over 30% after the company cut its FY20 outlook, while shares of Activision Blizzard (ATVI 47.56, -1.78, -3.6%) trade lower as investors remain underwhelmed by its downside Q3 guidance.The U.S. Treasury market, which has drawn plenty of attention this week, has been muted. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.70%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.2% to 97.43. Interestingly, despite the growth concerns, WTI crude is up 3.7%, or $1.94, to $54.48/bbl.Reviewing today's lone economic report, the Producer Price Index for July:The index for final demand increased 0.2% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, excluding food and energy, decreased 0.1% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). The m/m readings left the index for final demand up 1.7% yr/yr, unchanged from June. The index remains at its lowest level since January 2017. Core PPI was up 2.1% yr/yr, down from 2.3% in June.The key takeaway from the report is that inflationary pressure remains muted.12:53SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: AMRN (20.82 mln -17.35%), NKTR (16.72 mln -33.01%), VRAY (16.28 mln -56.9%)Industrials: GE (47.2 mln -3.06%)Consumer Discretionary: F (25.15 mln -1.36%), FTCH (19.75 mln -41.42%)Information Technology: AMD (54.93 mln +0.88%), NOK (17.11 mln +0.28%), SYMC (15.56 mln +0.57%), DXC (14.71 mln -30.57%), MU (12.35 mln -3.33%), AAPL (11.43 mln -1.13%)Financials: BAC (24.44 mln -1.07%), QQQ (17.87 mln -1.5%), TQQQ (16.4 mln -4.53%), SQQQ (12.92 mln +4.48%)Energy: CHK (27.62 mln +0.34%), RIG (14.88 mln -4.15%)Consumer Staples: ABEV (16.79 mln -0.2%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: VRAY (13.64x -56.9%), NKTR (10.16x -33.01%), SIEN (4.23x +18.94%), NVRO (3.47x +16.54%)Industrials: WAIR (14.57x +6.88%)Consumer Discretionary: FTCH (10.92x -41.42%), WTRH (5.33x -62.1%), QSR (4.44x -3.09%), PLYA (3.69x -2.52%), CHUY (3.58x +10.27%)Information Technology: DXC (6.38x -30.57%), XELA (4.18x -43.08%), CISN (4.1x -23.4%), ALTR (4.07x -15.05%)Financials: PMT (7.44x -3.18%), SMFG (4.36x -1.31%)Energy: PUMP (4.6x -30.59%)Consumer Staples: PRMW (3.67x +7.05%)12:52SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: PBYI (11.1 +20.52%), SIEN (5.94 +18.94%), LXRX (1.5 +17.19%), NVRO (73.82 +16.54%), TXMD (3.04 +15.15%), TRXC (1.02 +13.33%), TRHC (66.44 +12.05%), CYRX (22.39 +10.95%), OMER (17.86 +9.5%), DVAX (3.32 +9.42%), DPLO (5.8 +9.02%)Consumer Discretionary: OSTK (24.12 +13.27%), CHUY (26.3 +10.27%), AGS (9.16 +10.17%), FRGI (10.84 +8.94%)Information Technology: APPN (50.08 +15.82%), PCTY (110.93 +9.41%)Financials: GDOT (29.92 +9.12%), GGAL (38.07 +8.93%)Energy: WFT (0.02 +9.52%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: VRAY (2.91 -56.9%), NKTR (19.81 -33.01%), AMRN (14.72 -17.35%)Industrials: VSLR (7.5 -19.35%), AAXN (57.31 -16.23%), TPC (9.32 -15.7%)Consumer Discretionary: WTRH (1.43 -62.1%), FTCH (10.69 -41.42%), MAT (11.54 -14.07%)Information Technology: XELA (1.39 -43.08%), DXC (35.86 -30.57%), CNDT (6.03 -30.37%), CISN (7.55 -23.4%), VRTU (35.83 -17.8%), ALTR (35.67 -15.05%), DBX (18.65 -13.09%)Energy: PUMP (12.04 -30.59%)12:23LLY Eli Lilly announces favorable U.S. Court of Appeals Alimta ruling (112.66 -1.31)The co announced that the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in favor of Lilly, confirming that the Alimta (pemetrexed for injection) vitamin regimen patent would be infringed by competitors that had stated their intent to market alternative salt forms of pemetrexed prior to the patent's expiration in May 2022. The ruling came in the appeals of U.S. District Court decisions in the cases of Eli Lilly and Company v. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) and Eli Lilly and Company v. Hospira (PFE). Previous rulings in Lilly's favor had precluded the generic companies from launching the alternative salt forms until the patent expires. If the patent is ultimately upheld through all remaining challenges, Alimta would maintain U.S. exclusivity until May 2022, preventing marketing of generic products for as long as the patent remains in force.12:10SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (128) outpacing new lows (110) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ACAD, AEM, AIZ, AJRD, AMT, APPN, AVP, AWK, AWR, AXS, AYX, AZN, AZUL, BAH, BAM, BLDP, BLL, BRFS, CB, CCI, CECO, CIM, CINF, CME, CMG, CMS, COLD, CTAS, CUBE, CYTK, EIX, ELS, ENPH, EQIX, ES, EXR, FLT, FMC, FNF, HAE, HCP, HIG, LHX, HSY, ICE, IDA, KGC, LAUR, LNT, MCD, MELI, MKC, MLM, MODN, NEE, NEO, NTRA, NVCR, NVRO, OAK, PCTY, PODD, PRO, PSA, QTS, RGLD, RLI, RNR, ROKU, RPM, SAM, SBAC, SEDG, SHOP, SHW, SIGI, SO, SRC, STE, STOR, SUI, SVM, SWCH, TERP, TFX, TSN, TTD, VRSK, WEC, WELL, WK, WM, WPC, WPM, EVRG, WST, WTR, ZBH, ZTS, AQN, BHK, BKT, CYRX, EIM, EMB, FNV, FTS, FWONA, FWONK, IIM, IRT, MCR, MVF, MYI, NAC, NAD, NEA, NG, NMZ, NUV, NVG, NZF, OUT, PVG, RNP, RQI, VGM, VMOStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ACRS, ADAP, AEG, AM, AMTD, AR, ASNA, ATI, AXL, B, BRKMY, BCOR, BCS, BIDU, BOX, BT, CCO, CLB, CLVS, CMA, CNDT, COMM, CRESY, CYOU, DLTH, DXC, ENBL, EROS, EXPR, EXTN, FET, FLR, GLNG, GLOG, GMLP, GRPN, GT, GVA, HBM, HIMX, HMHC, HSBC, HSC, ING, JCP, KB, KEP, KMT, KT, LXFR, LYG, M, MAC, MCFT, MIK, MMLP, MMSI, MT, NE, NINE, NKTR, ODP, OEC, OLN, PLT, PRTA, PTEN, PVH, QNST, RGR, RIG, RL, SCHW, SEMG, SIG, SMLP, SSL, SSP, TAST, TECK, TEF, TELL, TGH, TMST, TPC, TRQ, TRUE, TSE, TUSK, VNTR, VRAY, VRTU, VSTO, WETF, WFTIQ, YY, BE, CARS, CEIX, CISN, CLNC, FIXX, FTCH, JHG, KLXE, LTRPA, SDRL, TRIP, WTRH, XELAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AFB, BFK, BUI, KTF, MCA, MQY, NBB, NID, NQP, WIAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: CEA, SHG, SHI, STN, BIOBETFs that traded to 52 week highs: EMB, FXY, IYR, UREETFs that traded to 52 week lows: FXB, XES11:45SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Farfetch (FTCH) sinks following second quarter press -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersAPPN (48.93 +13.16%): Topped consensus for Q2 EPS and revs (+11.7% yr/yr to $66.9 mln); issued mixed guidance for Q3 (sees revs above consensus, EPS below); raised its FY19 revs guidance, increasing its view of both subscription and total revenue for the year.

Posts all-time lows. NKTR (19.73 -33.29%): Reported mixed Q2 results. Co then disclosed a manufacturing issue: a suboptimal batch of in-process intermediate was used to produce two lots of bempegaldesleukin, which ultimately led to the softening of response rates in the PIVOT-02 study. The issue was restricted to the single batch of intermediates using lots two and five. Co has developed a comprehensive control strategy to limit variances in raw materials, intermediates, and the final product going forward. Downgraded at Mizuho, Jefferies, and JP Morgan.

Co's yr/yr decrease in US revenue (fell 2% to $78.1 mln) was associated with customer destocking associated with co's previously announced decision to alter its practice regarding certain high-volume product orders.

WTRH (1.95 -48.14%): Missed consensus for Q2 EPS and revs (+216.7% yr/yr to $51.3 mln) and lowered its FY19 revs view below consensus, citing delays to the roll-out of planned revenue initiatives, additional time needed to integrate the Bite Squad merger, and current competitive dynamics.

The S&P 500 (-0.7%) reclaimed its 50-day moving average during the last few minutes of yesterday's session but the benchmark index finds itself back below that level this morning.Equity futures stumbled after yesterday's cash close, responding to a Bloomberg report, which revealed that the Department of Commerce has yet to begin issuing licenses to U.S. companies that want to resume doing business with Huawei. The decision was reportedly made after the Chinese government ordered state-owned enterprises to stop purchasing agricultural goods from the U.S.Understandably, that revelation is having the biggest impact on chipmakers. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is down 2.0%, returning into negative territory for the week (-1.8% week-to-date). The broader technology sector (-0.9%) trades at the bottom of the leaderboard, while eight out of the remaining ten sectors also trade in the red.The Russell 2000 is down 0.8%; the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.8%; the S&P 500 is down 0.7%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.5%.09:40WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Wall Street opens slightly lower, little changed for the weekThe major averages begin the day slightly lower following a big two-day comeback.

Conversely, the utilities (+0.4%), health care (+0.2%), and real estate (+0.2%) sectors outperform.U.S. Treasuries are little changed.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -40.00.The S&P 500 is up 0.2% for the week, but is on track to lose those slim gains at the open with the S&P 500 futures currently trading ten points, or 0.3%, below fair value.The decline in the futures could be a breather considering that the S&P 500 climbed 112 points, or 4.0%, over a two-day span. Of course, that advance followed a sharp sell-off that had many market participants blaming trade tensions, which are not helpful for economic growth prospects. In either case, the decline is modest and futures do not necessarily predict intraday action.Uber (UBER 40.12, -2.85, -6.7%) shares rose over 8% yesterday heading into its earnings report, which included a $5.2 billion quarterly loss.

The company said that Robb will continue on with the Company for six months and help ensure a seamless transition of his responsibilities.Q3 & Updated FY19 Outlook:Q3: Co sees Platform GMV +30-35% yr/yr, and Adj-EBITDA loss margin of (~18-20%) of Adj-Revenues.FY19: Co sees GMV of ~$2.1 bln (+50% yr/yr), Platform GMV of $1.91-1.95 bln (+37-40% yr/yr vs. previous guidance for +41%), sees Adj-EBITDA loss margin of (~15-17%) (vs. previous guidance of (~16-17%)) of Adj-Revenues.

Biktarvy combines the novel, unboosted integrase strand transfer inhibitor bictegravir with the demonstrated safety and efficacy profile of the Descovy dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone and is the smallest INSTI-based triple-therapy STR available. In China, Biktarvy is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults without present or past evidence of viral resistance to the integrase inhibitor class, emtricitabine or tenofovir.The approval of Biktarvy is supported by data from four ongoing Phase 3 studies: Studies 1489 and 1490 in treatment-nave HIV-1 infected adults, and Studies 1844 and 1878 in virologically suppressed adults. The trials are comprised of a diverse population of 2,414 participants on Biktarvy or an active comparator regimen, including a wide range of adult age groups and races/ethnicities. Biktarvy met its primary efficacy objective of non-inferiority at 48 weeks across all four studies.Biktarvy received marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Commission in 2018. In the United States, Biktarvy has a Boxed Warning in its product label regarding the risk of post-treatment acute exacerbation of hepatitis B.

Before this communication, the FDA had been silent as to whether it would convene an AdCom in connection with its review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. The FDA expressed, based on the timing of its recent decision to convene an AdCom, that November 14th is the earliest date on which it could hold an AdCom due to scheduling constraints for such a meeting.Accordingly, Amarin does not expect the FDA to take action on the sNDA by the previously announced September 28, 2019 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date. Amarin did not receive notice from the FDA of a PDUFA date extension. In light of the tentative AdCom date, Amarin anticipates that the PDUFA date will be extended, assuming a typical three-month extension, to a date in late December 2019. If so, this anticipated revised PDUFA date timing would offset three of the four months that were expected to be gained from FDA's earlier determination to conduct a priority review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. Prior to such determination, Amarin had expected a PDUFA goal date in January 2020, based on a standard 10-month review. Amarin plans to update the investment community after appropriately definitive information is available related to a new PDUFA date.Amarin intends to continue to move forward with its plans to double the size of its sales force to support the launch of Vascepa. Amarin plans to use the anticipated three-month delay in the PDUFA clock to better prepare for the assumed launch of Vascepa including more time to hire and train new sales representatives. To the extent that new sales managers and representatives are hired prior to the expanded label for Vascepa, Amarin intends to have them join the company's existing sales team in promoting Vascepa based on its current indication and existing promotional messaging.16:30EB Eventbrite appoints Lanny Baker as CFO, effective September 3 (17.49 +0.73)Mr. Baker joins Eventbrite from Yelp (YELP) where as CFO he oversaw corporate finance, accounting, investor relations and workplace functions.

Today's rally, however, appeared to be more a continuation from yesterday's big intraday reversal that suggested the recent sharp sell-off may have been excessive.Interestingly, the S&P 500 traded just below its 50-day moving average (2934) for most of the afternoon before finally breaking above the key technical level late in the session. The benchmark index held above the level on a closing basis.All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher by at least 1.0%.

Continuing claims for the week ending July 27 decreased by 15,000 to 1.684 mln.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims continue hovering near multi-decade lows.Wholesale inventories were unchanged in June (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%) on top of an unrevised 0.4% increase in May. Wholesale sales decreased 0.3% in June after decreasing a revised 0.6% (from +0.1%) in May.The key takeaway from the June report and the May revision is that the gap between inventory growth and sales growth is widening, which should exert some pressure on prices.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for July on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +21.2% YTDS&P 500 +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +13.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.1% YTD16:21TSE Trinseo misses by $0.45, misses on revs; guides FY19 EPS below consensus (35.00 +1.81)Reports Q2 (Jun) earnings of $0.99 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.45 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.44; revenues fell 23.0% year/year to $951.8 mln vs the $1.07 bln two analyst estimate.Latex Binders net sales of $230 million for the quarter decreased 18% versus prior year due mainly to the pass through of lower raw material costs.Performance Plastics net sales of $347 million for the quarter were 16% below prior year due mainly to lower prices from the pass through of lower raw material costs.Co issues downside guidance for FY19, sees EPS of $4.15-4.86, excluding non-recurring items, vs. $5.54 S&P Capital IQ Consensus.16:20ROAD Construction Partners beats by $0.04, misses on revs (14.02 +0.20)Reports Q3 (Jun) earnings of $0.33 per share, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.29; revenues rose 16.5% year/year to $227.3 mln vs the $229.67 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Project backlog at June 30, 2019 was $581.1 mln.Adjusted EBITDA was $31.3 mln, up 37.9%.16:19PBYI Puma Biotech. beats by $0.32, reports revs in-line (9.21 +0.40)Reports Q2 (Jun) loss of $0.57 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.32 better than the single analyst estimate of ($0.89); revenues rose 6.1% year/year to $53.9 mln vs the $53.4 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Net NERLYNX revenue in the second quarter of 2019 was $53.8 million, compared to net NERLYNX revenue of $50.8 million in the second quarter of 2018."We anticipate the following key milestones during the remainder of 2019: (i) meeting with the FDA to discuss the clinical development and regulatory strategy for the SUMMIT trial in the third quarter of 2019; (ii) reporting additional data from the Phase II CONTROL trial in the fourth quarter of 2019; and (iii) receiving regulatory decisions for the extended adjuvant HER2-positive early stage breast cancer indication in additional countries."16:19DXC DXC Technology beats by $0.03, reports revs in-line (51.65 +1.76)Reports Q1 (Jun) earnings of $1.74 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.71; revenues fell 7.4% year/year to $4.89 bln vs the $4.86 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.16:18NRZ New Residential Investment prices $250 mln underwritten public offering of 10,000,000 shares of 7.125% Series B Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (15.27 +0.21)The company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for investments and general corporate purposes.16:18AIMT Aimmune Therapeutics misses by $0.08 (19.34 +0.24)Reports Q2 (Jun) loss of $1.01 per share, $0.08 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.93).Cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $250.3 million on June 30, 2019, compared to $303.9 million on December 31, 2018.

The benchmark index is down 1.0% with noticeable weakness in the semiconductor stocks.The Nasdaq Composite is down 1.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 is down 1.4%.President Trump told reporters today that the U.S. will not be doing business with Huawei, which seemed to confirm a Bloomberg report yesterday that the U.S. Commerce Department has been refraining from approving business licenses to work with the Chinese company. The president added that September trade talks could get canceled but are still scheduled for the time being.None of these events has been too surprising for investors, but the prospect of U.S.-China relations further deteriorating has contributed to a steady broad-based decline today.All 11 S&P 500 sectors are down, including eight with losses of at least 1.0%. The information technology sector (-1.5%) is underperforming amid the trade uncertainty, which has also made a noticeable impact on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-2.0%). Many semiconductor companies are heavily exposed to China.Uber (UBER 39.72, -3.23) shares have dropped 7.5% after the company reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss of $5.2 billion. Revenue also missed estimates, but today's loss has simply given back a bulk of yesterday's 8% rally.In other earnings news, shares of DXC Technology (DXC 35.74, -15.90, -30.8%) have plunged over 30% after the company cut its FY20 outlook, while shares of Activision Blizzard (ATVI 47.56, -1.78, -3.6%) trade lower as investors remain underwhelmed by its downside Q3 guidance.The U.S. Treasury market, which has drawn plenty of attention this week, has been muted. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.70%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.2% to 97.43. Interestingly, despite the growth concerns, WTI crude is up 3.7%, or $1.94, to $54.48/bbl.Reviewing today's lone economic report, the Producer Price Index for July:The index for final demand increased 0.2% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, excluding food and energy, decreased 0.1% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%).

The ruling came in the appeals of U.S. District Court decisions in the cases of Eli Lilly and Company v. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) and Eli Lilly and Company v. Hospira (PFE). Previous rulings in Lilly's favor had precluded the generic companies from launching the alternative salt forms until the patent expires. If the patent is ultimately upheld through all remaining challenges, Alimta would maintain U.S. exclusivity until May 2022, preventing marketing of generic products for as long as the patent remains in force.12:10SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (128) outpacing new lows (110) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ACAD, AEM, AIZ, AJRD, AMT, APPN, AVP, AWK, AWR, AXS, AYX, AZN, AZUL, BAH, BAM, BLDP, BLL, BRFS, CB, CCI, CECO, CIM, CINF, CME, CMG, CMS, COLD, CTAS, CUBE, CYTK, EIX, ELS, ENPH, EQIX, ES, EXR, FLT, FMC, FNF, HAE, HCP, HIG, LHX, HSY, ICE, IDA, KGC, LAUR, LNT, MCD, MELI, MKC, MLM, MODN, NEE, NEO, NTRA, NVCR, NVRO, OAK, PCTY, PODD, PRO, PSA, QTS, RGLD, RLI, RNR, ROKU, RPM, SAM, SBAC, SEDG, SHOP, SHW, SIGI, SO, SRC, STE, STOR, SUI, SVM, SWCH, TERP, TFX, TSN, TTD, VRSK, WEC, WELL, WK, WM, WPC, WPM, EVRG, WST, WTR, ZBH, ZTS, AQN, BHK, BKT, CYRX, EIM, EMB, FNV, FTS, FWONA, FWONK, IIM, IRT, MCR, MVF, MYI, NAC, NAD, NEA, NG, NMZ, NUV, NVG, NZF, OUT, PVG, RNP, RQI, VGM, VMOStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ACRS, ADAP, AEG, AM, AMTD, AR, ASNA, ATI, AXL, B, BRKMY, BCOR, BCS, BIDU, BOX, BT, CCO, CLB, CLVS, CMA, CNDT, COMM, CRESY, CYOU, DLTH, DXC, ENBL, EROS, EXPR, EXTN, FET, FLR, GLNG, GLOG, GMLP, GRPN, GT, GVA, HBM, HIMX, HMHC, HSBC, HSC, ING, JCP, KB, KEP, KMT, KT, LXFR, LYG, M, MAC, MCFT, MIK, MMLP, MMSI, MT, NE, NINE, NKTR, ODP, OEC, OLN, PLT, PRTA, PTEN, PVH, QNST, RGR, RIG, RL, SCHW, SEMG, SIG, SMLP, SSL, SSP, TAST, TECK, TEF, TELL, TGH, TMST, TPC, TRQ, TRUE, TSE, TUSK, VNTR, VRAY, VRTU, VSTO, WETF, WFTIQ, YY, BE, CARS, CEIX, CISN, CLNC, FIXX, FTCH, JHG, KLXE, LTRPA, SDRL, TRIP, WTRH, XELAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AFB, BFK, BUI, KTF, MCA, MQY, NBB, NID, NQP, WIAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: CEA, SHG, SHI, STN, BIOBETFs that traded to 52 week highs: EMB, FXY, IYR, UREETFs that traded to 52 week lows: FXB, XES11:45SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Farfetch (FTCH) sinks following second quarter press -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersAPPN (48.93 +13.16%): Topped consensus for Q2 EPS and revs (+11.7% yr/yr to $66.9 mln); issued mixed guidance for Q3 (sees revs above consensus, EPS below); raised its FY19 revs guidance, increasing its view of both subscription and total revenue for the year.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -40.00.The S&P 500 is up 0.2% for the week, but is on track to lose those slim gains at the open with the S&P 500 futures currently trading ten points, or 0.3%, below fair value.The decline in the futures could be a breather considering that the S&P 500 climbed 112 points, or 4.0%, over a two-day span. Of course, that advance followed a sharp sell-off that had many market participants blaming trade tensions, which are not helpful for economic growth prospects. In either case, the decline is modest and futures do not necessarily predict intraday action.Uber (UBER 40.12, -2.85, -6.7%) shares rose over 8% yesterday heading into its earnings report, which included a $5.2 billion quarterly loss.

Biktarvy combines the novel, unboosted integrase strand transfer inhibitor bictegravir with the demonstrated safety and efficacy profile of the Descovy dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone and is the smallest INSTI-based triple-therapy STR available. In China, Biktarvy is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults without present or past evidence of viral resistance to the integrase inhibitor class, emtricitabine or tenofovir.The approval of Biktarvy is supported by data from four ongoing Phase 3 studies: Studies 1489 and 1490 in treatment-nave HIV-1 infected adults, and Studies 1844 and 1878 in virologically suppressed adults. The trials are comprised of a diverse population of 2,414 participants on Biktarvy or an active comparator regimen, including a wide range of adult age groups and races/ethnicities. Biktarvy met its primary efficacy objective of non-inferiority at 48 weeks across all four studies.Biktarvy received marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Commission in 2018. In the United States, Biktarvy has a Boxed Warning in its product label regarding the risk of post-treatment acute exacerbation of hepatitis B.

Before this communication, the FDA had been silent as to whether it would convene an AdCom in connection with its review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. The FDA expressed, based on the timing of its recent decision to convene an AdCom, that November 14th is the earliest date on which it could hold an AdCom due to scheduling constraints for such a meeting.Accordingly, Amarin does not expect the FDA to take action on the sNDA by the previously announced September 28, 2019 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date. Amarin did not receive notice from the FDA of a PDUFA date extension. In light of the tentative AdCom date, Amarin anticipates that the PDUFA date will be extended, assuming a typical three-month extension, to a date in late December 2019. If so, this anticipated revised PDUFA date timing would offset three of the four months that were expected to be gained from FDA's earlier determination to conduct a priority review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. Prior to such determination, Amarin had expected a PDUFA goal date in January 2020, based on a standard 10-month review. Amarin plans to update the investment community after appropriately definitive information is available related to a new PDUFA date.Amarin intends to continue to move forward with its plans to double the size of its sales force to support the launch of Vascepa. Amarin plans to use the anticipated three-month delay in the PDUFA clock to better prepare for the assumed launch of Vascepa including more time to hire and train new sales representatives. To the extent that new sales managers and representatives are hired prior to the expanded label for Vascepa, Amarin intends to have them join the company's existing sales team in promoting Vascepa based on its current indication and existing promotional messaging.16:30EB Eventbrite appoints Lanny Baker as CFO, effective September 3 (17.49 +0.73)Mr. Baker joins Eventbrite from Yelp (YELP) where as CFO he oversaw corporate finance, accounting, investor relations and workplace functions.

Such an increase in the supply of ships, especially in a segment with a total of 118 vessels on the water and with more than half trading under time charters, has restricted handysize market rates from increasing alongside other sectors.

The S&P 500 advanced 1.9%, which extended its two-day comeback to 112 points, or 4.0%, from its session low on Wednesday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 1.4%, the Nasdaq Composite increased 2.2%, and the Russell 2000 increased 2.1%.Thursday's positive disposition ostensibly formed overnight after China reported a surprise yr/yr increase in July exports while holding its yuan firm, which again signaled goodwill in trade relations. Today's rally, however, appeared to be more a continuation from yesterday's big intraday reversal that suggested the recent sharp sell-off may have been excessive.Interestingly, the S&P 500 traded just below its 50-day moving average (2934) for most of the afternoon before finally breaking above the key technical level late in the session. The benchmark index held above the level on a closing basis.All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher by at least 1.0%. The energy sector (+2.9%) led the advance as oil prices ($52.52/bbl, +$1.38, +2.7%) rebounded, followed by the information technology (+2.4%), communication services (+2.2%), and consumer discretionary (+2.0%) sectors.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 33.92, +4.73, +16.2%) led the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+2.7%) higher after it unveiled its well-received server CPUs that Google and Twitter will reportedly use. Broadcom (AVGO 270.98, +0.93, +0.3%) struggled to participate in the chip rally amid news that it is close to purchasing Symantec's (SYMC 22.92, +2.51, +12.3%) enterprise business for about $10 billion.In earnings news, Booking Holdings (BKNG 1941.01, +119.45, +6.6%), Lyft (LYFT 62.10, +1.81, +3.0%), and Roku (ROKU 122.03, +21.06, +20.9%) outperformed the broader market following positive results and/or upbeat guidance. Kraft Heinz (KHC 28.22, -2.65, -8.6%) disappointed investors with its results.U.S. Treasuries were under noticeable selling pressure today, which sent the 10-yr yield up 11 basis points to 1.79% at one point during the session. Buyers gradually came back, ultimately leaving the benchmark yield up three basis points to 1.72%. The 2-yr yield finished also finished three basis points higher at 1.61%.

Continuing claims for the week ending July 27 decreased by 15,000 to 1.684 mln.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims continue hovering near multi-decade lows.Wholesale inventories were unchanged in June (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%) on top of an unrevised 0.4% increase in May. Wholesale sales decreased 0.3% in June after decreasing a revised 0.6% (from +0.1%) in May.The key takeaway from the June report and the May revision is that the gap between inventory growth and sales growth is widening, which should exert some pressure on prices.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for July on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +21.2% YTDS&P 500 +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +13.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.1% YTD16:21TSE Trinseo misses by $0.45, misses on revs; guides FY19 EPS below consensus (35.00 +1.81)Reports Q2 (Jun) earnings of $0.99 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.45 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.44; revenues fell 23.0% year/year to $951.8 mln vs the $1.07 bln two analyst estimate.Latex Binders net sales of $230 million for the quarter decreased 18% versus prior year due mainly to the pass through of lower raw material costs.Performance Plastics net sales of $347 million for the quarter were 16% below prior year due mainly to lower prices from the pass through of lower raw material costs.Co issues downside guidance for FY19, sees EPS of $4.15-4.86, excluding non-recurring items, vs. $5.54 S&P Capital IQ Consensus.16:20ROAD Construction Partners beats by $0.04, misses on revs (14.02 +0.20)Reports Q3 (Jun) earnings of $0.33 per share, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.29; revenues rose 16.5% year/year to $227.3 mln vs the $229.67 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Project backlog at June 30, 2019 was $581.1 mln.Adjusted EBITDA was $31.3 mln, up 37.9%.16:19PBYI Puma Biotech. beats by $0.32, reports revs in-line (9.21 +0.40)Reports Q2 (Jun) loss of $0.57 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.32 better than the single analyst estimate of ($0.89); revenues rose 6.1% year/year to $53.9 mln vs the $53.4 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Net NERLYNX revenue in the second quarter of 2019 was $53.8 million, compared to net NERLYNX revenue of $50.8 million in the second quarter of 2018."We anticipate the following key milestones during the remainder of 2019: (i) meeting with the FDA to discuss the clinical development and regulatory strategy for the SUMMIT trial in the third quarter of 2019; (ii) reporting additional data from the Phase II CONTROL trial in the fourth quarter of 2019; and (iii) receiving regulatory decisions for the extended adjuvant HER2-positive early stage breast cancer indication in additional countries."16:19DXC DXC Technology beats by $0.03, reports revs in-line (51.65 +1.76)Reports Q1 (Jun) earnings of $1.74 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.71; revenues fell 7.4% year/year to $4.89 bln vs the $4.86 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.16:18NRZ New Residential Investment prices $250 mln underwritten public offering of 10,000,000 shares of 7.125% Series B Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (15.27 +0.21)The company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for investments and general corporate purposes.16:18AIMT Aimmune Therapeutics misses by $0.08 (19.34 +0.24)Reports Q2 (Jun) loss of $1.01 per share, $0.08 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.93).Cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $250.3 million on June 30, 2019, compared to $303.9 million on December 31, 2018.

The benchmark index is down 1.0% with noticeable weakness in the semiconductor stocks.The Nasdaq Composite is down 1.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 is down 1.4%.President Trump told reporters today that the U.S. will not be doing business with Huawei, which seemed to confirm a Bloomberg report yesterday that the U.S. Commerce Department has been refraining from approving business licenses to work with the Chinese company. The president added that September trade talks could get canceled but are still scheduled for the time being.None of these events has been too surprising for investors, but the prospect of U.S.-China relations further deteriorating has contributed to a steady broad-based decline today.All 11 S&P 500 sectors are down, including eight with losses of at least 1.0%. The information technology sector (-1.5%) is underperforming amid the trade uncertainty, which has also made a noticeable impact on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-2.0%). Many semiconductor companies are heavily exposed to China.Uber (UBER 39.72, -3.23) shares have dropped 7.5% after the company reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss of $5.2 billion. Revenue also missed estimates, but today's loss has simply given back a bulk of yesterday's 8% rally.In other earnings news, shares of DXC Technology (DXC 35.74, -15.90, -30.8%) have plunged over 30% after the company cut its FY20 outlook, while shares of Activision Blizzard (ATVI 47.56, -1.78, -3.6%) trade lower as investors remain underwhelmed by its downside Q3 guidance.The U.S. Treasury market, which has drawn plenty of attention this week, has been muted. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.70%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.2% to 97.43. Interestingly, despite the growth concerns, WTI crude is up 3.7%, or $1.94, to $54.48/bbl.Reviewing today's lone economic report, the Producer Price Index for July:The index for final demand increased 0.2% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, excluding food and energy, decreased 0.1% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). The m/m readings left the index for final demand up 1.7% yr/yr, unchanged from June. The index remains at its lowest level since January 2017. Core PPI was up 2.1% yr/yr, down from 2.3% in June.The key takeaway from the report is that inflationary pressure remains muted.12:53SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: AMRN (20.82 mln -17.35%), NKTR (16.72 mln -33.01%), VRAY (16.28 mln -56.9%)Industrials: GE (47.2 mln -3.06%)Consumer Discretionary: F (25.15 mln -1.36%), FTCH (19.75 mln -41.42%)Information Technology: AMD (54.93 mln +0.88%), NOK (17.11 mln +0.28%), SYMC (15.56 mln +0.57%), DXC (14.71 mln -30.57%), MU (12.35 mln -3.33%), AAPL (11.43 mln -1.13%)Financials: BAC (24.44 mln -1.07%), QQQ (17.87 mln -1.5%), TQQQ (16.4 mln -4.53%), SQQQ (12.92 mln +4.48%)Energy: CHK (27.62 mln +0.34%), RIG (14.88 mln -4.15%)Consumer Staples: ABEV (16.79 mln -0.2%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: VRAY (13.64x -56.9%), NKTR (10.16x -33.01%), SIEN (4.23x +18.94%), NVRO (3.47x +16.54%)Industrials: WAIR (14.57x +6.88%)Consumer Discretionary: FTCH (10.92x -41.42%), WTRH (5.33x -62.1%), QSR (4.44x -3.09%), PLYA (3.69x -2.52%), CHUY (3.58x +10.27%)Information Technology: DXC (6.38x -30.57%), XELA (4.18x -43.08%), CISN (4.1x -23.4%), ALTR (4.07x -15.05%)Financials: PMT (7.44x -3.18%), SMFG (4.36x -1.31%)Energy: PUMP (4.6x -30.59%)Consumer Staples: PRMW (3.67x +7.05%)12:52SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: PBYI (11.1 +20.52%), SIEN (5.94 +18.94%), LXRX (1.5 +17.19%), NVRO (73.82 +16.54%), TXMD (3.04 +15.15%), TRXC (1.02 +13.33%), TRHC (66.44 +12.05%), CYRX (22.39 +10.95%), OMER (17.86 +9.5%), DVAX (3.32 +9.42%), DPLO (5.8 +9.02%)Consumer Discretionary: OSTK (24.12 +13.27%), CHUY (26.3 +10.27%), AGS (9.16 +10.17%), FRGI (10.84 +8.94%)Information Technology: APPN (50.08 +15.82%), PCTY (110.93 +9.41%)Financials: GDOT (29.92 +9.12%), GGAL (38.07 +8.93%)Energy: WFT (0.02 +9.52%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: VRAY (2.91 -56.9%), NKTR (19.81 -33.01%), AMRN (14.72 -17.35%)Industrials: VSLR (7.5 -19.35%), AAXN (57.31 -16.23%), TPC (9.32 -15.7%)Consumer Discretionary: WTRH (1.43 -62.1%), FTCH (10.69 -41.42%), MAT (11.54 -14.07%)Information Technology: XELA (1.39 -43.08%), DXC (35.86 -30.57%), CNDT (6.03 -30.37%), CISN (7.55 -23.4%), VRTU (35.83 -17.8%), ALTR (35.67 -15.05%), DBX (18.65 -13.09%)Energy: PUMP (12.04 -30.59%)12:23LLY Eli Lilly announces favorable U.S. Court of Appeals Alimta ruling (112.66 -1.31)The co announced that the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in favor of Lilly, confirming that the Alimta (pemetrexed for injection) vitamin regimen patent would be infringed by competitors that had stated their intent to market alternative salt forms of pemetrexed prior to the patent's expiration in May 2022. The ruling came in the appeals of U.S. District Court decisions in the cases of Eli Lilly and Company v. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) and Eli Lilly and Company v. Hospira (PFE). Previous rulings in Lilly's favor had precluded the generic companies from launching the alternative salt forms until the patent expires. If the patent is ultimately upheld through all remaining challenges, Alimta would maintain U.S. exclusivity until May 2022, preventing marketing of generic products for as long as the patent remains in force.12:10SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (128) outpacing new lows (110) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ACAD, AEM, AIZ, AJRD, AMT, APPN, AVP, AWK, AWR, AXS, AYX, AZN, AZUL, BAH, BAM, BLDP, BLL, BRFS, CB, CCI, CECO, CIM, CINF, CME, CMG, CMS, COLD, CTAS, CUBE, CYTK, EIX, ELS, ENPH, EQIX, ES, EXR, FLT, FMC, FNF, HAE, HCP, HIG, LHX, HSY, ICE, IDA, KGC, LAUR, LNT, MCD, MELI, MKC, MLM, MODN, NEE, NEO, NTRA, NVCR, NVRO, OAK, PCTY, PODD, PRO, PSA, QTS, RGLD, RLI, RNR, ROKU, RPM, SAM, SBAC, SEDG, SHOP, SHW, SIGI, SO, SRC, STE, STOR, SUI, SVM, SWCH, TERP, TFX, TSN, TTD, VRSK, WEC, WELL, WK, WM, WPC, WPM, EVRG, WST, WTR, ZBH, ZTS, AQN, BHK, BKT, CYRX, EIM, EMB, FNV, FTS, FWONA, FWONK, IIM, IRT, MCR, MVF, MYI, NAC, NAD, NEA, NG, NMZ, NUV, NVG, NZF, OUT, PVG, RNP, RQI, VGM, VMOStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ACRS, ADAP, AEG, AM, AMTD, AR, ASNA, ATI, AXL, B, BRKMY, BCOR, BCS, BIDU, BOX, BT, CCO, CLB, CLVS, CMA, CNDT, COMM, CRESY, CYOU, DLTH, DXC, ENBL, EROS, EXPR, EXTN, FET, FLR, GLNG, GLOG, GMLP, GRPN, GT, GVA, HBM, HIMX, HMHC, HSBC, HSC, ING, JCP, KB, KEP, KMT, KT, LXFR, LYG, M, MAC, MCFT, MIK, MMLP, MMSI, MT, NE, NINE, NKTR, ODP, OEC, OLN, PLT, PRTA, PTEN, PVH, QNST, RGR, RIG, RL, SCHW, SEMG, SIG, SMLP, SSL, SSP, TAST, TECK, TEF, TELL, TGH, TMST, TPC, TRQ, TRUE, TSE, TUSK, VNTR, VRAY, VRTU, VSTO, WETF, WFTIQ, YY, BE, CARS, CEIX, CISN, CLNC, FIXX, FTCH, JHG, KLXE, LTRPA, SDRL, TRIP, WTRH, XELAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: AFB, BFK, BUI, KTF, MCA, MQY, NBB, NID, NQP, WIAThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: CEA, SHG, SHI, STN, BIOBETFs that traded to 52 week highs: EMB, FXY, IYR, UREETFs that traded to 52 week lows: FXB, XES11:45SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Farfetch (FTCH) sinks following second quarter press -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersAPPN (48.93 +13.16%): Topped consensus for Q2 EPS and revs (+11.7% yr/yr to $66.9 mln); issued mixed guidance for Q3 (sees revs above consensus, EPS below); raised its FY19 revs guidance, increasing its view of both subscription and total revenue for the year.

Posts all-time lows. NKTR (19.73 -33.29%): Reported mixed Q2 results. Co then disclosed a manufacturing issue: a suboptimal batch of in-process intermediate was used to produce two lots of bempegaldesleukin, which ultimately led to the softening of response rates in the PIVOT-02 study. The issue was restricted to the single batch of intermediates using lots two and five. Co has developed a comprehensive control strategy to limit variances in raw materials, intermediates, and the final product going forward. Downgraded at Mizuho, Jefferies, and JP Morgan.

Co's yr/yr decrease in US revenue (fell 2% to $78.1 mln) was associated with customer destocking associated with co's previously announced decision to alter its practice regarding certain high-volume product orders. Patient trial procedures increased +15% yr/yr while permanent implant procedures increased +10%.Small Cap LosersVRAY (3.25 -51.78%): Reported below consensus Q2 EPS and upside revs (+83.5% yr/yr to $30.17 mln).

WTRH (1.95 -48.14%): Missed consensus for Q2 EPS and revs (+216.7% yr/yr to $51.3 mln) and lowered its FY19 revs view below consensus, citing delays to the roll-out of planned revenue initiatives, additional time needed to integrate the Bite Squad merger, and current competitive dynamics.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -40.00.The S&P 500 is up 0.2% for the week, but is on track to lose those slim gains at the open with the S&P 500 futures currently trading ten points, or 0.3%, below fair value.The decline in the futures could be a breather considering that the S&P 500 climbed 112 points, or 4.0%, over a two-day span. Of course, that advance followed a sharp sell-off that had many market participants blaming trade tensions, which are not helpful for economic growth prospects. In either case, the decline is modest and futures do not necessarily predict intraday action.Uber (UBER 40.12, -2.85, -6.7%) shares rose over 8% yesterday heading into its earnings report, which included a $5.2 billion quarterly loss.

Before this communication, the FDA had been silent as to whether it would convene an AdCom in connection with its review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. The FDA expressed, based on the timing of its recent decision to convene an AdCom, that November 14th is the earliest date on which it could hold an AdCom due to scheduling constraints for such a meeting.Accordingly, Amarin does not expect the FDA to take action on the sNDA by the previously announced September 28, 2019 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date. Amarin did not receive notice from the FDA of a PDUFA date extension. In light of the tentative AdCom date, Amarin anticipates that the PDUFA date will be extended, assuming a typical three-month extension, to a date in late December 2019. If so, this anticipated revised PDUFA date timing would offset three of the four months that were expected to be gained from FDA's earlier determination to conduct a priority review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. Prior to such determination, Amarin had expected a PDUFA goal date in January 2020, based on a standard 10-month review. Amarin plans to update the investment community after appropriately definitive information is available related to a new PDUFA date.Amarin intends to continue to move forward with its plans to double the size of its sales force to support the launch of Vascepa. Amarin plans to use the anticipated three-month delay in the PDUFA clock to better prepare for the assumed launch of Vascepa including more time to hire and train new sales representatives. To the extent that new sales managers and representatives are hired prior to the expanded label for Vascepa, Amarin intends to have them join the company's existing sales team in promoting Vascepa based on its current indication and existing promotional messaging.16:30EB Eventbrite appoints Lanny Baker as CFO, effective September 3 (17.49 +0.73)Mr. Baker joins Eventbrite from Yelp (YELP) where as CFO he oversaw corporate finance, accounting, investor relations and workplace functions.

Such an increase in the supply of ships, especially in a segment with a total of 118 vessels on the water and with more than half trading under time charters, has restricted handysize market rates from increasing alongside other sectors.

Washington rips Silicon Valley, but don't expect much actionPolitico.comJuly 16, 2019 Tuesday 10:15 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1276 wordsByline: jhendel@politico.com,  (John Hendel)Highlight: Democrats and Republicans appear to hold little common ground on what the problem with the tech industry is and how to fix it.BodyPresident Donald Trump threatened to open a probe into whether Google is committing "treason." Sen. Bernie Sanders said he would push to break up Facebook, Google and Amazon. Sen. Ted Cruz took aim at Google in his campaign against alleged censorship of conservatives. And Democrats accused the internet giants of squelching competitors and slammed Facebook's plans to offer a digital currency.And that was just Tuesday.But for all the flak Silicon Valley was taking from across Washington, the tech companies maintain a major advantage: Despite their shared suspicion and growing distrust of the tech industry, Democrats and Republicans appear to hold little common ground on what the problem is and how to fix it. And that could mean the odds of legislative punishment in the near term remain low.The attacks Tuesday dealt with a hodgepodge of issues and sometimes-incompatible complaints, though often in withering terms, in particular at the morning Senate hearing where Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown called it "delusional" for Facebook to expect people to trust the company with their wallets."Their motto has been 'move fast and break things.' And they certainly have," Brown said at a hearing on Facebook's planned digital currency, Libra. "They moved fast and broke our political discourse, they broke journalism, they helped incite a genocide and they're undermining our democracy."At Cruz's censorship hearing later in the day, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), compared Google to children who repeatedly sneak into the cookie jar despite their parents' warnings: "I feel like you all push the boundaries until your hand gets slapped."She also scoffed at the $5 billion fine that the Federal Trade Commission has proposed imposing on Facebook  for its violations of users' privacy - a complaint that puts the conservative Tennessean in much the same camp as liberal Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. "It should have been $50 billion," Blackburn said.But amid the back-and-forth at a slew of congressional hearings, clear divisions were evident between Democrats and Republicans and even sometimes within the parties themselves, highlighting the lack of consensus on just what to do about tech companies that dominate so many aspects of Americans' lives.Cruz (R-Texas) demanded that Google fork over data about how its algorithms work, to answer Republican questions about whether its main search engine and its YouTube video service discriminate against conservative viewpoints. Cruz again raised the prospect that Congress may pare back the online industry's 23-year-old legal immunity for lawsuits over user-posted content, a running theme lately among tech critics in both parties.But Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono, the top Democrat on Cruz's Judiciary subcommittee, hammered Republicans for even having Tuesday's tech bias hearing - saying they are "browbeating the tech industry for a problem that does not exist."In the House, Judiciary committee Democrats led by Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) drilled representatives of Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple over whether they've engaged in anti-competitive conduct, to the detriment of small retailers and the newspaper industry.But the top Republican on the antitrust panel, Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), warned against calls for sweeping antitrust action, saying that "just because a business is big doesn't mean that it is bad." Earlier in the day, Republicans appeared split over Facebook's Libra digital currency. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) called it "wildly premature" to pass judgment on the project. But Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) appeared to share Brown's skepticism, quipping: "I have great respect for Facebook but Facebook now wants to control the money supply. What could possibly go wrong?"Trump had kicked off the day by entertaining a gravely serious accusation about Google: He said his administration would look into a charge by tech investor and Facebook board member Peter Thiel - and, Trump tweeted, "a great and brilliant guy who knows this subject better than anyone!" - that Google may be committing "treason" through its work in China. That suggested that he may urge the Justice Department to launch an investigation into the matter. The DOJ did not respond to a request for comment on Trump's statement.The president later told reporters at the White House that he "would like to recommend to the various agencies, including perhaps our attorney general ... to maybe take a look" at what he called a "very strong charge" by Thiel.At the Cruz-led hearing Tuesday, Google public policy chief Karan Bhatia firmly pushed back against Thiel and Trump's assertions.Addressing questions from Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Bhatia said Google has "absolutely not" found evidence of Chinese government infiltration of the company or its data; allowed considerations involving work in China to influence any decisions on U.S. government contracts; or turned a blind eye to any leaks of Google software or data to Chinese intelligence."Fundamentally in China we actually do very little today," Bhatia said.Tech companies have deployed a range of strategies to deal with the increasing scrutiny in Washington. They've generally kept a low-profile in the face of Trump's attacks, denying that politics influences their content decisions, while arguing more vocally against Democratic calls from Warren and others to break them up. Executives including Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg have argued their companies' scale allows them to invest money in developing new technologies and compete with Chinese rivals.On the privacy front, many of the companies say they support federal privacy regulations in lieu of state-level rules, though Democrats warn against any national standard that could that gut strict privacy regulations in states like California.Despite the long Washington list of tech grievances, agreement on any one particular issue remains elusive. Democrats continue to be the most vocal about their unhappiness with the tech companies on data privacy and competition, while Republicans keep pressing their argument that conservatives are the victims of the industry's online censorship - something the tech companies emphatically deny.As POLITICO reported last week, Congress is running out of time to reach an agreement on one area where both Republicans and Democrats have seemed to be largely aligned - enacting federal privacy legislation to restrain how companies like Facebook can profit off of people's personal data. Last week's news about the FTC's proposed $5 billion fine for Facebook largely drew a yawn from Wall Street, and the company saw its stock price rise to its highest level in more than a year.And tech firms also continue to benefit from Trump's policies despite his escalating rhetoric against Silicon Valley. Just last week, his trade advisers went to bat against France's plans for a new "digital services" tax that would hit companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon, while Apple continues to escape the brunt of Trump's trade sanctions on China.On Monday, Trump even defended the billions of dollars in economic incentives that New York City had offered to Amazon for its proposed second headquarters, calling it "terrible" that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and fellow activists had helped block the deal. That was even though Trump frequently criticizes Amazon and its CEO, Jeff Bezos, for everything from its effect on brick-and-mortar retailers to Bezos' ownership of The Washington Post.Zachary Warmbrodt contributed to this report.  Article originally published on POLITICO MagazineLoad-Date: July 17, 2019End of Document

'REAL CONCERN' CAMBODIA MAY HOST CHINESE MILITARY ASSETS, DESPITE DEFENSE MINISTER'S DOWNPLAY: USStates News ServiceJuly 2, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1122 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:The U.S. Embassy in Cambodia on Tuesday hit back at Minister of Defense Tea Banh's bid to downplay suspicions that his government plans to host Chinese military assets at a U.S.-funded naval base in Preah Sihanouk province, warning that such a move would "weaken Cambodia's independence" and threaten ASEAN.In a letter written to Tea Banh last month, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for South and Southeast Asia Joseph Felter said that Cambodia's National Committee for Maritime Security Tactical Headquarters had requested that Washington refurbish a training facility and boat depot, built by the U.S. in 2017, when he toured the Ream Navy Base in January, according to media reports on Monday.While funds to upgrade the facilities were approved in April, Cambodia's Defense Ministry informed the Pentagon two months later that they were "no longer necessary," Felter said, prompting concerns that the ministry might be planning for a Chinese presence at the base in the province, which has seen an influx of Chinese investment in recent years.Tea Banh responded in an interview with RFA's Khmer Service that Cambodia had "never rejected" any offer from the U.S. to repair the buildings and said that the facilities in question "needed to be relocated" to allow for further development in the region, while dismissing speculation that Cambodia was planning to host Chinese military assets at the base as "fake news."He also reiterated a denial of a Nov. 15, 2018 report by Hong Kong's Asia Times online news portal, which cited unnamed diplomatic sources as saying that Beijing is building a 45,000 hectare (111,200-acre) naval base on the coast in Koh Kong provincea report that was later cited by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence in a letter to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen.On Tuesday, the U.S. Embassy issued a statement to RFA confirming the provenance of Felter's letter, which it said was delivered on June 24, and citing "recent developments" as having fueled speculation about Cambodia's plans for the Ream Navy Base, "including the possible hosting of Chinese military facilities.""Given the high level of Chinese economic and political influence in Cambodia, this is a real concern," the statement said."Any steps that weaken Cambodia's independence or open the door to a foreign military presence in Cambodia would be of serious concern to the United States and could threaten the credibility and centrality of ASEAN. We urge Cambodian leadership to maintain its constitutional commitment to an independent foreign policy and actively protect Cambodia's independence for future generations."Koh Kong baseHun Sen has also denied that his government would amend the constitution to allow China to build a naval base in the country as "fake news" and part of a "foreign campaign to mislead the public and the international community with the intention of destroying the country's independence and neutrality."If such a naval base were built on the Gulf of Thailand, it would allow China to significantly expand patrols on the South China Sea, which Beijing claims much of, while rival Taiwan and ASEAN countries Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam have their own stakes in the waters.In November 2017, Cambodia's Supreme Court ruled to ban the main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), months after its president, Kem Sokha, was arrested for an alleged plot to overthrow the government.The dissolution of the CNRP was part of a wider crackdown by Hun Sen on the opposition, NGOs and the independent media, which paved the way for his ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) to win all 125 seats in parliament in the country's July 2018 general election.While relations with the West have increasingly soured since the ballot, which was widely seen as a rollback of democratic freedoms, Cambodia's government has in recent months touted improved ties with China, which typically offers funding without many of the prerequisites that the U.S. and EU place on donations, such as improvements to human rights and rule of law.Chinese investment now flows into Cambodian real estate, agriculture and entertainmentparticularly to the port city of Sihanoukvillebut Cambodians regularly chafe at what they say are unscrupulous business practices and unbecoming behavior by Chinese residents, and worry that their country is increasingly bending to Beijing's will.Competing interestsIn an email on Tuesday, Brian Harding, deputy director of the Washington-based Center For Strategic and International Studies' (CSIS) Southeast Asia Program, told RFA that if Cambodia were to allow a Chinese military presence in the country it would "create a rift within ASEAN," as the move would be seen as "extremely provocative.""It will also significantly expand China's ability to project military power into Southeast Asia and enhance China's capacity to engage U.S. vessels transiting the region," Harding said.However, he acknowledged that the U.S. and European Union "have few ways to deter Cambodia from hosting Chinese military assets," aside from trade measures that they are already considering leveling against Hun Sen's government in response to rollbacks on democracy since the lead up to last year's election.Harding said that in light of a constitutional bar on foreign military bases in the country, "there are more artful ways" for China to have a military presence in Cambodia, "with Cambodia nominally retaining sovereignty."But he warned that "as long as Cambodia is seen to reflexively hew to Chinese interests, it will be very difficult for Cambodia to convince skeptics and tamp down speculation."Sovereignty at riskPaul Chambers, a lecturer on international affairs for the College of ASEAN Community Studies at Thailand's Naresuan University, also warned that Cambodia "could easily lose its sovereignty to China" if Hun Sen's government allows Beijing to establish a military base in the country.Hun Sen can either allow Cambodia to become "a proxy of China" by doing so, or look to the U.S. to balance Chinese influence in his country, he said."Either way, Cambodia would once again become a toy with which China and the U.S. compete to further their own geopolitical interests," he said, referring to Chinese influence over the 1975-1979 Khmer Rouge regime in 1975 and Western efforts that led to the establishment of a democracy in Cambodia following the October 1991 Paris Peace Accord."At this point, Cambodia's only way out is to keep China and the U.S. out of Cambodia," he said. "But that is highly unlikely at this point."Reported by RFA's Khmer Service. Translated by Sovannarith Keo. Written in English by Joshua Lipes.Load-Date: July 2, 2019End of Document

International Beer Day: The attempts at plagiarism of the world's most famous Mexican beerCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 2, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 640 wordsBody       Corona beer was plagiarized more than a decade ago (Photo: Special)Corona is the most famous Mexican beer in the world. His image is sopopular, he has inevitably fallen victim to plagiarism as well as failed attempts to emulate his successful formula.The flagship product of Grupo Modelo is the best-selling Mexican-born beer in theworld, with an annual production of 28.8 million hectolitres, being the United States where it is exported the most, according to information from Brewers of Mexico.Ranked among the top 10 best-selling beersworldwide, Corona was plagiarized 12 years ago, when in 2007 images of Cerono Chinese beer with exactly the same typography and design as the most pilsner were viral famous of the Aztec country in its various products.Beijing Cerono Trade Limited Company produced and marketed its Cerono beer with bottles, label, logos, typography, colors and graphics identical to those of Mexican drink.This faithful copy of Mexican beer was sold in China (Photo: Facebook)Grupo Modelo took up the matter and found that at least 1,000,000 of the brand's boxes were sold that plagiarised its image in China."A few years ago they launched a product called Cerono,it was either equal to ourproduct, the typography, instead of our gargoyles put two Chinese dragons, practically the image was the same, it was practically a clone ", mentioned years later, Carlos Fernández,chairman of the board of directors and ceo of Grupo Modelo."The Chinese government took letters on the matter, they helped us in theprocess, today you can no longer produce Ceronobeer, we win all the trials, it is no longersold, whoever does it commits a crime and goes to jail," the Management.In cerono's bottle, the legend "A Superior Quality Mexico Brand" appeared on the label's central seal and under it the phrase "Brewed and Bottled by Beijing Cerono Trade Limited Company", as if it were just a bad joke.Model took up the subject (Photo: Facebook)"Shanzhai is a contemporary Chinese economic-social phenomenon consisting of counterfeiting of electronic products and, most recently, innovation generated from these copied and improved products with new functions," byung-Chul Han describes in his essay "Shanzhai", a phenomenon that could explain this practice.However, despite the usurpation of its image in the Asiangiant, Mexican-born beerowned by Anheuser-Bush InBev (Ab InBev),it was recently positioned as the number one imported brand in China.READ: The Art of Deconstruction and Counterfeiting in China"The brand continues to grow rapidly in the super premium segment inChina, where it recently became the number one imported beer brand,"said Carlos Brito, CEO of AB InBev just a year ago.On several occasions, the alleged theft of the formula of this popular beerhas been hinted at, although such plagiarism has never been proven. And even if that were the case, Grupo Modelo's production capacity does not appear to be in opposition.But Grupo Modelo has also stolen ideas (Photo: Facebook)However, just as Grupo Modelo has suffered from the inclement conditions of piracy, this brewing company has also been pointed out for copying ideas, as happened with the "autocanas".The newspaper Excélsior revealed a year ago that the beer-producing giant illegally exploited the trademark "Autolata".READ: Corona: the iconic Mexican beer that could suffer major consequences from rising tariffsThe entrepreneur José Acevedo, owner of Publilatas, registered in September 1996 the brand "Autolata" with the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, according to the aforementioned medium, so the exploitation of that name by the brewer, would be breaking the law.With 93 years of existence - having been released in 1926 - this pilsner-type beer has transcended over time, despite the setbacks and vicissitudes throughout its history.Load-Date: August 2, 2019End of Document

Europe's pound and stock market fall after Boris Johnson's request to suspend British Parliament ahead of BrexitCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 28, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 532 wordsBody       The British Pound was shaken by Boris Johnson's project (Shutterstock)The UK currency fell on Wednesday after Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government's intentions to suspend Parliament's activities to avoid obstacles to the "Brexit", scheduled for 31 October.In a complex international context marked by the threat of a new global recession and escalating tensions over theU.S.-China trade war, the fall in the pound comes amid sharp falls in the world's major stock exchanges and the depreciation of the Chinese yuan.On Wednesday it took $1,2202 to buy a pound sterling, 0.72% less than onTuesday. It's its worst value in two weeks, although it cut a drop of about 1% at the beginning of the day. While the euro was trading at 1,1014 units perpound, representing a 0.58% fall for the British currency.On Wednesday Premier Boris Johnson announced that he will ask Queen Elizabeth II tosuspend parliament from 10 September, in a controversial move that would prevent British MePs from having sufficient time to try to prevent "Brexit" (UK exit from the European Union) without agreement.Boris Johnson, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (REUTERS/Stefan Rousseau/Pool)"The decision to end the current parliamentary session - the longest in almost 400 years and one of the least active in recent months - will allow the prime minister to put a new national agenda before Members for debate and scrutiny," he said, said a downing Street communiqué.Meanwhile, major European stock markets recorded losses at Wednesday's session, following a negative close on Tuesday, to the expectation of both Brexit and persistent trade tensions between China and the United States.The FTSE 100 index in London recorded a loss of 0.26%, while the DAX in Frankfurt fell back by 1.01% and the CAC 40 in Paris was 0.97%. The European Stoxx 600 index also fell, in its case 0.87%.Hours earlier, Asian stock markets had also closed in red, led by the Indian BSE Sensex (-0.50%), the Shanghai Stock Exchange index (-0.29%), in China, and also the Hong Kong Hang Seng (-0.195). The Japanese Nikkei 225, in camio, closed with a slight 0.11% rise.Market concern continuesNeither did Wall Street be saved on Tuesday from the negative day, recording casualties in the Dow Jones (-0.47%), the S&P500; (-0.32%) and the Nasdaq (-0.34%). These trends were expected to continue on Wednesday in New York when the session opens. U.S. markets had a good start to the week after President Donald Trump unveiled an alleged call from the Chinese government requesting a return to thenegotiations, to find an agreement that will leave behind the so-called "trade war," the wave of reciprocal tariffs on trade between the two countries.But Beijing disunderstood shortly after the call took place, again generating uncertainty among investors and dispelling the teret optimism for what was interpreted as trump's attempt to reduce tensions.MORE ON THIS THEME:Boris Johnson called for temporary suspension of British Parliament to avoid obstacles to BrexitWall Street opened up trend after Donald Trump's optimistic statements regarding China relationshipDonald Trump announced china wants to return to trade negotiations with USLoad-Date: August 29, 2019End of Document

Stocks That Drive One Of The Best Mutual Funds, And Is Facebook Risking An Antitrust Breakup?Investor's Business DailyJuly 8, 2019Copyright 2019 Investor's Business Daily, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: MUTUAL FUNDSLength: 2375 wordsByline: PAUL KATZEFFBodyhttps://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MFMQA-stuzin2-070519.jpgIf you want your mutual funds to outperform the broad market — and who doesn't? — use an active manager. That's fund manager Ken Stuzin's message. And active management is a key reason behind an outperformance streak that makes his portfolio one of the best mutual funds.Active management also gives him a concerned investor's perspective about whether Amazon and Facebook risk being broken up for violating antitrust laws related to monopolies or due to privacy concerns.As for shareholders who are satisfied with merely keeping pace with the overall market or a specific segment, either in their whole portfolio or a portion of it, they can find a passive index fund to do that, he adds.Stuzin runs his $2.3 billion Brown Advisory Growth Equity (BIAGX) in anything but a passive fashion. He focuses on a relatively small number of what he expects will be great investment ideas. His concentrated portfolio holds 30 to 35 names.More holdings than that, he feels, leads to overdiversification that dilutes performance.And Stuzin takes his notion of best ideas a step further. He compares his portfolio to a wild ecosystem, where the law of the jungle rules. It is survival of the fittest. Only the best growing stocks stay in the fund. He calls this "Darwinian capitalism."Stuzin's ideas have led to the success that makes his portfolio one of the best mutual funds. His fund outperformed the S&P 500 in 2018 as well as in the three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31 on an average annual return basis..Best Mutual Funds: IBD's 2019 Mutual Fund AwardsA scant 10% of qualified  earned a place among the best mutual funds.His fund is still shining bright among . This year through June 30, the fund was up 26.35%, well ahead of the broad market benchmark's 18.54%. It was also outpacing 90% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar. The entire category averaged 21.22%.Stuzin, who is 55 years old, talked with IBD about his investment strategy from his office on Baltimore Harbor.Other Articles And Tables In :Best Mutual Funds: Fast GrowthIBD: How fast does a stock have to grow for you to like it?Ken Stuzin: We define a growth stock as a business which can reasonably support 14% or better earnings per share growth through a full market cycle. That is twice the long-term growth rate of the broad market as measured by the S&P 500.Wild On Wall Street: 'Darwinian Capitalism'IBD: And give me an example of Darwinian capitalism.Stuzin: Microsoft had suffered from the law of large numbers. It's hard for a company that big to grow at 14% or more. And the market for personal computers and shrink-wrapped (noncloud on-site) software slowed.Then Microsoft introduced Azure, its cloud computing service like Amazon Web Services (AWS). So Microsoft began to meet our 14% growth requirement and we bought it a few quarters ago.Customers value subscription software (like Azure) so much that they keep buying it even if they get into deep trouble. They'll keep paying for it until they go out of business. So Azure is resistant to economic slowdowns.Our concerns about the regulatory backdrop for Facebook increased just as the stock for Microsoft dropped, so that was a swap we made.Will Antitrust Regulators Break Up Amazon?IBD: What about Amazon? Any regulatory concerns there?Stuzin: Amazon would do better than other consumer discretionary names in a recession. On the other hand, people are starting to talk about a new school of thought about what antitrust means.Remember, I'm not an antitrust lawyer. (But in the early 1900s,) antitrust action was about breaking up massive companies that at the end of day were inflationary vis a vis consumers. Whether it was 'Big Oil' or railroads, a key problem was lack of competition.But how do you handle Amazon, which is a deflationary force? Still, there's a school of thought that says anything that becomes too big, too powerful, has too much leverage over other businesses and industries is (a something that warrants) antitrust action.Is Facebook Risking Antitrust Action?IBD: Do you think Amazon will get broken up?Stuzin: My guess is that the Amazon situation will play out in courts and legislatures for years to come.It's not like Facebook, which has privacy issues that I suspect will cause something to happen sooner from a regulatory perspective.IBD: In contrast, you don't see Amazon at risk of being broken up?Stuzin: Right. Chances are close to zero over the period where we would make investment decisions.I'd be much more concerned about the prospect of Facebook being broken up. That regulatory process deals with questions of privacy, of monetizing privacy and the ability of consumers to opt out. That's part of why I don't own it.Best Mutual Funds: Is This Your Kind Of Market?IBD: What type of market does the fund tend to do best in?Stuzin: We generally outperform in most markets. We have strong evidence that in highly volatile and bear markets, we have done well vs. peers and our benchmark.Also, at the later stages of runaway bull markets that are driven by momentum and euphoria and not fundamentals, we tend to underperform.IBD: What type of market are we heading into?Stuzin: It's hard to say what the future holds. We are not currently seeing the same sort of euphoria that was evident in the late 1990s. And the current volatility, while not high by historic standards, does suggest a certain skittishness by market participants. That volatility has been a beneficial background for our fund.IBD: This fund has consistently outperformed. How does it do that?Stuzin: It's not that we outperform the benchmark every year. It's more of an average annual return thing.We own a small number of names. They have huge barriers to entry, to block new competitors. They are best of breed.I don't mind lagging in the short-term if it means outperforming in the long-term.Coaches For Money Managers: 'Be Ruthless'IBD: What else makes this fund different from other growth funds?Stuzin: There are several things. One of them is that about three years ago we began working with a firm in London that does behavioral finance work. They're coaches for money managers. In my fund's case, they modeled every trade it made over 18 years. They identified what we do to add alpha (outperform the broad market). They advised us to keep the number of names we own tight. Sell names faster. We can always bring a name back.We typically have weights up to 5%. Certain stocks that we were selling went from 5% down to 1% (of holdings). They said: "Why keep it at 1%? Sell it totally, faster. Be ruthless."Maybe I went slowly because I didn't want investors to think turnover was increasing. That could be mistaken for uncertainty.IBD: So have you sold out totally faster since then?Stuzin: Actually, we will not own less than 1.5% in a name. Our takeaways were to trust our fundamental views, which were statistically accurate, and to sell completely rather than waiting for more confirmation of the negative outlook at 1.5%.And yes, while we don't have a lot of experience where the fundamentals of names have deteriorated rapidly, where we have seen them in the last several years, we have more quickly moved to eliminate those names.Genpact: Odd Duck, Not SexyIBD: Genpact is an odd duck. It's both a delivery service and an outsourcing company, which was spun out from General Electric What's there to like about such an odd duck?Stuzin: Their outsourcing is good at doing mundane things that clients must do, like accounts payable or receivables. GE's Jack Welch said we'll form a division to do those thing and not bother our managers who are selling train engines or jet engines or medical imaging.It's not sexy. But it's a recurring revenue machine. The only time people stop using them is if a company goes out of business.They are a hedge if you're worried about hiring enough skilled workers to do those mundane administrative things. Genpact lowers the cost of doing those mundane but important activities.Subscription Business ModelsIBD: Why has Adobe grown so popular among investors in the past 10 years?Stuzin: The key was Adobe's switch to a cloud delivery system. That gave them recurring revenues. In the old days, when people bought shrink-wrapped software, maybe they'd buy an update, maybe not. Maybe they'd buy it every year, maybe not.But when software is delivered via the internet, you subscribe and have no choice about getting — and paying for — updates. As you know, it's called software-as-a-service (SaaS). When SaaS is attached to critical software, customers subscribe and keep paying because they have no choice.We also own Autodesk and Salesforce.com, which are also delivered as subscription services.Will Alibaba Trade In Hong Kong?IBD: Is Alibaba like Amazon, only with a longer runway?Stuzin: Yes, Alibaba is a Chinese version of Amazon, going into other areas like cloud computing, digital entertainment and the like. And it has a longer run in China than Amazon has in the U.S.IBD: Is there a worst-case scenario that in a U.S.-China trade war, U.S. investors could have their shares expropriated by Alibaba or the Chinese government?Stuzin: I would point out that it only trades in U.S. dollars (on the New York Stock Exchange in American depository shares). It would be a disaster not just for the U.S. and Chinese economies, but for markets around the world if something like that somehow happened.IBD: So it's not a problem?Stuzin: It's a reason that Alibaba isn't a bigger piece of my fund. These quasi-geopolitical risks exist. We can take comfort in the fact that this management team is very strong. (Co-founder and Executive Chairman) Jack Ma and (co-founder and Executive Vice Chairman) Joe Tsai are good people. Many of the company leaders are from the West. They are very smart. They take great pains to visit U.S. investors. On the face of it, we're fine.Why One Of The Best Mutual Funds Trimmed PayPalIBD: PayPal share price is uptrending. Why have you have trimmed your share count in recent disclosures?Stuzin: I don't have concerns about its fundamentals. It's just my 5% weighting limit. Things get trimmed that have done well.They benefit from the shift to digital payments from cash. Everyone wants to get into digital payments: Apple, banks. I have kids in college. I almost always send them spending money via Venmo, the peer-to-peer payment service that PayPal owns.Best Of American IngenuityIBD: What makes Edwards Lifesciences a "great investment idea?"Stuzin: It's a leader in medical devices focused on heart valves. They've introduced a minimally invasive heart valve through what's called TAVR.Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is the replacement of the aortic valve of the heart through blood vessels instead of through traditional open heart surgery, which requires cracking your sternum and then suturing you up. You are in an intensive care hospital setting (with heart surgery). You might get out in days or weeks.With TAVR, you have the procedure, have breakfast in the hospital the next day and leave. While you're in, you're not in intensive care. In terms of cost comparison, it's a home run.At first, TAVR was thought useful for the sickest patients, where an open heart procedure might kill them. Now, doctors are thinking that TAVR might be better for all patients needing a valve replacement. This is the best of American technological ingenuity.A Logistics Company — And MoreIBD: How can Cintas, which provides uniforms, supplies and services to light industry, be such an earnings powerhouse?Stuzin: At its core, it's a logistics company. They pick up and drop off uniforms. Their trucks go to workplaces, so they've learned to ask customers: Is there any other service we can provide?In fact, they drop off rugs for lobbies, soap dispensers in restrooms, cardiac paddles. And chances are, they do it at a lower price than smaller companies that used to deliver those products. They tell customers, we'll lower your costs by 10%. And they do it.Why One Of The Best Mutual Funds Likes ZoetisIBD: Does Zoetis offer built-in diversification, selling some drug products for companion animals and other drugs for farm animals?Stuzin: People who own companion animals are a growing group. And they love their animals. The number of farm-animal owners is also growing. As places like China become richer, their intake of protein grows. Consumption of farm-grown meat is up.Yes, it's terrifically diversified. And it's not subject to the same regulatory oversight as makers of drugs for humans are.IBD: What makes Estee Lauder attractive?Stuzin: They're skewed to higher-end brands in women's skin creams and fragrances. The business is global. They sell affordable luxury, which is resilient in slowdowns and a fast grower.The share price is up 40% on a year-to-date basis. One of the interesting things about them is their distribution. They sell a lot in airports. People spend more as they travel. They shop in duty-free shops. There's some cyclicality, but even in the worst of times, people stick with their regime of skin cream and fragrance, which makes them resilient and helps them meet our 14% annual growth requirement.Thermo Fisher: A Safe Play On Biopharma?IBD: Thermo Fisher Scientific has strong fundamentals and its stock has performed well. What makes it attractive?Stuzin: There are concerns about drug pricing in the U.S. because the government does not directly negotiate with drug companies. It's one of the few things that Democrats, Republicans and the president agree about.But Thermo sells the picks and shovels to the miners (sell the supplies to the drugmakers). You don't have to bet on which miner will strike gold.Thermo sells lab equipment, analytical equipment. They have a huge catalog of equipment that any research lab, whether it's at a university, biopharma company, food testing company — Thermo supplies them all.They are at the lower end of our growth requirement range. But they are positioned incredibly well.Follow Paul Katzeff on Twitter at @IBD_PKatzeff for more tips about growth stocks, growth mutual funds and active mutual fund managers who outperform the market.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Load-Date: July 9, 2019End of Document

POLICE FILL HONG KONG STREETS WITH TEAR GAS IN BID TO DISPERSE ANGRY CROWDStates News ServiceJuly 28, 2019 SundayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 954 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Police fired large numbers of tear gas rounds and rubber bullets in Hong Kong's central business district on Sunday, in a bid to disperse anti-government protesters after thousands gathered to make their anger known over recent violent attacks by triads and police alike.At least four people were taken to hospital during the clashes, where they were in satisfactory condition.While previous protests have been marked by slogans and banners opposing plans to allow extradition to mainland China, this weekend's protests have seen protesters start to use more aggressive tactics, returning police strobe lights with pocket lasers and ripping up paving stones to hurl at riot police after tear gas and rubber bullets were fired.The protesters are now calling their movement a revolution to "Reclaim Hong Kong," a Chinese expression that can also mean "Free Hong Kong," depending on context."I'm at the protest in Sai Wan," Joshua Wong, a former student leader of the 2014 Occupy Central movement for fully democratic elections, said via his Twitter account."Outside the Chinese Liaison Office just now, police suddenly fired more than 10 rounds of tear gas against us (who were not charging at all)," Wong wrote."There was smoke everywhere. I've never suffocated like this before and felt close to fainting. Chaotic."Dozens injuredWong also said he had witnessed multiple injuries at the hands of police, as well as arrests: "Police using excessive force once again against peaceful protesters who are only occupying streets," he wrote."Elsewhere rubber bullets are also fired. Dozens are injured. Many are beaten and arrested amid the mess."Local journalist Xinqi Su posted a photo of a livid-looking injury sustained by one protester after riot police charged on protesters."A young man's left ankle is bleeding," Su tweeted. "Another protester showed me a foam bullet and said that was what injured the man. This is the second foam bullet I saw on Connaught [Road]."One large crowd made its way from Admiralty in an easterly direction, blocking the road outside the police headquarters in Wanchai and posting messages on the building. Others continued to the glitzy shopping district of Causeway Bay, where they occupied a street outside the Sogo department store.Meanwhile, another crowd approached the Chinese government's Central Liaison Office in Hong Kong Island's Sheung Wan district, building barricades on the street and throwing debris. When police fired tear gas, protesters began throwing fragments of paving stones back, prompting police to dispatch the special squad.The standoff then moved to barricades hastily constructed from metal traffic barriers, cable ties, and umbrellas on Connaught Road and Des Voeux Road West.The special riot quad quickly dispersed the crowd on Des Voeux Road, subduing many on the ground, while police continued to fire tear gas rounds until the air all around was thick with it, and people in restaurants and shops were unable to escape.'Dodgy cops'Earlier, police had authorized a gathering in Central district's Chater Garden, to which some 11,000 people turned up, chanting "Shame on the dodgy cops!" in a reference to the growing belief among protesters that the Hong Kong Police Force are acting as frontline political enforcers for the ruling Chinese Communist Party via chief executive Carrie Lam, and are colluding with triad criminal gangs.Police said the lines of riot police were closing in on protesters late on Saturday."Police's dispersal operation is still ongoing and a large number of protestors are still gathering in Sheung Wan area," the force said in a statement."Police officers have proceeded with another round of dispersal operation and are moving their cordon lines from Shun Tak Centre on the west side and Harbour Building on the east side. Also, Police have set cordon lines on the roads on the south side."Public criticism of police is growing after they used tear gas in a heavily built-up residential area for the second day running, leaving families with children choking in nearby restaurants, government broadcaster RTHK reported.But police hit back, saying that some protesters had set fire to a cart full of objects and shoved it at police lines."Some protestors committed arson at various locations ... seriously threatening the safety of everyone at scene," the force said. "Police condemn the protestors' escalating violence and appeal to everyone at scene to stay calm."The statement said Sunday's gathering was "unauthorized," although a peaceful demonstration did take place in an authorized location earlier in the day.Earlier clashesThe renewed clashes came after 13 people aged between 18 and 68 were arrested in earlier clashes in the New Territories town of Yuen Long on Saturday, which came after thousands gathered to protest police inaction over a triad-related attack on train passengers a week earlier.The arrestees are being held on suspicion of illegal assembly, possession of offensive weapons, assaulting police, and assault.A total of 24 people were reported injured as of Sunday morning by the Hospital Authority, with two of them in a serious condition and six in a stable condition. The remaining 16 people were discharged after treatment. Four police officers were among the injured.Meanwhile, police have arrested Max Chung, the man whose application to hold a rally in Yuen Long was turned down on the grounds that it could pose a threat to public safety.Chung was arrested on suspicion of "incitement to illegal assembly" after speaking on a radio show on Sunday.Reported by Lau Siu-fung for RFA's Cantonese Service.

Twitter revealed its decision to suspend 1,000 accounts from its social network in China, and shut down its advertising platform to Chinese state media, due to its interference."Overall, these (suspended) accounts were trying to sow discord in Hong Kong, even damaging the legitimacy of the protesting movement."According to our intensive research, we have evidence that this is a coordinated, state-backed operation," Twitter corporate says.For its part, Facebook reported that it will delete five accounts, seven pages and three groups after Twitter alerted it. Facebook said some 15,500 accounts followed one or more of those pages, while 2,200 accounts joined at least one of the groups. The company said its investigation had found "links to people associated with the Chinese government."Global SaleurgeFacebook did not make the decision to cancel its advertising business to Chinese state media, but it is the first time it closes accounts due to political aspects.Hundreds of thousands of protesters have demonstrated by a self-contained and democratic Hong Kong over the past two months.Facebook and Twitter's decisions reflect the extent to which misinformation has become a global scourge.State-targeted social media polarization campaign cases have recently been seen in Saudi Arabia, Israel, China, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.In August, Facebook, Google and Twitter identified a misinformation campaign that originated in Iran, where state media purchased advertising to link accounts to them.In a statement, Suzanne Nossel, CEO of PEN America, a nonprofit that supports free speech, called Twitter and Facebook decisions "the height of hypocrisy."He urged both companies to "redouble resources to detect and eliminate government-backed disinformation campaigns."   Load-Date: September 2, 2019End of Document

Huawei says sales up 23% despite US controlsAssociated Press Financial WireJuly 30, 2019 Tuesday 10:58 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 858 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Huawei's sales rose by double digits in the first half of this year despite being blacklisted by Washington and its chairman, saying U.S. pressure has "galvanized our people," expressed confidence Tuesday the Chinese tech giant will "enter a new period of growth."Huawei Technologies Ltd., the biggest maker of network gear for phone companies and the No. 2 smartphone brand, is scrambling to preserve its business after the Trump administration blocked access to U.S. components and technology in May on security grounds.Sales have suffered "some impact" but Huawei avoided disruption in shipments to customers, Liang Hua said at a news conference at its headquarters in Shenzhen, near Hong Kong. He said Huawei is reviewing its product lineup to make sure it can fill orders without U.S. components if necessary.American pressure "has galvanized our people and reinvigorated the company," Liang said."We believe we will get through the difficulties and challenges in the short term and enter into a new period of growth," he said.Washington says Huawei is a security risk, an accusation the company denies. American officials also see Huawei as a competitive threat and a recipient of official Chinese support for technology development they say is based on improper subsidies and stealing or pressuring foreign companies to hand over know-how.Sales in the six months through June rose 23.2% over a year earlier to 401.3 billion yuan ($58.3 billion), according to Liang. That was up from 2018's full-year growth rate of 19.5%, but Liang warned Huawei will "face difficulties" in the second half.Smartphone shipments rose 24% from a year ago to 118 million handsets, he said.Liang declined to give a forecast of second-half sales, but said, "I am very confident in our full-year growth."At the start of his presentation, a photo of a fighter plane in flight despite being hit by gunfire was projected onto a screen beside Liang. He said, "like this airplane riddled with bullet holes, we stayed the course."Huawei's resilience reflects its financial and technological strength compared with its smaller Chinese rival, ZTE Corp., which was nearly driven into bankruptcy last year by a ban on access to U.S. technology over its sales to Iran and North Korea. President Donald Trump restored access after ZTE paid a $1 billion fine and replaced its executive team.Huawei has developed its own low-end chips for use in entry-level smartphones and servers but still needs U.S. chips and other components for its most advanced products.Liang said Huawei plans to increase this year's research and development spending to 120 billion yuan ($17 billion). That would be a 20 percent increase over 2018 spending, which already was among the highest for any global company.Washington's decision to add Huawei to an "entity list" of foreign companies that require official permission to buy technology sent shock waves through U.S. industry. Huawei is one of the biggest buyers of chips and other components and paid American suppliers some $12 billion last year.Trump agreed to allow vendors to sell widely available technologies to Huawei. But Liang said "we have not seen a resumption of supplies" of components needed for its core products.Trump has suggested he might lift controls on Huawei if Washington and Beijing reach a deal to end a tariff war over American complaints about China's trade surplus and technology ambitions.American and Chinese trade negotiators were due to meet this week in Shanghai.Huawei, with 180,000 employees, has for a decade fought U.S. accusations it might facilitate Chinese spying.The company denies suggestions it might install "backdoors" in equipment to permit eavesdropping. Its founder, Ren Zhengfei, a former military engineer, told reporters earlier this year he would reject Chinese government demands to disclose his foreign customers' secrets.The U.S. export curbs threatened Huawei's smartphone sales by disrupting access to the Android operating system supplied by Alphabet Inc.'s Google unit. Huawei can use the basic system, which Google provides for free, but lost access to maps and other services that require the U.S. company's support.Ren, the company founder, said earlier smartphones sales plunged 40 percent following the ban.

Huawei says sales up 23% despite US controlsAssociated Press InternationalJuly 30, 2019 Tuesday 10:58 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 858 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Huawei's sales rose by double digits in the first half of this year despite being blacklisted by Washington and its chairman, saying U.S. pressure has "galvanized our people," expressed confidence Tuesday the Chinese tech giant will "enter a new period of growth."Huawei Technologies Ltd., the biggest maker of network gear for phone companies and the No. 2 smartphone brand, is scrambling to preserve its business after the Trump administration blocked access to U.S. components and technology in May on security grounds.Sales have suffered "some impact" but Huawei avoided disruption in shipments to customers, Liang Hua said at a news conference at its headquarters in Shenzhen, near Hong Kong. He said Huawei is reviewing its product lineup to make sure it can fill orders without U.S. components if necessary.American pressure "has galvanized our people and reinvigorated the company," Liang said."We believe we will get through the difficulties and challenges in the short term and enter into a new period of growth," he said.Washington says Huawei is a security risk, an accusation the company denies. American officials also see Huawei as a competitive threat and a recipient of official Chinese support for technology development they say is based on improper subsidies and stealing or pressuring foreign companies to hand over know-how.Sales in the six months through June rose 23.2% over a year earlier to 401.3 billion yuan ($58.3 billion), according to Liang. That was up from 2018's full-year growth rate of 19.5%, but Liang warned Huawei will "face difficulties" in the second half.Smartphone shipments rose 24% from a year ago to 118 million handsets, he said.Liang declined to give a forecast of second-half sales, but said, "I am very confident in our full-year growth."At the start of his presentation, a photo of a fighter plane in flight despite being hit by gunfire was projected onto a screen beside Liang. He said, "like this airplane riddled with bullet holes, we stayed the course."Huawei's resilience reflects its financial and technological strength compared with its smaller Chinese rival, ZTE Corp., which was nearly driven into bankruptcy last year by a ban on access to U.S. technology over its sales to Iran and North Korea. President Donald Trump restored access after ZTE paid a $1 billion fine and replaced its executive team.Huawei has developed its own low-end chips for use in entry-level smartphones and servers but still needs U.S. chips and other components for its most advanced products.Liang said Huawei plans to increase this year's research and development spending to 120 billion yuan ($17 billion). That would be a 20 percent increase over 2018 spending, which already was among the highest for any global company.Washington's decision to add Huawei to an "entity list" of foreign companies that require official permission to buy technology sent shock waves through U.S. industry. Huawei is one of the biggest buyers of chips and other components and paid American suppliers some $12 billion last year.Trump agreed to allow vendors to sell widely available technologies to Huawei. But Liang said "we have not seen a resumption of supplies" of components needed for its core products.Trump has suggested he might lift controls on Huawei if Washington and Beijing reach a deal to end a tariff war over American complaints about China's trade surplus and technology ambitions.American and Chinese trade negotiators were due to meet this week in Shanghai.Huawei, with 180,000 employees, has for a decade fought U.S. accusations it might facilitate Chinese spying.The company denies suggestions it might install "backdoors" in equipment to permit eavesdropping. Its founder, Ren Zhengfei, a former military engineer, told reporters earlier this year he would reject Chinese government demands to disclose his foreign customers' secrets.The U.S. export curbs threatened Huawei's smartphone sales by disrupting access to the Android operating system supplied by Alphabet Inc.'s Google unit. Huawei can use the basic system, which Google provides for free, but lost access to maps and other services that require the U.S. company's support.Ren, the company founder, said earlier smartphones sales plunged 40 percent following the ban. Liang said Tuesday sales had recovered to 80 percent of their previous level.Liang said Huawei can develop its own operating system if necessary, based on its Hongmen system created for internet-linked cars, factory equipment and other devices."Using Android is always our preference," he said. "But if the United States doesn't let us use it, we have the capability to develop our own OS and ecosystem."Liang said the U.S. curbs had no effect on Huawei's sales of next generation, or 5G, telecoms technology.Huawei is, along with Sweden's LM Ericsson and Nokia Corp. of Finland, a top developer of 5G networks that are meant to expand support to internet-linked cars, factories and other devices.Huawei has signed 11 commercial contracts with foreign carriers since the May ban was imposed and has shipped a total of 150,000 base stations, according to Liang.Load-Date: July 31, 2019End of Document

Dec: 1789Moving the MarketSector WatchStock market little changed following yesterday's sell-offWalmart (WMT) earnings and guidance, July retail sales show resiliency in the U.S. China threaten countermeasures to U.S. tariffs but hopes U.S. can meet halfway in trade talksU.S. Treasury yields take another sharp leg lowerStrong: Consumer Staples, Utilities, Real EstateWeak: Energy, Industrials, Information Technology, Consumer Discretionary14:55 ETDow +42.13 at 25521.53, Nasdaq -20.67 at 7753.28, S&P +1.09 at 2841.69[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades near its flat line, while the Dow clings onto a 0.1% gain.Another look at energy shows the broader sector down 0.9%, which is good for today's worst-performance among the sectors. For the year, the S&P 500 energy sector is now down 2.8% this year versus a 13.3% gain in the S&P 500.Looking ahead, semiconductor companies Applied Materials (AMAT 46.96, +0.27, +0.6%) and NVIDIA (NVDA 148.23, -1.84, -1.2%) will report earnings results after today's closing bell.14:30 ETDow +26.28 at 25505.68, Nasdaq -24.59 at 7749.36, S&P +0.66 at 2841.26[BRIEFING.COM] In a Herculean feat of strength the major averages got taken for a ride this past half hour in which the S&P 500 at one point held losses of 0.53%, but now stands 0.06% higher. It's a head-scratcher for sure, but the decline had roots in the dip below 1.5% on the 10-year treasury yield -- a level not seen since August of 2016.The sell off, while partly treasury-based, draws partly from declines out of S&P 500 constituents Tapestry (TPR 18.80, -6.20, -24.80%), General Electric (GE 8.02, -1.01, -11.18%), and Gap (GPS 15.25, -1.28, -7.74%). TPR falls in reaction to this morning's underwhelming earnings and guidance, taking GPS lower in sympathy, while GE slips on the widely-covered critical report from "whistleblower" Harry Markopolos.Conversely, healthcare product company Agilent (A 69.81, +4.22, +6.43%) still holds on at the top of the index in part due to yesterday's Q3 beat and guidance.14:00 ETDow -123.28 at 25356.12, Nasdaq -53.26 at 7720.69, S&P -13.23 at 2827.37[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have resumed their selling in the last half hour with all three major averages getting worked over into negative territory; the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite now shows losses of 0.69%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 lower by 0.48% and 0.47% apiece.Gold futures added $3.40 (+0.2%) on Thursday to settle at $1,531.20/oz as a back and forth day turned higher at the right time.The U.S. Dollar Index sits just above 0.1% higher to 98.12.13:35 ETDow +56.61 at 25536.01, Nasdaq -4.92 at 7769.03, S&P +4.93 at 2845.53[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages still stand mixed at this point on Thursday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average pacing the advance, higher by 0.22%.Today's recovery in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is helped along by names like Walmart (WMT 110.92, +4.72, +4.44%), Boeing (BA 326.42, +6.00, +1.87%), and Visa (V 176.05, +2.79, +1.61%). WMT's widely-covered gains today stem from this morning's results and guidance, while BA & V move higher as the general recovery in the broader markets trickles down.Conversely, technology giant Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.53, -4.08, -8.06%) still sits at the bottom of the index following last night's underwhelming guidance.Today's modest recovery in the DJIA has the index about 4.94% lower on the month.12:55 ETDow +50.14 at 25529.54, Nasdaq -7.97 at 7765.98, S&P +4.42 at 2845.02[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.2% in a mixed session that has included its fair share of trade headlines, corporate news, and economic data. Today's price action hasn't been too convincing, though, as none of these events has provided the market any new revelations since yesterday's 3% sell-off.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%, and the Russell 2000 is down 0.2%.Prior to the session, the futures market was signaling for more losses at the open after China vowed countermeasures against the 10% tariff rate that is set to go into effect Sept 1. Disappointing guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.54, -4.05, -8.0%) added to the negative disposition.The following news, however, have helped the broader market regain some composure today: Walmart (WMT 110.99, +4.79, +4.5%) provided solid results and raised its full-year EPS guidance, July retail sales rose 0.7% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%), and China said it hopes the U.S. can meet it halfway in trade talks (which it has said before).At this juncture, leadership has been concentrated among the defensive-oriented S&P 500 sectors -- consumer staples (+1.3%), real estate (+1.0%) and utilities (+0.9%). Conversely, the cyclical energy (-0.5%), industrials (-0.3%), information technology (-0.2%), and consumer discretionary (-0.2%) sectors trade lower.General Electric (GE 7.95, -1.07, -11.9%) has largely accounted for the weakness in the industrials sector, as shares fall more than 10% following a critical report from Bernie Madoff whistleblower Harry Markopolos. The report labeled GE a "bigger fraud than Enron."Essentially, the market appears to be tilting positive on reassurance that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape, while hoping that trade relations can improve despite no evidence to suggest otherwise. There remains underlying growth concerns, though, evidenced by lower oil prices ($54.42, -0.81, -1.5%) and the continued flight to safety in U.S. Treasuries, which has driven yields lower again.The 2-yr yield is down eight basis points to 1.50%, and the 10-yr yield is down five basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 98.18.Reviewing today's heavy dose of economic data:Retail sales increased 0.7% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) and were up 1.0%, excluding autos (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).The key takeaway from the report is that it offered a clear reminder that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape, which is key to fending off a recession.Initial claims for the week ending August 10 increased by 9,000 to 220,000 (Briefing.com consensus 215,000). Continuing claims for the week ending August 3 jumped by 39,000 to 1.726 million.The key takeaway from the report is that there wasn't any meaningful shift in the underlying trend (which is solid) for initial claims, as the four-week moving average moved up just 1,000 to a low 213,750.Nonfarm business sector productivity increased 2.3% in the second quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.3%) after increasing a revised 3.5% in Q1 (from 3.4%), according to the preliminary reading. Unit labor costs increased 2.4% in the second quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.6%) after increasing a revised 5.5% (from -1.6%) in Q1.The key takeaway from the report is the improved trend in productivity, which was up 1.8% from the second quarter of 2018 to the second quarter of 2019 versus the annual average of 1.3% for 2018 and 2017, and 0.3% in 2016.Industrial production decreased 0.2% in July (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) after increasing a revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in June. The total industry capacity utilization rate fell to 77.5% (Briefing.com consensus 77.8%) from a revised 77.8% (from 77.9%) in June.The key takeaway from the report is that the July decrease in industrial production has reduced the yr/yr growth rate to just 0.5%.The Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August increased to 4.8 (Briefing.com consensus 1.1) from the prior month's reading of 4.3.The Philadelphia Fed Index for August came in at 16.8 (Briefing.com consensus 10.0), below the 21.8 reading in July. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1601/1219. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1409/1556.12:30 ETDow +93.30 at 25572.7, Nasdaq +5.19 at 7779.14, S&P +9.63 at 2850.23[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq is up 0.1%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results. Facebook (FB 182.21, +2.50, +1.4%), Amazon (AMZN 1776.96, +14.27, +0.8%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1171.68, +7.39, +0.6%) trade higher, while Apple (AAPL 202.08, -0.67, -0.3%) and Netflix (NFLX 294.21, -4.90, -1.7%) trade lower.Elswhere, the rally in gold has shown no signs of slowing down. The yellow metal is currently up 0.2% to $1531.20/oz.11:55 ETDow +28.87 at 25508.27, Nasdaq -12.97 at 7760.98, S&P +3.45 at 2844.05[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.1% in an uninspiring session. There has been no meaningful attempt to rebound from yesterday's 3% sell-off.Shares of American Airlines (AAL 25.28, -0.82) have dropped 3.2% on no confirmed news catalyst today.

For the year, the S&P 500 energy sector is now down 2.8% this year versus a 13.3% gain in the S&P 500.Looking ahead, semiconductor companies Applied Materials (AMAT 46.96, +0.27, +0.6%) and NVIDIA (NVDA 148.23, -1.84, -1.2%) will report earnings results after today's closing bell.14:30 ETDow +26.28 at 25505.68, Nasdaq -24.59 at 7749.36, S&P +0.66 at 2841.26[BRIEFING.COM] In a Herculean feat of strength the major averages got taken for a ride this past half hour in which the S&P 500 at one point held losses of 0.53%, but now stands 0.06% higher. It's a head-scratcher for sure, but the decline had roots in the dip below 1.5% on the 10-year treasury yield -- a level not seen since August of 2016.The sell off, while partly treasury-based, draws partly from declines out of S&P 500 constituents Tapestry (TPR 18.80, -6.20, -24.80%), General Electric (GE 8.02, -1.01, -11.18%), and Gap (GPS 15.25, -1.28, -7.74%). TPR falls in reaction to this morning's underwhelming earnings and guidance, taking GPS lower in sympathy, while GE slips on the widely-covered critical report from "whistleblower" Harry Markopolos.Conversely, healthcare product company Agilent (A 69.81, +4.22, +6.43%) still holds on at the top of the index in part due to yesterday's Q3 beat and guidance.14:00 ETDow -123.28 at 25356.12, Nasdaq -53.26 at 7720.69, S&P -13.23 at 2827.37[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have resumed their selling in the last half hour with all three major averages getting worked over into negative territory; the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite now shows losses of 0.69%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 lower by 0.48% and 0.47% apiece.Gold futures added $3.40 (+0.2%) on Thursday to settle at $1,531.20/oz as a back and forth day turned higher at the right time.The U.S. Dollar Index sits just above 0.1% higher to 98.12.13:35 ETDow +56.61 at 25536.01, Nasdaq -4.92 at 7769.03, S&P +4.93 at 2845.53[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages still stand mixed at this point on Thursday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average pacing the advance, higher by 0.22%.Today's recovery in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is helped along by names like Walmart (WMT 110.92, +4.72, +4.44%), Boeing (BA 326.42, +6.00, +1.87%), and Visa (V 176.05, +2.79, +1.61%). WMT's widely-covered gains today stem from this morning's results and guidance, while BA & V move higher as the general recovery in the broader markets trickles down.Conversely, technology giant Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.53, -4.08, -8.06%) still sits at the bottom of the index following last night's underwhelming guidance.Today's modest recovery in the DJIA has the index about 4.94% lower on the month.12:55 ETDow +50.14 at 25529.54, Nasdaq -7.97 at 7765.98, S&P +4.42 at 2845.02[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.2% in a mixed session that has included its fair share of trade headlines, corporate news, and economic data. Today's price action hasn't been too convincing, though, as none of these events has provided the market any new revelations since yesterday's 3% sell-off.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%, and the Russell 2000 is down 0.2%.Prior to the session, the futures market was signaling for more losses at the open after China vowed countermeasures against the 10% tariff rate that is set to go into effect Sept 1. Disappointing guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.54, -4.05, -8.0%) added to the negative disposition.The following news, however, have helped the broader market regain some composure today: Walmart (WMT 110.99, +4.79, +4.5%) provided solid results and raised its full-year EPS guidance, July retail sales rose 0.7% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%), and China said it hopes the U.S. can meet it halfway in trade talks (which it has said before).At this juncture, leadership has been concentrated among the defensive-oriented S&P 500 sectors -- consumer staples (+1.3%), real estate (+1.0%) and utilities (+0.9%). Conversely, the cyclical energy (-0.5%), industrials (-0.3%), information technology (-0.2%), and consumer discretionary (-0.2%) sectors trade lower.General Electric (GE 7.95, -1.07, -11.9%) has largely accounted for the weakness in the industrials sector, as shares fall more than 10% following a critical report from Bernie Madoff whistleblower Harry Markopolos. The report labeled GE a "bigger fraud than Enron."Essentially, the market appears to be tilting positive on reassurance that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape, while hoping that trade relations can improve despite no evidence to suggest otherwise. There remains underlying growth concerns, though, evidenced by lower oil prices ($54.42, -0.81, -1.5%) and the continued flight to safety in U.S. Treasuries, which has driven yields lower again.The 2-yr yield is down eight basis points to 1.50%, and the 10-yr yield is down five basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 98.18.Reviewing today's heavy dose of economic data:Retail sales increased 0.7% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) and were up 1.0%, excluding autos (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).The key takeaway from the report is that it offered a clear reminder that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape, which is key to fending off a recession.Initial claims for the week ending August 10 increased by 9,000 to 220,000 (Briefing.com consensus 215,000). Continuing claims for the week ending August 3 jumped by 39,000 to 1.726 million.The key takeaway from the report is that there wasn't any meaningful shift in the underlying trend (which is solid) for initial claims, as the four-week moving average moved up just 1,000 to a low 213,750.Nonfarm business sector productivity increased 2.3% in the second quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.3%) after increasing a revised 3.5% in Q1 (from 3.4%), according to the preliminary reading. Unit labor costs increased 2.4% in the second quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.6%) after increasing a revised 5.5% (from -1.6%) in Q1.The key takeaway from the report is the improved trend in productivity, which was up 1.8% from the second quarter of 2018 to the second quarter of 2019 versus the annual average of 1.3% for 2018 and 2017, and 0.3% in 2016.Industrial production decreased 0.2% in July (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) after increasing a revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in June. The total industry capacity utilization rate fell to 77.5% (Briefing.com consensus 77.8%) from a revised 77.8% (from 77.9%) in June.The key takeaway from the report is that the July decrease in industrial production has reduced the yr/yr growth rate to just 0.5%.The Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August increased to 4.8 (Briefing.com consensus 1.1) from the prior month's reading of 4.3.The Philadelphia Fed Index for August came in at 16.8 (Briefing.com consensus 10.0), below the 21.8 reading in July. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1601/1219. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1409/1556.12:30 ETDow +93.30 at 25572.7, Nasdaq +5.19 at 7779.14, S&P +9.63 at 2850.23[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq is up 0.1%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results. Facebook (FB 182.21, +2.50, +1.4%), Amazon (AMZN 1776.96, +14.27, +0.8%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1171.68, +7.39, +0.6%) trade higher, while Apple (AAPL 202.08, -0.67, -0.3%) and Netflix (NFLX 294.21, -4.90, -1.7%) trade lower.Elswhere, the rally in gold has shown no signs of slowing down. The yellow metal is currently up 0.2% to $1531.20/oz.11:55 ETDow +28.87 at 25508.27, Nasdaq -12.97 at 7760.98, S&P +3.45 at 2844.05[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.1% in an uninspiring session. There has been no meaningful attempt to rebound from yesterday's 3% sell-off.Shares of American Airlines (AAL 25.28, -0.82) have dropped 3.2% on no confirmed news catalyst today. The company, which is a part of the Dow Jones Transportation Average (-0.8%), is one of many stocks within that group to trade lower.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a lower note. Germany's DAX lost 0.7%, UK's FTSE lost 1.1%, and France's CAC lost 0.3%.

Pompeo: Trump Supports Democracy In Hong KongThe FrontrunnerAugust 20, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 512 wordsBodySecretary of State Pompeo said on Fox News' The Story (8/19), "What we know is this. In Hong Kong, these are protesters who are simply seeking liberty and freedom. They are asking only that China uphold its commitment. The promise that it made, which was that there will be one country but two systems, respecting Hong Kong in ways that were appropriate for the Hong Kong people. That is what President Trump has made clear. He has said he is for liberty, he is for democracy and we hope that the Chinese government will respect that."Protesters Raise Pressure On Lam As China Suggests Force May Be Used.The Wall Street Journal (8/19, Lyons, Khan, Wong, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports protesters in Hong Kong are increasing pressure on city executive Carrie Lam who is, the Journal says, blamed for allowing the growth of protests to hundreds of thousands of people. Meanwhile, China, the Journal says, has made it clear it could use force to end the protests, while President Trump, Canada, and the European Union have all urged peaceful resolutions.The New York Times (8/19, Myers, Hern?ndez, 18.61M) reports China has turned the Shenzhen Bay Sports Center, "across the water" from Hong Kong, into "a staging ground for olive-green military transports and armored personnel carriers that arrived on Aug. 11 and disgorged hundreds of security officers from the People's Armed Police, a Chinese paramilitary force, who are loudly running through daily exercises and drills." The Times adds, "China's Communist Party is delivering a strong warning that the use of force remains an option for Beijing."Twitter, Facebook Target Accounts Spreading Misinformation On Hong Kong Protests.ABC World News Tonight (8/19, story 13, 0:20, Muir, 7.12M) reported, "First Russia using social media, now, amid protests in Hong Kong, both Facebook and Twitter accusing China of spreading disinformation, using social media to target pro-democracy demonstrators. Both companies say they've taken down hundreds of accounts linked to China."The New York Times (8/19, Conger, 18.61M) reports Facebook and Twitter said Monday they had "discovered and taken down networks of accounts that had originated in mainland China, where both Facebook and Twitter are blocked." Facebook said it removed "seven pages, three Facebook Groups and five accounts involved in the disinformation," while Twitter "took down 936 accounts. Twitter said it would also ban state-backed media from promoting tweets after China Daily, and other state-backed publications, placed ads on the service that suggested the Hong Kong protesters were sponsored by Western interests and were becoming violent."The Wall Street Journal (8/19, Armental, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) quotes a statement from Twitter as saying, "These accounts were deliberately and specifically attempting to sow political discord in Hong Kong, including undermining the legitimacy and political positions of the protest movement on the ground." The Washington Post (8/19, Baca, 14.2M), among other news outlets, also reports the action.Load-Date: August 20, 2019End of Document

SECRETARY OF STATE MICHAEL R. POMPEO ON THE STORY WITH MARTHA MACCALLUM OF FOX NEWSStates News ServiceAugust 19, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1643 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Department of State:InterviewMichael R. Pompeo, Secretary of StatePress RoomQUESTION: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo joins us now in a Story exclusive. Secretary Pompeo, good to see you tonight. Thank you very much for being here.SECRETARY POMPEO: You're welcome. Great to be with you, Martha.QUESTION: So what do you make of that? Now, that's a pretty interesting story given what we've been watching unfold in Hong Kong.SECRETARY POMPEO: So, Martha, I've seen those reports. I also know the history of China and its efforts in cyber space conducting cyber crime. This is another element of their efforts to manipulate data.What we know is this: In Hong Kong, these are protesters who are simply seeking liberty and freedom. They're asking only that China uphold its commitment, the promise that it made, which was that there would be one country but two systems, respecting Hong Kong in ways that were appropriate for the Hong Kong people.That's what President Trump's made clear. He said he is for liberty, he is for democracy, and we hope that the Chinese Government will respect that.QUESTION: I mean, this puts President Xi in a difficult position in the middle of this trade discussion that is going on, and now he's under a ton of pressure as this movement that is trying to really preserve the democracy that they were promised in Hong Kong continues to fire up. And then you've got the question of Huawei and whether or not the Trump administration is starting to sort of back down a little bit on that discussion.Here's the President sort of talking about this in a big way, and I want to get your reaction to this:President Trump: "I think it would be very hard to deal if they do violence. I mean, if it's another Tiananmen Square, I think it's a very hard thing to do... At this moment, it looks much more like we're not going to do business. I don't want to do business at all because it is a national security threat."What are your thoughts on that? He's talking about Huawei there at the end.SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes. Look, with respect to Huawei, this administration has taken actions that no previous administration was prepared to take. President Trump has done the same thing on trade. We understand the challenges that China presents. We've asked them multiple times just to honor their word. We talked about that in Hong Kong, right? They have to honor what they promised the Hong Kong people. They made a commitment that they wouldn't militarize the South China Sea. They have made promises about human rights. The activities that are taking place in the western provinces in China are of an enormous scale of human rights violations.When we try to negotiate a trade agreement with them, we've tried to put in processes that ensure we have the opportunity to verify because we need to make sure that we don't suffer from China breaking a promise or have to watch Chinese disinformation about the agreement that's entered into.QUESTION: So, I mean, you have really dug in in diplomacy. You have traveled all over the world. I don't think you sleep in the same place probably very often throughout the course of the week and probably not home a whole lot either. But now that you've met these the individuals who are dealing with all of this in China, how optimistic are you, given everything that we just talked about, that they can enter into a good faith trade agreement that we can count on, that we can trust?SECRETARY POMPEO: Martha, it's the right question. It's the question that Ambassador Lighthizer, Secretary Mnuchin have been asking for the entire set of negotiations. We want to make sure that we have a set of agreements that have the real capacity to verify and enforce. We are eyes wide open with this and it's been the President's shown great leadership. We've had unfair, completely unreciprocal set of relationships with China on trade for an awfully long time now, and President Trump is determined to fix that on behalf of the American people. It's a commercial imperative so that we can continue to grow our economy, but it's also a national security imperative to make sure that we get that right.QUESTION: One last question: China's very upset that we are doing this F-16 deal, selling jets to Taiwan. They've spoken out about it. They said basically you better change your mind on this deal or else there's going to be consequences. What do you say to them?SECRETARY POMPEO: The President approved the notice that went up to Capitol Hill on Thursday or Friday of last week so that we could move forward with these F-16 sales. These are deeply consistent with the arrangements, the historical relationship between the United States and China, the three communiques that layer on top of that. Our actions are consistent with past U.S. policy. We are simply following through on the commitments we've made to all of the parties.QUESTION: All right. Question for you on Iran: Their tanker was released by the British that was being held in Gibraltar. Do you think that that was a mistake by the British?SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, it's unfortunate that that happened. These are oil profits that, when this is ultimately sold somewhere into the market, that will run back to the Qasem Soleimani and the Iranian Qods Force, their elite forces that have sown terror and destruction and killed Americans all around the world. And now they'll have, if they're successful and we hope that they're ultimately not but if they're successful, they'll have more money, more wealth, more resources to continue their terror campaign, to continue their assassination campaign in Europe.QUESTION: Yeah, but, I meanSECRETARY POMPEO: This is what we're trying to stop, so it's very unfortunate that that ship was released.QUESTION: So they've got 23 British crew members on a ship, and no doubt they're hoping that this move is going to help get those guys back home and women back home. Is that a good bet on their part?SECRETARY POMPEO: Weakness never is the right outcome.QUESTION: Okay. With regard to Afghanistan, take a look at what is happening at the camps, the IDP refugee camp. Some people are looking at the situation and saying that ISIS, which we just saw a horrific tragedy at a wedding, 63 people were killed at a wedding in Kabul and the thinking on the part of some who are looking at this camp are saying that they're basically entrenching there and they're starting to try to build another caliphate by treating these people horribly, even reports of executions inside this camp. What do you say about that?SECRETARY POMPEO: So the attack over the weekend was indeed tragic. It was innocent civilians that were killed. But I'm not sure what there is more to add about that other than to say this: President Trump has been determined. Every place we've encountered radical Islamic terrorism, whether it was ISIS in Syria or al-Qaida in other places, we've done everything we can to continue to decimate them and keep the American people safe, to reduce risk to the United States of America. We'll continue to do that all across the world, but we're going to do so in a way that is smart and doesn't require excess sacrifice on behalf of the American people.QUESTION: So you've been obviously very supportive and very in step with the President on I think 99 percent of the work that you've done. His other advisor and person that he trusts, Lindsey Graham, very strong on this. He does not want to see us pull out of Afghanistan. Where do you stand on that spectrum?SECRETARY POMPEO: You have to begin with the mission set. The mission set the President gave us was to do two things: to see if we can't reduce our costs we spend tens and tens of billions of dollars a year in Afghanistan, and we lose the lives of American young men and women every year to reduce that risk; but at the same time, ensure that we maintain a posture that can reduce the risk that there's an attack again from Afghanistan to our homeland.Those twin goals are what the President set out for my team and for the Department of Defense. We're working towards them. I am confident that we can achieve them. Any reduction that we make will be based on conditions on the ground and will be consistent with achieving those two goals on behalf of the President and on behalf of the American people.QUESTION: Before I let you go, two very quick political questions outside of your work at the State Department. Anthony Scaramucci, who was with the administration for a short 11 days, is getting a lot of attention everywhere today, saying that he is rallying a group of former Trump cabinet members to seek a candidate to run against the President in 2020. Any reaction to that?SECRETARY POMPEO: I hadn't seen that story, but from your description of it, it sounds ludicrous on its face.QUESTION: All right, ludicrous on its face. We'll put you down for that.One last question for you. The Senate run question in Kansas, is that something that is still you said it was not on the table? Is it completely off the table, or have you closed the book on that decision? Reports over the weekend that all the GOP fundraisers sort of standing on the sidelines in Kansas, waiting to hear what you're going to do.SECRETARY POMPEO: Lots of people talking about me potentially running for the Senate in Kansas, everyone maybe except me. I'm very focused on what I'm doing. My position on this hasn't changed. It's an incredible privilege to be President Trump's Secretary of State. I intend to continue to do this.QUESTION: So is that 100 percent no for Kansas?SECRETARY POMPEO: It's what I'm going to keep doing as long as President Trump gives me this opportunity.QUESTION: All right. Good to see you, Secretary Pompeo.SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, Martha.QUESTION: Thank you very much for being here tonight.Load-Date: August 20, 2019End of Document

Economists Skeptical That Trump-Xi Truce Will Rescue GrowthStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeJuly 1, 2019 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 503 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBodyOn Saturday, Trump announced his decision to allow Huawei to buy U.S. products at the request of American "high tech companies", adding his adminsitration will meet to discuss the plan in greater detail.It has drawn bipartisan criticism from U.S. Senators concerned that Huawei has close ties to Chinese intelligence agencies that could exploit the global distribution of its technology.It was feared that Trump would announce a further tightening of sanctions on China."The outcome of the G-20 also lowers the tail risk of tariffs going up on the remaining $300 billion of US imports from China", TD Securities analysts said in an e-mail to clients.After saying for weeks that it has access to enough non-U.S. technology to carry on as usual, Huawei said last month it would take a $30 billion revenue hit.From left, China's President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump shake hands on November 9, 2017, during a meeting outside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.Prior reporting by the Journal has indicated the Chinese government views Huawei as a top priority, and that it has made clear that lessening the penalties imposed on the company is a precondition for a deal.He added: "These are American companies... that make product and that's very complex, by the way, and highly scientific".Shay Mitchell confirms she's 6 months pregnantAdams in October - wrote: "YAS queen, I am so excited to be a mama with you and welcome this handsome babe to the world!" The mom-to-be then went on to explain why she finally chose to reveal her pregnancy to the public.United States president Donald Trump said he plans to revoke the ban, or, er, grant some licences to American companies supplying components and services to Chinese telecoms giant Huawei."We send and we sell to Huawei a tremendous amount of product that goes into the various things that they make".Yet Trump told the Fox Business Network: "Don't let anyone tell you that we're paying. If President Donald Trump backs off, as it appears he is doing, it will dramatically undercut our ability to change China's unfair trades practices", Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) stated.If Trump and Xi discussed the full gamut of issues underlying the U.S.Kudlow's suggested the president's announcement on Saturday represented only a limited overture in efforts to try to break the months-long impasse in the trade dispute between China and the US, the world's largest economies.This week sees the release of some crucial USA economic data including non-farm payrolls on Friday and non-manufacturing activity on Wednesday, which should help investors better assess whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates later this month. "China trade negotiations and the possibility of relaxation in the ban on selling to Huawei", analysts atUnited Overseas Bank in Singapore wrote in a note Monday."Any backlash to a Huawei deal will be 10 times worse than we saw with ZTE", Samm Sacks, a fellow at the New America think tank, told the Journal.Load-Date: July 1, 2019End of Document

TEXAS MAN CONVICTED OF CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT THEFT OF TRADE SECRETSUS Fed NewsJuly 29, 2019 Monday 2:40 PM  ESTCopyright 2019 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 764 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, July 29 -- The U.S. Department of Justice's Criminal Division issued the following news release:A Texas man was convicted today by a federal jury in Washington D.C. of conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets.Following a nine-day trial, Shan Shi, 54, of Houston, Texas, was convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets. Shi was originally indicted in June 2017 for conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets, and a superseding indictment containing one count of conspiracy to commit economic espionage and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering charges issued in April 2018. Shi was acquitted on the other charges."Shan Shi and his coconspirators went to great lengths to cash in on the Chinese government's desire to obtain syntactic foam technology," said Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department's Criminal Division. "As this case demonstrates, the Department of Justice is and will remain on the front lines of defending U.S. companies against the theft of their trade secrets.""The jury's verdict makes clear that Shan Shi conspired to steal trade secrets by poaching employees from a U.S. company and enticing them to bring technical data to his company," said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers. "He did this against the backdrop of China's strategic plan to close the gap between China and United States in buoyancy technology and with the benefit of millions of dollars of funding from China. Like our many other prosecutions implicating China's economic aggression, this case exemplifies both the threat to American companies and our commitment to confront it.""We take very seriously the theft of intellectual property that was developed in the United States through long years of research, development, and innovation," said U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu for the District of Columbia. "Shi chose to steal the secrets of a U.S. company rather than do the hard work necessary to succeed honestly in the free market. He is now being held accountable for that choice.""Shan Shi attempted to obtain sophisticated U.S. technology with both military and civilian uses for the ultimate benefit of China," said Assistant Director John Brown of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division. "It is no secret that China is determined to achieve superiority in virtually all high-tech areas, and the FBI is equally determined to stop individuals who commit illegal acts to help China achieve its goals. The stakes are high both for U.S. national security and for American companies who invest so much money and time on research and development.""FBI Houston's elite counterintelligence investigators worked for years to dismantle Mr. Shi's prolific network and bring him to justice," said Special Agent in Charge Perrye K. Turner of the FBI's Houston Field Office. "Our highly trained agents and intelligence analysts work every day to protect American businesses from unscrupulous foreign adversaries. We are pleased by today's verdict, and we will continue to aggressively protect America's economic security and intellectual property from those who would do us harm."Evidence introduced at trial established that Shi conspired with others to steal trade secrets from a Houston-based company, Trelleborg Offshore, relating to syntactic foam, a strong, lightweight material with commercial and military uses that is essential for deep-sea oil and gas drilling. In public statements of its national priorities, China has made clear its desire to develop this technology. Shi sought to obtain information about syntactic foam for the benefit of CBM-Future New Material Science and Technology Co. Ltd. (CBMF), a Chinese company based in Taizhou, and for the ultimate benefit of the People's Republic of China. Four of Shi's codefendants-some of whom worked at Trelleborg-had pleaded guilty to conspiring to steal trade secrets, and two testified as cooperating witnesses at trial. From 2014 to 2017, CBMF sent Shi's company in Houston approximately $3.1 million from China in order to promote Shi's activity in the United States.Sentencing has been set for Oct. 25, 2019.The FBI's Houston Field Office conducted the investigation. Senior Counsel Joss Nichols of the Criminal Division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jeffrey Pearlman and Luke Jones for the District of Columbia are prosecuting the case.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +23.30.The S&P 500 futures trade 15 points, or 0.5%, above fair value in a volatile pre-market session. Futures were pulled lower after China threatened to retaliate against the upcoming 10% tariff rate on Chinese imports, but solid results and guidance from Walmart (WMT 112.71, +6.51, +6.1%) has lifted futures back into positive territory.The market is presumably trying to find its footing after a sharp 3% sell-off yesterday that was attributed to recessionary fears. China added to those worries this morning, but it didn't provide any specific details related to countermeasures. Instead, Walmart has given the market some reassurance that consumer spending remains resilient, which has outweighed the disappointing guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.38, -4.23, -8.4%).A wide range of economic data will be released today, which will feature Retail Sales for July (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) at 8:30 a.m. ET.The weekly Initial Claims (Briefing.com consensus 215,000) and Continuing Claims report, the Empire State Manufacturing Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 1.1), the Philadelphia Fed Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 10.0), and the preliminary Q2 readings for Productivity (Briefing.com consensus 1.3%) and Unit Labor Costs (Briefing.com consensus 1.6%) will also be released at 8:30 a.m. ET.In addition, Industrial Production (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) and Capacity Utilization (Briefing.com consensus 77.8%) for July will be released at 9:15 a.m. ET, followed by Business Inventories for June (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) at 10:00 a.m. ET and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June at 4:00 p.m. ET.The U.S. Treasury market continues to see increased demand, driving yields even lower across the curve. Currently, the 2-yr yield is down five basis points to 1.53% and the 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.54%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 97.88.

Broad-based selling left both S&P 500 and Russell 2000 down 2.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 3.0%.The stock market began the day sharply lower, giving back a bulk of yesterday's advance, after data out of China and Germany continued to weaken. China reported its slowest industrial production growth since 2002, and Germany reported a 0.1% qtr/qtr decline in Q2 GDP. Understandably, investors rushed to safe-haven assets such as gold ($1527.80, +$13.70, +0.9%) and U.S. Treasuries, while equities steadily declined throughout the day.In turn, the yield on the 10-yr note fell below the yield on the 2-yr note for the first time since 2007, representing an inversion that has preceded each recession since 1980. The average length of time between the first inversion and the start of each recession since 1980 has averaged 18 months, with the range being as little as ten months to as many as two years.Despite this historical time-cushion, it was risk-off on Wall Street with all 11 S&P 500 sectors finishing lower. The energy (-4.1%) and financials (-3.6%) sectors led the broader retreat amid steep declines in oil prices ($55.01/bbl, -$2.03, -3.6%) and U.S. Treasury yields. The utilities sector (-0.9%) was the only sector that didn't finish lower by at least 1.0%.The 2-yr yield fell nine basis points to 1.58%, and the 10-yr yield fell ten basis points to 1.58%. Interestingly, the 30-yr yield hit a record low at 2.02% before finishing the session down 11 basis points at 2.03%. The U.S. Dollar Index held firm, advancing 0.2% to 98.04.It should be noted that the 2s-10s yield spread did not remain inverted during the session. Still, the yield curve had been steadily flattening all year and investors weren't given any reason today to expect a change of course. The yield-curve flattening undercut shares of Citigroup (C 61.41, -3.42, -5.3%), Bank of America (BAC 26.42, -1.30, -4.7%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 104.80, -4.54, -4.2%).Separately, Macy's (M 16.80, -2.56, -13.2%) provided disappointing earnings and guidance, which sent shares down 13.2% and put additional pressure on the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 38.42, -1.68, -4.2%).Reviewing Wednesday's economic data, which included Import and Export Prices for July and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index:Import prices rose 0.2% m/m in July, but declined 0.1% excluding fuel. On a yr/yr basis, all import prices were down 1.8%, versus up 4.8% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonfuel import prices declined 1.3% versus a 1.4% increase for the 12 months ending in July 2018.Export prices were up 0.2% m/m in July. Excluding agricultural exports, prices were also up 0.2%. On a yr/yr basis, all export prices were down 0.9%, versus up 4.3% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonagricultural export prices were down 1.5%, versus up 5.0% for the 12 months ending in July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is that it doesn't show any inflation, which stands in contrast to the Consumer Price Index for July. Accordingly, it will only serve to confuse the market's perspective on the Fed's read of inflation trends.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index spiked 21.7% following a 5.3% increase in the prior week.Investors will receive the following economic data on Thursday: Retail Sales for July, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for July, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August, the Philadelphia Fed Index for August, the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the preliminary Productivity and Unit Labor Costs for the second quarter, Business Inventories for June, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 15, 2019End of Document

The average length of time between the first inversion and the start of each recession since 1980 has averaged 18 months, with the range being as little as ten months to as many as two years.Despite this historical time-cushion, it was risk-off on Wall Street with all 11 S&P 500 sectors finishing lower. The energy (-4.1%) and financials (-3.6%) sectors led the broader retreat amid steep declines in oil prices ($55.01/bbl, -$2.03, -3.6%) and U.S. Treasury yields. The utilities sector (-0.9%) was the only sector that didn't finish lower by at least 1.0%.The 2-yr yield fell nine basis points to 1.58%, and the 10-yr yield fell ten basis points to 1.58%. Interestingly, the 30-yr yield hit a record low at 2.02% before finishing the session down 11 basis points at 2.03%. The U.S. Dollar Index held firm, advancing 0.2% to 98.04.It should be noted that the 2s-10s yield spread did not remain inverted during the session. Still, the yield curve had been steadily flattening all year and investors weren't given any reason today to expect a change of course. The yield-curve flattening undercut shares of Citigroup (C 61.41, -3.42, -5.3%), Bank of America (BAC 26.42, -1.30, -4.7%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 104.80, -4.54, -4.2%).Separately, Macy's (M 16.80, -2.56, -13.2%) provided disappointing earnings and guidance, which sent shares down 13.2% and put additional pressure on the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 38.42, -1.68, -4.2%).Reviewing Wednesday's economic data, which included Import and Export Prices for July and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index:Import prices rose 0.2% m/m in July, but declined 0.1% excluding fuel. On a yr/yr basis, all import prices were down 1.8%, versus up 4.8% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonfuel import prices declined 1.3% versus a 1.4% increase for the 12 months ending in July 2018.Export prices were up 0.2% m/m in July. Excluding agricultural exports, prices were also up 0.2%. On a yr/yr basis, all export prices were down 0.9%, versus up 4.3% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonagricultural export prices were down 1.5%, versus up 5.0% for the 12 months ending in July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is that it doesn't show any inflation, which stands in contrast to the Consumer Price Index for July. Accordingly, it will only serve to confuse the market's perspective on the Fed's read of inflation trends.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index spiked 21.7% following a 5.3% increase in the prior week.Investors will receive the following economic data on Thursday: Retail Sales for July, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for July, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August, the Philadelphia Fed Index for August, the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the preliminary Productivity and Unit Labor Costs for the second quarter, Business Inventories for June, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 15, 2019End of Document

Broad-based selling left both S&P 500 and Russell 2000 down 2.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 3.0%.The stock market began the day sharply lower, giving back a bulk of yesterday's advance, after data out of China and Germany continued to weaken. China reported its slowest industrial production growth since 2002, and Germany reported a 0.1% qtr/qtr decline in Q2 GDP. Understandably, investors rushed to safe-haven assets such as gold ($1527.80, +$13.70, +0.9%) and U.S. Treasuries, while equities steadily declined throughout the day.In turn, the yield on the 10-yr note fell below the yield on the 2-yr note for the first time since 2007, representing an inversion that has preceded each recession since 1980.

Wall Street falls at 2019 lows and BVL still in retreatCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 5, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 349 wordsBodyThe major stock indices of Wall Street —S&P; 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq— today recorded their worst fall so far this year, amid the resumption of trade tensions between China and the United States.The S&P; 500 index — the most representative index of the U.S. market - fell 3%, its highest pullback since December last year and recorded a loss of US$766 million, according to Refinitiv. The Dow Jones industrial index also declined 3%, while the Nasdaq- technology companies index – had a 3.5% contraction, also recording the worst falls since December, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.Markets began to fall back after the Chinese government allowed its currency, the yuan, to devalue above the Rmb7 for US$, for the first time since the 2008 global crisis. This would be a response to the announcement of 10% additional tariffs on Chinese exports to the United States. and would seek to make Chinese exports more competitive.The devaluation of the Chinese currency hit emerging currencies like the sun. Thus, the sun depreciated 0.8% against the dollar, which stood at S/3.38, compared to last Friday's S/3.35. In addition, the Lima Stock Exchange was also affected by global financial uncertainty. The overall BVL index fell 1.52% and already scores five consecutive sessions with negativeresults. With this, the local stock market is close to erasing all profits of the year, as to date it gets a yield of just 0.24%.Trade tensions have also reduced the price of industrial metals such as copper. Amid fears about lower prospects for global growth and China in particular, copper — Peru's main export product— has fallen to US$2.54 per pound, its lowest level in 2years.On the other hand, in the face of rising financial volatility—the VIX index rose to 24.6 points, its highest level in 7 months—investor risk aversion rose and skyrocketed demand for US treasury bonds, a haven asset. This increased its price and reduced its performance. Thus the 10-year treasury bond, reduced its yield by 14 basis points and stood at 1.71%, its lowest level in the year, according to the Financial Times.Load-Date: August 5, 2019End of Document

Uruguay and Huawei signed an agreement for the development of 5G networksCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 27, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 340 wordsBodyThe Uruguayan government signed an agreement of understanding with the Chinese company Huawei to "deepen cooperation in fifth generation (5G) networks, industrial digitization and training of talent in information technology," Xinhua agency reported.The firm took place during a recent visit to the company's headquarters in Shenzhen, southeastern China, by a delegation headed by Uruguayan Minister of Industry, Energy and Mining Guillermo Moncecchi.During this visit, Moncecchi said that his country hopes to "deepen the strategic partnership with Huawei" - which has been operating in Uruguay since 2005 - in emerging technologies such as 5G, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and cloud computing, the Efe.The official expressed appreciation for Huawei's contribution to Uruguay's industrial development and said that applications of new technologies are "of great interest" to the country, which seeks to strengthen its role as a service center for the company in Latin America.While countries such as China, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Spain and the United States began this year to roll out 5G in some cities, the arrival of this technology in Latin America could occur between 2021 and 2022, following spectrum tenders and projects pilot, said in April this year, Huawei's director of strategy for Latin America, Joaquín Saldaña.Huawei has signed 40 contracts with operators for the deployment of 5G (23 in Europe, 10 in the Middle East, 6 in Asia-Pacific and 1 in Africa), despite being banned in the United States, Japan and Australia by pressure from Washington.The White House is pushing a campaign against the tech giant on the grounds that the Chinese government uses Huawei's equipment to conduct espionage, a unproven accusation that has been denied by the company and by Asian nation authorities.TECHNOLOGY Newsletter with the most important analysis and news, every Wednesday.

Huawei Lays Off Many Workers At US Research UnitRTT News (United States)July 23, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 RTT News All Rights ReservedLength: 283 wordsByline: editorial@rttnews.com,  (RTT Staff Writer)Body       Huawei Technologies cut more than 600 jobs at its U.S.-based research and development subsidiary Futurewei Technologies, according to reports. The move comes after the Chinese telecom equipment giant was blacklisted by the U.S. in May this year. Huawei was quoted as saying said that the job cuts, effective July 22, were due to "curtailment of business operations caused by the U.S."  Futurewei is a research and development subsidiary of Huawei, with offices in California, Texas, Illinois and Washington State. The unit employs about 850 people in research labs across the U.S. The Trump administration had blacklisted Huawei on national security grounds. The ban was primarily aimed at keeping equipment made by the Chinese company out of the next generation of wireless network, 5G. The U.S. has serious concerns about the security risks posed by Chinese technology companies, including Huawei and ZTE. Intelligence agencies are concerned that Huawei and other Chinese companies may be beholden to the Chinese government, raising the risk of espionage. Huawei and ZTE are major players in the 5G market as they manufacture and sell telecom equipment for 5G networks at competitive prices. The blacklisting made it difficult for Huawei to sell products for which it relied on parts from U.S. suppliers. It also made it illegal for Futurewei to transfer sensitive technologies to its parent company in China.  The U.S. may now approve certain companies to re-start new sales to Huawei as long as those products do not pose national security concerns.  U.S. chipmakers, including Intel, Qualcomm and Micron Technology, are said to have lobbied intensely for sales to resume to Huawei.        Load-Date: July 23, 2019End of Document

According to NBC, Falun Gong sees Trump as a force to undermine China.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.Facebook has banned The Epoch Times, a pro-Donald Trump, pro-Conservative publication, from advertising on its platform after it tried to sneak ads past its review system, NBC News reported on Thursday.The news comes after reports surfaced that The Epoch Times had spent more than $1.5 million on pro-Trump Facebook advertising in the past six months, making it the second-largest source of pro-Trump Facebook ads on the platform after the Trump campaign.Its ads were described by NBC as featuring "unidentified spokespeople" who "thumb through a newspaper to praise Trump, peddle conspiracy theories about the 'Deep State,' and criticize 'fake news' media."Read more: Aside from the Trump campaign itself, the biggest spender on pro-Trump Facebook ads is reportedly a secretive New York-based newspaperUp until mid-July, these ads were run through accounts that clearly showed their affiliation to The Epoch Times via a Facebook page called "Coverage of the Trump presidency by The Epoch Times."But after journalists started looking at whether these ads violated Facebook's policies, NBC discovered that the Epoch Times shifted funding to other accounts with names such as Honest Paper, Patriots of America, Pure American Journalism, and Best News in attempt to hide its connection to the pro-Trump ads it was publishing.Now, Facebook is taking action."Over the past year, we removed accounts associated with the Epoch Times for violating our ad policies, including trying to get around our review systems. We acted on additional accounts today and they are no longer able to advertise with us," a spokeswoman for Facebook wrote in a statement emailed to Business Insider.The spokesperson shared a link to the specific rule that the publication violated, which is listed in its advertising policies: "Ads must not use tactics that are intended to circumvent our ad review process or other enforcement systems. This includes techniques that attempt to disguise the ad's content or destination page."'The Epoch Times is a nonpartisan media that is dedicated to truthful and accurate reporting'Business Insider reached out to Epoch Times Editor-in-Chief Jasper Fakker for comment but did not immediately hear back.The Epoch Times is a non-profit publication that's tied to a Chinese religious group named Falun Gong. According to NBC, Falun Gong seeks to undermine the Chinese government and sees Trump as a force for that goal.In a previous statement to Business Insider, Fakker acknowledged the publication's connections to Falun Gong but said that it isn't owned by the religious group. He also denied that its pro-Trump ads on Facebook were meant to be political."NBC News' statement is incorrect," Fakker said in an email exchange with Business Insider. "The Epoch Times advertisements are subscription advertisements for the print version of The Epoch Times. In the advertisements we discuss The Epoch Times editorial and feature content and encourage people to subscribe to us."Facebook has specific rules for advertising that require anyone - including a publisher like ourselves - to label content if it touches on social issues or politics, something some news content naturally does. The Epoch Times is a nonpartisan media that is dedicated to truthful and accurate reporting."Additional reporting by Rob Price.NOW WATCH: The incredible story behind Slack, the app that's taken over offices everywhereSee Also:• Aside from the Trump campaign itself, the biggest spender on pro-Trump Facebook ads is reportedly a secretive New York-based newspaper• Silicon Valley is about to go into war mode against a new French tax on big-tech revenue• 2 privacy crises in one week prove Facebook still hasn't solved its privacy woes, even after a $5 billion fineSEE ALSO: Apple, Google, and Mozilla are blocking the Kazakhstan government's wild attempts at spying on peopleLoad-Date: August 23, 2019End of Document

A decidedly disappointing Factory Orders report for May out of Germany, however, has been an early guide for the negative stance. Additionally, the news from Thursday that the British navy seized an Iranian oil tanker headed for Syria has fostered some geopolitical angst that is keeping buying efforts in check.In economic data (Thursday and Friday): Eurozone's May Retail Sales -0.3% m/m (expected +0.4%, last -0.1%) and +1.3% yr/yr (expected +1.6%, last +1.8%)Germany's May Factory Orders -2.2% m/m (expected -0.1%, last +0.4%); June Construction PMI 50.0 (expected 52.0, last 51.4)Switzerland's June CPI 0.0% m/m (expected -0.1%, last +0.3%) and +0.6% yr/yr (expected +0.5%, last +0.6%)France's May Trade Balance EUR -3.3B (expected EUR -5.7B, last EUR -4.9B)Spain's May Industrial Production +1.4% (expected +1.1%, last +1.8%); June Consumer Confidence 102.3 (expected 95.1, last 96.9)UK's June Halifax House Price Index -0.3% m/m (expected +0.3%, last +0.4%) and +5.7% yr/yr (expected +5.4%, last +5.2%); Q1 Labor Productivity -0.5% (expected -0.6%, last +0.3%)---Equity Markets---STOXX Europe 600: -0.4%Germany's DAX: -0.3%U.K.'s FTSE 100: -0.3%France's CAC 40: -0.4%Italy's FTSE MIB: -0.4%Spain's IBEX 35: -0.4%---FX---EUR/USD: -0.2% to 1.1260GBP/USD: -0.2% to 1.2550USD/CHF: +0.3% to 0.987507:13SUMRX Asian Markets Close: Nikkei +0.2%, Hang Seng -0.1%, Shanghai +0.2%Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region were relatively mixed on Friday following an otherwise good week for most markets. Today's mixed disposition was attributed in part to a wait-and-see attitude in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report, which will have implications for the Fed's policy stance. Other factors in play included a preliminary estimate from Samsung Electronics that its second quarter profit was down 56% yr/yr, a stronger-than-expected household spending report for May out of Japan, and a South China Morning Post report indicating China won't buy agricultural goods from the U.S. if the U.S. "flip flops again in future trade negotiations."In economic data: Japan's May Household Spending +5.5% m/m (expected +1.2%, last -1.4%) and +4.0% yr/yr (expected +1.4%, last +1.3%); May Preliminary Leading Index 95.2 (expected 95.3, last 95.9)Australia'a June AIG Construction Index 43.0 (last 40.4)---Equity Markets---Japan's Nikkei: +0.2% (+2.0% for the week)Hong Kong's Hang Seng: -0.1% (+0.8% for the week)China's Shanghai Composite: +0.2% (+1.1% for the week)India's Sensex: -1.0% (+0.3% for the week)South Korea's Kospi: +0.1% (-0.9% for the week)Australia's ASX All Ordinaries: +0.5% (+2.0% for the week)---FX---USD/JPY: +0.2% to 108.03USD/CNH: +0.1% to 6.8804USD/INR: +0.1% at 68.5307:02WIRES On The WiresLGI Homes, Inc.

Why protests are becoming increasingly facelessCNN.comJuly 23, 2019 Tuesday 9:46 PM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: DESIGNLength: 2098 wordsByline: Julia Hollingsworth, CNN | Zoe Sottile, CNNDateline: Hong Kong BodyOn a humid Sunday night in Hong Kong's financial district, hundreds of young people ready themselves for the latest protest.Some wear flimsy medical masks and swimming goggles, others heavy-duty respirators and protective glasses. All are covering their faces to protect themselves not only from police tear gas -- but also to obscure their identities.Hong Kong's pro-democracy activists are concerned about being identified by authorities and prosecuted. Since mass demonstrations kicked off in June, roughly 700 people have been arrested, many for unlawful assembly.This weekend, demonstrators attempted to tear down or dismantle some of the city's 50 newly-installed so-called "smart lamp posts" -- which have cameras and sensors -- in a protest against perceived government surveillance. The Hong Kong government said the lamp posts, which are intended to track data such as air quality and traffic flow, are not equipped with facial recognition software and "would not infringe upon personal privacy."But Hong Kong's protesters aren't the only ones worried about protecting their identities.Activists, designers and artists around the world are inventing creative ways to avoid detection.As state surveillance becomes more advanced -- and widely used -- wearable technology has been proposed as a way to thwart monitoring systems.Fighting technology with technologyAfter witnessing police brutality at protests in his native Brazil in 2013, United States-based designer Pedro Oliveira began researching how authorities around the world deploy technology against demonstrators.In some countries, there were internet black outs. In others, widespread censorship.Hoping to raise awareness about the tactics authorities were using against protesters, Oliveira and fellow designer Xuedi Chen created a slick-looking protest kit as part of their art and design project, Backslash.It includes a "smart" bandana that serves to simultaneously conceal the wearer's identity, while communicating messages between protesters through a computer-generated pattern that can only be read by a custom app.The kit also features a wearable device that alerts fellow demonstrators to the presence of police, and a stencil that creates graffiti "tags" -- readable only by an app -- to inform protesters when an area is under surveillance.But the kits are not for sale. Instead, Oliveira and Chen hoped to start a dialogue about what they see as an increasing power imbalance between authorities and demonstrators."We didn't feel that these should be offered to protesters as a solution. We just thought it was important to research and have a conversation about the hyper-militarization of police and all this technology being used against protesters," Oliveira said in a phone interview.Advancements in facial recognition technology is of particular concern to demonstrators and privacy campaigners.The technology, much of which is still in development, works by capturing images of people's faces and matching biometric information -- such as the distance between facial features -- with existing photo ID databases.In his project CV Dazzle, artist Adam Harvey proposes a number of inventive ways to evade surveillance technology, including face jewels and elaborate hairstyles. On his website, he claims that applying tonal gradients of make-up can create fake contours that obscure people's features -- a kind of "anti-face," as he puts it -- making it harder for facial recognition systems to collect the data needed to identify individuals.He also recommends make-up be applied asymmetrically, in order to throw off facial-recognition algorithms.Alternatively, London-based Zach Blas has invented "collective masks" using biometric data from multiple faces in his project "Facial Weaponization Suite." The artist's conceptual masks are a statement on the "inequalities these (biometric facial recognition) technologies propagate," according to his website.One of the masks addresses facial recognition software's built-in prejudices towards skin color, a criticism that activists have raised before. Critics say that if software is trained using a disproportionate number of male and white faces, there could be an increased chance of women and people of color being misidentified.The resulting disguises look like amorphous, colorful blobs that Blas claims can fool facial recognition technology -- to the extent that wearers aren't even identified as human.But these unusual tactics can create problems of their own. As artist Leo Selvaggio points out: "Walking out with this make-up on your face ... actually makes you conspicuous."Selvaggio believes that people have also been "weaponized" into being part of surveillance, meaning that someone would likely report anything out of the ordinary -- like unusual make-up or a blob-like mask -- to the authorities."(Anti-surveillance projects) don't really take into account the human aspect of surveillance," he added in a phone interview.The artist has proposed another solution: prosthetic masks of his own face. Like Blas' "collective" masks, they hide the wearer's true identity. But unlike Blas' disguises, they would be analyzed as a human face by surveillance systems, fooling authorities into thinking that one person is in multiple places at the same time.Simple solutions in Hong KongOn the streets of Hong Kong, protesters have opted for readily available solutions."People tend to experiment a lot in protest movements," said Gavin Grindon, who curated a 2014 exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London on objects used in protests."It's often the simple solution -- the quick solution -- that's the elegant and effective one," said Grindon.When it comes to avoiding detection, many opt for a medical or gas mask paired with goggles to obscure their identities."We need to hide ourselves so if we get caught on camera, we're safe," said a 22-year-old volunteer first aider, who spoke on condition of anonymity, for security reasons.She is concerned that if police spot her at the scene, they could pin a crime on her that she didn't commit, or later identify her online, which could put her friends and family at risk.Young Hong Kong protesters also employ other tactics to cover their digital tracks, such as organizing themselves on encrypted app Telegram, using new SIM cards and single-journey subway tickets, rather than travel cards registered to their names, and adopting code names while talking to one another at demonstrations.Umbrellas are also widely used to block security cameras, ward off tear gas and provide cover for those painting slogans on walls or unscrewing metal railings from the sidewalk. In recent weeks, protesters have strategically used laser pointers to blind security cameras and distract the police.The 22-year-old volunteer first aider said that these ideas form organically from online discussions.Protesters offer each other advice, such as wearing identical outfits and taping over brands on their shoes, to blend in with one another. She's also seen some put reflective tape on their goggles, taking a cue from the silver strips that Hong Kong riot police sometimes place on their protective visors.A police spokesperson would not disclose why they did so, for operational reasons. But the material helps prevent observers from identifying the wearer, as their eyes are hidden from view. A post on online forum LIHKG, the city's answer to Reddit, instructs protesters where to affix it to hide their identity.The use of reflective materials to evade surveillance isn't just being explored in Hong Kong. In 2016, American artist Scott Urban set up a Kickstarter page to crowdfund his anti-surveillance sunglasses, Reflectacles.The eyewear is made from a material that reflects infrared light, meaning the frames appear as flashes of white light in surveillance footage. Because of the glare, a person could appear anonymous in images and photos, his website claims.Urban said his website has experienced a spike in hits from Hong Kong, as a result of the recent protests."I'm not trying to hawk a product," Urban said in a phone interview. "I'm just trying to tell people that when your face becomes your identity, there's no going back. You're going to be tracked constantly in any public space."Wider concernsSo can the ideas proposed by artists and designers keep up with the ever-improving technology? And can protesters stay ahead of the developments?Garfield Benjamin, who researches privacy and digital culture at Britain's Solent University, said while concepts might work when they are proposed, they can quickly be rendered obsolete because technology is developing so rapidly."It's a bit of an arms race," Benjamin said.That's because the technology powering facial recognition software is becoming ever more complex.Some systems now can use machine learning to mimic the way humans recognize each other, according to Lujo Bauer, a professor of electrical and computer engineering and computer science at Carnegie Mellon University.Other software uses infrared light to create 3D models of a person's face -- the kind of technology used on an iPhone X. These examples are more advanced than simply measuring the distances between facial features.For now, authorities around the world are mostly using 2D facial recognition technology, which isn't able to recognize depth, said Anil Jain, a computer science professor at Michigan State University. He added that governments may already have access to huge databases of citizens' photos -- such as driver's license pictures or mugshots -- which they can compare with facial recognition data in order to identify individuals.In mainland China -- which operates under a separate legal system from Hong Kong -- facial recognition technology, according to Human Rights Watch, is already being used with chilling effects.Beijing has created a mass surveillance system to closely monitor the movement of Uyghurs and other minorities in the far western region of Xinjiang.In the United States and the United Kingdom, authorities in some cities have started to use facial recognition to catch suspects, but have faced push back from critics who say the technology can be inaccurate, biased and in violation of citizens' privacy rights. San Francisco and Oakland, California, and Somerville, Massachusetts have already prohibited the use of facial recognition on citizens."We've gotten to the point (in the US), where these technologies are rolled out around the country with no transparency, no guidelines, regulations, and very little public understanding of actually how the technologies work," said city councilor Ben Ewen-Campen, who sponsored Somerville's measure to outlaw facial-recognition technology.Mass surveillance using facial recognition software relies on infrastructure; and without a web of cameras capturing images of citizens the technology cannot be implemented.Worldwide, such video surveillance is "ramping up," according to new research by Comparitech.A report released by the consumer technology website found that eight of the 10 most surveilled cities in the world are in China. London and Atlanta also made the top 10 cities based on the number of CCTV cameras per 1,000 people and Singapore, Sydney and Delhi made the top 20.In Hong Kong, surveillance measures are worrying protesters. On Saturday, demonstrators clashed with riot police after attempting to forcefully pull down some of the city's smart lamp posts. Despite authorities saying that the lamp posts did not carry facial recognition software, "irrational protesters disregarded the facts and blatantly damaged the smart lamp posts," a Hong Kong government spokesperson said.Other protesters are concerned about being spotted by the city's CCTV cameras, although the Hong Kong government says the city's CCTV cameras aren't equipped with automatic facial recognition (AFR) technology.But Hong Kong's protesters aren't just concerned about the short-term issue of being arrested by police.Many are worried about the future, when the "one country, two systems" arrangement that allows the city certain freedoms and autonomy expires in 2047.As a 20-year-old student protester -- who only gave his surname, Lau -- took a break in the shade during a protest on a blazingly hot day, he kept his face mask on, even though no police were around."We are not prepared to be picked up by the government yet," he said.Top image caption: A protester covers a security camera on the outside of the Chinese government's liaison office in Hong Kong on July 21, 2019.Load-Date: August 26, 2019End of Document

Because of the glare, a person could appear anonymous in images and photos, his website claims.Urban said his website has experienced a spike in hits from Hong Kong, as a result of the recent protests."I'm not trying to hawk a product," Urban said in a phone interview. "I'm just trying to tell people that when your face becomes your identity, there's no going back. You're going to be tracked constantly in any public space."Wider concernsSo can the ideas proposed by artists and designers keep up with the ever-improving technology? And can protesters stay ahead of the developments?Garfield Benjamin, who researches privacy and digital culture at Britain's Solent University, said while concepts might work when they are proposed, they can quickly be rendered obsolete because technology is developing so rapidly."It's a bit of an arms race," Benjamin said.That's because the technology powering facial recognition software is becoming ever more complex.Some systems now can use machine learning to mimic the way humans recognize each other, according to Lujo Bauer, a professor of electrical and computer engineering and computer science at Carnegie Mellon University.Other software uses infrared light to create 3D models of a person's face -- the kind of technology used on an iPhone X. These examples are more advanced than simply measuring the distances between facial features.For now, authorities around the world are mostly using 2D facial recognition technology, which isn't able to recognize depth, said Anil Jain, a computer science professor at Michigan State University. He added that governments may already have access to huge databases of citizens' photos -- such as driver's license pictures or mugshots -- which they can compare with facial recognition data in order to identify individuals.In mainland China -- which operates under a separate legal system from Hong Kong -- facial recognition technology, according to Human Rights Watch, is already being used with chilling effects.Beijing has created a mass surveillance system to closely monitor the movement of Uyghurs and other minorities in the far western region of Xinjiang.In the United States and the United Kingdom, authorities in some cities have started to use facial recognition to catch suspects, but have faced push back from critics who say the technology can be inaccurate, biased and in violation of citizens' privacy rights. San Francisco and Oakland, California, and Somerville, Massachusetts have already prohibited the use of facial recognition on citizens."We've gotten to the point (in the US), where these technologies are rolled out around the country with no transparency, no guidelines, regulations, and very little public understanding of actually how the technologies work," said city councilor Ben Ewen-Campen, who sponsored Somerville's measure to outlaw facial-recognition technology.Mass surveillance using facial recognition software relies on infrastructure; and without a web of cameras capturing images of citizens the technology cannot be implemented.Worldwide, such video surveillance is "ramping up," according to new research by Comparitech.A report released by the consumer technology website found that eight of the 10 most surveilled cities in the world are in China. London and Atlanta also made the top 10 cities based on the number of CCTV cameras per 1,000 people and Singapore, Sydney and Delhi made the top 20.In Hong Kong, surveillance measures are worrying protesters. On Saturday, demonstrators clashed with riot police after attempting to forcefully pull down some of the city's smart lamp posts. Despite authorities saying that the lamp posts did not carry facial recognition software, "irrational protesters disregarded the facts and blatantly damaged the smart lamp posts," a Hong Kong government spokesperson said.Other protesters are concerned about being spotted by the city's CCTV cameras, although the Hong Kong government says the city's CCTV cameras aren't equipped with automatic facial recognition (AFR) technology.But Hong Kong's protesters aren't just concerned about the short-term issue of being arrested by police.Many are worried about the future, when the "one country, two systems" arrangement that allows the city certain freedoms and autonomy expires in 2047.As a 20-year-old student protester -- who only gave his surname, Lau -- took a break in the shade during a protest on a blazingly hot day, he kept his face mask on, even though no police were around."We are not prepared to be picked up by the government yet," he said.Top image caption: A protester covers a security camera on the outside of the Chinese government's liaison office in Hong Kong on July 21, 2019.Load-Date: August 29, 2019End of Document

HONG KONG REELS IN WAKE OF STABBING ATTACK ON PROTESTERS, POLICE TORTURE VIDEOStates News ServiceAugust 20, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 957 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Hong Kong was reeling on Tuesday following a knife attack by a pro-police thug on two anti-extradition protesters and a former journalist.The blue-shirted attacker slashed and stabbed three people at an anti-extradition "Lennon Wall" in a pedestrian tunnel in Tseung Kwan O district late on Monday , leaving a 26-year-old woman surnamed Wong, who recently resigned from her job as a reporter at Hong Kong's Chinese-language Economic Journal in intensive care, the paper said in an online news report.A 25-year-old man and a 35-year-old woman were sent to the local hospital for stab and slash wounds inflicted in the attack. The man has since been discharged, while the woman in is a stable condition, it said."This newspaper condemns any form of violence, and is distressed at the serious injuries suffered by one of its colleagues," the paper said.A knife was left at the crime scene, while a second weapon was also found in a nearby trash can, the report said, but it hadn't yet been linked to the attack."Police believe that the attacker discarded his blue shirt and other clothing, before putting on a red shirt to make his escape," the paper reported.Meanwhile, surveillance camera footage has emerged of two uniformed police officers assaulting an elderly man on a hospital gurney.In the video, which was widely shared on social media, the officers torture the man while he lies prone on the gurney, assaulting his abdomen, genital area and head with fists and batons.Family members told journalists that the victim -- who is in his sixties -- lost control of his bladder during the assault and was told to "drink your own piss" by one officer after they removed his clothing."Why did they torture and abuse him in such a skillful manner? They even put on gloves at the outset, which made it seem premeditated," the man's son said."I can only hope that anyone breaking the law, including the police, will be subjected to the usual sanctions," he said.Torture, inappropriate conductLam Cheuk-ting said the incident was particularly shocking given that the man was restrained by all four limbs and had been drinking heavily."These officers tortured him, beating and humiliating him, which is an extremely serious abuse of their power," Lam said. "It would be appropriate for them to be prosecuted not just for torture, but for inappropriate conduct in public office."Torture is defined in Hong Kong law as the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering on another in the course of carrying out official duties. It carries a potential life sentence.The officers in the video were only arrested after the video was posted online by pro-democracy lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting.Asked why police waited until now to make an arrest linked to the attack, a police spokesman said they were unaware that the footage existed.Nathan Law, a former lawmaker and leader of the 2014 pro-democracy movement currently studying in the United States, said he had reported a torrent of online threats and abuse to the local authorities."I've been receiving numerous threats to my personal safety, including messages about murdering me or going after me at Yale, etc. I don't know where these messages come from but am deeply troubled," Law wrote via his Twitter account."These sickening individuals have not deterred my support of the pro-democracy resistance in Hong Kong," he said. "I've already informed my school and the local police department, both of which are worried and monitoring my situation."The threats against Law come after a wave of increasingly aggressive pro-China protests have mushroomed on university campuses around the world, with some pro Beijing protesters reportedly attacking and intimidating supporters of the Hong Kong anti-extradition movement.C oordinated inauthentic behaviorFacebook and Twitter both said they had taken steps to remove advertisements smearing anti-extradition protesters on their platforms, citing strong evidence that they were placed by a state actor, namely the ruling Chinese Communist Party." Today , we removed seven Pages, three Groups and five Facebook accounts involved in coordinated inauthentic behavior as part of a small network that originated in China and focused on Hong Kong," Facebook said in a news release."The individuals behind this campaign engaged in a number of deceptive tactics, including the use of fake accounts some of which had been already disabled by our automated systems to manage Pages posing as news organizations, post in Groups, disseminate their content, and also drive people to off-platform news sites," it said."Although the people behind this activity attempted to conceal their identities, our investigation found links to individuals associated with the Chinese government," it said.The groups and pages had been followed by at least 15,500 accounts prior to being removed, it said.Twitter said it had uncovered "a significant state-backed information operation focused on the situation in Hong Kong, specifically the protest movement and their calls for political change."It said some 936 accounts originating from within the People's Republic of China (PRC) were "deliberately and specifically attempting to sow political discord in Hong Kong, including undermining the legitimacy and political positions of the protest movement on the ground.""We have reliable evidence to support that this is a coordinated state-backed operation," the company said on its official blog. "All the accounts have been suspended for a range of violations of our platform manipulation policies."Reported by Lau Siu-fung, Ng Yik-tung and Wen Yuqing for RFA's Cantonese Service.

Huawei secretly installed wireless networks in North KoreaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 23, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 379 wordsBodyWashington. Huawei Technologies Co, the Chinese tech giant involved in President Trump's trade war with China, and blacklisted as a threat to national security, secretly helped the North Korean government build the wireless network according to internal documents obtained by The Washington Post and individuals familiar with the agreement.Huawei partnered with Chinese state-owned firm Panda International Information Technology Co Ltd to develop a variety of projects whose collaboration landscape spans eight years.The evidence was handed over to The Washington Post by a former Huawei employee.The revelations raise questions about whether or not Huawei, which has used American technology in its components, violated US export controls to supply equipment to North Korea, where the isolated regime has faced sweeping sanctions nuclear weapons and human rights abuses.Since 2016, the Department of Commerce, which declined to comment on the issue, has investigated the alleged links between Huawei and North Korea, but has never found solid swords.Response from HuaweiThrough a statement, Huawei argued that it "has no commercial presence" in North Korea. However, spokesman Joe Kelly refused to address detailed questions, including whether Huawei had done business in Pyongyang in the past.It did not question the authenticity of the shared documents, although it also refused to verify them."Huawei is fully committed to complying with all laws and regulations of the countries and regions where we operate, including all export control and sanction laws and regulations" of the United Nations, the United States and the European Union, concludes the statement.A spokeswoman for Panda Group, Panda International's state-owned parent company, declined to comment on The Washington Post.The discovery of the link between North Korea and Huawei, whose activities, ambitions and alleged ties to the Chinese government have alarmed U.S. and European security officials, will raise suspicions about existing spying, putting its commercialization of 5G wireless networks at risk."Just the fact that there's a connection between Huawei and North Korea is meant to create political and diplomatic problems in Washington," said Evans J.R. Revere, a former State Department official.Load-Date: July 23, 2019End of Document

Apple Ascends on Stronger-Than-Expected Results and Guidance: 7 Key TakeawaysTheStreet.comJuly 31, 2019 Wednesday 10:29 AM EDTCopyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1163 wordsByline: Eric JhonsaHighlight: The tech giant beat estimates with the help of a big quarter for its wearables businesses, and offered a better-than-expected outlook for its September quarter, which is expected to see three new iPhones launch.BodySolid guidance, improving Chinese sales trends and a blowout quarter for the Apple Watch and AirPods are helping Apple's  shares rally post-earnings.On Tuesday after the close,  June quarter (fiscal third quarter) revenue of $53.81 billion (up 1% annually) and GAAP EPS of $2.18 (down 7%), beating a consensus analyst estimate of $53.32 billion and $2.09. The company also guided for September quarter revenue of $61 billion to $64 billion (down 3% to up 2%), above a consensus estimate of $60.9 billion.Apple's shares, which had also  , jumped in after-hours trading and were up 4.7% to $218.66 on Wednesday morning, putting their market cap at just above $1 trillion. Shares are now up 38% on the year, after having tumbled during the last three months of 2018. Here are some notable takeaways from Apple's earnings report and call.1. 'Wearables' Sales SoaredDriving much of the June quarter revenue beat: Apple's Wearables, Home & Accessories segment, which covers all hardware offerings outside of iPhones, iPads and Macs, saw revenue rise 48% annually to $5.53 billion, trouncing a consensus estimate of $4.59 billion. The segment's revenue growth accelerated from the March quarter's 30% and hit the highest levels seen since 2015, the year the original Apple Watch launched.The Apple Watch and AirPods have been driving this segment's growth for some time. On Apple's earnings call, Tim Cook said Apple's "wearables" revenue, which covers the Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats headphones, grew "well over 50%" annually during the quarter, after having grown close to 50% in the March quarter.Cook added that over 75% of Apple Watch buyers were first-time buyers. Separately, CFO Luca Maestri noted the segment also benefited from double-digit Apple TV and accessories growth.2. iPhone Sales Were a Little Below ExpectationsAfter dropping 17% in the March quarter, iPhone revenue (48% of total revenue) fell 12% annually in the June quarter to $25.99, missing a consensus estimate of $26.31 billion. On the bright side, the iPhone installed base (boosted by used iPhone sales and high customer loyalty rates) once more hit a new high, and enhanced trade-in offers helped iPhone sales at Apple's own retail stores grow in June.The iPhone accounted for less than 50% of total revenue  since 2012. It's still expected to account for over 50% of Apple's September and December quarter sales, as new iPhone launches provide a lift.3. Mac Sales Growth Improved Sharply, While iPad Growth CooledFollowing a 5% March quarter revenue drop amid Intel  CPU shortages, Apple's Mac revenue rose 11% last quarter to $5.82 billion, beating a consensus estimate of $5.45 billion. Maestri mentioned that nearly half of all Mac buyers were first-time buyers, which in turn helped the Mac installed base hit a new high. The MacBook overhaul  could provide a lift to the September quarter's Mac sales.iPad revenue rose 8% to $5.02 billion, missing a consensus of $5.17 billion, with growth slowing from the March quarter's 22%. iPad revenue still rose in all five of Apple's geographic reporting segments; the installed base hit a new high, and over half of iPad buyers were first-time buyers.4. Services Growth Remained Broad-BasedServices revenue came in at $11.46 billion, slightly below an $11.68 billion consensus. Revenue officially grew 13%, and was up 15% excluding a one-time, year-ago gain related to lawsuit settlements; the adoption of  accounting rules has also impacted services growth a bit in recent quarters.It's possible that Alphabet/Google's  giant search ad revenue-sharing payments to Apple grew more slowly last quarter, given  . But sales momentum for Apple-branded services remained strong. Maestri disclosed the App Store, Apple Music, cloud services (iCloud storage subscriptions) and AppleCare all saw double-digit growth, and that Apple Pay and App Store search ad revenue grew at triple-digit rates.App Store growth, which is benefiting from the end of a Chinese government halt on game monetization approvals, is said to have accelerated from the March quarter. And the total number of paid subscriptions (whether from Apple or a third party) handled by Apple's services ecosystem rose by another 30 million sequentially to over 420 million.Maestri did caution that AppleCare will be facing tougher annual comparisons later this year, following a 2018 expansion of its partner base. On the flip side, the upcoming launches of the Apple Card and Apple's TV+ and Arcade services should provide a boost to services revenue.While Apple's product gross margin (GM) fell 2.4 percentage points annually to 30.4%, its services GM rose by 2.3 points to 64.1%. As a result, while services accounted for 21% of Apple's revenue, they produced 36% of its gross profit dollars.Apple and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer's .

Sales Trends in China and Other Emerging Markets ImprovedWhile Apple's sales to the "Greater China" region (it covers Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan) fell 4% to $9.16 billion, that's a much smaller decline than the March quarter's 22% drop and the December quarter's 27% decline. Cook added that Greater China revenue was up in constant currency, and that Mainland China revenue rose in dollars as well.Sales trends also improved in some other emerging markets. "Strong double-digit" growth was reported for India and Brazil, and Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines were said to have hit new sales records.6. A Strong Dollar Continues Impacting Revenue GrowthIn Apple's March quarter, currency swings had about a 2-percentage-point impact on revenue growth. In the June quarter, that figure increase to 3 percentage points. As a result, while total revenue grew 1% in dollars, it was up 4% in constant currency.For the September quarter, Apple is guiding for forex to have about a $1 billion impact on revenue. At the midpoint of its revenue guidance range, that implies an impact of about 1.6 percentage points.7. Stock Buybacks Continued$17 billion was spent to buy back close to 88 million shares via open-market transactions. This follows about $24 billion worth of buybacks in the March quarter, and a more modest $8 billion in the December quarter. Thanks to buybacks, Apple's diluted share count fell by about 330 million annually to 4.6 billion, which in turn boosted the quarter's EPS by about $0.15.With Apple possessing over $102 billion in net cash (cash minus debt) and generating over $60 billion in annual free cash flow, and with Maestri reiterating that his company aims to eventually become net cash neutral, expect Apple to remain an avid buyer of its own stock.TheStreet's Eric Jhonsa previously covered Apple's earnings report and call .Save 76% with our Summer Break Sale.

(NYSE: SOGO) ("Sogou" or "the Company"), an innovator in search and a leader in China's internet industry, today announced its unaudited financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2019.Second Quarter 2019 HighlightsTotal revenues[1] were $303.6 million, a 1% increase year-over-year, or an 8% increase in RMB terms. Net income attributable to Sogou Inc. was $21.3 million. Non-GAAP[2] net income attributable to Sogou Inc. was $27.8 million. Sogou Mobile Keyboard had 453 million DAUs (daily average users), up 17% year-over-year. As China's largest voice app, it processed up to 680 million daily voice requests."During the second quarter, our business maintained steady growth and we made important progress in key areas," said Xiaochuan Wang, CEO of Sogou. "Search revenues continued to grow faster than the industry average.  At the same time, by leveraging the large user bases for both Search and Mobile Keyboard, we have gradually built up our big data and recommendation service at a company level and are focusing on unlocking its commercial value."Mr. Wang added, "We also geared up our efforts to drive innovation in language-centric AI technologies and continued to advance our leadership in voice and computer vision. Moreover, leveraging our core AI capabilities, we made significant progress in upgrading the smart hardware business, with new AI-enabled products launched and more in the pipeline. Going forward, we believe the steady growth in our core search business, coupled with the solid progress in the big data and recommendation service and smart hardware, will support sustainable expansion across our businesses."Joe Zhou, CFO of Sogou, said, "We continued to drive top line growth during the second quarter. Notably, revenues generated from the big data and recommendation service ramped up quickly year-over-year.  Although we anticipate the external environment will remain challenging in the second half of 2019, we expect to experience positive momentum from our new growth drivers."Second Quarter 2019 Financial ResultsTotal revenueswere $303.6 million, a 1% increase year-over-year.Search and search-related revenues were $276.2 million, a 2% increase year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to growth in auction-based pay-for-click services. Auction-based pay-for-click services accounted for 88.2% of search and search-related revenues, compared to 84.7% in the corresponding period in 2018. Other revenues were $27.5 million, a 11% decrease year-over-year. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales of smart hardware products as a result of the Company's continued efforts to upgrade its smart hardware strategy.Cost of revenueswas $195.9 million, a 9% increase year-over-year.Traffic acquisition cost, a primary driver of cost of revenues, was $146.3 million, an 8% increase year-over-year, representing 48.2% of total revenues, compared to 45.0% in the corresponding period in 2018. The increase was driven by price inflation.Gross profitwas $107.8 million, an 11% decrease year-over-year.Non-GAAP gross profitwas $107.9 million, a 12% decrease year-over-year.Total operating expenseswere $96.1 million, largely flat year-over-year.Research and development expenses were $50.6 million, a 10% decrease year-over-year, representing 16.7% of total revenues, compared to 18.7% in the corresponding period in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in professional fees. Sales and marketing expenses were $36.7 million, an 8% increase year-over-year, representing 12.1% of total revenues, compared to 11.2% in the corresponding period in 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel-related expenses. General and administrative expenses were $8.8 million, a 31% increase year-over-year, representing 2.9% of total revenues, compared to 2.2% in the corresponding period in 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in expenses related to non-core business initiatives.Operating incomewas $11.6 million, compared to operating income of $24.8 million in the corresponding period in 2018.Non-GAAP operating incomewas $18.1 million, compared to non-GAAP operating income of $29.9 million in the corresponding period in 2018.Other income, netwas $4.2 million, compared to $3.4 million in the corresponding period in 2018.Income taxbenefitwas $1.4 million, compared to income tax expense of $3.0 million in the corresponding period of 2018. The income tax benefit resulted from a tax filing adjustment of income tax expense previously recognized, which was due to a reduction in taxable income related to Chinese government initiatives to encourage investment in R&D.Net income attributable to Sogou Inc.was $21.3 million, compared to net income of $33.2 million in the corresponding period in 2018.Non-GAAP net income attributable to Sogou Inc.was $27.8 million, compared to net income of $38.2 million in the corresponding period in 2018.Basic and dilutedearningsper ADSwere $0.05.Non-GAAP basic and dilutedearningsper ADS were $0.07.As of June 30, 2019, the Company hadcash and cash equivalents and short-term investmentsof $1.1 billion, compared with $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2018.Net operating cash inflowfor the second quarter of 2019 was $56.2 million.Capital expendituresfor the second quarter of 2019 were $12.1 million.[1] On a constant currency (non-GAAP) basis, if the exchange rate in the second quarter of 2019 had been the same as it was in the second quarter of 2018, or RMB 6.38=$1.00, total revenues in the second quarter of 2019 would have been 324.3 million, or $20.7 million more than GAAP total revenues, and up 8% year-over-year.[2] Non-GAAP results exclude share-based compensation expense. Explanation of the Company's non-GAAP financial measures and related reconciliations to GAAP financial measures are included in the accompanying "Non-GAAP Disclosure" and "Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Results of Operation Measures to the Nearest Comparable GAAP Measures."Recent DevelopmentSogou today announced that on August 3, 2019, its Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to US$50 million of the outstanding American depositary shares, or ADSs, of Sogou over the next twelve months. The ADSs may be purchased from time to time at management's discretion at prevailing market prices in accordance with Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Sogou's management will determine the timing and amount of any purchases of Sogou ADSs based on their evaluation of market conditions, the trading price of Sogou's ADSs and other factors. The purchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company plans to fund repurchases from its existing cash balance.Business OutlookFor the third quarter of 2019, Sogou expects total revenues to be in the range $304 million to $314 million, representing a 10% to 14% increase year-over-year, or an 11% to 15% increase year-over-year in RMB terms.For the third quarter 2019 guidance, the Company has adopted a presumed exchange rate of RMB6.90 = $1.00, as compared with the actual exchange rate of approximately RMB6.81 = $1.00 for the third quarter of 2018, and RMB6.82 = $1.00 for the second quarter of 2019.Non-GAAP DisclosureTo supplement the unaudited consolidated financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"), Sogou's management uses non-GAAP measures of gross profit, gross margin, and net income that are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude the impact of share-based awards. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.Sogou's management believes that excluding share-based compensation expense is useful for management's internal operating purposes and for investors. The amount of share-based compensation expense cannot be anticipated by management, and this is not built into the Company's annual budgets and quarterly forecasts, which generally will be the basis for information Sogou provides to analysts and investors as guidance for future operating performance. As share-based compensation expense does not involve subsequent cash outflow, Sogou does not factor in this expense when evaluating and approving expenditures or when determining the allocation of its resources to its business operations. As a result, in general, the Company's monthly financial results for internal reporting and any performance measures for commissions and bonuses are based on these non-GAAP financial measures that exclude share-based compensation expense.The non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of Sogou's current financial performance and prospects for the future. A limitation of using non-GAAP gross profit, gross margin, and net income measures that exclude share-based compensation expense is that share-based compensation expense has been and is likely to continue to be a significant recurring expense in the Company's business. In order to mitigate these limitations, the Company has provided specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The accompanying tables include details on the reconciliation between GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measures the Company has presented.Safe Harbor StatementThis announcement contains forward-looking statements. It is currently expected that the Business Outlook will not be updated until release of Sogou's next quarterly earnings announcement.

The estimate includes a modest negative impact from foreign exchange, which is largely offset by a positive net impact from acquisitions and divestitures. P&G expects organic sales growth in the range of three to four percent. Core earnings per share are expected to increase four to nine percent (mid-to-high single digits) versus fiscal 2019 Core EPS of $4.52 (~4.70-4.93, excluding non-recurring items, vs. $4.74 S&P Capital IQ Consensus) . P&G said its current outlook for commodities, foreign exchange, transportation and tariffs is expected to provide a modest net benefit to earnings growth in fiscal year 2020. P&G expects adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% for the fiscal year. Capital spending is estimated to be in the range of 4.5% to 5% of net sales. P&G estimates it will pay more than $7.5 billion in dividends and repurchase $6 billion to $8 billion of common shares in fiscal 2020.07:00AOS A.O.

Co issues downside guidance for FY19, sees EPS of $2.35-$2.41 vs. $2.67 S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Commentary: "We continue to see prolonged headwinds in the appliance market in China. As a result of weakness in consumer demand and recent communications with key customers in China indicating that they will scale back their purchases in the third quarter due to continued elevated channel inventory levels, our outlook for the back half of the year includes a year-over-year decline in China sales. We project full year China sales to be down between 16-17% yer/yr in local currency terms and 19-20% after a three percentage point currency headwind."07:00SUMRX Asian Markets Close: Nikkei +0.4%, Hang Seng +0.1%, Shanghai +0.4%Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended Tuesday on a mostly higher note. Nikkei reported that more than two thirds of manufacturers in Japan have seen lower quarterly profits in Q2, representing the largest share since the financial crisis. Japan's Cabinet office lowered expectations for growth in fiscal 2019/2020 to 1.3% from 0.9%.

Gross margin is expected to increase approximately 110 to 130 basis points compared to 2018. Excluding restructuring charges from the comparable prior period, we expect an increase of approximately 70 to 90 basis points compared to 2018 adjusted gross margin due to ongoing supply chain initiatives and channel mix benefits.06:56GLT Glatfelter Co reports EPS in-line, misses on revs; On track to meet cost reduction target (17.01 )Reports Q2 (Jun) earnings of $0.19 per share, excluding non-recurring items, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.19; revenues rose 9.3% year/year to $235.7 mln vs the $251.05 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus."Entering the second half of 2019, we remain focused on delivering our commitments as we continue to shape the new Glatfelter into a higher-margin, growth-oriented engineered materials company. Airlaid Materials is well positioned to achieve 10% legacy volume growth for the full year and we continue to expect the Steinfurt acquisition to deliver $7 million to $9 million of operating profit in 2019.

"While weaker overall market demand negatively impacted our sales volume during the first half of 2019, we are confident we have not lost share in our core wood connector business. For the remainder of the year, we are cautiously optimistic housing starts will pick up and enable healthier demand levels."Based on current business trends and conditions, outlook for fiscal year 2019 is expected to be as follows: 2019 full-year gross margin is estimated to be in the range of ~43.5% to 44.0%, lower than previous estimate of 44.5% to 45.5%. 2019 full-year operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, is estimated to be between ~27.5% and 28.5%. 2020 Plan update: Expects its consolidated operating margin to be in the range of 16% to 17% by fiscal 2020 from 16.4% in 2016. This is a downward revision from its prior 2020 target for consolidated operating margin of approximately 21% to 22%. Importantly, Simpson's success in rationalizing its cost structure has helped mitigate further downward pressure on this target. Due to a combination of rising raw material costs and then soon-to-be tariffed finished goods from China, the Company pro-actively built up its anchor inventory, bought an additional allotment of steel (in late 2018) in order to mitigate the potential impact of product availability and built-up inventory to ensure customer needs are met during the SAP roll-out.

The Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) and Russell 2000 (-0.6%) both underperformed, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) managed to finish higher.Monday's session didn't include much price action, as investors appeared to be waiting for several key events later this week.

On a related note, Apple's price target was raised to $235 from $225 at UBS before its results after Tuesday's close.Apple shares rose on the increased price target, but the broader market was still weighed down by widely-held shares of Amazon (AMZN 1912.45, -30.60, -1.6%), Facebook (FB 195.94, -3.81, -1.9%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1239.41, -11.00, -0.9%).

For the remainder of the year, we are cautiously optimistic housing starts will pick up and enable healthier demand levels."Based on current business trends and conditions, outlook for fiscal year 2019 is expected to be as follows: 2019 full-year gross margin is estimated to be in the range of ~43.5% to 44.0%, lower than previous estimate of 44.5% to 45.5%. 2019 full-year operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, is estimated to be between ~27.5% and 28.5%. 2020 Plan update: Expects its consolidated operating margin to be in the range of 16% to 17% by fiscal 2020 from 16.4% in 2016. This is a downward revision from its prior 2020 target for consolidated operating margin of approximately 21% to 22%. Importantly, Simpson's success in rationalizing its cost structure has helped mitigate further downward pressure on this target. Due to a combination of rising raw material costs and then soon-to-be tariffed finished goods from China, the Company pro-actively built up its anchor inventory, bought an additional allotment of steel (in late 2018) in order to mitigate the potential impact of product availability and built-up inventory to ensure customer needs are met during the SAP roll-out.

The Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) and Russell 2000 (-0.6%) both underperformed, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) managed to finish higher.Monday's session didn't include much price action, as investors appeared to be waiting for several key events later this week. Some of these events will include the FOMC's rate decision, U.S.-China trade talks, the July employment report, and Apple's (AAPL 209.68, +1.94, +0.9%) earnings report. On a related note, Apple's price target was raised to $235 from $225 at UBS before its results after Tuesday's close.Apple shares rose on the increased price target, but the broader market was still weighed down by widely-held shares of Amazon (AMZN 1912.45, -30.60, -1.6%), Facebook (FB 195.94, -3.81, -1.9%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1239.41, -11.00, -0.9%). In turn, the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.6%) and communication services (-0.5%) sectors were among today's laggards but, like the broader market, finished the session off intraday lows.The S&P 500 financials sector (-0.8%) succumbed to broad-based selling interest throughout the day. Wells Fargo (WFC 48.28, -1.02, -2.1%) was a notable laggard amid a Wall Street Journal report indicating that the Trump administration plans to make it harder for deeply indebted borrowers to acquire mortgage loans.On the other hand, the S&P 500 defensive-oriented sectors -- utilities (+0.5%), real estate (+0.5%), health care (+0.4%), and consumer staples (+0.3%) -- were the lone sectors that finished higher.Separately, Mylan N.V. (MYL 20.78, +2.32, +12.6%) agreed to combine with Pfizer's (PFE 41.45, -1.64, -3.8%) off-patent drug business, giving Mylan shareholders 43% of the combined company. On a related note, Mylan N.V. beat top and bottom-line estimates; Pfizer beat earnings estimates but missed revenue estimates.U.S. Treasuries finished the session higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points each to 1.84% and 2.06%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index finished flat at 98.04. WTI crude increased 1.2% to $56.87/bbl.Investors did not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Looking ahead, Tuesday will feature the Personal Income and Spending report for June, which will include the Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- the PCE Price Index.
