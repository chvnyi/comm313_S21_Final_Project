House Transportation Committee Issues Testimony From Guardian Six ConsultancyTargeted News ServiceMay 16, 2019 Thursday 8:01 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 5468 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee issued the following testimony by John Adams, president of Guardian Six Consultancy, at a hearing entitled "Impacts of State-Owned Enterprises on Public Transit and Freight Rail Sectors":"My name is John Adams and I am a 30-year veteran of the US Army and President of Guardian Six LLC, (Guardian). Guardian Six is a defense and national security consulting firm, which specializes in understanding, assessing, and mitigating against national security threats to our Nation's defense industrial base. Guardian Six is also a national security advisor to the Rail Security Alliance (RSA) which is a coalition of North American freight railcar manufacturers, suppliers, steel interest and unions committed to ensuring the economic and national security of our freight and transit rail systems. Notably, on October 22, 2018, Guardian Six published a report titled "National Security Vulnerabilities of the U.S. Freight Rail Infrastructure and Manufacturing Sector - Threats and Mitigation," which systematically examines, among other things, the threats posed by SOEs in this industry."Our country depends upon the freight rail system to provide safe, reliable, and effective transportation for our defense and homeland security infrastructure. I know first-hand that our national survival depends upon these vital rail links as the primary transportation for U.S. military equipment, infrastructure logistics, hazardous waste, toxic substances, and the range of products and commodities that support our entire economy. U.S. freight rail is a strategic asset, the health and integrity upon which our armed forces depend to maintain readiness and preserve our defense capacity. Our freight rail system connects ports to rural and urban inland hubs, military bases to each other, and to key logistics nodes throughout our Nation. It also links the U.S. by land to key allies and trading partners Canada and Mexico and enables transportation between coastal and inland military and homeland infrastructure nodes. On the passenger side, millions of Americans rely on transit rail systems every day. The U.S. rail system is also highly sophisticated, relying on a constantly expanding network of technology and digitization that dramatically increases its risk to cyber-attack and hacking."Today, I would like to draw the Committee's attention to China's strategic targeting of the U.S. rail manufacturing sector, with aggressive, strategic and anti-competitive actions. China is making substantial economic inroads into our rail system's supporting supply chains, as well as rolling stock asset ownership and management. Beijing's 2015 "Made in China 2025" plan leverages state resources and industrial policy, specifically aiming for a comparative advantage in the global advanced rail sector among nine other sectors. China's strategy to capture the U.S. rail system's supply chain threatens the system's cyber-security, reliability, and safety. Any Chinese dominance of the U.S. rail system would turn the system from a bedrock strategic asset into a potentially crippling vulnerability.China's State-Owned Enterprises Target U.S. Rail Manufacturing"The United States has seen a growth in Chinese foreign direct investment over the last few decades, exceeding $140 billion in 2018.1 Much of this investment is targeted in several sectors including energy, telecommunications, and transportation - industries that make up key pillars of our country's critical infrastructure. In the rail transportation sector, this investment has been spearheaded by a Chinese SOE called the China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation (CRRC). Specifically, CRRC is a massive conglomerate that is wholly owned by the Chinese government, with deep ties to the Communist Party of China. Not only does CRRC possess 90 percent of China's domestic market to produce rail locomotives, bullet trains, passenger trains and metro vehicles, but it has dramatically and strategically increased its investment and footprint in the United States. This fact raises serious questions and concerns about the current and future safety and security of our Nation's railroads."The "Made in China 2025" initiative, a key component of China's 13th Five-Year plan,2 identifies the rail manufacturing sector as a top target for Chinese expansion. This initiative has systematically and deliberately driven strategic investment and financing activities of the SOE CRRC in third-country markets and the United States.3 In 2015, CRRC reported revenues of more than $37 billion4 -- significantly outpacing the entire U.S. railcar market, which had $22 billion of output during the same year.5 According to Chinese state media, CRRC plans to increase overseas sales to $15 billion by next year alone. This represents about double the level of export orders from just four years ago6 and according to CRRC's own presentation materials the U.S. market remains a prime target to, as they put it, "conquer."7"CRRC's bylaws direct that the company seek guidance from the Communist Party of China on significant matters affecting the company's operations.8 Three of CRRC's current board members previously held high-level positions at several state-owned defense companies including, Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), which produces fighter and bomber aircraft, helicopters, and unmanned aerial vehicles for the Chinese Army, and China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC), which produces submarines, warships, and other naval equipment for the Chinese Navy. Furthermore, two former CRRC board members held positions at AVIC and China North Industries Group Corporation Limited (NORINCO), a state-owned defense company that supplies tanks, aircraft, missiles, firearms, and related products for the Chinese military."The latter two of these entities, CSIC and NORINCO, have been subject to allegations of espionage and sanctions evasion by the U.S. government, raising serious questions about the link between CRRC board members and these compromising activities. Coupled with these facts, in 2007, AVIC was reputed to have stolen data on the F-35 fighter jet from Lockheed Martin and used it to build the Chinese J-31 fighter.9 Similarly, CSIC was indicted in 2016 by the U.S. Department of Justice for entering into contracts with another Chinese company for the purchase of industrial materials that were created using stolen trade secrets from an American company.10 NORINCO has also been sanctioned by the U.S. State Department on six occasions for contributing to Iranian Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) development.11 Two of CRRC's board members were respectively employed in high-level positions at CSIC and NORINCO at the time these offenses occurred, suggesting that they were likely aware of, if not complicit in, this illicit activity."Using state-backed financing, subsidies, and an array of other government resources, CRRC has strategically targeted and sought to capture the U.S. railcar manufacturing sector. In just the last five years the United States has witnessed CRRC establish rail assembly operations for transit railcars in two states, along with additional research and bidding operations in several others. By beginning with a business strategy to take market share in the U.S. transit rail manufacturing sector and deploying near-limitless financing from its home government to help ensure the well below-market bids for new U.S. metropolitan transit projects, CRRC has quickly established itself as a formidable force and major competitor in the U.S. transit rail system.."Thus far China has secured four U.S. metropolitan transit contracts, totaling $2.6 billion, largely by utilizing anticompetitive under-bidding practices. In each case, CRRC leveraged massive subsidies and other resources from the Chinese government to dramatically underbid its competitors, and in one case going as much as fifty percent below the bid submitted by another competitor. The trains purchased by those U.S. metropolitan transit agencies will contain Wi-Fi systems, automatic train control, automatic passenger counters, surveillance cameras, and the Internet of Things (IoT) technology that will be thoroughly integrated into the information and communications technology infrastructure of transit authorities, all designed and built by the Government of China."The fact that the advanced technologies in these trains is sole-sourced from a Chinese state-owned enterprise is alarming and the risk is very high that Chinese-built-in surveillance cameras could track the movements and routines of passengers, searching for high-value targets that intelligence officials can then identify to vacuum data from using the train's built-in Wi-Fi systems. Some argue that these risks are low and manageable; however, I beg to differ. Already, China is openly developing a system of "algorithmic surveillance" that leverages advances in artificial intelligence and facial recognition technology to enable the Chinese Communist Party to monitor the movements and patterns of its own citizens, purportedly as a means of combatting crime. China boasts about how it has utilized the latest advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and facial recognition technology to identify and track its 1.4 billion citizens,12 creating a very real prospect that they have the current capacity and interest in doing the same here, in the United States."Several recent cases involving CRRC bids for new transit rail projects serve as compelling examples of the strategy being employed by China to capture our rail systems. For example:* CRRC bid $567 million to win a contract with the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA) in Boston in 2014, coming as much as 50 percent below other bidders.13* CRRC won a 2016 contract to provide transit rail for the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA), bidding $226 million less than the next-highest bidder.14* CRRC bid $137.5 million in 2017 for a contract with Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in Philadelphia, underbidding the next-lowest bidder--which had a robust local manufacturing presence--by $34 million.15* CRRC finalized a contract with the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority in 2017 for its transit rail system worth up to $647 million.16 Again, China did this by leveraging below-market financing, which in turn undercut other bidders."Emboldened with these contract victories, CRRC continues to target other U.S. cities, including our nation's capital. In September, the Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority (WMATA), which is the second largest mass transit system in the country, issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the new 8000-series metro car. This RFP includes video surveillance, monitoring and diagnostics, data interface with WMATA, and automatic train control systems that are susceptible to cyber-attacks. In response to concerns expressed by a number of lawmakers, including the Vice Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, WMATA re-issued its RFP to include additional cybersecurity protections.17"Most concerning is that whomever is selected to supply railcars for WMATA will become a partner in the day-to-day operations of a Metro system whose stops include the Pentagon and the Capitol, as well as unfettered access to our Nation's tunnels and underground infrastructure. We couple this reality with two additional critical facts. First, a classified report written by WMATA's Inspector General recently concluded that there were significant shortcomings in WMATA's enterprise-level cybersecurity posture.18 Second, the New York Times recently noted that "businesses and government agencies in the United States have been targeted in aggressive attacks by...Chinese hackers..."19 So, in light of China's pervasive history of cyber espionage and hacking, we cannot trust a Chinese SOE to build, own, or operate U.S. critical infrastructure."As troubling as these developments in our transit rail sector are, they are even more alarming because they provide CRRC the opportunity to pivot into freight rail assembly, a subsector of rail not protected by the same Buy America requirements as transit rail, and one that represents a dangerous vulnerability if overtaken by the Government of China. The Chinese government is banking on the fact that once CRRC secures sufficient U.S. municipal transit contracts, it can pivot quickly and inexpensively toward the more strategically important freight rail sector. With 140,000 miles of rail lines across the United States, the North American freight rail system transports five million tons of goods and materials each day. By providing a means for safe, reliable and effective transportation, freight rail keeps our nation's economy thriving while helping to ensure the security of our homeland. Penetrating our freight rail market will allow China to unload much of its current freight car manufacturing capacity oversupply - offsetting its own, slowing domestic market, while continuing its strategy of using exports to sustain its own employment base."CRRC is making steady and deliberate headway into the freight rail sector with the launch of Vertex Rail Corporation and American Railcar Services. Vertex Rail Corporation is now a defunct freight rail assembly facility that was based in Wilmington, North Carolina. On the other hand, American Railcar Services is a separate assembly facility headquartered in Miami, Florida, that maintains assembly operations in Moncton, New Brunswick."Concerns about CRRC's transition into freight rail manufacturing are best illustrated by the recent experiences of third-country markets like Australia, whose freight rail manufacturing sector CRRC entered in 2008. In less than ten years, CRRC effectively decimated the sector, forcing the four domestic suppliers out of business and out of the rail market which left only CRRC standing. Today, almost no meaningful Australian passenger or freight rolling stock manufacturing exists - CRRC's Australia footprint is almost exclusively that of an assembler of Chinese-made parts and a financier of purchases from CRRC. That cannot happen here.National Security Implications"As stated earlier in my testimony, the threat of Chinese dominance of our freight and transit rail sectors is more than just a market concern. The Department of Defense (DoD) has a longstanding reliance on freight rail in the United States. Unlike the U.S. maritime shipping industry, whose security is protected by the Jones Act, a measure that requires vessels transporting goods between U.S. ports to be U.S.-built and majority U.S.-owned, freight rail in America has been left comparatively unprotected. Yet, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) deems the U.S. rail sector as part of the nation's critical infrastructure,20 noting that 140,000 rail miles enable U.S. freight rail to run through every major American city and every military base in the nation. Most of the military's heavy and tracked vehicles are transported by freight rail meaning that freight rail runs through every military base in the United States.21 The DOD's Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC) has designated nearly 40,000 miles of freight rail track as being uniquely important to our Nation's defense, and thus part of the Strategic Rail Corridor Network, or "STRACNET." STRACNET serves 193 U.S. defense installations, connecting military bases with maritime ports of embarkation and other key points across the country. Because of the deep reliance of our military on U.S. commercial rail, MTMC monitors and evaluates data on railroad industry construction, industry mergers, bankruptcies and other similar events to determine how they may affect DoD's mobility and readiness capabilities."Freight rail is also core to the U. S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), DoD's global defense transportation system, coordinating people and transportation assets around the world. The Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC), a component of TRANSCOM, operates 10,000 containers and some 1,350 rail cars to deliver equipment and supplies for deployed members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard. SDCC also leverages commercial freight rail to provide important components of DoD's surface transportation requirements.22 SDCC uses a fleet of 1,850 specially designed heavy-duty flatcars managed by a company owned by the major freight railroads."The specter of Chinese dominance over our freight rail system presents a myriad of national security concerns. The implications of U.S. industry and military interests being forced to rely on Chinese government-manufactured railcars are jarringly self-evident: Chinese penetration of the rail system's cyber-structure would provide early and reliable warning of U.S. military mobilization and logistical preparations for conflict. Were the Chinese to gain access to advanced U.S. freight car technology (notably specific rolling stock asset health, waybill commodity information on loaded freight cars, or precise GPS train location) the potential exists for the generation of a false negative (or positive) sensor activation - something particularly worrisome given that freight rail transports most of our t nuclear waste and hazardous material. A false sensor reading (e.g. tank car outlet dome cover is secure) could lead to a false level of confidence that tank car service valves are secure. If service valves are disturbed and that disturbance is undetected, a release of toxic chemicals could have catastrophic consequences and cost American lives. Moreover, Chinese intelligence about U.S. rail freight logistical movements could provide China with a destabilizing economic competitive edge. Last and certainly not least, Chinese access to U.S. freight rail would also mean that the risk of malicious intrusions into our rail infrastructure, including those carried out by terrorists, would become more difficult for U.S. operators to detect or counter."Predatory Chinese efforts to penetrate our freight rail market also create the potential for disruption to the most advanced technologies upon which our rail system depends for safety and efficiency. Commercial railroads are, of course, aware of the risks they face from potential cyber-security incursions and are investing in cybersecurity capabilities. Even so, we significantly increase the risk of Chinese cyber-espionage or even cyber-terrorism by allowing CRRC to displace U.S. rail interests and shift our freight rail supply reliance to the Government of China. If allowed to penetrate the U.S. freight rail system, Chinese government-backed entities could simply vacuum data from individuals and firms connected to the rail network."China's history of cyberattacks on U.S. interests, combined with the Chinese Government's known efforts to use facial recognition and artificial intelligence for tracking its own citizens through "a vast and unprecedented national surveillance system" make this security risk all the more acute.23"As noted in my 2018 report on the vulnerabilities of freight rail,24 our rail system's rapidly expanding IoT capabilities present an array of national security challenges that include:* Digitized railroad network/IoT: Integrated teams of data scientists, software developers, and engineers develop and apply technology across every aspect of the nationwide freight rail network, effectively increasing the vulnerability of industrial control systems, train operations, and perhaps even the industry's metadata warehousing centers to cyber threats.* Rail Signaling: Congress has mandated the installation of positive train control (PTC) systems on much of the nation's rail systems as a means of preventing specific accidents. A malicious cyber breach of PTC or underlying existing rail signaling systems could wreak havoc and cause accidents or derailments on the highly interdependent freight railway network.* Locomotives: Rail locomotives rely upon hundreds of sensors to monitor asset health and performance of train systems.* Onboard Freight Car Location &#38; Asset Health Monitoring: Thousands of freight cars are equipped with telematics or remote monitoring equipment, many of which are carrying hazardous materials like chlorine, anhydrous ammonia, ethylene oxide, and flammable liquids. This tracking technology includes a wireless communication management unit to track precise near-real time location via GPS, direction of travel, speed, and dwell time within the Transportation Security Administration (TSA)'s 45 designated high-threat urban areas (HTUAs).25* End-of-Train Telemetry (EOT): The FRA requires all freight trains operating on excess of 30 mph to be equipped with a 2-way EOT device that tracks GPS location and can allow a locomotive engineer to initiate an emergency brake application, a critical safety feature for trains that can stretch upwards of 10,000 feet long."The presence of these evolving technologies underscores the clear danger of a foreign country, and particularly the Government of China and its SOEs, having unfettered control of freight manufacturing in the U.S. market. Already, there are reports of Chinese manufacturers investigating the production of their own "telematics" technology to allow the monitoring and control of their rail cars.26"We depend on technology, machinery and a robust system of intellectual property protections to support our national security; when we allow foreign states to interfere - especially our strategic competitors - we risk that security. While Congress has recognized and taken steps to address similar threats to products such as computer chips and cellular technology, it is equally important that policymakers enact legislation directed to stop immediately the scope and impact of China's ongoing incursion into an increasingly digitized rail network.Mitigation"Chinese intrusion into the U.S. rail system's supply chain threatens the health and sustainability of this vital economic pillar, especially in a national emergency. Were China to gain inroads into those operations, management, and supply chains, the ability of U.S. to effectively utilize and leverage the freight rail network in a crisis could be crippled. Moreover, the extensive telematics and digitization of the American rail network, while integrating the most modern technology, also exposes the system and those who use it to a wide array of cyber risks."In other U.S. economic sectors where Chinese SOEs have engaged aggressively, the U.S. Government has responded with targeted restrictions to mitigate clear security risks. Such measures have included a reported U.S. government ban on the purchase of Chinese drones27 and the removal of Chinese-made security cameras from U.S. military bases.28 In April 2018, DoD reportedly also banned Huawei and ZTE cell phones from sale in U.S. military exchanges world-wide.29 We have yet to do the same to protect Chinese incursions into the U.S. freight rail manufacturing base."While there is no single solution that will mitigate the concerns and risks described in my testimony today, I suggest that we must modernize our national policies to reflect these security risks. It is difficult to overstate the potential impact on our national security and our economic future if we do not take a comprehensive and long-range approach to CRRC specifically, and SOEs generally."Considering these security risks, both chambers of Congress last year attempted to pass a ban on federal funding going to CRRC through the appropriations process. This year 30 Senators have so far signed onto legislation that would place a permanent ban on Federal funding going to CRRC and the House just recently introduced a bill as well. I would urge members of this Committee to join their colleagues in co-sponsoring the Transit Infrastructure Vehicle Security Act. Congress also passed legislation last year that would mandate DHS, in coordination with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and the Department of Transportation, to produce a report on the national security threats of Chinese SOE investment in our rolling stock manufacturing sector.30"It is now time for our Nation's leaders to put an end to CRRC's infiltration of the U.S. rail manufacturing industry by developing comprehensive restrictions to ensure the integrity of our Nation's transportation systems. In that vein, I recommend that Congress and the Administration giver serious and immediate consideration to:* Developing comprehensive restrictions and additional reviews on investments from SOEs in critical infrastructure integral to our national defense.* Ensuring that appropriate federal agencies, in coordination with states and localities, develop robust standards for cyber and data integrity applicable to any rail or transit sector contracts involving foreign state-owned entities.* Strengthening oversight of Buy America laws to ensure that existing laws and regulations are adhered to in Federally-funded transit and rail procurements including railcar manufacturing, and explore new avenues to further protect the manufacturing capabilities of freight rail and other core domestic industries that are integral to support and maintain our defense industrial base.Conclusion"We need urgent action to safeguard our U.S. rail system's health and integrity. Chinese control of our rail system's supply chains, much less control of the system through cyber-intrusion or outright firm ownership, threatens this vital national security asset. The strategic targeting of our Nation's infrastructure by the Government of China and its state-owned enterprises poses a fundamental threat to the fabric of our critical infrastructure and is a pressure point for malicious cyber actors to threaten not only the economic and national security of the United States, but to our standing as a global power."We greatly appreciate the Committee's interest in addressing these critical issues. We must take action to safeguard our U.S. rail system's health and integrity before we lose it. We owe it to the American people to ensure that the American freight rail sector continues to be a vibrant and secure element of our Nation's infrastructure, keeping us safe and carrying our economy into the future."Thank you again for the opportunity to testify. I look forward to answering your questions."* * *Footnotes:1 Rhodium Group, China Investment Monitor: Capturing Chinese Foreign Investment Data in Real Time. https://rhg.com/impact/china-investment-monitor/2 U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2016 Report to Congress, November 2016, at 100.3 Langi Chiang, China's largest train maker CRRC Corp announces 12.2 billion yuan in contracts, South China Morning Report, July 23, 2015. https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/1842983/chinas-largest-train-maker-crrc-corp-announces-122-billion-yuan4 CRRC Corporation, 2015 CRRC Annual Report, https://www.crrcgc.cc/Portals/73/Uploads/Files/2016/8-23/636075436968234671.pdf5 Oxford Economics, Will We Derail US Freight Rolling Stock Production?

FCC Commissioner Carr Issues Statement on China Mobile InternationalTargeted News ServiceMay 9, 2019 Thursday 9:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1009 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Federal Communications Commission issued the following statement by Commissioner Brendan Carr:Re: China Mobile International (USA) Inc., Application for Global Facilities-Based and Global Resale International Telecommunications Authority Pursuant to Section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as Amended, ITC-214-20110901-00289"The free market is building the next generation of communications networks in America. Broadband providers have invested $1.6 trillion in connecting households to fast Internet. And wireless carriers are spending more than $30 billion per year to upgrade to 5G."Investors are willing to put that astonishing amount of capital at risk to serve American families because of the open system we have. Our economy is vibrant because people around the globe have confidence that we will uphold the rule of law. We are the top destination for foreign direct investment, attracting $4 trillion--money used to employ our scientists in R&#38;D, our tradesmen in construction, and our farmers in their efforts to feed the world. If you play by the rules here, we welcome your business. That commitment has been at the foundation of our success as a country."And so in telecom, we don't have nationalized networks. The government's role is to encourage all comers to invest, build, and serve Americans--so long as they play by the rules. The government acts as the referee, not the star player. And in this case, it's imperative that we blow the whistle."When a company seeks authorization to integrate itself into our communications networks, our security review must consider at least three questions. First, how much control can a foreign actor exert over the company? Second, what evidence do we have about the foreign actor's desire to exercise that control? And, third, if the foreign actor were to act on its malintent, what's the scope of the threat that the specific authorization poses?"Here, the answer to the first question is clear. The People's Republic of China owns China Mobile. The Chinese government controls its management and can direct its actions. Compounding its control by ownership, the Chinese government can compel access to telecom facilities within China on demand. China's 2017 National Intelligence Law mandates that "[a]ll organizations and citizens . . . support, assist, and cooperate with national intelligence efforts in accordance with law." We understand that this vague dictate places Chinese telecoms and their customers under routine and secret surveillance by the People's Republic of China."Second, we have substantial evidence that the Chinese government intends to surveil persons within our borders, for government security and spying advantage, as well as for intellectual property and a business edge. Just this week, the New York Times reported that hackers working for the Chinese government stole some of our government's most important cybersecurity tools and repurposed them to attack Western allies and businesses. The Chinese reportedly targeted an ally's telecom network, and when the tools were later transferred to North Korea and Russia, those governments crippled British hospitals and shipping companies. They even shut down a Ukranian airport, its postal service, gas stations, and ATMs. There is little doubt that the Chinese government would value additional direct access to our telecom networks for reasons contrary to our security interests."Third, we must assess the scope of the U.S. authorization at issue. In this case, the Chinese government, through China Mobile, proposes to carry traffic from our shores to international destinations. The purported business plan is to provide low-cost calls between the U.S. and China. At first blush, this looks like a narrow authorization. Interconnection is not integration, and, in any case, we may assume some security risk whenever traffic goes abroad. This reasoning might be dispositive if interconnection were that simple. But due to least-cost routing, a customer may not be able to choose which company carries the traffic. And once on a particular carrier, the traffic can follow a path of the carrier's choosing. This is what security researchers discovered in November, when Internet traffic originating in Los Angeles and destined for Washington, D.C. was sent on a detour through Hangzhou, China. The Chinese government owns the company that directed the traffic along the puzzling LA-Hangzhou-D.C. route."So the evidence in this case is clear. After a multi-year inquiry spanning two administrations, the Executive Branch agencies recommended that the FCC deny China Mobile's application due to national security and law enforcement concerns--the first such recommendation, ever. The record here supports that outcome."In fact, the evidence suggests that we should go even further. The Chinese government owns a number of other carriers that already are operating in the U.S., including China Unicom and China Telecom. Those companies hold the same Section 214 authorizations that China Mobile sought. The evidence I've seen in this case calls those existing authorizations into question. For instance, the decision today cites reports that China Telecom has been hijacking U.S. traffic and redirecting it through China."So it's time for the U.S. to take additional action. Our national security agencies should examine whether the FCC should revoke those existing Section 214 authorizations, and the FCC should open a proceeding on those matters. Security threats have evolved over the many years since those companies were granted interconnection rights to U.S. networks in the early 2000s. Much if not all of the reasoning behind today's decision appears to apply with equal or greater force to those legacy authorizations. Let's ensure that our decisions from decades past don't inadvertently endanger American interests."I thank the International Bureau for its work on this item. And I thank Team Telecom for its input. The item has my support."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6724313 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: May 10, 2019End of Document

Faculty question moratorium on Huawei research funding as U.S.-China tensions intensifyThe Stanford Daily: Stanford UniversityMay 28, 2019 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 4511 wordsBodyThis article is the first in a series examining how rising U.S.-China tensions are affecting the Stanford community.In 2007, Stanford considered whether it should ban research funding from tobacco companies. Proponents of the ban argued the tobacco industry manipulated the research they sponsored to push a habit that killed millions.Debate over the proposed ban consumed the Faculty Senate, with each speaker allowed just one minute to sum up an opinion in the lead up to the vote. Passionate arguments on both sides highlighted an intense conflict over how moral judgments should influence academic research. In the end, the Faculty Senate voted 21 to 10 against a ban."There are a few things we protect above all else at this University and those include academic freedom and freedom of expression," then-Stanford president John Hennessy said afterward. "The minute you infringe upon those, you can run into trouble."In December 2018, Stanford placed a moratorium on new research support from the Chinese telecoms company Huawei, amid rising U.S. pressure on a firm the government sees as part of a broader national security threat from China. This time, however, no discussion or vote in the Faculty Senate preceded Stanford's decision. The policy was implemented so quietly that some faculty only learned about it after asking why their funds were frozen.A formal announcement to all affected faculty did not come until Feb. 1."We made the decision out of an abundance of caution," Dean of Research Kathryn Moler wrote in the email to those with funding at stake. "We are aware of nothing inappropriate arising from past support that Huawei has provided to Stanford."Administrators' communication has left faculty confused about the University's decision-making and questioning the policy's wisdom, even as peer schools from the University of California, Berkeley to Princeton enact similar restrictions - and as the Trump administration urges organizations in the U.S. and allies abroad to cut ties. At the time of the ban, Huawei supported millions of dollars worth of research at Stanford and was poised to support millions more. Much of the current funding goes to graduate students through various industrial affiliates programs that will have to kick Huawei out if the moratorium continues.In January the U.S. government indicted Huawei - the world's top manufacturer of telecommunications equipment and second-biggest producer of smartphones - with bank fraud, theft of trade secrets and violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran. The concern with the company, however, is much more expansive: federal officials consider Huawei a potential conduit to the Chinese state, because the company produces equipment that could dominate in the race for next-generation wireless technology and also facilitate spying by Beijing.Earlier this month, the Trump administration forbade Huawei from using American technology without the government's consent, a serious blow for a company whose products rely on partners like Google and Qualcomm. The administration also barred domestic telecommunications firms from installing foreign-made equipment "posing an unacceptable risk."Publicly, there's been little sign at Stanford of backlash against the moratorium. But behind the scenes, faculty have been organizing objections. They have even created a "moratorium" mailing list to keep people up to date.Professors pushing back on the new policy argue that worries around issues like intellectual property theft are moot, as gifts affected by the policy support broadly published, non-classified research. Regardless of the threat the government sees, these faculty also view the moratorium as a test case for Stanford's commitment to academic freedom."It is true that there is one odd policy about one company at this moment, but in this context, it's hard to read it that way," said psychology professor Brian Wandell, who lost funding due to the moratorium and also sat on the Faculty Senate's research committee during the debate over tobacco money. "It's much easier to see it as, we're part of a thing that's going on that could be transformational."Administrators, meanwhile, remain tight-lipped about the reasoning behind instituting the moratorium, saying only that the decision was based on public information. They emphasize the University's desire to balance bipartisan concerns about "undue foreign interference" with support for international collaboration."No one has pressured the university," Dean of Research Kathryn Moler wrote in an email to The Daily. "We are committed to the advancement of knowledge and the international exchange of people and ideas, and we also are attentive to concerns about potential risks associated with particular engagements."Like most U.S. universities, Stanford gets the majority of its research funding from the federal government - far more than what Huawei or any other Chinese entity offers. Jeopardizing Stanford's relationship with an administration increasingly worried about technology transfer to China could thus have far-reaching implications, revealing the tenuous balance the University must strike between upholding international engagement and remaining sensitive to national security concerns.'An abundance of caution'Just before Stanford put the moratorium in place, Huawei was considering quadrupling its gift to a University research group called the Platform Lab, upping it to $2 million a year.The lab, whose website lists nearly a dozen faculty and more than 40 Ph.D. students, is developing three platforms to enable what the lab calls "Big Control." The lab imagines a world where Big Control allows us to oversee the morning commute of a million self driving cars or coordinate 10,000 drones delivering packages.The project's ominous-sounding name evokes many China critics' worst fears about academia aiding an authoritarian government, especially given China's reputation for repressing its citizens through omnipresent technology. A November update to the U.S. Trade Representative's 301 report, prepared annually to identify trade barriers to U.S. companies, accused the Chinese government of investing in high-technology U.S. startups through state-backed venture capital firms, with the goal of acquiring emerging technologies in robotics, artificial intelligence, biotechnology and other fields.But computer science professor John Ousterhout, who directs the Platform Lab, believes that Huawei's contributions to his research do not pose a national security threat, and that it's the government's job - not Stanford's - to prosecute companies that break the law."So what if they have been conspiring with the Chinese government?" he said of Huawei. "What does that have to do with our research program?"Huawei's January indictment claims the company has showed blatant disregard for intellectual property protections, giving bonuses to employees who steal competitors' secrets and even taking part of a T-Mobile robot to learn how it worked.Huawei has denied wrongdoing. Shortly after the U.S. placed sweeping new penalties on the company, a Huawei spokesperson told The Daily that "it has been a very challenging week" but did not give further comment.Spying concerns stem from the lack of true separation between the public and private sectors in China. Chinese laws state that Chinese individuals and organizations must cooperate with government intelligence operations upon request, though Beijing maintains that Huawei is not obliged to aid intelligence gathering in its business overseas."You just don't know how modern China works if you think that any private company in China can resist the demands of the Communist Party state for whatever - to share data, to share their technology [or] to share their knowledge of how the U.S. system works," said Larry Diamond, a political science professor at Stanford who has called for vigilance against the Chinese government's attempts to influence U.S. institutions, including universities.Though Huawei officials have stepped up efforts in recent months to prove their autonomy from the Chinese Communist Party, critics are unconvinced. Given that Huawei is not a publicly listed company, it is not subject to the scrutiny that would allow outsiders to evaluate company claims that, for example, it is owned entirely by its employees.The U.S. is especially fearful of the Chinese government having access to the "5G" networking infrastructure that Huawei is building around the world. Huawei has pulled ahead of other companies in the race for technology that promises to not just boost data speeds but allow all sorts of devices to talk to each other in new ways."5G will be, simply put, the central nervous system of the 21st-century economy," an April article in Foreign Policy asserts. "And if Huawei continues its rise, then Beijing, not Washington, could be best placed to dominate it."Moler's Feb. 1 email to professors affected by the moratorium gave no reasons for the new rules beyond an "abundance of caution," a phrase that other universities have used to explain new restrictions on Huawei funding. But several professors said that, privately, Moler has explained the decision in more detail. Rationales they said she cited include Huawei's indictments, national security concerns, the fact that other schools have enacted similar restrictions and Stanford's network security, among other considerations.Affected faculty say they have trouble seeing why such concerns would apply to Huawei's funding at Stanford.Huawei's supports the Platform Lab and other researchers at Stanford through gifts, which means the company cannot control how their money is used. The results of Ousterhout and his colleagues' work are published for anyone to see, regardless of whether they've given funding. That's standard at Stanford, which has long prized academic openness and banned classified research during the 1960s at the height of anti-war activism.Research programs like Ousterhout's do offer perks to their industry sponsors. They are opportunities for companies to support work that interests them while building connections with other experts and potential hires. Platform Lab "premium" sponsors receive updates on projects, chat informally with faculty and students, and can send their own researchers to Stanford as visiting scholars.But faculty contend that concerns about companies' access via these research arrangements can be addressed. Earlier last year, for example, the University balked at the idea of Huawei's visiting scholar to the Platform Lab getting access to Stanford's networks. Stanford eventually let the Huawei researcher come but had them access the network as a guest, without a SUNet ID.Electrical engineering professor Andrea Goldsmith, whose research group focuses on 5G, also said that Huawei employees would not gain unique information from their collaboration."Certainly if they're giving me a gift and want to have a discussion about the research that's being funded by that gift I'll have that conversation with them," she said, 'but I would have the exact same conversation with anybody else that wanted to talk to me about my research, or I'd have that same conversation at a conference when I was presenting that research."Many of those conferences count Huawei among their funders. Goldsmith emphasized the benefits of collaboration not just for the telecoms company but for U.S. universities that draw on its expertise."Exchanging ideas with them in 5G, which they're really a technical leader in many ways, is valuable to me as a researcher," she added.Randy Katz, vice chancellor for research at UC Berkeley - which enacted a moratorium like Stanford's on Jan. 30 - has also called such restrictions a "disservice" to U.S. companies and researchers who can learn from Huawei. He told The Daily he held out at first against a funding ban, even as other universities cut ties."As a public university, I felt we needed a principle upon which to limit engagement with any source of funding, and suspicions of public officials was not a sufficient reason," he wrote in an email.Huawei's Jan. 28 indictments changed his mind, Katz said."These suggested seriously improper business practices on the part of [Huawei], and we hold our corporate sponsors to high standards," he wrote, though he said UC Berkeley has not placed a moratorium on other companies due to indictments.Many of the Stanford professors affected by the moratorium remain unconvinced by such logic. How can the University justify cutting ties with just Huawei, they say, when other companies Stanford partners with have acted immorally or illegally?"Should we take research funding from a company that has paid teenagers to allow the company to spy on their online habits so the company could create software more addictive to children?" Ousterhout said. "That would be Facebook. Should we accept money from a company that has been fined billions of dollars from the European Union for what they consider legal violations? That would be Google, possibly Apple. So the question is, where do you draw the line?"The University's traditional solution to this problem is to examine research and funding proposals case-by-case for violations of University policy or export control and information security risks. Administrators cited that approach earlier this year when The Daily asked whether it had reevaluated its relationships with Saudi Arabian government, another major research funder that's drawn scrutiny at some peer schools for its repressive actions and apparent killing of a U.S. journalist.Computer science professor Philip Levis believes each professor should decide for themselves how to weigh concerns that fall outside Stanford's educational mission."I don't think it's fair for the University, or any university, to, when they hire a faculty member, say, one of your jobs is to promote the national security of the United States," he said of the moratorium. "I'm sure there are many faculty from other countries who did not sign up for that."Levis thinks the Huawei issue should have gone to the Faculty Senate, as the debate over tobacco industry funding did back in 2007. His conversations with Moler have "definitely given me some good things to think about," he said, but he still has questions."I don't know all the facts, right," Levis said. "It could very well be that this is the right decision. To me the troubling thing is that I don't really know."Rising government pressure?Some at Stanford wonder if government pressure is behind the moratorium.Wandell and Ousterhout, who met with administrators in January about the policy, both recalled Provost Persis Drell discussing conversations with members of the government that implied federal agencies might cut research funding for Stanford if it did not pull away from Huawei. The meeting also included Moler and Director of Export Compliance Steve Eisner, among others.Wandell in particular remembers Drell saying that someone at the Department of Energy told her the agency would look negatively on universities that took funding from Huawei and was concerned researchers applying for DOE funding might fail to disclose their ties to the company. Given the DOE's clout as a funding agency - it bankrolls most of SLAC National Linear Accelerator Laboratory and gave Stanford an additional $26 million in 2017 - Wandell guesses the thought of the agency's disapproval could be persuasive.During the same meeting, Eisner said it's important for Stanford to be "a good partner" to the government, according to Ousterhout, who kept notes of the conversation. Eisner, though, said that the quote "does not sound like" him."What I tried to convey in the meeting was neither about pressure from the government nor partnering with the government, but rather that when there are concerns about potential risks in the research enterprise, we need to consider those issues seriously," Eisner wrote in an email to The Daily.The DOE did not respond to a request for comment. Beyond Moler's statement that no one has pressured Stanford, Moler and Drell did not address Wandell and Ousterhout's recollections.Though administrators deny government pressure, U.S. officials have stepped up their efforts to communicate the threats they see in Huawei to schools.In July 2018, the F.B.I. and other intelligence agencies briefed Department of Education employees on Huawei. Two months later, the FBI held a "major summit" with university presidents in Washington that covered the issue, according to Tobin Smith, the Vice President of the Association of American Universities, which represents 62 research institutions including Stanford."They're very careful not to say you should or shouldn't deal with this company," Smith told Bloomberg News. "But they help you assess the risk."But the government has also leveraged federal research funding to push universities away from Huawei. Many schools ditched IT equipment from Huawei following government concerns over Chinese spying - and a ban on federal funding for universities that use technology from a host of Chinese companies, part of the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act .The NDAA also calls for universities to work more closely with Department of Defense officials to create new regulations protecting academics from foreign exploitation, potentially limiting universities' research partnerships and other agreements with Chinese groups.In fact, a Department of Defense (DoD) official visited Stanford in March for a discussion focused on the government's concerns about foreign influence in research. The meeting, which Moler said she organized after the official told her it would be helpful to chat with a few faculty, stated in its invitation that "the academic-government relationship is critical to ensuring that the United States remains a Great Power."After the meeting, at attendee Goldsmith's request, the DoD passed on declassified government white papers explaining China's threat to the domestic and world economy. The papers outline everything from hacking-aided theft of trade secrets to "predatory" lending to developing countries. One of the documents, which focuses on university science and technology, states that academics become unintended enablers of a regime that uses tech and data - sometimes with U.S. origins - to track and persecute its critics.The DoD official's talk did not focus on Huawei and "wasn't super enlightening" about the reasons the government would see the company's gift funding as a threat, Goldsmith said. But she said appreciated the chance to convey concerns about openness in research.Ousterhout, who said none of the faculty who have been most vocal about the University's Huawei policy were invited, pointed to the meeting as an example of how moratorium critics have been shut out of University discussions. Moler pushed back on that idea."There wasn't any selection process and there wasn't any intent to exclude anyone," she said.Meanwhile, federal agencies like the National Institutes of Health have increasingly expressed concerns that scientists may not be disclosing all their foreign ties when applying for research grants. These agencies are wary of funding research for scholars who they believe may share work with foreign groups and governments.Levis said Moler told him in a meeting that worries about the University's ability to track gifts fed into the moratorium decision. Gifts are monitored less carefully than sponsored research agreements, as they do not involve a contract, Levis said. He said he's received emails to the computer science faculty list noting that a gift check has arrived and haphazardly asking for someone to claim it. Moler, however, told The Daily that the University tracks all gifts.Levis understands why the University would be anxious to keep tabs on money from groups flagged by the government, like Huawei."The concern is that faculty - we're tired, we're overextended, we make mistakes, nobody's perfect," Levis said, adding that researchers may not be aware of all the groups that back programs they belong to at Stanford. "[Say] Huawei gave some money to [an institute], somebody didn't realize, they don't put it on the form, and the government gets really upset."While many faculty suspect Stanford's moratorium is rooted in government concerns, they remain frustrated with the administration's lack of transparency."To understand the decision, understand the reason it was made...that's something that many universities are grappling with right now," said Joyce Farrell, who leads the Stanford Center for Image System Engineering . "Is this coming from pressure from the Trump administration? The Defense Department? Is this a trade policy issue? When it's basically based on what seems to be the press or rumors, it's very difficult not to be cynical and suspicious.""The idea that, out of an abundance of caution, we shouldn't engage with the people who are the best in the world - because of reasons I don't know, because they're being kept secret - is just weird from my point of view and a slippery slope," Wandell said.Faculty await committee inputOn Feb. 10, Moler and other top administrators received a letter signed by about 20 affected professors. The letter urged Stanford to evaluate funding on a case-by-case basis and have a committee with a range of expertises develop general policies that can be applied to cases like Huawei. Wandell and Ousterhout also presented concerns at a March meeting of the Faculty Senate's committee on research.Provost Drell announced at the Faculty Senate's May 9 meeting that two new committees will review the University's policies around federal concerns of foreign influence on research universities. One committee will report to the Dean of Research about a broad review of Stanford's policies on issues like researcher disclosures and international funding and visitors. Meanwhile, a subcommittee of the Faculty Senate will consider "how to balance Stanford's values and non-discrimination in research agreements with concerns about foreign influence," as Drell put it.Both groups' discussions will cover countries like China and Saudi Arabia, Moler wrote to The Daily. But their work will be "broader in nature, addressing our policies related to all foreign research engagements," she said.Professors upset by the moratorium see the committees as a step forward and have urged administrators to fast-track a final decision. But they're still troubled that University leaders would take such an unusual policy step without first opening the issue to faculty discussion.Moler only told the Faculty Senate's committee on research about the decision after it had been made, with approval from the President and Provost. According to Moler, there was a "brief discussion" of Huawei at the committee's Jan. 24 meeting as Stanford considered whether to continue the funding pause. Administrators also met and communicated with a number of faculty shortly after.Moler told The Daily that the University consulted with the School of Engineering and notified "lead faculty" for gifts put on hold in December, when the moratorium was put in place. But emails reviewed by The Daily show that some leaders of affected affiliate programs and faculty whose funds were frozen were just learning about the policy in late January.Moler also said that she asked the School of Engineering to reach out to each affected faculty member and summarize issues the moratorium created for them. But multiple professors told The Daily they have not been contacted.While faculty wait for the new committees to weigh in, the moratorium has blocked significant funding meant to support graduate students and postdocs. Professors The Daily talked to said they will continue supporting their current students, but many are still figuring out how they will make up the difference. They estimated the cost of supporting a graduate student at $75,000 to $100,000 a year."Faculty often move their group members from one source of funding to another in response to changing levels of external support," Moler wrote to The Daily. "Although the loss of funding is a disappointment, I'm not aware of any students who do not have funding as a result of the Huawei decision."For some students, the loss of funding meant scrambling to find summer internships in lieu of research projects. Others will take on additional teaching duties. Professors said they may dip into unrestricted research money they've saved up.Administrators have told faculty that, if needed, they can approach their departments or deans for money to close gaps. But professors are skeptical this will work, especially as a poor endowment payout squeezes budgets."With this low payout and all the budgets being busted and stuff, basically I'm on my own here," Wandell said.Wandell chose not to take on several graduate students as a result of the moratorium. Other faculty who relied on Huawei money are also holding back on new hires.About half of Goldsmith's research group was funded by Huawei when the moratorium went into effect. She's not sure where replacement money will come from: The main funders Goldsmith has encountered for her 5G research are Huawei and the federal government, and she hasn't seen the latter offering more funding to compensate for universities' breaks with Huawei.Gift money like Huawei's is precious, she said, because it's unrestricted - in contrast to government grants, it doesn't come with conditions on its use. It's also subject to lower "overhead" fees from the University than federal grants, meaning more money goes to the researcher.Beyond funding difficulties, some professors worry that the moratorium has exacerbated feelings among Chinese students that the University is not combating increasing government hostility toward China and the Chinese community - despite Stanford leaders' statements that national security concerns must not feed discrimination by heritage or country of origin."I think it's very difficult to explain this [decision] to Chinese students in a way that doesn't make it seem as if they're being discriminated because they're Chinese," said Farrell. "It's really extrapolated from much farther beyond just Huawei."Farrell recounted an incident in which one student did not want to contact Huawei engineers inquiring about an open-source software he was developing. His work was not supported by the company. The student did not even want to respond to a request from a Huawei employee due to fear that his email messages were being monitored and could affect his visa status."I don't think he was wrong to be worried," Farrell said."They're worried about what projects they work on," she said. "They're worried about their visa of applications... We don't have an explanation to the graduate students to say, this is why Stanford made this decision."Contact Berber Jin at fjin16 'at' stanford.edu and Hannah Knowles at hknowles 'at' stanford.edu.Load-Date: May 28, 2019End of Document

Senate Judiciary Committee Issues Testimony From Center for Strategic &#38; International StudiesTargeted News ServiceMay 14, 2019 Tuesday 9:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4931 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Judiciary Committee issued the following testimony by James Andrew Lewis, senior vice president and director of the Technology and Public Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, at a hearing entitled "5G: National Security Concerns, Intellectual Property Issues, and the Impact on Competition and Innovation":"This goes well beyond 5G, although 5G is the focal point. 5G networks will shape the digital economy - this is why there is such intense competition. The United States can manage 5G risk with two sets of policies. The first is to ensure that American companies can continue to innovate and produce advanced technologies and face fair competition overseas. The second is to work with like-minded nations to develop common approaches to 5G security."Telecom is a strategic industry and a reliance on Chinese companies creates risk for the United States and its allies. A secure supply chain for 5G closes off dangerous areas of risk for national security in terms of espionage and the potential disruption of critical services. China's coercive behavior and aggressive global campaign of cyber espionage makes it certain that it will exploit the opportunities it gains as a 5G supplier."How did we get here? America and other Western countries assumed China would be a friend and would evolve to become a market economy, and perhaps even somewhat democratic. For a time, this seemed to be the direction China was taking. In that period, American and Western companies were eager to do business in a fast-growing market with low labor costs. Money and technology poured into China, and what technology China was not given or could buy, it would steal. Companies knew that there were risks, but they thought these risks were manageable. China was for the first few decades of its growth, still a poor country, still developing and this encouraged an underestimation of risk."How should we portray the struggle with China? It is easy for the U.S. to look backwards and dredge up Cold War terms and concepts that are inappropriate for a new kind of conflict in a new century - we do not need another Solarium Commission, this is not an arms race, nor in fact, is it a Cold War. What we discuss in Washington is too often like ancestor worship rather than strategy. The chief similarity between the Cold War and the conflict with China is that it is a battle for global influence where both China and the U.S. have advantages and disadvantages. China's greatest advantage is that it is willing to spend money while the U.S. is not. China's political system is not particularly attractive and Han nationalism limits China's influence, but many countries will, in the near term, want to work with China."China was allowed into the World Trade Organization (WTO), opening global markets to its industries, but the preparatory agreement between the U.S. and China did not require any Chinese commitment on protection of intellectual property (IP). This was an immense mistake. China did not extend reciprocal treatment to Western companies. China used non-tariff barriers and subsidies contrary to its WTO commitments, and it was not held accountable, perhaps the greatest failing of the WTO and one reason why it is in such disrepute today. Now that it is the second largest economy in the world, the policies the U.S. and others followed in regard to China until a few years ago have come back to haunt us."5G is a problem because neither the U.S. nor other Western nations objected in the WTO to China's mercantilist behavior in telecommunications. Huawei founder and chairman Ren Zhengfei even said, "If there had been no government policy to protect [nationally owned telecom companies], Huawei would no longer exist." Huawei uses predatory pricing enabled by Chinese government subsidies to drive its competitors out of business, it benefits from China's economic espionage (Chinese IP theft was a significant contributor to the demise of Nortel, the Canadian telecommunications company). It has a long record of industrial espionage and IP theft on its own account that began with the company's founding and continues to this day, as evidenced by the many court cases for IP theft it has faced. Huawei's reliance on industrial espionage, its murky ownership, and its long-standing and close ties to the Chinese security services raise serious questions for any country thinking about 5G."There has been a significant change in attitudes over the last few years on the issue of China. Until recently, Western companies and trade associations would usually often demur from any criticism of China or any effort to get it to change its behavior. This is no longer the case. There is a growing consensus in the U.S. and other advanced economies on the risks of doing business with China. The Chinese are puzzled, by the global reaction to government's aggressive mercantilism and disregard for global business norms, to the extent they can read about it in their heavily censored media.5G and Risk"Why is 5G important? First, 5G is more than phones, it is a new kind of network technology that will connect millions of devices and provide unparalleled mobility and capacity. This means that self-driving cars, smart cities, telemedicine and smart factories - a whole range of new activities and devices - can use 5G to provide expanded services at lower costs. 4G, the smart phone revolution, created the "app economy" which in five years has grown from nothing to more than $100 billion, or about five percent of U.S. GDP. 5G will more than duplicate this success and generate hundreds of billions in revenues."Countries hope to duplicate the success of U.S. companies in creating 4G and hope to "capture" 5G so as to reap the economic benefits for themselves. China is not alone in this as European and Asian countries seek to be the first to deploy 5G networks and gain the boost to innovation it will provide. This is a competition over who owns the revenue streams that 5G innovations will produce. Building and deploying 5G networks will create the next wave of global innovation, which is one primary reason for not letting China unfairly dominate this market."There would be no grounds for objection if China competed fairly, but it does not, since it stifles foreign competition in China, fails to provide Western companies with reciprocal treatment, and uses subsidies, espionage, and other illicit techniques to win foreign markets. China has innovative companies, particularly in the internet sector, and while these companies make excellent products, they suffer from a trust issue, snice the social media and messaging services they provide are completely monitored by the Chinese government. A more important problem for China is that these innovative companies were private, not state-owned, and grew up during a period of relative political openness. As the Chinese government adopts more intrusive policies to control company operations and investments, and as the Chinese political space closes, there is a risk that China's ability to innovate will be damaged. One thing to watch if this occurs, is that China will expand its already massive technological espionage campaign to compensate."The illicit acquisition of technology remains central to Chinese espionage. When President Xi Jinping came to power, he reorganized Chinese intelligence tasking and collection priorities. Xi reportedly ordered an accounting of Chinese cyber espionage. Before Xi, a significant proportion of Chinese espionage was "private," used for private gain by PLA units. Under Xi, cyber espionage has been reorganized as part of a larger military modernization effort. Chinese intelligence collection is more focused on strategic priorities, and, some would say, better in performing clandestine missions. This comes at a time when, according to the U.S. Intelligence Community, Chinese spying has reached unprecedent levels. This still focuses on acquiring advanced technologies, since China still relies on Western sources for this."Much of the 5G discussion has focused on supply chain issues and the risk of using Chinese telecom equipment.1 There are three parts to this discussion. First, many technologies use the internet to connect to their manufacturer even after sale for maintenance, updates, and status reports. We are all familiar with how our phones or computers are updated, often without our knowledge. An increasing number of products will remain connected to the manufacturer after sale, allowing both improved services, but also creating new opportunities for malicious actions, particularly when the manufacturer comes from a hostile foreign power."Major telecom "backbone" equipment connects to the manufacturer over a dedicated channel, reporting on equipment status and receiving software updates as needed, usually without the operator's knowledge. Equipment could be sold and installed in perfectly secure condition, and a month later, the manufacture could send a software update to create vulnerabilities or disrupt service. The operator and its customers would have no knowledge of this change."Huawei, for example, with both its 4G network equipment (which is widely used in Europe and Africa) and its new 5G technologies, retains access and control to this equipment. It would be possible for Huawei to send a command to network equipment installed in another country instructing it to disrupt service. The UK, which established a monitoring center to review patches and updates from China to the UK for Huawei equipment, concluded that it could not guarantee that it would detect this kind of command. The risk is increased by China's 2017 national Intelligence Law, which makes it compulsory for all Chinese companies to comply with requests for assistance from the Ministry of State Security - there is no appeal. The 2017 law only codified existing practices and it raises concerns about the use of any Chinese technology which remains connected over the internet to its manufacturer in China."The products of a Chinese company could be completely trustworthy, but a decision by the Chinese government could change overnight. In the context of China's increasingly aggressive global espionage campaign, which relies heavily on both human and cyber espionage, there are reasonable grounds for the distrust of Chinese products. The issue is not whether one trusts the Chinese company, but whether one trust the Chinese government."No major telecommunications service provider wants to find itself dependent on Huawei. Even Chinese telecom companies will say privately that they do not wish to see Huawei dominate the market. Interviews with executives from these companies emphasize the need to preserve supplier diversity. One European executive compared this to the market for commercial aircraft, where Boeing and Airbus must compete against each other. A Huawei-dominated market would mean higher prices and less innovation (since competition drives innovation)."Similarly, providing telecommunications equipment can provide advantages in the collection of communications intelligence. The poster child for this risk is the headquarters building of the African Union, which was built by China using Chinese technology. When the building was still new, its systems administrators noticed something strange. Every night at about 2:00 in the morning, there was a huge outflow of data from computers on the headquarters networks, even though the building was empty. On inspection, it was discovered that this data was going to Shanghai, where Chinese cyber espionage groups are located. The AU example is a warning. The increased risk of coercive disruption or espionage are the primary objections to relying on Chinese 5G technology.A UK Alternative"The Chinese State, led by a single unchallengeable party, is not hesitant about using coercion, including explicit threats to cut trade, against those who oppose it. When Australia banned Huawei from selling 5G, China retaliated by blocking Australia's major exports to China for two weeks. When Canada detained Huawei's CFO at the request of the U.S., the Chinese retaliated by going around and arresting random Canadians in China for imaginary crimes. Those who question whether Huawei has close links to the Chinese government might ask why there was such a pronounced reaction when the CFO was detained. Many countries are afraid to ban Huawei because they fear Chinese retaliation and a few, including the UK and Germany, do not want to put their economic relations with China at risk."One explanation for the recent UK announcement that it would allow Huawei into its 5G infrastructure, under certain limitations, is that senior levels of the British government, alarmed by the possibility of major economic damage from Brexit, hoped to allay this risk by pursuing both expanded trade with China and a free trade agreement with the U.S. The week of the UK announcement, a Ministerial-level British delegation flew to China to negotiate trade deals. Perhaps this was only coincidence, but we should help the UK realize why it will become increasingly difficult to accommodate China while maintaining close security ties with the U.S., and that what its former Prime Minister David Cameron called the "Golden Era" of cooperation with China is over."A complete ban is the only way to eliminate this risk, but a ban appears so far to be politically unacceptable for the UK. The recent UK announcement that it would allow Huawei to supply the "edge" but not the "core" of 5G networks is an effort to mitigate the risk of using Huawei without imposing a complete ban. The UK says it will use four different techniques for 5G risk reduction."First, Huawei technologies will not be allowed in sensitive areas such as around Whitehall. Second, Huawei technologies will be kept from the core but installed in the "Radio Access Network" that connect mobile devices (such as a phone) to the larger telecommunicate system (cell towers and base stations are visible examples of the RAN). There is some doubt that this architectural solution will actually work. Finally, the UK would develop security standards for telecommunications equipment that would emphasize trusted suppliers and demonstrably trustworthy equipment (and internal reviews by GCHQ found Huawei to be the most "buggy" telecom gear). While there are strong objections to this partial ban, it is attractive to many European countries, including Germany, as it avoids a direct confrontation with China. Other countries are considering a similar approach."A simplified portrayal of the UK "architectural" solution would divide 5G networks into four parts that range from the edge to the core of the network and the network "cloud." At the edge there are the devices, such as mobile phones or cars. These connect over a "Radio Access Network" (RAN), cell towers with some computing capability. The RAN connects user devices to the core network. The core uses specialized routers, switches, and other packet handling technologies to aggregate and manage billions of calls. Service providers are also moving towards using "software defined networks" (SDN) where much of the core processing is in the cloud. Both RAN and core connect back to the manufacturer, who has the ability to monitor traffic and manipulate software."The fundamental question is whether there is a meaningful distinction between core and edge that can address security concerns. The UK proposal would allow Huawei to provide RAN but not core technologies. Access to the core delivers intelligence advantages (by providing access to bulk traffic), and some argue that access to the RAN, which uses its computing power to manage traffic in bulk, also provides an intelligence advantage. To further complicate the picture, initial deployments of 5G in many countries will be layered over existing 4G network infrastructures, whose technologies have often been provided by Huawei (as is the case in the UK and Germany).China's 5G Push"Huawei seeks not only to supply the full range of technologies - edge devices, RAN, core infrastructures - but to dominate the standards processes for 5G. Chinese IT companies, helped by government subsidies, attempt to dominate global standards bodies. Representatives from China's State-Owned Enterprises or other companies that receive government backing (like Huawei) now seek to shape the agenda and outcomes in standards groups for 5G and the Internet of Things."China is politicizing the international standards process. Anecdotal reports from attendees at international standards meetings tell of greatly expanded Chinese participation. In looking at the membership of 3GPP, the 5G standards umbrella organization, the U.S. and China are tied for leadership when we look at the number of member companies and associations. Chinese companies must vote the party line, which is to support Chinese proposals even if they are technologically inferior. Last summer, the Chairman of Lenovo was forced to apologize publicly and promise never to vote again for a non-Chinese standard after Lenovo representatives voted in favor of a technologically superior American proposal instead of a Chinese proposal. This is not how the standards process is supposed to work, but China will flout norms to gain dominance. China was unable to dominate the first round of 5G standards discussions, but it will be back in force for further rounds. The U.S must find ways to work with Western partners to ensure the standard process remains politically neutral and that American companies are not underrepresented."If China wins the standards battle, it would also help ensure Huawei's dominance. Huawei also uses predatory pricing to drive competitors from the market. A European telecommunications executive said in an interview that Huawei offered a ninety percent discount over the market price in a recent competition and was "desperate" to get in the telecommunications "core" of his countries networks. Large discounts have been offered to Indian telecommunications firms (sometimes in the form of no-cost or low-cost loans) and an unpublished study by a European government found that Huawei routinely offered discounts of twenty to thirty percent over competitors' prices. Huawei can afford these discounts because of financial support from the Chinese government and this support is prompted by both mercantilist and intelligence motives. The effect has been to drive Western telecommunications firms from the business."For telecommunications systems, there remain only five major producers. In order of market share, they are Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia, ZTE and Samsung. There are no American producers as the last, Lucent, went out of business more than a decade ago. However, U.S. component manufacturers dominate the 5G market, particularly for semiconductors. None of the five major suppliers could make 5G network equipment without Intel, Qualcomm, Xilinx and Cisco equipment. American technology remains essential for 5G mobile telecommunications. A Huawei executive, for example, has stated that only 30% of Huawei equipment uses Chinese technology. American companies have been strong performers in developing 5G technologies, but the United States and its allies face a fundamental challenge from China. The focus of competition is over 5G's intellectual property, standards, and patents."China is of course racing to end its dependence on the U.S. and will invest more than $100 billion over the next five years to build its own semiconductor industry, but for now and for the foreseeable future, it relies on U.S. technology. It is crucial that the U.S. develop supportive policies for research, education, and intellectual property protection to support its semiconductor industry, and push back against foreign efforts to use anti-trust or patent laws to hobble U.S. competition."It's worth noting that while the U.S. is the unique supplier of the most advanced technologies necessary for 5G, many subcomponents come from Chinese firms. The positive expectations for China as an economic partner mean that there is a deeply intertwined global supply chain, with American, European and Japanese companies manufacturing in China, Chinese companies relying on US. technology, and U.S and European technology that may itself incorporate Japanese or Chinese components. Nor does every Chinese company create risk. This depends on what they make and whether their product connects back to China. It would be very difficult - and perhaps impossible - to bifurcate the global supply chain into "Chinese" and "Western." This complex, interconnected supply chain is a source of risk - the Chinese worry about it as well - and we need to develop policies and techniques other than a radical split to manage this risk."Another set of objections to using Chinese technology for 5G relates to competitiveness and innovation. By reducing the market share of Western companies, unfair Chinese 5G competition also reduces the ability of these firms to fund research and development (R&#38;D) by reducing their revenue shares. Success in deploying 5G depends not just on supply chain security, but on the ability to innovate, to build the new "apps" that will take advantage of 5Gs potential. This is part of a broader technological competition. Technology and the capacity to create new technologies are the basis of information age power. 5G is the most salient example of a new kind of competition for global influence, along with other technologies like artificial intelligence or quantum computing, that will help determine a nation's economic competitiveness and military capability.Next Steps for the U.S."The United States is well-positioned to lead in 5G, but success and security require action by the Federal government. The United States does not need to copy China's government-centric model, but it does need to reorient its regulations, laws, and policies to compete in the 21st century. This requires a comprehensive strategy for managing risk with the next generation of network technologies. The elements of a strategy should include:1. Closer intelligence, technology, and security partnerships with the countries that share the assessment of the risk of using Chinese network technologies and agree on the need to address it. The foundation for this partnership is the Five Eyes and the Nordic countries, Japan, and other nations in Europe and Asia that share our concerns.2. Robust security standards for telecommunications equipment and supply chains (noting that some European customers of Huawei may try to dilute standards to ensure that Huawei has continued access to their markets). The Prague Principles and the draft principles releases by Germany's Federal Network Agency offer good starting points for this.3. Foreign assistance funding to encourage developing countries not to buy Chinese 5G technology. We will not match Chinese subsidies, but we can reduce the financial burden of excluding Huawei.4. Support for Western telecom infrastructure companies for research and development. This could involve the use of Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA) to subsidize R&#38;D. This is a politically sensitive suggestion and support for foreign R&#38;D should be accompanied by support for US research into the secure use of 5G and on the next generation of telecommunications equipment. The goal should be to preserve diversity in telecommunications technology suppliers so that we do not find ourselves dependent solely on suppliers in a hostile country.5. Research on how to securely communicate over international networks that contain Huawei equipment, since many European, African and Middle Eastern companies already use Huawei and will adopt its 5G technologies.6. A Federal strategy on telecom supply chain security that lays out U.S. policy, accompanied by significant investment in research and formal bans (either complete or partial) on the purchase and use of Huawei technology.7. A reorientation of domestic policies to emphasize technological competitiveness. The U.S. no longer has the luxury of being unchallenged and the laissez-faire approach of the first two decades after the Cold War are no longer sustainable. This means not only expanding Federal support for research but looking at intellectual property law, anti-trust, taxation, and infrastructure investment to build technological and economic strength.8. A long-term engagement strategy with China to bring its behavior into conformity with international norms for trade and security. China is not going away. It will always be powerful and the United States, working with its partners, must encourage and require change."The United States cannot meet the 5G challenge on its own. When the United States successfully challenged Chinese policy in the past, it has been done in concert with nations who share our concerns. We may need to rethink partnerships in this new conflict. For example, Hungary, while a NATO member, sees Huawei as a strategic partner and is expanding its cooperation with China and Huawei. In contrast, Sweden, not a NATO member nor a treaty ally, is a strong partner in information age conflict. Many countries will find Huawei's highly subsidized prices attractive and dismiss U.S. concerns. Perhaps this could be one new measure of security partnership: a country that does not understand or ignores the risk of using Chinese 5G equipment should not be a close security partner."The contours of the new global security landscape are still emerging but there are perhaps twenty countries in Europe and Asia who share the U.S. concerns. Many more do not. The battle for influence will be shaped not only by ideas, but by a country's investment decisions. China's overly centralized system should be a disadvantage, but in the near term, the U.S. failure to invest in public goods like basic research and infrastructure, or to spend efficiently in public goods like health care or defense, creates a disadvantage."The U.S. is doing better than many public accounts suggest, but this will be a hard and close-run fight. The recent Prague Summit laid a good foundation for cooperative effort. Among our partners, there is no disagreement on the risk of using Chinese technology. Where there is disagreement is over how to manage this risk and how to implement agreed principles. Domestically, U.S. spectrum management policy has been effective in freeing up spectrum for 5G deployments. We do not need a nationalized 5G network. The U.S., however, faces a problem that China does not have in its plethora of state and local regulatory agencies. Beijing does not have to worry about "NIMBY.""We are at the start of a singular moment when computing power, mobile connectivity, and abundant data are restructuring economies. 5G technologies play a major role in this restructuring. The next internet will be a complex, dynamic environment where technological opportunities reshape commerce and markets in unexpected ways. 5G will be a central part of a nexus of new information technologies that will shape the future of the global economy. While the internet was created by the U.S. and has been led by American companies, if 5G leadership goes to China, it creates the opportunity for it to shape the future internet to its own advantage."We are at the start of a long contest with China over whose rules and values will shape the world. This contest is made more complicated by the close economic ties between China and the West. China is a formidable competitor and its leaders are clear in their intentions to displace the U.S., which they see as in decline, and rebuild global rules and institutions to serve China's interests.The Belt-and-Road Initiative is part of this effort."Respect for the rule of law is not, and this is a fundamental difference between the U.S. and China. Most countries would prefer a world ordered along the lines of Western principles, but the institutions created after 1945 are outdated, and polling data shows there is a growing public discontent with democratic governance as it is now structured (evidenced by the increase of populism and nationalist sentiment in many countries). China also has weaknesses, and is more fragile than its propaganda makes appear, but if China is unwilling to compromise and follow international norms, this will be a lengthy and difficult fight."China has developed a competing model for innovation and investment that is well-funded and centrally directed. U.S. technological leadership is no longer undisputed. This is a much more competitive global environment where the U.S. needs to accelerate its efforts in policy and investment choices if it is to preserve its technological strengths and advantages. This is not a race the U.S can afford to ignore. Adopting the right policies and partnerships will play a crucial role. Policies that strengthen our own technology base, build strong cooperation with partners and allies, and maintain supplier diversity in telecommunications will ensure that the U.S. can manage the risk and reap the opportunities new technology will provide."I thank the Committee for the opportunity to testify and look forward to your questions."* * *Footnote:1 CSIS recently released a report on 5G supply chain issues: https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/181206_Lewis_5GPrimer_WEB.pdf[TheHill]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6729306 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: May 15, 2019End of Document

He's Danny DeVito. So, so far, more than 10,000 people have signed this petition. They're trying to reach 15,000 signatures.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: OK.CARRASCO: They say no one else can, of course, replace Hugh Jackman, but - -CASONE: It would be a comedy if Danny DeVito played Wolverine, right?CARRASCO: Maybe it's his stature, I don't know.CASONE: God, that is so random. All right, Tracee, thank you very much, really interesting.Real quick, we do want to take a look at Futures before we send it over to Maria Bartiromo for MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Really quick, you do have kind of a mixed market, Maria, and as you can see, here we go, Dow, unchanged. MORNINGS WITH MARIA starts right now.MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: All right. Thank you so much, ladies. Good morning. We do watch markets this morning. I'm Maria Bartiromo, happy Wednesday, it is Wednesday, May 22nd, your top stories right now, 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Retail's terrible Tuesday, the sector hit by a round of weak earnings and tariff warnings. Those stocks got crushed. We're taking a look at what's in store for today with Lowe's and Target, among the names reporting this morning.Trade uncertainty, China's ambassador says Beijing is ready for more talks, but it comes as the White House reportedly is ready to expand the black list on Chinese technology firms, perhaps four othersBreaking news this morning, a California judge reportedly, ruling against Qualcomm, saying that the company violated anti-trust law, what it means for the technology giant there, it too, having a tough week, just after recently settling a similar suit from Apple.New Coke, making a comeback, it is all because of a Netflix, and it's a hit show, Stranger Things. We've got that coming up, right here. MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.BARTIROMO: We want to kick it off right here with Lowe's earnings, they are out. It is a mixed report. Let's get to Ashley Webster, he's got the numbers. And it looks like it's a miss on earnings, Ashley.ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, indeed. The retail woes go on, apparently, for another day here, Maria. On the earnings per share for Lowe's, and you can see, it's already down two percent, coming in at $1.22, the estimate was for $1.33, so 0.11-cent miss on the earnings.On revenue, $17.7 billion, that's just about where it was estimated, perhaps a little higher than that. But perhaps more of an impact will be that Lowe's is actually reducing its growth outlook for the rest of the year. In the last quarter, they projected three percent sales growth. Now, it's down to two percent, so that is certainly going to hurt the stock.Same-store sales for Lowe's, up 3-1/2 percent, which was better than the last quarter which was up just a little less than that. But overall, these soft numbers in retail are certainly starting to be a trend and certainly the outlook that guidance has been pulled back a little bit.It doesn't say anything about the Chinese tariffs or anything like that, but of course, we'll listen in on the conference call to see whether they're giving any particular reasons for this, the comp sales, first quarter, 4.2 percent, according to this, which is a little better. But overall, those earnings miss does hurt and the guidance as well, Maria.BARTIROMO: All right. That stock down better than two percent right now. Ashley, we'll get back to you as we see more news in the retail space.Other breaking news right now, a legal setback for Qualcomm, a California judge reportedly ruling that the company violated anti-trust laws, saying that it unlawfully suppressed competition in the markets for cell phone chips, that's according to the Journal this morning.Qualcomm recently settled a similar suit from Apple. The stock is plunging on the news; take a look, down almost 11 percent, right now, on Qualcomm.Futures, meanwhile, broadly speaking, are mixed. It's very much a flat morning as we see here. Dow Futures down 5 points, S&P Futures down 1-1/2, and the NASDAQ down 12, right now, after all three indices finished in the green yesterday, led by technology.Investors liking the news of the potential easing of some trade restrictions against telecom giant, Huawei. This, of course, was a 90-day reprieve that the White House is offering, so that Huawei can settle current business affairs. So, it's just a 90-day reprieve.U.S. and China trade talks largely, on hold, for now. The U.S. will hold a meeting in Paris with Japan and the E.U. tomorrow, to discuss the situation. The Chinese ambassador to the U.S. was on "SPECIAL REPORT" last night on FOX News. He said he's keeping the door open for more talks. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CUI TIANKAI, CHINESE AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES: China remains ready to continue our talks with our American colleagues, to reach a conclusion. Our door is still open. It's quite clear, it is the U.S. side that more than once, changed their mind overnight, and broke the tentative deal already reached.So, we are not -- we are still committing, we are still committed to whatever we agreed to do. But it is the U.S. side that changed its mind so often. We want to meet the growing aspiration of our people, 1.4 billion people, for a better life.That is our only goal. We have no interest, no intention to seek global dominance or to compete with anybody else for global dominance.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: This as the Trump administration is considering putting five additional Chinese surveillance firms on the blacklist. That means they would be banned from using American software.Joining me right now, Ohio Congressman and House Financial Services Committee Member, Anthony Gonzalez, and Congressman, it's good to have you on the program this morning. Thanks very much for joining us. Can you discuss the national security risk around Huawei for us?REP. ANTHONY GONZALEZ (R-OH): Absolutely. So, with Huawei and with ZTE, I think what you're looking at is -- are two companies that if those technologies are here and prevalent in the United States, they could be used to surveil United States people, the American people, just like they're doing in China to their own.And so, I am in full support of what the President and the administration are doing to push back on China, and to make sure that we are keeping those technologies away from us, so long as we can't secure them.BARTIROMO: Well, initially, the Chinese had agreed to codify into law that I.P. theft was against the law, against Chinese law, and the forced transfer of technology as well, but then they reneged on everything and changed the fundamental issues of that deal.So, whether it's espionage or theft of I.P., how are you really going to change a culture, in China, to get a deal done?GONZALEZ: Well, I think that gets into, you know -- how do we verify the terms of the deal once the deal is struck. So, I'm in full agreement with you, just because it's on a piece of paper, and even if they sign the document, I'm not fully confident that they'll comply with it.So, it needs to be a trust but verify, sort of, system. And I know that the administration is well-aware of that. They've been working on this for a very long time. And I'm excited to see the progress that China did back out. They did change the terms of the deal. But that's not good enough. And I applaud the administration for walking away --BARTIROMO: OK.GONZALEZ: -- when they did.BARTIROMO: So, how far are you willing to take that? What if there's no deal at all? Would you be OK with that?GONZALEZ: I think no deal is better than a horrible deal.BARTIROMO: OKGONZALEZ: And it's certainly one that doesn't protect the American people.BARTIROMO: All right. Let me move on to the headwinds, in terms of the budget. Congressional leaders say that they are on a path to reach a deal over spending caps, in the next two years, and increasing the debt ceiling beyond 2020. The sticking point of chorus is nondefense spending.How are you going to get spending under control when we know that it's the entitlements, in terms of spending growth, that's really the budget buster and military spending continues to go up.GONZALEZ: Yes, I mean, I think you hit on -- you hit the nail on the head there, and frankly, this is one of those issues in divided government where, you know, we're probably not going to get as much progress as we would hope. We're just not -- excuse me. We're just not fully empowered here.And so, the negotiation will take place. We'll see how it progresses. I look forward to working with my colleagues to get to a fair resolution.BARTIROMO: But you've got to get the debt ceiling up, right?GONZALEZ: It seems that way, in order to get this done, yes.BARTIROMO: New pressure on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, after several House Democrats are calling for a formal inquiry to potentially impeach President Trump. Now, a democratic caucus meeting to discuss oversight and investigations is scheduled for later this morning. The President just tweeted about it early this morning. Here's what he just said.Everything the Democrats are asking me for is based on an illegally started investigation that failed for them, especially when the Mueller report came back with a no collusion finding. Now they say impeach President Trump even though he did nothing wrong while they fish.After two years of an expensive and comprehensive witch hunt, the President writes, the Democrats don't like the results and they want a do-over. In other words, the witch hunt continues.He writes, the Democrats are getting zero work done in Congress. All they are focused on is trying to prove the Mueller report wrong, the witch hunt.And then he writes, presidential harassment, this morning, your thoughts? I mean, obviously, I don't see an end to any of this. How are you going to get anything done, in Congress, for the American people, when you've got this constant barrage of, you know, demands to see the President's tax returns and investigate the President and lead to impeachment?GONZALEZ: Well, I think the President's right on this. I mean, we've been here now almost six months, and I feel like the entire time we've been here, we've been fighting over whether or not to impeachment the President. As a result, we haven't gotten the things like USMCA, which would be unbelievably important for our economy.Now, we haven't gotten to healthcare, we haven't gotten, really, to anything of consequence, because we've been wasting our time. If we're only here, a certain, you know, a handful of days every month, and we waste that time, going after the President, we're just not going to get anything done. And the American people deserve so much better than that.BARTIROMO: So, is there anything that you can see, that you can actually get done with your colleagues on the left?GONZALEZ: You know, I do believe we can get USMCA done. And I think the pressure is starting to build there. Mexico has gone ahead and agreed to a lot of the terms that we asked for with respect to labor. And then also the steel and aluminum tariffs have been lifted temporarily, and so --BARTIROMO: Yes.GONZALEZ: -- we have a path forward there. We just have to get the bill to the floor.BARTIROMO: Right. That's if she brings the bill to the floor. Is there any timing on that? Do you have any vision on that?GONZALEZ: I know that the discussions are ongoing but again, I think the progress that's been made -- I sincerely believe you're going to start seeing -- especially over the next week, all members of Congress will be home in their home districts, you'll see a lot of these Midwestern members getting pressure from their constituents, hey, why aren't we voting on this? This is going to be good for our community.BARTIROMO: Yes.GONZALEZ: And so, that's, I think, you know, pressure in this country builds from the bottom up, not from the top, down. And so, I think that will ultimately be what pushes this bill forward.BARTIROMO: All right, Congressman, we'll be watching. Thanks very much. Anthony Gonzalez --GONZALEZ: Thank you very much.BARTIROMO: -- joining us this morning, in Washington.Apple, with another fix for its troubled laptop keyboards, meanwhile, Dagen's on that this morning. Good morning, Dagen.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. Yet again, Apple is promising to fix its MacBook keyboards. The issue is the butterfly keyboard. It's meant to be low profile and very fancy, and guess what, third generation, and they still don't work.Here are the MacBook's affected, the MacBook, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro. Here are the problems that people have been experiencing, even three generations in of these keyboards, oh well, the letters or characters repeat unexpectedly without your finger on the key. The characters, letters don't even appear, and keys feel sticky or don't respond.Here's what Apple is planning to do, again, it's changing the materials in the keyboard mechanism. Apple didn't say what specifically changed but it says it's going to help with the issue. Also all the MacBook laptops with butterfly keyboards are now eligible for Apple's program or covered up to four years after the original purchase.Why is this a big deal? Apple has shipped about 40 million of these laptops just between 2016 and 2018, and the majority of them have this butterfly keyboard. The other types of laptops not made by Apple have what's called the scissor keyboard. Guess what, Apple, scissor works, butterfly, not so much, back to you, Maria.BARTIROMO: All right. Dagen, thanks so much, we will see you in a little bit. Meanwhile, an iconic American beauty company could soon be sold, Cheryl Casone with those details and headlines this morning, Cheryl.CASONE: Oh, the Avon lady, Maria, remember her? Reportedly, Avon is nearing a deal with Brazil's Natura Cosmeticos. That's the company that actually owns the Body Shop. The price tag, more than $2 billion.Avon, famous, of course, for its door-to-door sales force, has been under pressure from the rise of online beauty sales. There is that stock in the premarket, up almost 22 percent, Avon products.Saudi Arabia and the U.S. are changing their energy roles. The kingdom has entered a 20-year deal to buy liquefied natural gas from U.S.-based Sempra Energy. Historically, the Saudis have been a major supplier of oil to the U.S. But with the boom in shale drilling, here in this country, the energy department is predicting that the U.S. is going to become a net energy exporter by next year.All right, British Prime Minister Theresa May, trying again to get her plan to leave the European Union approved. This time around, she's offering lawmakers the chance to vote on whether to hold a new referendum on the country's membership in the E.U., but only if they back her latest deal.Now, this is May's latest attempt to persuade parliament to back a divorce agreement, which would allow the U.K. to make an orderly departure. And Maria, somebody not departing yet, that's Theresa May.BARTIROMO: Yes, good point, Cheryl, thanks. Coming up, crisis at the border, border patrol closing down a processing facility after one teen migrant's death from the flu, the fallout coming up next. And then tornadoes hitting the plains, wild weather causing damage across the country, who's in the storm's path? We've got it all for you next. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: We've got a big show this morning, coming up, House Homeland Security Ranking Member, Alabama Congressman Mike Rogers is here this morning.New Jersey Congressman Jeff Van Drew joining us this morning, along with America First Action PAC Chair, former head of the U.S. Small Business Administration, Linda McMahon, joining us, along with the CEO of Deloitte, Cathy Engelbert and IndyCar Driver, Charlie Kimball, joining us this morning, as well. We've got a big show, so do stay with us.First, though, this, quarantine at the border, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Protection has stopped taking in detainees at its main processing center in McAllen, Texas because of a large number of migrants reportedly suffering from flu-like symptoms, the temporary move coming shortly after a teenager being held at the facility, died, after being diagnosed with the flu.Joining the conversation this morning, Benchmark Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly, and PWC Partner, Mitch Roschelle, and Dagen, as always, of course, great to see you this morning, thank you for being here, there really is this crisis at the border and we continue to see stories about people dying, kids coming over the border alone.It's actually really significant. And you don't get anything from the Democrats on this because they want to impeach the President.KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK: Yes, I think that's actually a great point and it's being echoed throughout all the border states. I was in Arizona last week.BARTIROMO: Yes.KELLY: And at every single lunch, dinner, you name it, that I was talking to people, they are very concerned about this, especially because they realize these are human beings and they want to help as humanly possible. I know people were discussing there's collections going up at churches to help donate to the Catholic charities down there, just to figure something out.But they think everybody has their head in the sand in the northeast. That's what (INAUDIBLE) is anybody talking about trying to figure this out? And I say, yes.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: It is a crisis. For any of the deniers still out there, there is hope with -- and, again, you were ahead on this, Senator Lindsey Graham putting together a package to change some of the laws --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: -- to kind of rationalize the patchwork of regulations that essentially encourage people to bring minors into this country from non- contiguous countries from Central America, for example. There is hope.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: I don't know in the next year and-a-half as the Democrats try to unseat President Trump and remove him from office, legally or maybe with shenanigans, I don't see how anything gets done. And how bad does this have to get? And for Democrats who said that the White House was separating families at the border and he was hurting children, I think now that that's on them.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: Children are being hurt, and t's because of their inaction. They own some of this, at this point.BARTIROMO: When we took the show to the border, a couple weeks ago, some of the kids that I met and parents with their kids, the reason that they were so sick is they had been traveling for three months, OK?So, you've got one woman holding an infant, and she said I hitchhiked here. I walked for the last, you know, month. I mean, it's just nuts to see the dangerous position that these people are putting in -- putting their children in.And then there's the whole renting issue going on in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, where I heard that mothers are renting their kids for $140, $140, they give the child to a smuggler. They come over the border with the child.Once they're over the border, they're done with the kid, and you know, either the child is going back, and the mother will do it again for another $140 or, I don't know, the kid is in a dangerous situation.MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC: And the pace of all of this, is accelerating, because it's getting out. It's well-known in those countries that you can come up and there's a way to make money. And so, it's only going to accelerate.BARTIROMO: Yes. By the way, big news on the investigating the investigators story, last night, we learned from John Solomon from The Hill, that the President is going to declassify in the next couple days.He's going to start declassifying some of the documents that are classified that are related to the FISA warrants that were -- that were gotten for -- to wiretap on Carter Page and George Papadopoulos as well.So, we're going to -- we're going to wait for those. They could be very telling. And they will -- they will obviously expose how they defrauded the FISA court to get those warrants. So, we'll wait for those.Quick break, and then extreme weather, tornadoes ripping across the plains states, the forecast coming up, and then Tesla making some changes, the company taking steps to improve sales, what it's doing, Tesla shares are down almost two percent in the premarket.Lot of news here, we had some earnings on the retail sector, below expectations, and we've got more stocks lower, in retail, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, wild weather is slamming the Midwest, still, just a few days away from Memorial Day, tornadoes, storms, ripping across Oklahoma. FOX News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean is in the FOX Weather Center this morning, Janice, good morning.JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST: Hi, Maria. Yes, we saw over two dozen reports of tornadoes across the plains states, and take a look at some of these reports, not only tornadoes, but we have flash flooding, the reports of the high water rescues yesterday were incredible, and then the hail and the damaging winds.Today, we have another threat. We don't think the explosive threat that we have seen over the last couple days, but certainly some of these same areas could get hit with hail, damaging winds, flooding rainfall and isolated tornadoes today.In some of these areas, four to six inches of rain in a very short period of time, and that's why we have this ongoing threat of flood watches and warnings in the same regions, Oklahoma, through Missouri, up towards the Ohio River valley, parts of Texas.And unfortunately, we've got more rain in the forecast as we get into Friday, and the long holiday weekend, behind this, cold enough for some snow across the higher elevations. If we weren't talking about the severe weather, we would certainly be talking about the threat for heavy snow over the Rockies, incredible as we get into the later part of May.Flood advisories remain posted for all of these areas vulnerable for more flooding, down the Mississippi River valley. And again, over the next several days, watching the same areas get hit with more rain in the forecast. Look, there's that snow across the higher elevations of the Rockies.Here is your forecast today, the other big story is the incredible heat across the Southeast, 92 in Atlanta, and we will take 76 and mostly sunny here, in New York City, back to you.BARTIROMO: Yes. We will take that for sure, Janice, thank you.DEAN: You got it.BARTIROMO: Janice Dean. Coming up, retail in focus, we are waiting for Target, first quarter earnings out, momentarily. We've got numbers here and reaction, when they hit the tape. And then 1985 revisited, the Netflix hit, Stranger Things, brings back new Coke, we're taking a look. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, May 22nd. Your top stories right now. 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.We're focused on retail earnings. We've seen a lot of slowdown within a number of retailers this week. Target's numbers are due at any minute. We bring you those numbers and analysis, we already had lows out earlier.Same-store sales were 3-1/2 percent higher. But the company is cutting its full-year profit forecast. And look at the stock. A big concern for this entire sector has been tariffs. Lowe's is down eight percent on that lowered guidance for the year -- down $9.31.Target is out. It looks like it's a beat this morning on earnings at a $1.53 a share versus an estimate of a $1.43. Target shares have been trading down in the last month, as you can see from this chart. And in the last -- yes, and the last month here. This is year to date chart at 71.96 on Target.Revenue is also a beat. As you can see, $17.6 billion on revenue at Target just hitting the tape right now. We're going to get to Ashley Webster and get more on that coming up. But this is certainly one bright spot it looks like. But we'll see what it says about say (INAUDIBLE) sales and as well as the guidance because that has been the issue that has been sending these stocks lower.Breaking news this morning. Elsewhere, a California judge ruling against Qualcomm. Saying that the company violated anti-trust law. That stock is plunging on the news as well. Take a look at Qualcomm shares, down 7-1/2 percent right now.Meanwhile, the broader market, well, the broader markets a lot quieter than this. Take a look, major indices are mixed with the Dow futures up two points, S&P futures down half a point, and the Nasdaq futures down 6-1/4.Of course, we're going into a long holiday weekend with the Memorial Day holiday on Monday. Markets are closed. We will probably see volume tail off by the end of the week. Yesterday stocks rallied ending the day near session highs.It was materials, technology, industrials, all leading the gains which brought the Dow Industrials up 198 points, three-quarters of one percent. The S&P was up 24 almost one percent and the Nasdaq was up 83 point, that was better than one percent on the session yesterday.European indices this morning, a lot happening in Europe with the FTSE 100 up 37 points right now. One half of a percent. CAC Quarante in Paris is up 13, and the DAX index in Germany higher by 59 points, one half of one percent.In Asia overnight, investors remain cautious ahead of the U.S. trade fight with China. Tensions are continuing. The ambassador to China telling the United -- telling Fox last night that the door is still open to resume trade negotiations. He blamed the U.S. on everything.Breaking news right now, we told you the target earnings are out, and they were better than expected on the top and bottom line. But Ashley Webster is looking behind the numbers. And Ashley, good morning to you.WEBSTER: Yes, good morning to you, Maria. Maybe bucking the trend that we've seen on retail numbers. Pretty good from Target. As you say, headline numbers earnings per share coming in a buck 33, that meets the estimate by 10 cents. Revenue, $17.6 billion, 17.5 was the estimate. So, and a slight beat on revenue.But I look at the key numbers here, same-store sales up 4.8 percent, the estimate was for 4.18 percent. The traffic growth was up 4.3 percent. Digital sales up 42 percent year-over-year. This is, of course, being the big push by Target to really get ramped up their online business seems to be paying off.And also they're maintaining their four-year guidance, both for the next quarter as well, and for the full year, no drop-off, no cutting back on the guidance. So, you put all that together and you can see Target in the pre- market up eight percent.And again, Maria, bucking the trend of other retailers who have struggled in the first quarter, and have also declined or -- you know, lowered their guidance for the full year. So, Target pretty good report indeed.BARTIROMO: Yes, I know, this is definitely a bright spot in what has been a weak environment.WEBSTER: Yes.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Ashley.WEBSTER: Sure.BARTIROMO: Want to talk more about that and we are -- we're joined right now by retail analyst Mary Epner. Mary, thanks very much for being here.MARY EPNER, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, MARY EPNER RETAIL ANALYSIS: Thank you for having me.BARTIROMO: So, how would you characterize, so far, what you're seeing? Target is obviously doing well, this morning stock is up as we just saw this chart. But recently, we've seen a real slowdown in a number of these retailers, right? For their (INAUDIBLE).EPNER: Right, yes. In the traditional department store space, if they didn't have anything in one of the key sectors of the market, nobody came in. The key ones are sneakers, license team, merchandise, cosmetics, home goods, which is really part of the reason that I believe target did well in addition to a few other things. But no, otherwise it was a very soft quarter for apparel and other sort of nondescript items.KELLY: Well, it's interesting because weather was what everyone was citing, right? When I look at Kohl's, they were like, hey, listen, nobody wanted to buy spring wear because it was gloomy, and it was raining. But then, I look at Target, where they actually beat on same-store sales by half of a percent which is huge, and they refine to your guidance, so it's like -- well, how --EPNER: Right, right.MCDOWELL: Can I -- can I add to that?KELLY: Yes, sure.MCDOWELL: I want to add to that. So, Kohl's blames weather, and then, for lowering its guidance for the full year, they blame the import tariffs.KELLY: Right.MCDOWELL: That's going to be the crutch, the excuse that these companies use to explain away bad management and a bad product.EPNER: Right.KELLY: Right.EPNER: You're right, when I was working for department stores, if I had blamed weather on any of my businesses, I would have been shown the door. So, I don't buy that at all, quite frankly.KELLY: Yes.EPNER: Get the product right. And the tariffs, I do believe will have an impact and I think that is valid, but the other, no, I don't buy that.KELLY: Well, blaming the weather just real quick is meanings, they don't have their omnichannel down, right? Because -- it just because of the weather is bad, doesn't mean people aren't going to stop spending money, vis-a-vis when we see Target.EPNER: Exactly.KELLY: Because Target actually had great sales.EPNER: Right.KELLY: And that was through the omnichannel through the web sites.EPNER: Right. I believe that a lot of these stores who complain about weather are the same ones who have not evolved their assortments and have relied on brands that are no longer relevant. So, I don't buy it, and you're right if, with bad weather, you can still shop online.BARTIROMO: But go back to tariffs for a second.EPNER: Yes.BARTIROMO: And you say that this is going to have a devastating effect on some of the hottest areas of retail.EPNER: Yes, yes.BARTIROMO: What do you -- what's your vision here on -- because it doesn't look like these tariffs are going to be lifted anytime soon certainly, for China?EPNER: I think it's -- yes, yes. No. I -- you know, a lot of the sneakers, and the shoes, and the boots, you know, fourth quarter businesses we're not that far from that. They are going to get the tariffs and that will be devastating.These companies don't have a plan B, well, we'll just get it somewhere else -- we'll start to produce it somewhere else. They largely rely on China. And again, sneakers are one of the hottest businesses out there now.But even -- in addition to that, there'll -- you know a lot of places, these big-box stores, in particular, get their merchandise for China. And again, back to school, fourth quarter just around the corner.BARTIROMO: But this fight is only getting bigger. I mean, you know, pronounce, hearing for our audience in the lead story in the journal this morning.(CROSSTALK)EPNER: It's getting point, point out, yes, yes.BARTIROMO: Which says the U.S. is putting the brakes on Chinese tech job seekers. China has not been able to penetrate the U.S. semiconductor industry.EPNER: Right.BARTIROMO: Semiconductors will not go and share their intellectual property with China. Now the U.S. is sharply slowing the approval for the country's semiconductor companies to hire Chinese nationals.This is getting deeper and wider in terms of the fight with China because of national security.EPNER: Absolutely, yes.BARTIROMO: So, these tariffs are going to be in place.EPNER: Right. And so, again, they're not going -- the stores are not going to be able to do anything about it this year. They're going to have -- to have -- to have a long term strategy into 2020 to figure out how to get out of this. Because you can't just pass this onto the customer. Their customers are middle-income families who can't absorb this or -- you know, spend that much extra to make up for this.ROSCHELLE: And how agile, Mary, are -- is the supply chain for this typical retailer -- I mean, the buyers just can't pivot and say, we're not buying it. I mean, the president says we're not buying it from China, we're buying from somewhere else in Southeast Asia.EPNER: Right, right. So, with -- it depends. And I'll tell you two scenarios. Number one, with something -- categories like shoes that have to fit, they have a contour a certain way of making them, there is no plan B, usually. Same thing with like a Victoria's Secret with bras, that you know, they have to fit, they're engineered. So, those are difficult to do elsewhere.If it's t-shirts, there are other options. Denim another one that's difficult and back-to-school is right around the corner. So, this is as far as I know for most companies out there, it's going to be a challenge.MCDOWELL: Which --(CROSSTALK)ROSCHELLE: -- go ahead.MCDOWELL: Just which company's prepared for this years ago have the most diversified supply chain do you think?EPNER: I think the ones who work with somebody like a Li & Fung. Because Li & Fung have backup plans all over the world. And so, I would say, some of -- you know, probably, I don't know this for a fact, my -- I would imagine it would be Wal-Mart and Target.But again, there's such big companies and they have such vast quantities coming in. I don't know how quickly they could back it up for this year.MCDOWELL: Do they eat the tariffs though? So, as long as the supply is there for sneakers, do they eat the tariffs or spread the cost increase across literally all its merchandise? How was that?EPNER: When I've seen this in the past, not to this degree, by the way, but normally, its spread over a number of categories that would be able to absorb it and not -- you know, and have subtle increases be passed onto the customer.So, it will depend by company, and I'm sure everybody's figure -- trying to figure that out right now. Because I don't know that everybody really took this seriously, and you know, prepared for it especially in time for the second half of the year.ROSCHELLE: Very real quick, the retailers have the cash flow to pre-buy for the Christmas holiday season now to get ahead of the tariff?EPNER: So, some companies do -- two companies I really like who would be prepared for this, I believe would be Ross Stores and T.J. Maxx. They're very agile, they always have money to move around and they're doing well. And I see no signs of that slowing down. Other companies like the traditional department stores -- you know, I think that would be more difficult -- you know, you made the comment earlier, do people go into stores anymore, right? So, they do. But --you know, they're --ROSCHELLE: That was an attack at me, by the way.EPNER: Well, know, it were. Come on. I told it over here, too. I'll get you for that. So, yes, the department store's getting back to that. I think it would be more difficult for them, as we saw with J.C. Penney, they're having a harder time. So, that makes it really challenging.BARTIROMO: So, this is a China issue, or is it a consumer issue as well? Is the consumer weakened here? Or are you still seeing that the strength and the spending power of the consumer sustained?EPNER: I see the spending power sustained for now.BARTIROMO: For now.EPNER: But if this happens, if these go through, we're going to have an issue.BARTIROMO: Yes.EPNER: Because these companies will not perform well. You'll all be talking in six or nine months about how poorly they did because they had extra tariffs, and then, it has a ripple effect in the economy.BARTIROMO: Sure. So, we'll watch that. Mary, good to have you.EPNER: Yes, thank you for having me.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much, Mary Epner on retail there (INAUDIBLE) knows this. Tesla, cutting prices on two of its most expensive models. Cheryl Casone with the details there and headlines. Cheryl.CASONE: That's right, Maria. Tesla, slashing the price of its Model S Sedan by $3,000. And the price of its Model X SUV by $2,000.The company also bringing back free unlimited supercharging. They are trying to sell some inventory cars. These latest moves coming as Tesla's stock drops to its lowest point we've seen since late 2016 with several analysts questioning demand for its cars. The stock is down in the premarket, more almost two percent as you can see on your screen.Well, American Airlines eliminating oversize bag fees for certain sporting gear and musical instruments. A passenger has a big items like a surfboard or a snowboard can now check them as standard baggage. Travelers are going to still be charged $150 for other big items that include your hang glider, your scuba tanks because they need special handling.Because I always take my scuba tanks when I travel. OK. All right. And finally, there's this, guys. Coca-Cola is bringing back a product flop.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: First time, first love, oh, what feeling is this electricity flows like the very first kiss.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: New Coke making its return as part of a promotion with the Netflix show, stranger things. Now, this show, if you don't watch it, set in 1985. Well, that's when New Coke was born. The soft drink didn't last very long, consumer backlash led to the quick return of the original formula. New Coke won't be available in store, you have you to buy it on the web site, Coke's web site.But, of course, that was known as the biggest marketing fail of the 1980s. New Coke. Which, I don't know, I tried it as a kid.BARTIROMO: Yes. I didn't like it.CASONE: Horrible.MCDOWELL: No, it tastes like Pepsi.CASONE: Yes.MCDOWELL: A bigger fail, though --KELLY: Clearer Pepsi?MCDOWELL: McPizza.BARTIROMO: McPizza.MCDOWELL: McPizza, McDonald's had a pizza.BARTIROMO: Oh, yes, that's right, those a bigger fail. I agree with you.KELLY: On the Tesla thing, it's pretty interesting because the tax situation where they lost their subsidies, and now they have to discount their car pricing to kind of match what the subsidies went away.MCDOWELL: It's not totally gone, though.KELLY: No, it's not. Right.MCDOWELL: It's phasing out.KELLY: Right, exactly.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll take a break. When we come back, trade tensions spilling into the markets. Investors playing close attention, the recession risk is what we're talking about, coming up. And then the terminator and the law, Arnold Schwarzenegger supporting a tobacco ban with one exception. We'll tell you what it is. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Headlines across America this morning. NWFDailyNews.com reports Florida's space coast is bouncing back with help from SpaceX, Boeing and Blue Origin. New life (INAUDIBLE) back into the real estate along the coastline thanks to the new space age. The area of front row perched to watch new rockets fly.The L.A. Times this morning reporting Beverly Hills votes to ban tobacco sales, but exempts Schwarzenegger's favorite cigar club. It's being billed as the most stringent tobacco ban in the country, eliminating the sale of virtually all recreational nicotine products. But there's one very Beverly Hills exception -- an elite group of aficionados who fought hard against the new rules -- can keep their cigars as long as they smoke inside three dedicated lounges.And the New York Daily News this morning writes: "Goats arrive in New York City. These unique four-legged summer interns will spend their days eating weeds, bugs and whatever else they find in Manhattan's riverside park as part of a conservancy initiative." I didn't know that they had this goat initiative.KELLY: This isn't new.ROSCHELLE: This is in my neck of the woods. People with a lot of property will rent goats, it's like $8.00 a day or something like that -- you have to fence them off.BARTIROMO: You want them to eat the bugs and weeds?MCDOWELL: They eat everything.KELLY: They do this at my church, actually, down in Soho. So, it's kind of funny. You would see goats wandering around and then all the tourists are like, what's going on in Manhattan?MCDOWELL: We have like the goat farms will bring all the goats in. But if they're not managed properly, they can get out and wind up somewhere they're not supposed to be. Maybe not in New York. But that's happened in other cities.ROSCHELLE: The trick is, it's $8.00 a day, but they don't tell you how much it costs to build a fence so they don't escape. That's a little bit more expensive.KELLY: Well, it could be good to let them out on the streets, because it's pretty dirty here. So, we can start in the parks and maybe they can do Bill de Blasio's job and help clean this up.BARTIROMO: Well, he's got to campaign now.KELLY: Yes, of course, which he promised he wasn't going to do.BARTIROMO: Coming up, trade hitting the markets. U.S.-China trade tensions threatening a recession, we've got the details there. How likely is that? Coming up. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Futures this morning are lower, take a look. It's fractional moves, quiet morning. But Dow Futures indicating a decline at the start of trading by 15 points. S&P Futures down three, and the NASDAQ Future is right now down 19. Markets reacting yesterday to the Trump administration's temporary exemptions to an export blacklist against Huawei technologies. The move expected to ease tensions for a 90-day period. But investors are still watching recession risks due to the ongoing trade turmoil.And I mentioned earlier, there's story in the journal this morning about the U.S. slowing down Chinese technology job seekers and slowing down the approval for the semiconductor companies in the U.S. to hire Chinese nationals in engineering positions. Joining me right now is Altium Wealth Portfolio Manager and Market Strategist, Michael Lee. And Michael, good to see you. I mentioned the story in the journal because it just shows you that the U.S. is not backing down and they're continuing to push back on China's bad behavior, certainly anything related to national security. So, what does it mean for markets, if we don't get a deal?MICHAEL LEE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AND MARKET STRATEGIST, ALTIUM WEALTH: You know, I don't -- I think we're going to end up with some sort of volatility and selloff when we go to a full 25 percent on everything. I'd say that, that's got to be the base case scenario right now for the markets going forward. Although, I don't think it has that big of an effect on the overall economy. I think it causes some short-term turmoil. But if we do that, this is a death nell to China. The Chinese government, the Chinese economy is a house of cards. They are supposedly, you know, 15 percent of the world GDP, yet less than one percent of international transactions are settled in local Chinese currency. Why? They printed $30 trillion of currency since 2001; and they are now in a double definite deficit.Meaning, our deficit -- our fiscal deficit of GDP is about four percent, theirs is 10. They're now in a capital count deficit as well with currency flowing out of the country. This is a death nell for mercantilist economy. They need currency from all over the world to be able to fuel themselves. And now that the money's going out, what are these tariffs really going to do to China? Yes, they'll slow exports, but it's going to destroy direct foreign investment, which is the only way forward for China.KELLY: Well, what's interesting to me is that they've actually -- but they certainly impact a lot of the markets. And so, one, they actually sell treasuries to raise, you know, money but then the other thing too is I've seen Dr. Copper has gotten sickly. It's down 17 percent over the last three months, and that's indicative of what's happened to the he global supply chain. If we look at global PMIs, they're actually in retraction and the economy is slowing globally, right?And so, it's not just a China story, it's not just a U.S. story. I'm worried just because Germany contracting for four consecutive months. I mean, that's not good, right? So, my thing is, I'm worried about the market for the rest of the year because we have margin pressure, right? I mean, we're seeing cost of goods go up vis-a-vis the tariffs. We're seeing labor go up. So, I mean, how do you position yourself in this market?LEE: So, I'd say it's important to remember that it's the U.S. GDP that drives the world growth, not the other way around. And things at home are spectacular. There are 1.3 million more jobs than people looking for work; 3.2 percent GDP growth in the first quarter public and revised down. But most talking heads, and most people that are looking at the market are applying a zero multiple to the long-term effects of massive structural tax reform, massive structural deregulation. As well as adding a half a million new manufacturing jobs in just over two years.The multiplier effect that these things are going to have for many years to come, so I think you're going to see a lot more resiliency and this business cycle will be extended a lot further. And part of the reason you're seeing the slowing overseas is because the U.S. has become an infinitely more attractive investment. So where are you going to put your marginal dollars to work? In the U.S. where we're booming or in other places in the world where they have structural issues?MCDOWELL: European debt. I have to pay them to own their debt.LEE: So -- no, central bank has ever created inflation. What they can do is they can curb inflation. And right now, in the U.S., you have Bullard yesterday talking about maybe we should cut rates to generate inflation. I don't think that's -- I don't buy it.BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, you make all good points. But I wonder what your point about copper tells us, that's an important point too; copper down 17 percent in three months. Michael, good to see you. Thank you, Michael Lee. Back in a minute.Load-Date: May 22, 2019End of Document

The Chinese cash that feeds Silicon Valley became suddenly toxicCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 12, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 2468 wordsBodyPilot AI Labs Inc., a new Silicon Valley company, hired a venture capital firm backed by China as its first major investor in 2015. Last summer, Pilot AI wanted him to leave.The new American company expected to sell more of its artificial intelligence software to the US government after working with the Pentagon, according to people familiar with its operations, feared that its effort might be affected by the links Of the investor with the government of China. The president of the Chinese-backed investor, Digital Horizon Capital, was asked to sell his share, said one of the present. He refused angry.Chinese investors initially embraced Silicon Valley both for their portfolios and for their access to one of the largest and most difficult markets in the world. Today, you are suddenly not so welcome.Since late last year, amid rising tensions between the US and China, ventures with ties to China have been delaying their investments in the US, structuring agreements in novel ways to avoid regulators or closing their Offices in the United States. Some American risk firms are getting rid of their Chinese partners or are fencing them with special structures. And some new US companies that have accessed significant sums of Chinese money are keeping investments in silence or trying to expel their Chinese investors to avoid scrutiny.After reaching record levels early last year, Chinese funding for new American companies decelerated from May 2018, according to the research firm Rhodium Group. And state-backed Chinese investors disappeared at the end of last year, Rhodium said. Meanwhile, China's foreign direct investment, which includes acquisitions of US companies, plummeted by 90% to $5 billion in 2018 from US $46 billion in 2016.Behind the change in sentiment there is an effort by the US government to contain the flow of talent and technology that it fears may threaten the country's economic and military superiority. Some Chinese investors expected a trade agreement to be reached in April, easing tensions and reopening the way to investment, but instead, trade struggle has been shot at higher tariffs.Some American risk investors say that Washington is exaggerating and threatening the benefits of open trade with China, preventing new companies from accessing a lucrative market and a source of capital. Two venture companies with operations in China have complained to a Defense Department unit of being unjustly marked, a sign of the differences in how the two parties assess the threat.Many policymakers in Washington do not understand technology, and many technology executives do not understand the politics of great Power, said Amy Zegart, senior researcher at the Hoover Institution, a group of conservative experts.The EU government pressure campaign gained momentum last fall when a new law increased the power of the Foreign investment committee or Cfius, to demand that international investors obtain approval for technology agreements. Change restricts investments in companies that work with more sensitive technologies and adds a bureaucracy that makes foreign investment less attractive to new US businesses.Almost at the same time, a group of senators and Trump administration officials began holding private meetings with companies and investors in Silicon Valley to warn about the risksTo do business with China.The administration criticized China's efforts to obtain U.S. technology in a November report that describes how Chinese companies with state linkages could gain access to the intellectual property of US emerging companies. The U.S. Trade Representative's report mentioned Digital Horizon, the investor linked to China on Pilot AI, saying that its goal was to help guide US technologies back to Beijing.Digital Horizon, formerly called Danhua Capital, is backed by multiple Chinese investors, including the investment arm of the state Zhongguancun Development Group.Digital Horizon has been one of the most active Chinese-funded capital firms in Silicon Valley, raising approximately US $500 million in capital and investing in new U.S. companies, along with the major U.S. capital firms. In 2015, at a time when new American companies were happy to take on Chinese capital, Digital Horizon led an investment of approximately US $500,000 on Pilot AI, becoming its first institutional investor, according to the research firm Pitchbook.In the middle of last year, the mood had changed dramatically, with President Trump implementing tariffs on Chinese manufacturing products and with Congress advancing to reinforce the power of Cfius to review more agreements. Hoping to get more government business, Pilot AI, headquartered in Palo Alto, Calif., last summer, decided it would be prudent for Digital Horizon to stop participating. It was then that the president of Digital Horizon was asked to sell it, according to the person familiar with the incident, who said that the president, Shoucheng Zhang, was angry at what he felt was the pressure to sell.Shoucheng Zhang spoke at a technology conference in Beijing in July 2017. PHOTO: VCG/GETTY IMAGESDr. Zhang, who was also a professor of physics at Stanford University, died on December 1, in what the San Francisco medical office called an apparent suicide. "An apparent note" was quoted as referring to depression.A spokesman for Digital Horizon said he was not aware of a request for the company to sell its stake in Pilot AI, which it still maintains.A sponsor of Digital Horizon, the Zhongguancun Technology Center in Beijing, withdrew the Chinese language signs from his outpost in Santa Clara, California, and pulled out a Chinese flag on the front.When asked about signage, Ella Li, chief investment officer in Santa Clara for Zhongguancun Capital, said they wanted to keep a low profile after a U.S. government report. The U.S. Trade Representative's November report described Zhongguancun, commonly known as ZGC, as a Chinese government-backed entity that aims to divert US technology and talent.U.S. and Chinese officials attended the opening of the ZGC Innovation Center in Silicon Valley in San Francisco in May 2016. PHOTO: MA DAN/XINHUA/ZUMA PRESSA spokesman for ZGC wrote in a statement: "We believe there are some gaps in trade transactions across the Pacific, and we hope to cover the gaps through our efforts to operate the incubator space in Bay Area."Sinovation Ventures,Another Beijing-based investor closed his office in Palo Alto and stopped investing in the U.S., said people familiar with the company, whose president, Kai-Fu Lee, is a leading expert in artificial intelligence and, in addition, former executive of Google and Microsoft. Sinovation had made 46 investments in the US, according to its website.A spokesperson for Sinovation said the company is "re-evaluating its strategy in the US" after key personnel outlets lead to a reduction in U.S. investments. His change of investment plans was previously reported by Vox.Sinovation Ventures showed the names of the new companies in which it invested in a slate at its Beijing headquarters in August 2017. PHOTO: GIULIA MARCHI/BLOOMBERG NEWSDavid Cao, who helped build a network and event business that introduced Chinese investors to new U.S. businesses, found that the number of Chinese companies actively investing in new US businesses has declined significantly. Few Chinese investors attended a conference that Cao held in April. "It's harder to connect people," he said.Making things more difficult is the point, say US policymakers.Since October, Virginia's Democratic senator, Mark Warner, and his Republican colleagues on the Senate Intelligence Committee have held briefings with American risk capitalists, technology executives, other leaders Business and university administrators, urging to take seriously the threat of China's intellectual property theft and to reduce relations with its Chinese counterparts.The meetings, with presentations by senior officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigations, the Department of Homeland Security and the National Center for Counterintelligence and Security, are closed to the public so that the classified material can be Shared. Some attendees, people who have come to trust China for their businesses and funds, have pressured the government to present strong evidence of the threat, according to US officials who are familiar with the meetings.Warner, a former venture capitalist, says he historically supported the expansion of economic ties with China. "But after a few years and many, many classified briefings, my views have changed, as the Chinese government has done," Warner said in a written statement. "While many people in Washington understand the severity of the threat, that is not true across the country."Democratic Senator Mark Warner and his Republican colleagues on the Senate Intelligence Committee have privately urged executives to take the threat of Chinese intellectual property theft more seriously. PHOTO: KEVIN LAMARQUE/REUTERSThe FBI has also intensified efforts to warn companies about the threat of China's intellectual property theft, creating a squadron of a dozen agents and analysts in their San Francisco office, more people than other FBI offices, to Working with companies. Recently published a report titled "Protect Your Startup" with tips to prevent theft of intellectual property.The FBI office has conducted hundreds of briefings for companies on cyber-security threats and economic espionage. Discourages people from using their smartphonesand laptops when they travel to China and warns US executives to avoid the "honeypot" espionage attempts of attractive women. "If you are not a 10 in the United States, you are not a 10 in China," say the officials who have told the executives.A venture capitalist who received such information said that his signature is excluding his only Chinese investor from future fundraising to avoid delaying any agreement that might require Cfius's approval.Baidu Ventures, a venture capital firm financed mostly by the prominent Chinese search engine company Baidu INC., has altered the structure of some of its investments to avoid Cfius's scrutiny, said Saman Farid, partner of the firm.When Baidu Ventures sees a company he likes, he sometimes recruits another investor to close the agreement and signs his voting rights to that other investor, so he does not take a position on the board or ask to see company information, Farid said.Chinese conglomerate Fosun International is now avoiding investments in the US in sensitive industries due to a "less friendly environment," said Mike Xu, manager of the Fosun Capital unit.The risk branch of Chinese electronic commerce giant Alibaba Group holding Ltd. Is shifting to investments outside the US, according to two people familiar with their operations.Alibaba was already careful to avoid the look of the regulators. When he invested last summer at DeepMap Inc., a new Palo Alto company that works on advanced mapping technology for auto-driving cars, Alibaba bought about 7% of the company, a percentage that would have helped to avoid a review of the Agreement on the part of Cfius.After DeepMap started a new round of funding last summer, he revealed some of his new investors and no Alibaba, even though he had invested more. A spokesman for DeepMap said that Alibaba had asked not to be quoted.A spokesman for Alibaba declined to comment.DeepMap's co-founder and CEO, James Wu, said his company does not reveal some of its Chinese investors. "We don't want to make a big noise," he said.When American company DeepMap Inc. Revealed to investors in a round of funding of 2018, it omitted the major, the China Alibaba. A spokesman for DeepMap said that Alibaba did not want to be quoted. PHOTO: MICHAEL SHORT/BLOOMBERG NEWSPart of the fall in Chinese investment is due to China's efforts to restrict capital outflows in order to protect the value of the yuan. Naval Ravikant, co-founder of the AngelList financing network, said the Chinese investment firm CSC Venture Capital agreed in 2015 to invest US $400 million in new companies listed in AngelList and discussed increasing the amount to US $1 billion. It had invested only about $100 million before Chinese capital controls effectively terminated the agreement in 2017, explained Ravikant.Some Chinese investors and ethnically Chinese American citizens say they are confused by the aggressive approach of the US government, and argue that making connections in other countries is often a way for venture capitalists to help The new companies.A January 2018 report by a Department of Defense unit warned that China's government could gain access to "the jewels of innovation in the US" through investments in new enterprises. The report lists seven "Chinese risk companies" without making specific allegations that any ofThey have been involved in the problematic diversion of US technology.Richard Lim, a manager at GSR Ventures, said his signature was not contacted before his name was included in the Department of Defense Innovation Unit (IUD) report. He said it was wrong to call his company a Chinese fund, because most of its capital comes from limited US-based partners and less than 10% of Chinese investors.The IUD report did not mention some American risk companies that have major operations in China, notably Sequoia Capital. Neil Shen, who is the head of the Sequoia operation in China, and one of the world's most prominent venture capitalists, is part of a body called the Chinese People's Political Consultative conference advising the Chinese legislature.A spokesman for Sequoia declined to comment.Another signature listed by the IUD, GGV Capital, protested for inclusion in a letter sent in March to the IUD and reviewed by the Wall Street Journal. One spokesman said the IUD has not responded to its signature letter, which has offices in Silicon Valley, China, and Singapore. The IUD did not answer a question about GGV's complaint.Sinovation also fu mentioned in the report and complained to the IUD last June. A person familiar with the report said that after the complaint, the IUD consulted with researchers who found additional links between Sinovation and the Chinese government. This person stated that the companies named in the report were not contacted before time.Michael Brown, director of the IUD and one of the authors of the report, said it was written to raise awareness in the U.S. government and in industry officials about the extent of Chinese investments in early-stage firms "and how these investments fit u N longer and broader process of a technology transfer strategy that benefits from both legal and illegal means. "The entry the Chinese cash feeding Silicon Valley became suddenly toxic was first published in the third.Load-Date: June 12, 2019End of Document

Unrest in East TurkestanThe Tech: Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyMay 31, 2019 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 3338 wordsBody• Facebook• Twitter• Reddit• Email• PrintGeopoliticsIt is no secret that the world in the past decades witnessed a violent chain of religious conflict and devastating extremist insurrections that left irreparable scars all over the earth. What is more subtle, however, is how the Chinese government treats those whom they view as potential "extremists" in the outskirts of its own nation.At the western edge of the world's most populated country is the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous region, an ancient land bounded by Tibet to the south and the vast Central Asian and Mongolian steppes to the west and north, respectively. Of China's various provinces and territories, Xinjiang is arguably the most isolated and unknown to outsiders. Unlike the bustling citadels of Guangdong, whose dense crowds attest to China's unmitigated growth, or the grand Pagodas sprinkled throughout the nation's imperial historical sites, Xinjiang contains the western pocket of the arid Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts and the ancient Tian Shan range - home to various Turkic pastoral tribes in Central Asia and an entirely separate culture: one that differs sharply from that of the Han Chinese to the east.Xinjiang, especially in some of its remote villages, is built upon the road less traveled; while travel to the region is generally regarded as safe, the "Old Town" of Kashgar - a main Xinjiang city and one through which Marco Polo once walked - only received 1.57 million visitors in the first half of 2018 compared to the country's over approximately 140 million inbound visitors over the same period. Its designation as an autonomous region, however, belies a dark truth about the rigid hegemony in place.As MIT students, we are not always aware of or exposed to the foreign relationships that our administration maintains or even where the research on our campus is put to use. On April 20 in the Stata Center, the MIT-Harvard Conference on Uyghur Human Rights occurred, offering fantastic insight into the little-known conflict for dozens of attendees in the greater Boston area. Regrettably, the Chinese government leverages technologies used in DNA profiling and surveillance of the Uyghur originating in MIT's Media Lab and CSAIL laboratories, and yet we never learn of how our ambition and research harms innocent beings overseas. When will this end?A tragic conflict is brewing in China's rolling hills, heavenly mountains, jubilant market bazaars, and ancient cities set astride the paths of the old Silk Road: one - among many - that must move the world to action.Chinese fearsThe Chinese government's "One Belt, One Road" initiative seeks to resurrect and amplify the commercial connectedness of the Silk Road in China's favor. Xinjiang is critical for the program's regional development through Central Asia but remains its current weakness.In days past, many of the Silk Road's pathways traveled through the heart of Xinjiang; if Xi Jinping's visions are realized, then Xinjiang will likely be the epicenter of the program's activity. The region connects China to Siberia, Central Asia, and the China-Pakistan economic corridor. Without a means to pacify the region, there would be a potentially debilitating break in the geopolitical chain meant to solidify the reach for power of the Chinese Communist Party . The brewing instability in Xinjiang, coupled with its tumultuous past, compels the Chinese government to quickly, quietly, and uncompromisingly take hold of the region via frightening modes of subjugation.On July 5, 2009, for reasons still disputed, violent riots broke out between Uyghur protesters and Chinese security officials in Ürümqi, capital city of Xinjiang. The death toll reportedly reached 140, with over 1,700 left injured. Some allege that the violence was spurred by a fatal brawl between Han Chinese and Uyghur workers in a Guangdong factory. The CCP claimed that the riots were premeditated and encouraged by the World Uyghur Congress. It is much more probable that the "7.5" riots, as they are sometimes called, were the product of years of pent-up animosity amongst the hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs residing in Xinjiang regarding governmental policies and ethnic conflict.After continued upticks in violence between Han and Uyghurs, especially in July 2014's bloody riots, the CCP responded by conducting its "People's War on Terror," aimed at clearing the territory of all extremist influences. The Chinese government reported knife-wielding, masked assailants in the Yarkand municipality and boasted of the deaths of nine "terrorists" in Xinjiang's Hotan prefecture. Authorities, however, waited over a week to report on these events, and the government's effective ban on foreign journalists from entering the region makes it difficult for media to access the truth behind these stories. China's reporting and the ambiguity surrounding the causes and effects of the spikes in violence throughout Xinjiang obscure what really transpired during these events, and this confusion prevents us from obtaining concrete answers.In Ürümqi today, everyday life has changed drastically - what once was a city teeming with life has now grown much quieter, and dark memories of events much rather left unspoken lie on the conscience of its inhabitants. When asked by journalists posing as tourists in late 2015 about what transpired in their region, Xinjiang residents shook their heads solemnly and claimed that they knew nothing. What would quiet an entire body of people? The answer lies in the reach of the Chinese government.In virtually all of Xinjiang, the streets crawl with Chinese security forces. Video cameras capture the movements of every being in the vicinity, and thousands of troops are deployed throughout the province, often seen alongside highway checkpoints and near mosques. China's vision is one of ideological extermination - the Xinjiang Party Secretary Zhang Chunxian believes that to "cut weeds, we must dig out the roots." But can a province so tightly controlled by regulations and surveillance bear the crossroads of a continent's trade?To understand the behavior of the CCP in Xinjiang, the international community need not look far. Yet, numerous media organizations and human rights groups seem to be missing the motivations that drive China to these measures. Generally, the world understands the Chinese government's unwavering ambitions to expand its sphere of political influence and maintain financial prowess. Unknown to many, however, is the government's desperation to achieve these goals in different regions. With Africa becoming "China's China" and the encroachment upon the South China Sea with artificial island construction, the world is witnessing China's anxious outreach for survival. Oil fields, ports, and other resources are all engulfed by the CCP as it furthers its path to dominance.The fertility of Central Asia and connectivity of Eurasia to other major global trade hubs makes China's western borders appear as high profile sectors of necessary redevelopment, and the CCP reasons that the Uyghur occupation of Xinjiang is the primary roadblock to achieving its goals.Also important are the geographic fears that the Chinese government likely experiences. The 50 mile border that China shares with Afghanistan's Badakhshan Province is located on the southwest rim of Xinjiang. In the shadow of the Pamir and Hindu Kush mountains lies Afghanistan's northeast panhandle, the Wakhan corridor, leading directly into the mountainous border with Xinjiang. China has historically received requests from nations including Afghanistan to open the border with the Wakhan Corridor to help fight Taliban insurgencies and obtain a supply route to a region bereft of trade, but it has so far has denied such requests.Afghanistan continues to suffer some of the most devastating violence and terrorism in the past two decades, and its proximity to China is reasonably worrying to the latter nation's government. China watched the Arab Spring unfold, where despotic leaders of Islamic societies were torn from their leadership and met with horrifying ends. With the majority-Muslim territory of Xinjiang standing between Beijing and Eurasia, the CCP simply views this western region as a threat.How can the Chinese ensure stability in Xinjiang? The simplistic answer is to let be the Uyghur population in the hopes that the oppressed will desist in their retaliation. However, given the belligerent tendencies between both groups in recent years following decades of tension, this seems virtually impossible. If the Chinese government truly cared about peace and harmony in Xinjiang, it would pursue an approach of gradually removing the military presence it maintains in the region, possibly even liberating whatever Uyghurs it may or may not have detained in secretive sites. China's heavy-handed response to the crisis will only catalyze more resistance and resentment from the Uyghurs.The problem the CCP struggles to answer for itself, though, is how much it cares for the scores of people under its administration. All of this tension echoes a concerning pattern in recent Chinese history, with traces of the unrest in Tibet and 2008 riots in Lhasa, the slow disappearance of Cantonese in Hong Kong and Guangzhou, and more. What evidence do we have that the Chinese administration has any propensity to abandon its current trajectory in Xinjiang?The Uyghurs' plight"Xinjiang" in Mandarin means "new territory" or "new frontier," a concept which belittles the history of the Uyghur people in their land - who prefer to refer to it as "East Turkestan." Originally a nomadic tribe of the Altai mountains, the Uyghur people arrived in East Turkestan centuries ago. Their physical legacy conveys the echoes of a people descended from the Sogdian traders once encountered by Marco Polo, and their history is one of oasis settlements and bustling trade on the Silk Road. They lived harmoniously and independently, until their region was brought under Chinese jurisdiction during the 19th century reign of the Qing Dynasty. From then on, the Uyghurs were brought into ominous confrontation against their own volition with their eastern neighbors.Walking through a bazaar anywhere in East Turkestan used to guarantee that one would be met by smiling faces: energetic vendors displaying their ornate crafts and savory cuisine happily greet the onlookers and new faces. Market stands, rugs, and mosques adorn the teeming streets of old cities like Kashgar. Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Hui, and Kyrgyz all thrived in the heart of East Turkestan, giving a colorful glimpse at the cultures of Central Asia.In recent years, centers of "enlightenment" in Xinjiang have been appearing and expanding as shown on aerial surveillance. Concurrently, thousands of Uyghur and even Kazakh individuals all across Xinjiang are being quietly seized from their communities and vanishing without a trace. Structurally, the edifices resemble a network of prison-like dormitories, buildings, and fields, all enclosed in protective walls. These "re-education" centers are nothing short of, if not strikingly worse, than concentration camps designed for the purpose of breaking and undermining the will of its prisoners, if such allegations are true.Thousands of Muslims residing in China's largest territory are subjected to morally depraved exercises; these individuals are forced to memorize and reproduce mantras praising the Chinese leadership, denounce their faith, and offer their unwavering compliance under threat of pain for themselves or their equally-threatened friends and family members.A Kazakh Muslim by the name of Bekali recounts that he was submitted to abuses including forced standing, food deprivation, and solitary confinement - most of which are deemed to be forms of inhumane torture by the United Nations. Other accounts tell stories of electrocution, beatings, and being locked in cages with numerous other detainees for weeks on end. Others remember how they were forced to take unknown pills, have weights tied to their feet, or be handcuffed to stare at walls for up to 17 hours. All of this "re-education" is spent on people who have no ties to terrorist networks nor any extremist desires. This is not re-education; this is torture.Survivors of the camps experience immense psychological degradation after years of isolation and degradation; Uyghurs testify that they "can't sleep" as a result, and that the thoughts of the camps never leave them. They say the cries of those around them stay in their ears. Denouncing their own ethnicity and their own people is a cruel means by which to undermine and uproot the spirit of these innocent people. Some allege that they contemplated suicide or witnessed others kill themselves.Ilham Tohti, a Uyghur scholar, writer, and professor often spoke on his website and in his works about peaceful resolutions to the conflict in Xinjiang. In return for promoting ethnic harmony, he was declared a separatist and sentenced to life in prison by Chinese authorities after a two-day trial in Ürümqi.The Chinese government's eagerness to take control of its western frontiers has led it to practice extremely low tolerance for dissension, which greatly endangers the Uyghurs under the illusory notion of "harmony" that the CCP presses. Thousands more like Tohti vanish and face undeserving punishments.There is a small population of ethnic Uyghurs who learn of more extreme forms of Islam and use this to motivate bellicose means to an end. In 2014, hundreds of Uyghurs who fled China since 2009 began appearing in Syria - unfortunately, not simply as refugees.When ISIS still had much of its Levantine and Middle Eastern territories, it turned its vengeful attention to the crimes of the Chinese. In 2015, the Islamic State released a video featuring radicalized Uyghur children training in combat and learning in a classroom-like environment. The chilling footage shows the young children, supposedly from East Turkestan, wearing black clothes and hats and seated at desks. One child sings a song praising martyrdom, while another speaks sternly to the Chinese "infidels" and promises the caliphate's return to East Turkestan to spill "rivers" of Chinese blood.The direct threat of ISIS or any extremist organization to China is limited in reality, as very few Uyghurs are able to leave the country in the first place, and those who do rarely travel to the Middle East to serve extremist agendas. However, Chinese officials conflate the identity of Uyghurs with that of extremism, leading to a gross exaggeration of terrorist threats to justify its overbearing control of Xinjiang and the destruction of a culture. The Uyghur territory thereafter became a region of mass surveillance; advanced facial recognition technology is consistently used to record obligatory data on the Uyghur residents for police records, cell phone applications (such as Jingwang Weishi) are enforced as required installations on Uyghur cellular phones to monitor calls and messages, and DNA profiling occurs on a massive scale.Even for a nation already employing profuse technological surveillance on its own citizens, the measures which the CCP is willing to leverage in its far west to monitor and control the Uyghur population are, as depicted, totalitarian at best. Police minders in plain clothing inspect the crowds of market centers; neighborhood monitors watch over and inspect family homes; and dozens of cameras trained on the pedestrians below line each block in major cities.In the populated areas, posters indicate that older men should not wear long beards and warn against hijabs as marks of extremism. In some cases, the propaganda posters advise against giving children Islamic names or practicing their religion openly.The tragedy in East Turkestan can no longer be ignored or overlooked by any nation government, or individual. One of Earth's most geographically rich territories is at risk of losing its original inhabitants to the unwavering expanse of China. While the Chinese people cannot be held accountable for the travesties in Xinjiang, we must recognize that the Chinese government's strongest weapon in waging ideological war is its ability to leverage silence. We must be the ones to speak up - for those who have been silenced, and for those whose voices cannot be heard.Central Asia's hopeThe world is moving towards drastic revolution on multiple fronts, and numerous shifting paradigms of the world hinge on China's encroachment on global territories. The Uyghur people may be suffering far away from us, but what happens in China very blatantly does not stay in China. Furthermore, those who are spatio-temporally isolated from us are often no less important in their struggles than we; no longer can the sorrow and despair of Xinjiang's inhabitants be swept under the rug of our own apathy and silence.Under the Belt and Road initiative, China undertakes a wide array of international infrastructure projects aimed at strategically implanting their political influence. Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan are all home to numerous ethnic and Islamic minorities that may stand in China's path to regional domination. Conveniently, these nations are, once again, rich in resources such as oil and crops, and are strategically located to give access to European and west Asian centers of power. We've seen and now know what China is capable of. If the world lets this expansion move forward, what do China's ambitions mean for Central Asia and beyond?We can never allow situations like in Xinjiang or Tibet to arise again. Our planet faces extreme cultural degradation when events like these are allowed to persist. Human rights abuses already plague many pockets of the world, but robbing innocent communities of their culture and stripping the vibrance of diversity from our earth is an entirely separate and unimaginable crime.Nonetheless, there is hope. We can begin by igniting the power of our voices. Silence will be the ultimate downfall of the Uyghurs' resistance, and the burden of speaking up cannot fall singly on their shoulders. We must consider the consequences of MIT's involvement in Uyghur suffering. Every day that we allow this to continue, we let China take further steps into turning Xinjiang and Tibet into virtual laboratories of high-tech human rights abuses.Some U.S. Senators, including Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Robert Menendez (D-NJ) introduced legislation to the Congressional Committee on Foreign Relations to hold Chinese officials accountable for crimes against humanity. This is a positive step, and we as American citizens must follow and pressure our representatives to turn their eyes to this conflict and work to alleviate the current suffering to any degree possible and prevent future disaster in Central Asian territories.There is a growing Uyghur independence movement at home in the United States. Some exiled Uyghurs, some of whom still have family members in camps in Xinjiang, currently living in the DC Metro area, including Falls Church, Virginia, still experience threats from China. But still they persist in their fight. They, like more and more across the globe, are standing up to voice their strength and stand in solidarity with the suffering Uyghurs in China.At the April 20 conference, two websites were introduced to give an opportunity for supporting the Uyghurs from afar. They allow for friends and families of missing Uyghurs to submit testimonies that can help locate their loved ones and to donate to and support the international causes for freedom. They are: izdeymiz.org and shahit.biz, translating from Uyghur to "we are searching" and "we are witnesses," respectively. I find these names fitting for our role as more than conscious onlookers - we are witnesses with voices ready, and we will always be searching; for all those who have not lost hope, and for those in whom this fight still endures, we will always be waiting.Load-Date: May 31, 2019End of Document

Marco Rubio was among users who spoke out about the suspensions, saying the company had "become a Chinese [government] censor."However, the company pushed back on similar suggestions, saying in a statement posted to the company's Public Policy page Saturday, that though "some of these were involved in commentary about China," the deletions were part of a "routine action" that suspended "a number of accounts" in an effort to target potential "platform manipulation.""These accounts were not mass reported by the Chinese authorities - this was a routine action on our part," the company said. "Sometimes our routine actions catch false positives or we make errors. We apologize. We're working today to ensure we overturn any errors but that we remain vigilant in enforcing our rules for those who violate them."Read more: China's internet censors are on high alert ahead of the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protestsThe company's explanation clarified that the action didn't originate with the Chinese government, but that didn't soothe concerns for all users. Yaxue Cao, founder and editor of ChinaChange.org, a website dedicated to writings on civil society and human rights, pointed out that the company's explanation doesn't add up to justify the suspensions."Per @Twitter's explanation, it's cleaning up CCP bots but accidentally suspended 1000s anti-CCP accts," Cao tweeted. "That doesn't make sense."Though the site said users whose accounts were deleted should be able to recover them, Gab, a social network that is popular among users affiliated with the alt-right and other fringe groups, seized on the incident to promote its own commitment to open posting, tweeting Sunday that the site was "We are working on getting in touch with the Chinese dissidents who Twitter banned on behalf of the Chinese government to get them on Gab."Widening trend of censorship ahead of Tiananmen anniversaryREUTERS/Soo Hoo Zheyang The incident sparked concerns because of its close proximity to the 30th anniversary of the bloody June 4 crackdown on pro-democracy protests at Tiananmen Square that has been accompanied by a tightening of censorship across the country.Twitter in particular site been long-targeted in the country, where users bypass the country-wide block with virtual-private network software. Late last year, China's Ministry of Public Security began to target Chinese Twitter users in a harsh development of President Xi Jinping's widespread campaign to            suppress internet activity.Under the order, a special police force was dedicated to finding, detaining, and interrogating users, who were then forced to delete their tweets.NOW WATCH: This startup turns 100 non-recyclable plastic bags into a high-end Bluetooth speakerSee Also:• These are the 25 celebrities most addicted to social media, from the Kardashians to Snoop Dogg• Huawei is planning to drop Google's operating system as soon as next month after being barred from working with US companies• China's internet censors are on high alert ahead of the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protestsSEE ALSO: A Twitter cofounder says a more diverse team would have addressed abuse earlier.

Happy Tuesday, everybody, thanks for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, May 21st, your top stories right now, just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Retail earnings this morning, kicking into high gear, we've got Home Depot results coming in momentarily, what it means to the state of consumer and the economy today.President Trump is talking tough on China and on trade, the highlights from his Pennsylvania rally last night, coming up.And easing restrictions on Huawei, the U.S. granting some exemptions to the blacklist on the Chinese technology and telecom giant, what it means for the trade negotiations, where are the exemptions, all of that, coming up.Millions of Instagram influencers hit by a data breach, their personal information exposed. We have the details and a look at whether it can be prevented from happening to you.MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Breaking news right now, Home Depot earnings are out better-than-expected, on the EPS line, right to Ashley Webster, we go with the numbers. Ashley.ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes. We have a 227 on the EPS. The estimate was for 218, so a nice 0.9 cent beat there, Maria, on the revenue coming in it at $26.4 billion just above the estimate of 26.35, so a nice beat on the top and bottom line.I'm just going through the comp sales here. Comp sales in the U.S. for Home Depot, up three percent, the company is saying it's very pleased with the underlying performance of the core business despite the unfavorable weather, the company says, in February.For a full year, the same-store sales estimate coming in at up five percent, which is also in line with the last estimate that the company put out for the full year, so they haven't downgraded at all, on the same- store's percentages.Let's see, four-year earning per share, up three percent, to $10.00 a share. So, all in all, this looks very positive but they do note that unfavorable weather, in February, did hurt sales some, but they're reaffirming their fiscal four-year outlook which will be gross revenue at around $111 billion for 2019.So, overall, Maria, it seems like the Home Depot, hitting the numbers.BARTIROMO: Yes, but the stock is not doing much, so that's what I'm questioning here, what the company is saying about the guidance and the same-store sales, we'll take a look at that, because the stock is, right now, showing really a flat performance down a fraction, actually, Ashley, we'll get back to you.WEBSTER: Yes, it's not --it's not blowing out numbers but it isn't missing them either.BARTIROMO: But it has turned around now. It is up half a percent.WEBSTER: Right.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much, Ashley Webster --WEBSTER: Sure.BARTIROMO: -- with the latest there. I want to bring in E-Valuator Funds Chief Investment Officer, Kevin Miller, get some reaction here. Overall, I know Home Depot is not one of the companies you necessarily follow, but broadly speaking, in terms of the earnings back drop, what can you tell us?KEVIN MILLER, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, E-VALUATOR FUNDS: Yes. Home Depot has -- it's a good company, in fact, it has, you know, when you look at individual stocks, you're looking for companies that have a good (INAUDIBLE) in fact, they're good protection from other entities coming in to compete with them, and then their cash flow, you know, what kind of free cash flow they're generating.They're a huge -- the largest provider in the retail space, so we look at Home Depot as being a good alternative to -- if you're looking to get into retail, they would be a good stock.BARTIROMO: What's driving markets, right now, from your standpoint?MILLER: Well, markets, right now, are kind of going sideways as a result of just the uncertainty of the China agreement. I think we're going to start seeing a slowdown in guidance, coming from corporations, going forward with earnings. We've seen decent earnings.The tailwind that we've had as a result of the tax breaks, that's becoming more of a breeze. I mean, we're still getting some momentum because the consumer is still healthy with regard to additional disposable income to spend.But the uncertainty that's in the -- in the marketplace as a result of the trade agreement is going to slow things down a little bit. I think we're going to see more volatility. It could actually be decent for the market, intermittently, and that corporations come out and they guide lower, and as a result, they have earnings surprises.So, I think we're going to see increase volatility right between quarterly earnings reports, so we could see some loan performance and then we'll see some surprises. The next thing I'd like to see the Fed do is just to continue their unwinding. They came very, very close to overshooting with their raises, as of last December.BARTIROMO: Yes, they sure did. We're going to get the FOMC minutes this week --MILLER: Yes.BARTIROMO: To give us a sense of what's on the Fed's mind. Would you expect a cut for the next move from the Federal Reserve, or just continue the wind down and do what you're doing?MILLER: Yes. What -- in the E-Valuator Funds, it's kind of -- we invest in fixed income and in equities, and so in our fixed income, we have pivoted from credit-based yield and convertibles into longer duration, higher quality.So we are expecting the Fed to stay where it's at, if not, cut. Now, if this trade agreement would've come to fruition, i could've seen the actual next move being a raise. I don't think you're going to see any Fed action in 2020 just because it's an election year, and that's kind of -- it's -- you don't that, right?BARTIROMO: Right.MILLER: You know, unless they do need a cut, but we don't expect any significant movement until they discontinue the unwinding of their (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: So, the firm is largely fixed income. What about stocks? We've got markets, this morning, trading up. Look at Futures indicating a gain of 133 points this morning, after markets were lower yesterday. Obviously, this China trade is rattling investors.But it feels, to me, like the markets are supportive and giving this President the benefit of the doubt, otherwise, I think we would have seen a much bigger selloff.MILLER: Absolutely. I miscommunicated. We have six investments and each of them has some allocation to fixed income are more conservative one, obviously, has more. So, we do invest in equities in all 6, and I agree 100 percent. When you look at the stock market, you look at fundamentals.And emotions and fundamentals can drive the market. The fundamentals have been strong, emotion, uncertainty, has been picking up. So that's why we are seeing this slowing down in growth that we've experienced.But you look at unemployment, it's great, you look at inflation, it's great, you look at initial unemployment claims are low, you look at housing permits are doing very strong.BARTIROMO: Right.MILLER: So, the fundamentals are strong, consumer confidence is good, we don't see a reason for any significant pull back.BARTIROMO: OK.MILLER: Even though since 1980, if you look at the average pullback (INAUDIBLE) pullback, the average is about 13.9 percent drop. So, we will have a period, this year, where we will have a significant drop.BARTIROMO: Sure.MILLER: And that's just an opportunity to get in.BARTIROMO: But it doesn't -- it doesn't feel like that right now, to you?MILLER: No, no, not at all.BARTIROMO: You know, the President was touting the economy (INAUDIBLE) backdrop in Pennsylvania last night, at a rally, and he also touched on the relationship with China, watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Our spirit is strong, our stride is back, and our stand is clear, we are finally putting, like I said, America, first.The United States added 263,000 jobs just last month, far exceeding any expectations. We will soon be taking in over $100 billion in tariffs. And remember this, they subsidize their product, people are moving from China now to go to areas that aren't tariffed.We're going to build places in Pennsylvania and others rather than like the old days, remember the old days? We actually made our own product, OK? We made our own product.Very expensive for China, they're not happy, but that's OK, it'll all work out.What they've done to us is indescribable, economically. We have rebuilt China. They've done a great job, and I don't blame China. I don't blame President Xi. I don't blame them. Look, we allowed it to happen, our leaders allowed it to happen. Well, it's not happening anymore.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: You know, it's interesting because, initially, people thought that a deal had to happen, but now, China's behavior, the national security risk, as well as the economic opportunity and risks are -- it's resonating with the broader public.MILLER: Real quickly, I think President Trump stopped the printing press in China. And the printing press is their history books, where they're going to, in five years, say, this is how China took over the globe without firing a shot.I.P. theft, acquisition of mineral rights throughout Africa, Huawei information gathering, there was a system in place. And you know what, if they won't negotiate with us now, when they're an emerging market, they're a smaller economy than us, how do you think they would negotiate with us in 5 to 10 years, when they're bigger than us, they are a developed economy.So, what we are doing now, we have to do.BARTIROMO: Yes.MILLER: And we just have to work our way through it.BARTIROMO: I agree with you. And, you know, that isn't even taking into account the national security risks, the way China is putting on, you know, military bases throughout the world, setting up islands, putting military bases there, really trying to compete with the U.S. military which is incredible. Not so fast, today, but at some point, maybe. Kevin, it's good to have you. Thank you.MILLER: Thank you very much. Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Thanks for weighing in, Kevin Miller, joining us there.We want to tell you about this, Dish Network is under pressure this morning, the stock has been selling off all night, Cheryl Casone with the details there, big story here, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: It really is, Maria, and good morning, so shares of Dish coming up a six percent decline from yesterday, to your point, down six percent in the premarket. Investors worried about this proposed merger between T-Mobile and Sprint, that that can possibly hurt Dish's sale of (INAUDIBLE) spectrum.Meanwhile, Sprint and T-Mobile appear to be gaining traction in that merger. The Wall Street Journal is reporting the Chairman of the FCC says he will back the deal if the companies agree to certain concessions. Two more stocks you want to watch today.Well, American Airlines is suing its Mechanics' Union, accusing them of staging a slowdown that's caused more than 2,000 flight cancellations and delays since February. American charges that the Mechanics are using the downshift for leverage in their contract talks.Now, Americans also warning the slowdown to cause trouble for the summer travel season which starts this Friday. There is the year to date chart, as you can see, on American.And you may have to get to the airport extra early this summer, get this, an airline group sees summer air travel going hit a record this year, and that's even with the grounding of Boeing's 737 Max aircraft.Airline, anticipating more than 257 million passengers between June 1st and August 31st that would be up more than three percent from last summer's record, and with the 737 Max, Maria, it's only about 0.5 percent of the aircraft that's flying in the air around the globe.BARTIROMO: Wow.CASONE: So, keep that in mind as you see the packed airport that you're about to enter into this summer.BARTIROMO: Yes. Cheryl, thank you. All right, we'll take a break. When we come back, Huawei restrictions have been eased a bit, we're going to tell you about the reprieve the government is offering, the U.S. offering temporary relief to the ban against the Chinese tech and telecom giant, what it means for trade negotiations, coming up.And then, big changes coming to Whole Foods, we've got those details right after this, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We have a big show this morning. Coming up, Senate Armed Services Committee Member, Senator Joni Ernst is here, a lot to talk about with her between China and Iran, Pennsylvania Congressman Dan Meuser, joining us this morning.France Business Chairman, Ambassador Pascal Cagni is here, to talk about Europe and a lot around that, Crunch Fitness CEO, Keith Worts, joining us this morning, coming up. Don't miss a moment of it, we've got a big show coming up.And we want to focus, right now, on Huawei. The U.S. government is temporarily easing some trade restrictions which were imposed just last week, on Huawei Technologies.The order expected to be published tomorrow, will give some suppliers and customers, a 90-day reprieve, joining the conversation this morning, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell, GOP Strategist John Thomas and CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell, great to see everybody this morning.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Great (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: Yes. So, you know, this Huawei reprieve is interesting, and I think all you really have to look at is that the performance of some of these stocks that were the suppliers to Huawei, and look at how they got killed in the last couple of days, like, Qualcomm, Intel, Broadcom, your reaction to this, Lindsey?LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH: (INAUDIBLE) yesterday was one, like, guidance for the year, so they're taking action. And it's interesting that this is all happening a week after the (INAUDIBLE) is put into place, or the sanctions are put into place.BARTIROMO: Because they saw the reaction.BELL: Exactly. And I think that maybe it's a tough arm tactic to really get China to the table to, you know, show them what we can really do and the impact that Trump has on their economy over there, because this is what --Well, Huawei is the golden crown, the crown jewel over there. There are other ways that he can really impact the manufacturing business, he can prevent manufacturers and semiconductor equipment manufacturers from selling their equipment.Semiconductor's chips, that is where this country really wants to take off, they need to make -- start making chips themselves.BARTIROMO: Yes.BELL: -- to excel.BARTIROMO: But I -- go ahead, Dagen.MCDOWELL: No, I was going to say, because you pointed this out, repeatedly, that you cannot separate these issues from one another, again, protecting our intellectual property and the thievery by China, in addition to trade talks and coming to agreement, in terms of improving our exports to that country.It's all one big thing. And this is clearly a way of trying to bring China back to the table. I'm talking about the exemptions --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: --of giving them a reprieve and saying, OK, we'll take some time, but this is part of the trade negotiations.JOHN THOMAS, GOP STRATEGIST: The news is tightening around Huawei, and the move here really is, it's not about Huawei, to me, it's about the suppliers, and it's also about the people who rely on Huawei's technology. Give them time to find something else.BARTIROMO: That's exactly right. Because you saw how investors reacted to the selloffs in the U.S. companies because they are the supplier to Huawei. But I don't know how they changed the behavior of Huawei. I don't think that happens. I mean, this is espionage at its best, and this is state- owned.Huawei is something I focused on for a long time for that reason. Take a look back at some of the comments over the last couple of months that we've gotten from, for example, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, A.I. Expert, the former President of Google China, Kai-Fu Lee, and then we had Huawei Technologies Chief Security Officer, Andy Purdy, on himself. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE, UNITED STATES: China is using technology in ways that will fundamentally put Americans at risk, this technology from Huawei that is now being put in place all across the world.It's a company that's very close to the Chinese government and will do what the Chinese government asks them to do. And so we have sounded the alarm, urging nation's security apparatuses from around the world, not to put this technology.BARTIROMO: Do you worry that there is sort of a score on people in China?KAI-FU LEE, CHAIRMAN & CEO, SINOVATION VENTURES: I think, the idea of using credit score exists in a lot of countries. In the U.S., there are scores that are run by the equivalent of Equifax. It's just that, I think, in China, it's perhaps more ambitious, I think, at this point. It's not different from an Equifax, but I think in the future, it may go further, but it's also culture-dependent.ANDY PURDY JR., CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER, HUAWEI: On the theft of intellectual property by the China government, that's not us. The China government does not speak for us, we don't speak through the China government.The China government does not need to hack into Huawei's products to be able to conduct the spying that they want to do around the world, just as they did when they hacked into the Office of Personnel Management a few years ago and stole all of our personal records.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: That was Huawei, defending itself, there, Andy Purdy was. But it's impossible to think that you're not going to get the behavior of the Chinese government when you've got the Chinese communists on the board of directors of Huawei.The chairman was part of the Communist Party and it's still very active at Huawei. So these are the kinds of issues that is surrounding this company.THOMAS: Well, you've got to remember; Huawei sells more smartphones than Apple. I mean, this is significant, although, it's being eased on Huawei right now. Let's not forget, Google just struck a major blow to Huawei, not allowing Huawei to deal on certain apps which will hurt their smartphone market no matter what --BARTIROMO: And this was a really important telling move that Google also, you know, took a step back because Google has been all in on China to the extent that it wasn't all in with the U.S. government, walking away from that Pentagon program and, in fact, helping the Chinese military, so that was a really important step, I think, that was -- that said a lot.MCDOWELL: And I want to just point out yesterday that we had a Department of Homeland Security warning about drones in this country that Chinese-made drones might be sending sensitive flight data to their manufacturers in China.And the vast majority of drones used in the United States are made in (INAUDIBLE) or actually made by this company, nearly 80 percent of the drones used in the U.S. and Canada, come from DJI, which is in Shenzhen, China.BARTIROMO: I'm really glad you mentioned that. This is resonating.MCDOWELL: Right. I think that, at least, the world is waking up.BARTIROMO: That's right.MCDOWELL: It started with the Trump administration's focus on China and the theft --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: -- and the espionage --BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: -- and now, a front -- they're putting it front --BARTIROMO: Yes. We'll be right backBARTIROMO: Welcome back. Privacy and big tech, the personal contact information of millions of Instagram influencers, released online, in a database, open for the public to see. The leak affected more than 49 million records.This comes as Microsoft is issuing a warning that a computer bug, the company recently found, could be used and exploited by malicious software, joining me right now is the CEO of Proofpoint, Gary Steele, and Gary, it's good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.And your products obviously include compliance solutions, security solutions for companies, why are we seeing so many breaches today?GARY STEELE, CEO, PROOFPOINT: I think the reality is that (INAUDIBLE) landscape is incredibly complicated and (INAUDIBLE) they're getting people's private information and they're financially benefiting from that.BELL: So there's this trend now for a lot of companies to move their databases into the Cloud.STEELE: For sure.BELL: AWS, Amazon is one of the biggest providers, how does that impact cybersecurity? Is it safer in the Cloud or is it better to have your stuff on the databases on premises?STEELE: Well, the Cloud is a -- is a really important infrastructure move for most companies. So, they are getting rid of all that information that is traditionally been on (INAUDIBLE) they're putting in the Cloud that cybercriminals are following them.And so, it's an easy way to target companies and their employees. The information is super critical, moving the Cloud, and could be hacked.BARTIROMO: You recently made an announcement that you were acquiring Meta Networks, provider of zero trust network access solutions, $120 million there. Tell us about that acquisition, what it does in terms of strengthening your ability to help and, you know, put these breaches at rest.STEELE: Yes. And we are super excited about it. So, what Meta does, is it allows a company to put policy around where individuals within the company and contractors can go. So, you basically can say you can only have access to one application or multiple applications, et cetera, and it really limits and better protects individuals within companies.THOMAS: What advice are you giving your customers that are Cloud -- that are based in the Cloud, is it just don't use the same password for all of your different devices, is it change it with frequency, or is just -- is it one of those things that there's nothing we can do, that it's up, you know, the Cloud gods to protect their system for us?STEELE: I think there a lot that companies can do. And I think, you know, what we recommend is that -- companies take a people (INAUDIBLE) approach. Look who is more vulnerable. Put controls in place that ensures that those specific people, if they are targeted, are going to be well protected.So, it can be everything from training people to know what to click on or not to click on, to two factor authentication. There are a lot of actions that companies can take, because you can't give up.THOMAS: And that seems to be the problem because there's so many (INAUDIBLE) in these large organizations that just aren't going to understand what not to click.(CROSSTALK)STEELE: One of the things we sell and help companies do is, raise the awareness of their employees so that people know what to click on and what not to click on.BELL: Business is booming, though, 20 percent revenue growth, free cash flow, 20 percent, that's what every investor's dream is.STEELE: Yes. We're really focused on this balance between growth and cash flow, and we think that that's -- that profile is what investors want, and we've had great sustainable growth over long period of time and increasing cash flow which we think gives us long term durability as a company.BARTIROMO: Gary, it's great to have your insights. Thanks so much.STEELE: Great. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.BARTIROMO: Gary Steele, joining us there. And Lindsey, you made a point earlier that the U.S. is trying to do a number of things to try to offset the loss of Huawei, but also make sure that we get coverage in some of these places that maybe Huawei is, in the rural areas, do you think that was probably behind the approval from the FCC yesterday?BELL: Yes. I thought the timing of the FCC approval of the Sprint, T- Mobile deal was very interesting, because Huawei's equipment is used in rural areas and those two, combined, are going to have a great presence in the rural areas and they have commitments in three to six years to really get wireless telecommunications ability to that region.BARTIROMO: It's interesting that that happened yesterday, and then today, we get this list of exemptions on Huawei, as the U.S. is trying to figure, but also, keep Huawei banned in the country. Thank you very much for joining us.Coming up, U.S.-Iran relations, I'll be speaking with one lawmaker, as the national security officials head to Capitol Hill for a briefing later today on the threat of Iran. And then the Eiffel Tower evacuated, why the French landmark was temporarily closed to visitors, that's next, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, May 21st. Your top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast.Retail earnings are in focus this morning. Home Depot reporting better than expected earnings and revenue. To stock up a $1.05 right now, that's one half of one percent. $192 where Home Depot shares.All right now, it is a Dow component, it is not having much effect on Futures. We were looking at a rally before the numbers came out. We remain looking at a higher start to trading this morning. The Dow Industrial set to open up about a 128 point, 2-1/2 of one percent.S&P futures are up 16 and the Nasdaq futures are higher by 66. This actually declines across the board yesterday. The technology-heavy Nasdaq, the hardest hit amid the Huawei blacklist, as we told you earlier, a number of high tech stocks getting -- taken a hit yesterday on the Huawei news, because their suppliers turf Huawei.And the markets yesterday were down 84, and the Dow down 19 on the S&P and the Nasdaq was down 114 points, 1-1/2 percent.European indices this morning are looking better, take a look, higher across the board, FT-100 up 52 or three-quarters of a percent. CAC Quarante in Paris is up 31, and the DAX index in Germany higher by 122 points.In Asia overnight, mixed performances, take a look the Shanghai Composite was up better than one and a quarter percent. As you can see, the others mixed. Whole Foods going green in a new way. We will tell you how.And the most famous monument in Paris shut down. A man was arrested for trying to scale the Eiffel Tower. Yes, there he is.Spring is in the air but it does not feel like that in Colorado this morning. There is a deep freeze going on complete with snow. We will take you there.First, our top story this half an hour, rising tensions with Iran. The country quadrupling its production of enriched uranium. Iranian officials stressing that it would be usable for a power plant, not an atomic weapon. Tehran setting a July 7th deadline for Europe to set new terms for a deal or it will enrich closer to weapons-grade levels, it says. So, they're threatening Europe.Yesterday, President Trump spoke about this and the tough stand he's got on Iran right now.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We have no indication that anything's happened or will happen, but if it does, it will be met obviously, with great force. We'll have no choice.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The White House is set to brief Congress on the Iran Threat today. Joining me right now is Iowa Senator, Senate Judiciary, Agriculture, and Armed Services Committee member Joni Ernst.Senator, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks very much for being here.SEN. JONI ERNST (R-IA): Good morning. Thank you so much.BARTIROMO: Can you characterize the threat of Iran right now? It does to have things worsen?ERNST: We do have a briefing today. So, we will learn more about that particular threat, but yes, certainly, there has been an imminent threat for our president to evacuate our embassy in Baghdad. It's pretty significant.BARTIROMO: Yes, I know that you made a statement on China which is the other big story right now. And I want to talk to you about trade, as well as the national security risks. The White House pushing for the passage of U.S. USMCA, saying it will boost economic growth and create jobs as the US- China trade battle goes on. Before we get into China, do you expect USMCA to pass?ERNST: I do. I do, I am very hopeful. But now the pressure is on the House to make sure that it is moving. So, we will keep encouraging our constituents to reach out to our delegations in the House, put the pressure on Speaker Pelosi to actually honor her obligation in passing and as -- so we can get this ratified quickly.BARTIROMO: So, you know, the Speaker has said she's not sure if it's actually even going to come to the floor. I mean, I know it will probably pass if it comes to the floor, but is it even possible that she wouldn't bring it to the floor this year?ERNST: Well, she needs to bring it to the floor, and she needs to encourage her members to be supportive of this deal. We've worked very hard and long on this. And in Iowa, it's very important, one in five jobs in Iowa is tied directly to trade. And Canada and Mexico are two of our largest trading partners. So, we do want to make sure that we're good trade partners to our neighbors.We have seen the tariffs -- the 232 tariffs removed by the president, he did that last Friday. Very supportive of his actions, now we need to move on the USMCA.BARTIROMO: Yes, and your constituents are getting impacted by all of this. We want to talk about broadband for rural America. You are part of a bipartisan effort to increase access to the high-speed Internet in rural areas. And we know that in certain rural areas of this country, Huawei is being used.ERNST: Right, exactly. And through this bill, we're able to help these smaller rural telecom companies with regulation. There are so many overwhelming burdensome regulations coming from the federal government that can't apply to larger companies, but it's detrimental to these small rural telecom companies.One company that I heard from in Northeast, Iowa, annually if it had to file with the SEC, it would cost about $800,000 to $1 million. That's pretty significant for folks in the rural areas. So, if we can help ease that burden certainly we'd love to do so.BARTIROMO: So, will you be able to pick up the lost -- the lost communication as a result of Huawei? How does the Huawei ban and now today's reprieve -- temporary reprieve impact your constituents in rural America?ERNST: Well, certainly it will be tough, but we will find a way. We certainly need to move away from China, we need to move away from Huawei in these areas. And the president is very encouraging. So, I think that we will find a way, we will continue developing here in the United States, and we'll make it much easier for our folks in rural America.BARTIROMO: Yes, we were having a conversation earlier -- Dagen and I about this China partnership. And for a long time, many people looked at this as just an economic story in a trade story. But there are real national security risks having to do with China, whether it's Huawei or their behavior elsewhere in terms of their efforts to try to overtake the U.S. military.Give us your sense of the national security risks around China, and what can be done about it. And how important a trade deal is in all of that, and tariffs.ERNST: Yes, absolutely. I always look at trade and I look at national security, they go hand-in-hand. China needs to be a good trade partner with us, they have treated the United States horribly for many years with the theft of intellectual property, and forced technology transfers, and the utilization of many of their products is a national security risk when we look at technology.So, we do need to move away from those products we need to make sure that China is a fair trade partner, and all of that the president has been working very hard on. We will be visiting with Bob Lighthizer, the U.S. trade rep today at our luncheon. And we expect to hear a lot more about China coming from Mr. Lighthizer today.MCDOWELL: Senator, its Dagen McDowell. You won that seat in the Senate running on the fact that you come from a family that raised hogs. And I remember that ad very well, what is going on with the hog farmers in your state, and the farmers who were very negatively impacted with the fight with China over this trade deal?ERNST: This has been very, very hard on our hog farmers and our soybean farmers. Of course, the tariffs around China make it difficult on those producers. And I have heard from a number of those farmers.One hog farmer, in particular, he and his young wife, they had hoped to take over their father's operation, and he stated, I can't do that now, I've had to take off-farm employment to make ends meet.The tariffs have been very, very detrimental to them, very hard. That's why we need a deal with China soon. But you know what, the president, he is doing the right thing, and was China that backed away from these negotiations.We have moved along so well, and then, China basically went back on everything that they had agreed to. So, the president is using the tariffs as leverage, but I'm telling you, our farmers are feeling the pinch. We'd like to see these done soon -- these trade deals done soon.BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, if they don't agree to national security issues in terms of the theft of I.P., as far as other behavior. The monitoring of all of its citizens including Americans. I mean, can you actually do a trade deal when you've got these other open questions? Or do you need them to make that Chinese law, which initially, they had -- I guess said they would, and then reneged on?ERNST: Yes, and I believe that they need to move ahead with that. China needs to honor its obligations, and it can't just be just a regulation, it does need to be codified.The Chinese decided they didn't want to do that at the last minute. But we need to push them further. We have a strong healthy economy, it is really doing quite well. The Chinese are not doing as well. And so, we hope that we can bring them to the table. Let's agree to trade agreement. Let's move forward.BARTIROMO: Senator, good to see you this morning. Thank you so much.ERNST: Thank you very much.BARTIROMO: Senator Joni Ernst, there. Meanwhile, Whole Foods ditching plastic straws among other things. Cheryl Casone with the details there, Cheryl.CASONE: Such a trend with plastic straws. Whole Foods has yet decided to drop the straws in its stores in the United States, U.K., and Canada all this summer. Instead, they're going to offer paper straws at the juice and coffee bars, they'll start that in July.Whole Foods also planning to replace hard-plastic cases for those (INAUDIBLE) and chickens with bags made up of 70 percent less plastic. Take a look at shares of Whole Foods for an Amazon, higher in the premarket. As you can see at more than one percent.Well, big news this morning. The Eiffel Tower in Paris is now back open. After a man scale the iconic landmark and it caused six hours of chaos yesterday there. More than 2,500 tourists had to be evacuated. Police eventually convinced the guy to surrender just as he was approaching the peak of the nearly 1,100-foot tower. Unclear how the climber got past security, or why he decided to climb the Eiffel Tower.And there is this Jeopardy's reigning champ, making quite an impression, rocking up a 23rd straight win. He was back yesterday, big news, James Holzhauer, won nearly $1.8 million thus far. This puts him third in all- time winnings. He is going to be back on tonight. People are now starting to analyze, Maria, his strategy on the Internet.BARTIROMO: I love it.CASONE: Yes, the way that he's putting down his really -- you know, intensive bets and he's aggressive.BARTIROMO: Very cool. What makes somebody scale the Eiffel Tower? I mean, what -- I don't know what this guy was thinking.BELL: When if he's almost at the top, must to let him finish.MCDOWELL: What about the guy that scaled the Trump Tower.THOMAS: Or (INAUDIBLE) the Statue of Liberty.BARTIROMO: Oh, my God.MCDOWELL: Yes, it would get you one thing or arrested.BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly. Coming up, burning calories, not dollars. The CEO of Crunch Fitness in the house. How would business of breaking a sweat is changing? We'll tell you about it.Then, five straight, Golden State Warriors headed back to the finals. Those details right after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Headlines across America this morning. The Boston Globe reports: "Why Wynn consider selling its Everett casino when it's so close to opening?" The news sent shockwaves to political circles yesterday. Confused policymakers trying to understand Wynn's motivation and what the sale might mean.The Denver Post writes this morning: "Colorado weather: Denver under winter weather advisory as Front Range gets May blast of snow." We're less than a week away from Memorial Day, but it is still snowing hard in Colorado this morning. The National Weather Service reporting nine-inches of new snow in some areas, just before 9:00 p.m. last night. Parts of the state, under a winter storm warning.And the San Francisco Chronicle this morning reports: "Sweep complete: warriors ready for their date with history." The Warriors overcoming a big deficit to sweep the blazers and lose their fifth straight NBA final. We'll get more in sports coming up. But first, the big business in fitness. My next guest, weighing on the competitive gym industry as we kick off the summer this weekend. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: We have breaking news right now. Merck is going to acquire Peloton Therapeutics; Merck just announcing this now. The company is set to buy all outstanding shares for $1.05 billion. Now, Peloto Therapeutics was going to go public, but now Merck is acquiring that. We will look for more info on that and check out the reaction within health care, coming up. But first, survival of the fittest; Big Box Gyms is competing with boutique fitness classes and niche workouts. Joining us right now to talk about the business is the CEO of Crunch, Keith Worts. Keith it's great to have you, thanks so much for joining us.KEITH WORTS, CEO, CRUNCH: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: How is business going? I mean, I know Crunch has its own individual story, the company filed for bankruptcy protection back in 2009 and then came back and has been growing pretty strongly and consistently.WORTS: We have. We have over 300 locations today. We started with -- in 2010 we had 20 locations. So, we've grown significantly over the last 10 years.BARTIROMO: Then, how is that growth happening?WORTS: So, there's obviously significant tailwinds in the fitness business; there's a lot of new entrance into the market that's created a lot of folks that are interested in working out in gyms and we've been able to capture a lot of that market.MCDOWELL: Is one of the biggest competitive threats, though, the Peloton user, the mirror user which is kind of more new-fangled way of interacting with -- in a class structure. Is that a competitive threat than other boutique gyms, whether it's a boxing gym or a cycling gym?WORTS: It's not. The digital workout experience is more complementary than it is competitive for us. So, we have a product called Crunch Line, which is online digital workout platform. So, if you're a member of Crunch, you get to come in to our gyms and work out, you also have the ability to go home and take Crunch with you on the go.BARTIROMO: The mirror you can look at -- it's like you're in a class, right? You can do it in anything -- yoga, in aerobics, whatever it is.MCDOWELL: Right, and it doesn't require giant piece of fitness equipment sitting in, you know, sitting in your office for you to do it.BARTIROMO: So, what are you doing in digital way? Do you need to get more involved in digital products like what Dagen is bringing up?WORTS: Again, it's a piece of what we do. This product, Crunch Line, we have a 100 workout classes that are online and you can go and stream it at home, you can bring it with you to the gym. But Crunch is really about community of people that want to come together and fitness today is more social. People are spending their money, social currency, if you will, on workouts to meet people and have a good time and create community of people.BARTIROMO: So, what's the strategy? How do you get growth accelerating from here?WORTS: We expect to double in the next five years; we have got commitments from franchisees to grow by over 300 more locations in the next five years.BARTIROMO: Wow.WORTS: That will be six-700 locations by 2022.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And are you investing in current locations? I know, I go to the one in Tribeka and you've done some new things there, with the equipment?WORTS: We've been able to adapt our floor plans to reach that market segment that's out there, looking for more of a competitive workout or high-intensity workout. So, we put turf and functional zones in our gyms and we've been reinvesting back in our locations, again, to kind of modernize and adapt our floor plans.MCDOWELL: You got to have some turf. You have to have some turf in all gyms, because that was something that was kind of missing from traditional gym that's present in say, pro-athlete gyms. What's the hottest workout? Because again, with these gyms, it's all about innovating on classes, that's really, I know what drives traffic particularly in New York and Los Angeles. What's the hottest thing you've got going?WORTS: So, I say HIIT workouts; things that really are high-intensity, interval training. HIIT, H-I-I-T, people really want to come in and have a tough workout, and get their heart rate up and have a really great experience and take away from -- create a diversion, if you will from everything --MCDOWELL: But if you're not a little nauseated, you're not working hard enough.BARTIROMO: How's pricing? Are you going to raise prices soon? What are you expecting?WORTS: Well, we have two different business models. We have our signature locations that are here in New York and San Francisco that are priced in the premium end of the market. So, we're able to take pricing up $2.00, $3.00, $4.00 a month each year, and then our business model is in the lower price category of $10.00 to $20.00 a month and those pretty much stay static and really go after a different market share.BARTIROMO: Do you see business pick up during -- I mean, of the year, summer time, bikini season, things like that? Are these seasonal catalyst for you?WORTS: Over the last 20 years. That's really kind of flattened a bit; it's a little bit even throughout the year. You still have peak in January, and then also pre-summer, for sure.BARTIROMO: All right. Keith, great to have you. Thank you so much.WORTS: Thank you for having me.BARTIROMO: Keith Worts from Crunch.

Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, June 27th. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast. We have breaking news this morning on trade. President Xi Jinping will present President Trump with terms to actually move forward on a deal.Among them, Xi Jinping is going to insist that the President lift the ban on Huawei as part of any U.S.-China trade deal. That's according to the Wall Street Journal. They also want the President to do away with all punitive tariffs. I will speak with Huawei Technology's Chief Security Officer Andy Purdy in just a few moments coming up right here live. President Trump of course is in Japan at the G20 meeting.He had dinner last night with the Prime Minister of Australia, Scott Morrison where the President talked about U.S. allies and trade deficits. Markets this morning are mixed. Take a look at the Dow Industrials, it is down but it is off of the lows. It actually would be up if not for Boeing. Dow futures right now showing a decline of 33 points. The S&P futures are up four points and the NASDAQ futures up 21.Boeing is the issue because the company has discovered an additional software issue in the 737 Jet Max. As a result, the stock is down almost three percent. That is taking more than 100 points off the Dow Jones Industrial average. Yesterday, markets started the day very strong on an erroneous report at -- when all was set and done, the Dow Industrials were down 11 points. Yesterday the S&P was down three and the NASDAQ was up 25.In Europe this morning, take a look at indices, we are seeing some weakness there as well. FT-100 down 23 points, CAC Quarante down 12. The DAX Index in Germany is up about 15 points. In Asia overnight, markets rally on U.S.-China trade optimism as well. Shanghai Composite was up two-thirds of a percent, the Hong Kong, Hang Seng Index was up almost 1-1/2 percent. Last night was the first Democratic debate focusing on the economy and President Trump.We've got all the highlights, the lowlights and the moments that went viral. Plus, the big business of Amazon. The retail giant teams up with a major drugstore chain for package pick up. Find out where you will be able to get your orders. By the way, Rite Aid shares are down sharply because the company is predicting a loss for the year. We'll tell you about that as well. All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Washington Examiner Commentary Writer and Editor, Siraj Hashmi and Fox News Contributor, columnist for The Hill, Liz Peek. Great show so far everybody.LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. Lots of energy. Lots going on always.BARTIROMO: So much going on this morning.PEEK: Find and talk about the debate.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: You want to quickly talk about Bernie Sanders has an editorial ahead of the second debate tonight. Trump is the worst kind of socialist and I don't agree with much of this. Again, it's Democratic populism that more power needs to go to the Federal government to fix all these things. Again, attacking the fossil fuel industry, the pharmaceutical business.However, there is a chunk of this in here that is the where is my bailout? He talks about the bank bailout. Remember the where is my bailout chant?PEEK: Sure.MCDOWELL: It -- that ultimately led to the birth of the tea party in this country. So this is populism that crosses party lines.PEEK: Well, there is a real right-left alliance on opposing corporate cronyism. Remember, one of the things the tea party did early on was trying to get rid of X.M. banks. Something I really thought was wrong. But they thought it was sort of another example of helping get big companies. I thought the one thing that unified the group last night, all those candidates, they hate big corporations, they think they're terrible for America, terrible for workers.I disagree with that. I think big corporations have been responsible for some bad stuff, but I also think they provide jobs and R and D and all the rest of that.MCDOWELL: What's the alternative? If it's not the free market in private industry it is the government, they believe --PEEK: Yes. No question.MCDOWELL: -- that they make better decision with your money and about your life and about your healthcare, than you do as an individual. It is removing the power and the thought of the individual.BARTIROMO: That's why Medicare for All eliminates 180 million people's healthcare.MCDOWELL: Here's Tracy Flick, Elizabeth Warren with her hand in the air. That's going to come back to haunt.BARTIROMO: And Bill de Blasio also said yes. I want --(CROSSTALK)SIRAJ HASHMI, COMMENTARY WRITER AND EDITOR: What's interesting though, I would say millenials as a whole, they've been very attracted to some of these extremes in the political spectrum.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Do they understand them?HASHMI: That's the thing, is there's been a historical disconnect among many millenials. You have Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez making this comparison of detention centers to concentration camps, like that's just a fundamental disconnect right there.BARTIROMO: Yes.HASHMI: And people don't understand that in many ways, if they don't trust the other party, with their -- with what -- you know, their healthcare decisions, why would they vote for something for -- like the government to have more power if they say, the Republican Party then comes into control? And then they, you know, undo everything.BARTIROMO: Yes. It's a good point. So check out the Journal's op-ed, this is a Bernie Sanders op-ed before tonight, day two of the next debate, Democratic debate. By the way, we're going to get GDP out in about 25 minutes, 3.1 percent growth expected for the final reading of the first quarter. The breaking news of the morning though, President Trump is in Japan for the G20 Summit.While here's there he could sign off on trade deal with China, but there appears to be some serious terms. Our own Blake Burman is live in Osaka. And when I look at these terms, Blake Burman, to me looks like we're back at square one and we're not going to get a China-U.S. trade deal.BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: The timing of this is interesting too, Maria, because this article popped from the Wall Street Journal in which they say Chinese officials as to what the Chinese President Xi Jinping is going to want from President Trump when they sit down on Saturday for these talks. So the President got to Osaka here earlier this morning two hours ago and then you've got this article in which China sort of spells out what they want.Ending the ban on Huawei and then also ending all of the tariffs. That is sort of the lead-in to all of this when President Trump and President Xi will be meeting on Saturday. It is Thursday night here in Osaka, the President has been on the ground a couple hours, he's already had one meeting with the Australian Prime Minister, we'll be done for the day and then things pick up tomorrow as President Trump will be meeting with five different leaders then including Russia's Vladimir Putin.He will also have meetings on Saturday of course with the four mentioned Xi Jinping of China. In the lead up to the G20, U.S. officials were saying that the President would be comfortable if there was not any progress made because tariffs are intact. The Chinese leading up to this are saying that they want those tariffs gone. But yesterday, on this very show, the President reiterated that the tariffs could very well keep on going.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Look, we have lost billions and billions and trillions of dollars with China, right? We're not taking in billions and billions of dollars and I've only done the phase one. Phase one is 25 percent of 250 billion. I haven't done phase two yet. Now, phase two doesn't have to be 25 percent, it could be 10 percent which people can absolutely handle, but our people aren't get a pay for that either.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: So Maria, according to the Wall Street Journal, China is prepared to ask for a for ban -- for the ban on Huawei to be removed for tariffs removed as well, but the other side of the equation is what are they willing to give to the U.S.? That this morning remains unclear. Maria?BARTIROMO: All right. Thank you so much. Blake Burman in Japan this morning. Joining me right now is Chief Security Officer of Huawei Technology, Andy Purdy here in our studio this morning. Andy it's very nice to see a you. Thanks so much for joining us.ANDY PURDY, CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER OF HUAWEI TECHNOLOGY: Thank you. Good to be here.BARTIROMO: You have and I have spoken and even sparred in the past in issue in this issue over China and U.S. Blake just mentioned the breaking news of the day, that the "The Wall Street Journal" is reporting that Chinese Xi Jinping wants Huawei ban lifted and he wants punitive tariffs removed while at G20. Now we've spoken a lot about the relationship between Huawei and the Chinese government. If there is not a direct link between Chinese government and Huawei why would Chinese government want this ban listed so much?PURDY: Let me say two things. The second point is people don't understand the way the United States government works. If they think any agreement between U.S. and China is going to eliminate all restrictions on Huawei's ability to do business in the United States. We will not be allowed to do business unless there are strict government monitored risk mitigation processes. A trade deal is not going to affect that.Secondly, we do not want and we do not speak for the Chinese government, and they don't speak for us. We still welcome the opportunity to talk directly with U.S. government to work out these proven risk mitigation measures.BARTIROMO: Now you say that you don't speak for the Chinese government yet the founder, the chairman of the company, is actually a member of the Communist Party.PURDY: Well there are -- there are 88 million members of the Communist Party a Communist country.BARTIROMO: Right I know but I mean, for you to say that you don't speak for the Chinese government, you've got your founder who said so much in fact I've got a quote here. He says, "We sacrificed interest of individuals and families for the sake of idea to stand at top of the world," Ren said an interview with Chinese state media, "For this idea there will be conflict with United States sooner or later."PURDY: Well, I had opportunity to speak at length with Mr. Ren when I was in China last week, and I am confident that he wants as we do, Huawei employees in United States, we want to talk with U.S. government and we recognize that no deal is going to allow Huawei to participate without government monitored risk mitigation and we welcome that.BARTIROMO: So Huawei has not spoken with the U.S. government?PURDY: Well, we have spoken to U.S. government over time, in terms of the current situation, we have had some technical conversations but we have not had substantive conversations that we welcome.BARTIROMO: Tell me about the impact that this ban on Huawei has had on the company. I mean you have been vocal, and in terms of the economic hit. It's also hit U.S. companies by the way because of the relationship -- the suppliership that goes on between companies like QUALCOMM and Intel and Micron Technology. What is the impact of the ban?PURDY: Well, there was some discussion last week, about the potential decrease in projected revenues. Mr. Ren said last week, perhaps speaking to "Fox" that we project up to a 30-billion-dollar reduction in projected increased profits. The impact in terms of our suppliers, of course, is not going to be fully felt until August 19 when back is in place because they are still allowed to apply from us, so we believe there may be a hit over time but if we're not allowed to be able to buy from American suppliers long term we hope, and we hope to because we welcome those partnerships. It will have impact on us but we are able to deal with it.BARTIROMO: Now one of the issues, obviously, has been that Huawei represents a security issue, national security is what Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has told me on this program and many people many times because the fact is because of the connection with the Chinese government, if at any time any of the data that the Chinese government wants data from U.S., that data can go directly to the Chinese government.PURDY: Well the fact I think is a misunderstanding about the role of the telecom operators and the equipment providers like us. We can only get access to any of the data if the telecom operators give it to us and in fact we have very limited access to the data. They have to give us written permission every time we access data and we only do it from special laptops and they record every keystroke of laptops, so its fully auditable, our access quite limited to the data.BARTIROMO: Well now wait a minute because we know that there were back doors found, in the number of situations. So you and I talked last time we had an interview about the Vodafone situation. There was an executive at Vodafone who found hidden back doors in their Huawei equipment. Their equipment was in Italy at the time and Vodafone had to raise their hand and tell Huawei there was backdoor. We see that there is a backdoor going right back to the Chinese government for our data and then it was rectified.There's also obviously data from the African Union in Ethiopia that was sent about directly to Shanghai overnight that there were engineers that found that overnight when nobody was at their desk, the system was very active and there was all of this transferring of data going to China. So we know, Huawei has all of these back doors. You are the security officer. Are you telling me you were unaware of this Andy?PURDY: Long before media accurately publicized publicity about Vodafone. Vodafone came out and said there were no such back doors. That is what their official position has been. That is what Vodafone Italy has said.BARTIROMO: We know there were back doors.PURDY: Vodafone says there were not backdoors.BARTIROMO: Vodafone actually said there were back doors.PURDY: No, subsequently said they were wrong.BARTIROMO: Because then they had to rectify; they got it rectified.PURDY: No, that's not what their position is.BARTIROMO: What about the African Union? What about the African Union?PURDY: I am not really familiar with those allegations.BARTIROMO: How can you not be familiar, you're the security officer?PURDY: But, I'm security officer for Huawei in United States. My understanding is that there was no direct connection, to senior leadership of Huawei from that situation.BARTIROMO: It has been widely reported that there was massive activity during the night for the African Labor Unions and as a result it was found that there were back doors. In Ethiopia the data was going directly back to Chinese government.PURDY: The fact is that there is no proof that Huawei was involved in those back doors and as you see.BARTIROMO: That is actually not true. That's not true. We know that there's actual evidence from the Africa situation.PURDY: What Secretary of State Pompeo and Vice President Pence in their efforts to block Huawei around the world found that because they could give no evidence of significant cyber security wrongdoing by Huawei anywhere in the world, our allies are pushing back and our allies want to continue to buy from Huawei using proven risk mitigation measures.BARTIROMO: Well we will see about that. I want to talk about that. Let's take a short break because there's a story this morning and I want to ask you about the so-called civil fusion with military, civil military fusion. We're back with Andy Purdy. He's the Chief Security Officer Huawei Technologies this morning live in our studio.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. I'm back with Andy Purdy, the chief security officer at Huawei Technologies on a day that we have really breaking news where Xi Jinping, the president of China, is going to be presenting President Trump with come terms when they meet on Saturday.And one of the terms in order to move forward on any China deal with the United States, the president of China says it must include the ban being lifted on Huawei. And Andy Purdy, I appreciate you joining us this morning on this important news day.One question has come up about who really owns Huawei, is it owned by the employees? Who owns Huawei?PURDY: Well it's an employee owned company, there are 90,000 or so who own shares in the company.BARTIROMO: Well that's actually not true, I mean one percent is owned by your chairman, Mr. Ren, 99 percent is owned by the union, and the union is overseen by the Chinese government.PURDY: Well the union is not overseen by the Chinese government and -BARTIROMO: But this is a state union.PURDY: And the fact is we have ownership shares and we get to vote. I just met with the chairman of the - of the company, just met with him last week.BARTIROMO: He owns one percent of the company, that -PURDY: That's Mr. Ren, this is the chairman of the board, who's elected to run the - run the board.BARTIROMO: OK.PURDY: Yes. And we're a privately owned company, in fact we got our distribution (inaudible) in May.BARTIROMO: Well the labor union owns the company, 99 percent of it, and the labor union is overseen by the Chinese government. If the Chinese government says to you, look, we need to see this data from the U.S. military, you're going to be forced to send that data to the - to the Chinese government. Isn't that right?PURDY: We can't send the Chinese government data we don't have.BARTIROMO: Well how do you not have it, it's your company?PURDY: No the data in terms of our dealing with customers, the telecom operators control the data. We don't control the data. We own the - own the equipment once it's deployed (ph).BARTIROMO: Unless there are backdoors, and we have evidence that there are in fact back doors.PURDY: The principal deputy director of national intelligence said that they can test for backdoors. We are open to objective testing, verifiable facts so that we all know which products are worthy of trust.BARTIROMO: Has the U.S. government checked for backdoors in your technology recently?PURDY: Well I'm not sure if they've checked for anyone's backdoors in anyone's technologies recently. They monitored our traffic for five years and they could not find any wrongdoing by Huawei in Operation Shock Giant (ph) that Snowden revealed.BARTIROMO: Tell me about civil military fusion.PURDY: Well the reports about Huawei employees participating in research for the government is not the kind of thing that Huawei does, unlike other companies in the United States and around the world, we do not do those kinds of specialized projects for the military.We did not authorize those employees to do it and we did not know that those employees were doing it.BARTIROMO: You didn't authorize them to do it, but we know today that several Huawei employees have collaborated on research projects with the Chinese government, Bloomberg this morning is out with an extensive report talking about Chinese armed forces personnel indicating closer ties to the country's military than - than people really acknowledged and civil military fusion is basically you can't have an innovation in China without first going to the military about it, right?PURDY: Well that's not the experience with our company with 80 some thousand patents including over 10,000 U.S. patents. We don't collaborate with the military before we seek those innovations.BARTIROMO: But this is sort of underlying the national security risk, basically China wants to become the superpower of the world, overtaking the U.S. in terms of the military, right? So -PURDY: The U.S. government is definitely much more concerned about China than they are about Huawei. But the fact is, there are objective and transparent mechanisms to protect and manage the risk.But the - regarding the access to data, that can be completely controlled and protected in the telecom operators are doing that quite thoroughly.BARTIROMO: How do you think this is going to fix itself? What are you expecting, how do you expect this to play out, Andy?PURDY: Well if the United States government is willing to talk with us, I think we can come to agreement about how we can operate in the United States with particular limitations such as it might be that we can't sell to the government, we can't sell into the critical infrastructure.We want to be able to support our tier three, the rural wireless customers and we want to be able to buy from American companies. We think America has the best technology and we want to be able to buy it.So in the long term, we'll be able to do business when we have good standards, we don't have those good standards yet.BARTIROMO: Andy stay with us, Andy Purdy, we'll be right back.And we are back with Andy Purdy of Huawei Technologies and Andy we're going back and forth in terms of the connection to the Chinese government. The story really has been is that this company has been littered with theft in terms of stealing trade secrets from the likes of Cisco, Microsoft, T- Mobile and the list goes on, Motorola.I mean that's one of the issues that consumers look at Huawei and say how could we trust them? They've stolen all of this intellectual property, and now they want to get bigger and actually dominate the industry.PURDY: Well if you Google the names of major companies in the same industry, you will - it's replete with stories of law suits involving intellectual property. And we have - as far as I know, there's never been an instance where a court has ordered us to pay damages in such a case.And the non-disclosed -BARTIROMO: Well you've settled the cases, you settled with Motorola, you settled with Cisco, you settled with T-Mobile. So we know that you have paid because you've settled these lawsuits.PURDY: The non-disclosure agreements don't let us say whether or not we paid, but there are instanced - numerous instances where we did not have to pay anything in connection with those cases.BARTIROMO: Andy let me ask you a bit about you, you're an American citizen, right?PURDY: Yes.BARTIROMO: You worked for the U.S. government. So how did you end up at Huawei?PURDY: Well I was recruited by John Suffolk, our global chief with a vision that I would be able to be responsible for the U.S. security part of what we do. And I'd be able to participate in trying to make cyberspace safer, and that's why we want to have objective standards that apply to everybody with verifiable testing.Cisco had eight backdoors recently, nobody asked them questions.BARTIROMO: We don't know that Cisco had any backdoors.PURDY: It's well publicized that they had eight backdoors.BARTIROMO: We know that Huawei has backdoors.PURDY: And the question is who put the backdoors in and why does no one ask questions about those backdoors.BARTIROMO: Andy Purdy, thanks for joining us.PURDY: You're welcome.BARTIROMO: We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, June 27th. We have breaking news right now. We are waiting the final reading for the GDP for the first quarter. Economists are expecting an increase of growth of 3.1 percent for the quarter. That's what it's been so this is the final reading. We also have jobless claims coming out. The numbers and full analysis straight ahead. It's going to be out in 10 seconds' time. As we await the breaking news, let's take a look at markets, futures indicating pretty much a gain at the start of trading.The Dow Futures are down five points, but that has everything to do with Boeing. S&P Features are up six, and the NASDAQ Futures right now up about 30 points. As you see there, markets are waiting on the GDP number. Now - - and it is expected up 3.1 percent for the first quarter on the GDP. We are waiting on those numbers and we see the market pretty steady.MacroMavens President, Stephanie Pomboy this morning and Stephanie is going to give us her read on where we are right now in the economy. Stephanie, good to have you this morning.STEPHANIE POMBOY, PRESIDENT, MACROMAVENS: Thank you very much for having me.BARTIROMO: Yes. And we are, right now, looking at the -- 3.1 is the number right in line with the estimates at 3.1 percent growth for the first quarter, for the GDP, just coming out hitting the tape right now. Stephanie, your reaction.POMBOY: As expected, you know, this third revision, they usually have it nailed at that point. So, obviously, the question is second quarter and thereafter, and as we've talked about before, you know, this first quarter number was inflated by perversely by the tariff affect, where companies rushed to import goods ahead of the anticipated tariffs Jan 1, which, of course, were delayed and whatnot. But that had the effect of boosting inventories and adding to the trade number.So, in the second quarter, those two factors should come out which is why the number -- the forecast for the second quarter is more around 1-1/2. Atlanta Fed is at 1.9, New York fed's 1.4, but I think the trend -- the underlying trend growth in the economy is closer to 1-1/2 right now. So, that's really what we're working with, and the question is, in my view, will a shift in fed policy be sufficient to arrest and reverse this slowdown that we're seeing in activity?And I guess my feeling is they've already waited too long. You know, we talked about this basically all of last year. I was sitting here talking about how Q2 was going on in the background and everyone was so focused on the fiscal stimulus and the boost from the tax cuts that no one was paying attention to what the Fed was doing in the background.BARTIROMO: Yes.POMBOY: And I was so concerned that when we got to January 1, and the tax cut lift started to fade, that people would realize, hey, you know, what's the Fed doing all this time? And now Wall Street's come to this kind headed-smacking epiphany that, oh, my gosh, look, they are tightening, they're taking, you know, liquidity out of the banking system. Rates going up and we're seeing the slowdown in the economy as if that was some great shock.MCDOWELL: What did -- what did you say in December that the Federal Reserve will cut -- historically cuts rates exactly six months after the last tightening. So, they're about on course. What is fed doing right now in terms of the reduction in the balance sheet? Have they eased off it? Will they be done by September or even sooner?POMBOY: Well, they slowed down the piece of the draining of the balance sheet, and I think their timeframe was that they would cease entirely by September and then trying go to figure out what's the proper sort of normalized level of reserves the system. But, you know, this, to my thinking, has been a much bigger factor and the Fed itself realized, you know, they described quantitative tightening as this kind of innocuous technical shift that really was going to take place in the background. I mean, yellow and talked about it being on, you know, autopilot and like watching paint dry.MCDOWELL: Right, and dismissive about it. People were dismissive about the impact of it on this very program, and like when you remove this amount of, like, excessive stimulus from the system, you don't know the impact on asset classes and to say, well, it's been well telegraphed. They don't even know what's going on.BARTIROMO: Yes, I think -- I think Powell, to his credit, did say something like we've never done, we don't really know what to expect from it. In fact, the session with Powell speaking. There were so many that it seems to me that they were sort of clueless about including talking to Americans and discovering that employment was really important.POMBOY: Right.BARTIROMO: Were sort of clueless. Yes. How about the -- how about the fact that just seven months ago, we're talking about three rates hikes.POMBOY: That's the thing. It's amazing.BARTIROMO: I mean it ridiculous.POMBOY: If you go back --BARTIROMO: He was on autopilot.POMBOY: It's not surprising, but if you go back and look at the last time we've had a shift in expectations about Fed elections about Fed policy to this degree. We went from basically to three to hikes to three to four cuts in the span off --BARTIROMO: Right.POMBOY: -- you know, eight months. That's happened three times in the fast. It happened in 1994 which was sort of the silent bear market and stocks, and set us up for the 1995 soft landing in the economy 1999, which I don't need tell you what happened after that. And 2007.MCDOWELL: But to their credit, in terms of the kind of 1880 that the Fed's done. We're in the middle of a really hard to judge unprecedented trade war with China.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.MCDOWELL: And we've paid -- and we were also fighting with some around most trading. Important taking Americans as well. So this heart discovering may be ascertain what the fault out from that would really important.POMBOY: I think that's true en but I guess I would say this notion that they could've tightened and scaled back the balance sheet from the day it started in October 2017, was ridiculous. I mean as you said, Dagen, people can't monitor and we're dismissing of QT. If QT is a nonevent, why did you do QE in the first place, you know?BARTIROMO: I know. What was the point?POMBOY: Obviously -- right. I mean it inflated risk assets. It really pushed people out. The risk of lowered rates and --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: Oh, but it's measured and will telegraph.POMBOY: It's like getting punched in the face, you know. Someone tells you, "I'm about to punch you in the face," does that make it hurt less when they actually do?BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about this slowdown specifically. You said we're at around, what, 1.9, 1-1/2 percent growth you said?POMBOY: Yes. Well, the --PEEK: Atlanta Fed.POMBOY: -- Atlanta Fed's at 1.9, New York Fed at 1.4, but if you strip away the tariff, I think --BARTIROMO: But you're estimate is what?POMBOY: It's -- right now, we're around 1-1/2 as (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: So 1-1/2 percent. Where is that slowdown in growth coming from? Is that the consumer segment, is that the business assessment? Where are you seeing the most vulnerability in terms of slowdown?POMBOY: Well, number one, housing peaked not surprisingly right when Fed - - the Fed started QT at the end of 2017. We've had five consecutive quarters where housing has been a drag on the economy. Fifteen months of negative existing home sales year on year growth. So, that's one key area. I mean housing is a huge input to the economy.The second is capital spending. I know we've seen some of these things in (INAUDIBLE) but the capex and the GDP numbers peaked at 11-1/2 percent in 2018. It's now -- it was 2-1/2 percent in the first quarter and judging by the durable -- the capex proxy and the durable goods number, it's really closer to one percent year on year growth today as we've gone from 11-1/2 to one, that's a pretty significant drag on growth as well.PEEK: That seems to me to be the biggest cost of the trade war.POMBOY: YesPEEK: Is that corporations -- and you've seen it in the CEO numbers, confidence CEO numbers, you know, people are just scared to death, they don't know what to do and there's not -- and they're not spending money on -- and so the productivity number, we finally had an uptick. My guess is that's kind of what we're going to see.BARTIROMO: How much of this is priced into the market? We had Michael Kantrowitz on earlier from Cornerstone Macro and he said, "Get ready for bad earning season for the second quarter and the markets -- is also going to follow suit." So, what kind of a move in the markets are you expecting?POMBOY: Thank goodness. I mean I've been talking about negative earnings growth because the government, the GDP profits number were predicting a recession in profits a year ago, we're getting it now. I think he's --MCDOWELL: Fourth quarter and first quarter, you pointed out the profit growth.POMBOY: And we're going to get another one in the second quarter, even by S&P expectations. I think the markets still don't have that priced in. I think that the, you know, the consensus is basically second half rebound, you know, we're going to kitchen sink the bad numbers here in the first half.BARTIROMO: But you think it's going to be a second half selloff?POMBOY: I do, because I think those earnings numbers are going to continue to be shaved lower. And right now, we're at like 11 percent for 2020 earnings growth. That number is going to come down.HASHMI: Just quick, you mentioned housing before. Economists have sort of forecasted that the housing bubble might be bursting. Are we going to see something like we saw in 2007, 2008?POMBOY: I guess I don't really worry about the housing side. There -- obviously, there are areas where things are frothy and whatnot, but I -- to me, the conspicuous bubble this cycle is corporate credit, and that's why I think the longer the Fed drags its feet in terms of cutting rates, the harder it becomes for them to fix the problem because once fear grips in credit risk, concerns start to grip the market, that's really hard for them to reverse.BARTIROMO: Well, market's expecting a July cut, right?POMBOY: Yes.BARTIROMO: A July cut, and then perhaps a September cut. We'll see about that. Stephanie, it's great insights from you as always. Thank you.POMBOY: Thank you so much.BARTIROMO: Stephanie Pomboy, MacroMavens. Coming up Boeing is under pressure this morning. The stock is down on news of yet another issue with the 737 Max Jet. And then there's amazon teaming up with Rite Aid. Tough day for Rite Aid, by the way. Company is predicting a loss for the year, disappointing guidance has that stock down six percent right now. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Boeing leading the Dow lower this morning, as the FAA finds another additional software problem with the 737 Max. Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange this morning looking at Boeing. Looking at Boeing and the broader markets. Good morning, Gerri.GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right. Yes. So not as bad as it was earlier right there. The Dow expected to open maybe 17 points lower, but I have to tell you Boeing now a new software problem, different from the one they formerly reported, and what we know us that this could require a software or maybe even upgrade maybe even a hardware fix. Big questions about this. Now remember, the FAA has no time playing for when the 737 Max Jet might get back into service. Barclays now saying a supplier reset is in order. There's a company called Senior PLC down and down hard on the downgrade from Barclays.So, starting to ripple through a lot of the companies in this sector. Meanwhile, Amazon says that they're going to allow their Amazon Prime Members to pick up purchases at 1,500 Rite Aid stores starting with 100 of these stores. But Rite Aid, as you mentioned earlier, down and down hard because the company is guiding lower, further, Evercore is saying that the company has zero long-term value. Amazing.All right. This is an online brick-and-mortar partnership that's becoming more and more common. Amazon already does this with Kohl's and Bed Bath & Beyond. You can go there and pick up your bags. Air Canada is buying Transat, the tour and travel company for $529 million. We have interesting tie-up there, the airline itself and the tour company. Maria, back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Gerri. Thank you so much. Gerri Willis is on Wall Street. Meanwhile, the 2020 democratic presidential hopefuls are looking to stand out during the debate last night and again tonight. But last night, they traded jabs on the economy, taxes, health care. Kristina Partsinevelos with more details now. She's in Miami. Kristina.KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Maria, that's right. They did trade some jabs and some of them, even Beto O'Rourke, split and answered in Spanish mid question. You had -- Julian Castro who's a first- time candidate. He was here in our reporter tent just about maybe 10 minutes ago. He spoke to FOX, but off camera, he said that he didn't sleep at all last night after the debate, because he said he had a good performance.Speaking of performances, the beginning of the night started out with the focus on an attack on the wealthy as well as an attack on corporations. Listen to this recap.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Who is this economy really working for? When you've got an economy that does great for those with money and isn't doing great for everyone else, that is corruption, pure and simple. We need to call it out. We need to attack it head on and we need to make structural strange in our government, in our economy, and in our country.BILL DE BLASIO, MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is supposed to be the party of working people. Yes, we're supposed to be for 70 percent tax rate on the wealthy, yes, we're supposed to be for free college, free public college.REP. BETO O'ROURKE (D-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This economy has got to work for everyone. And right now, we know that it isn't.SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is actually an economy that's hurting small businesses not allowing them to compete.(END VIDEO CLIP)PARTSINEVELOS: We have another two-hour debate tonight at -- in the building right behind me. It's supposed to be evenly distributed or randomly distributed between candidates. You have 10 tonight, but there's a lot of popular faces on the board. You got Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Mayor Pete, or Pete Buttigieg, as well as Kamala Harris to name a few. So, let's just hope that tonight they don't have audio issues where the mike goes out and they have to cut to commercial.They will be speaking here 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time in Miami though, so stay tuned. We have more coming up. Summer's top toys, this is on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.BARTIROMO: All right. Welcome back.

All right.DIBARTOLO: So it looks like a regular beach ball.BARTIROMO: Oh my God. It's actually a sprinkler.DIBARTOLO: But you actually put the hose up. Isn't that amazing?

Let's talk about the Ninja.DIBARTOLO: Yes. This is Ribbon Ninja. So --BARTIROMO: Ribbon Ninja.DIBARTOLO: This is a really fun game. Everyone gets these little wristbands that you put on your wrist.BARTIROMO: OK.DIBARTOLO: You can try to get each other's ribbons off of the wristband, so the person who ends up with no ribbon is going to be the loser.BARTIROMO: So they just -- so they just --DIBARTOLO: Yes, it's a little Velcro.BARTIROMO: Attached to its Velcro.DIBARTOLO: That's it. That's all you have to do.BARTIROMO: OK.DIBARTOLO: You can only move with one foot so that's kind of the key.BARTIROMO: Yes.DIBARTOLO: And you have to do your ninja moves.BARTIROMO: It's a -- it's a safe game.DIBARTOLO: You know, it's super safe and it's super fun and it gets kids active, which is what we want all summer.BARTIROMO: Yes. Exactly. It's great. Well, all this stuff you get -- you get outside which is nice.DIBARTOLO: Absolutely, yes, off the couch and playing outside.BARTIROMO: Exactly. And the price of this one, the Ribbon Ninja?DIBARTOLO: This one's $19.99 as well.BARTIROMO: $19.99.DIBARTOLO: Yes.BARTIROMO: Very good prices and these are the top sellers, Marissa.DIBARTOLO: Yes, absolutely. So we have tested all these toys. They're all on our summer gift guide, and we can definitely give them our seal of approval.BARTIROMO: OK. And let me -- let me ask you about this, in terms of anything to worry about, in terms of -- I mean it's a vehicle, you know --DIBARTOLO: It only goes four miles an hour. Kids are seated the entire time, which is important, and you want to make sure you're paying attention to things like age range, which is three and up, and weight restriction. So, this is safe for 77 pounds and under.BARTIROMO: And are there any other age notes that we need to know about with any of the other toys, like for example the bubbles or the -- or that thing there.DIBARTOLO: Yes. So the Nerf glasses --BARTIROMO: The Fortnite Nerf, yes.DIBARTOLO: -- are for about six and up.BARTIROMO: OK.DIBARTOLO: The bubbles are really for all ages.BARTIROMO: Yes. Sure.DIBARTOLO: Three and up, but it goes way up from there. This one's good for 18 months and up and this one -- the game is also great for ages like five or six and up.BARTIROMO: I love it.DIBARTOLO: Yes.BARTIROMO: These are great toys, Marissa.DIBARTOLO: Thank you so much.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Great to see you.DIBARTOLO: Great to see you, too.BARTIROMO: The Toy Insider, Marissa DiBartolo joining us there. All right. Take a short break. When we come back, we got final thoughts from our all-star panel today. Stay with us. Back in a minute. Thanks for coming out.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The markets have pared the losses. We're only down about six. Let's take a look at futures here, and you see that all of the decline in the Dow is all due to Boeing, down eight points right now. Boeing is representing about almost a hundred points on the Dow Industrials because of that selloff that we're talking about, about two percent plus on Boeing because of the new issue with the 737. Let's get some final thoughts. Liz Peek.PEEK: I'm very concerned that Xi Jinping's comments ahead of the G20 do not auger well for any kind of trade agreement. I don't -- there will not be a final deal, but I thought we would come out of this with a path forward. Now I think that throws that in jeopardy and I think the markets -- I'm surprised the markets aren't off more this morning.BARTIROMO: Yes, I agree with you, Liz. I mean, you know, he just came out with all of these must-do terms. Siraj.PEEK: Yes.HASHMI: President Trump really needs to get China to the negotiating table to at least salvage some of this trade talks that he has going on because if the -- if the economy tanks and it's because of the trade war, it's probably over for him in 2020.BARTIROMO: Yes.HASHMI: Yes. Well, the economy is the number one issue for the President, no doubt about it. Dagen.MCDOWELL: Tonight is the second big debate, making last night look like a warmed-over casserole. Tonight is the main course. Expect Bernie Sanders to attack Joe Biden. Watch for it.BARTIROMO: Yes. That is going to be really interesting to watch. Kamala Harris on that stage. Pete Buttigieg as well. Thanks, everybody, great show. Thank you so much for coming out today, everybody. Have a great day. Right to Stuart Varney we go. And "VARNEY & CO."

Tiananmen's Legacy May Be Whether a Government Can Revise HistoryUSNEWS.comJune 3, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: CIVIC; Best Countries; Vol.; No.Length: 1552 wordsByline: Lara FarrarHighlight: A decadeslong effort by Chinese authorities to erase the memory of the 1989 massacre may be working, observers warn.BodyIvy Yang is a student in an international high school in Beijing, where she studies myriad subjects, including world history. She is well-versed in topics such as the American Revolution and the Renaissance. Yet there is one major historical event she knows almost nothing about that was far more recent and much closer to home: the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing that ended with Chinese soldiers firing upon and killing an unknown number of civilians. She says she knows that her mother was somehow involved with the demonstrations and "that a lot of students died," but, she says, "not a single teacher told us what it really was." "My friends my age don't know much about it -- most people don't know about this," says Yang, who spoke by telephone from Beijing. "I don't know why people hide this event and why the government remains so silent about all of these things. In the future this event may just vanish from history, and that is the way the government of China will just deal with it." June 4 marks the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre, a day when the Chinese Communist Party ordered the People's Liberation Army to ambush thousands of pro-democracy student demonstrators in Beijing and elsewhere around the country. The protesters were indiscriminately beaten or shot, and hundreds, if not thousands, died. [MORE:How China Has Prevented Another Tiananmen]The bloody event and its anniversary remains one of the most sensitive subjects inside China, with the government making painstaking efforts to eradicate it from public memory. Immediately after the massacre, the Chinese Communist Party made sweeping efforts narrate its own version of history, painting the event as a conspiracy by Western forces, drawing upon an oft-used narrative where foreigners were trying not only working to humiliate China but also prevent the country from becoming a respected global superpower. Today, Tiananmen is simply not allowed to be talked about. 'Stability Maintenance' a Legacy of TiananmenScholars, human rights activists and survivors of Tiananmen who now live overseas say that a decades-long campaign to erase any memory of Tiananmen may be working. Beijing is ramping up sophisticated surveillance systems, including online censorship and facial recognition technology, as well as running an ongoing crackdown on academic and press freedom. Meanwhile, the country's growing influence abroad has tamped down international criticism of China's human rights record, observers say. Journalist Louisa Lim, author of "The People's Republic of Amnesia: Tiananmen Revisited," said at a recent conference at Harvard University examining Tiananmen's anniversary that Western companies such as Apple and Linkedin have censored Tiananmen-related content. [MORE:Twitter Apologizes for Blocked China Accounts Ahead of Tiananmen Anniversary]Many observers say that Beijing's efforts to crack down on any potential dissent ahead of this year's anniversary is the most severe yet. Students advocating for labor rights at Peking University in Beijing have been arrested in recent months. Police have detained or threatened dozens of activists, according to Amnesty International. Since late April, all language versions of Wikipedia have been blocked on the mainland. Meanwhile, any mention of the anniversary online is immediately scrubbed by censors that are powered by artificial intelligence. Yang Dali, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago, says the apparent ramp-up of repression ahead of the anniversary reflects an ongoing, more systematic, effort by the Chinese government to maintain social stability by what he calls "stability maintenance." He says such efforts could be intensifying against the backdrop of an economic slowdown in China, potentially worsened by the trade war between China and the United States. Other factors, including increasing ideological control within the Communist Party, in the state-run media and on university campuses, as well as ethnic conflict and a flare-up of small protests across the country by people who feel disenfranchised for various reasons, also could be contributing. "China's quest for social stability or stability maintenance really became a much more systematic effort after Tiananmen," Yang says. "We are living with that legacy, and it is a legacy that keeps on reinforcing itself with every crisis, forestalling instability and making itself a stronger system." Increasing Government Control of HistoryBut as the Chinese surveillance state continues in real-time to ratchet down on virtually all forms of dissent -- Tiananmen-related or otherwise -- some researchers are saying a concerted campaign to change the official historical narrative surrounding the Tiananmen protests is more concerning and perhaps more long-lasting. [Beijing Tightens Its Control Across China]At the Harvard forum, journalist Lim described how China has worked to erase the collective memory of the events of June 4, 1989. She detailed how only 15 out of 100 students in Beijing could identify an iconic photo from June 4 of a Chinese man standing alone in front of tanks as they progressed down an avenue in central Beijing. Lim conducted the survey several years ago. "Since then, the control over history and memory has only tightened," Lim says. "Access to those people who remembered what happened, memory carriers, is limited," she adds. "We are seeing the process of forgetting the actual movement itself being accelerated and exported." Nationalism Encouraged to Push Back Against Western IdealsAlmost immediately after the massacre, Beijing instituted a so-called patriotic education campaign in schools, in mainstream media, even in workplaces. The events of June 4 were portrayed as promulgated by foreign forces seeking to humiliate China -- essentially a Western conspiracy. The students who participated were on the wrong side of history, according to the education narrative. The soldiers who ran them down were the true patriots, the ones who protected the motherland from chaos. "There was this active promotion of the government's own official memory," Tom Chen, an associate professor of Chinese at Lehigh University, says, detailing how the government ordered classes and tests for students and workers about the official historical narrative and told them to "openly espouse what you have been told, that you have incorporated the propaganda into yourself and now you are a believer." "They had to show their allegiance," Chen says. [MORE:China Expands Its Surveillance Model By Training Other Governments]This government's official narrative about June 4 was soon replaced with an all-encompassing nationalistic propaganda campaign, says Rowena Xiaoqing He, a current scholar at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study. The campaign aimed at convincing not only the general population, but specifically students, that China "has a different political culture and historical context" and therefore is not a place where Western ideals about democracy and human rights could ever be imposed, according to He, who took part in demonstrations in Guangdong Province on June 4, 1989. "China promoted ideas about Chinese uniqueness," He says. "There is this hijacking of history on the one hand, they manipulate history, but at the same time, they silence dissent, and together with this patriotic education, it amplifies nationalism, and you are seeing this large population willing to defend China." This strategy by Chinese authorities is dangerous, she adds. "It will actually have a profound impact on the world." Chinese Diaspora Fights to Maintain Memory of TiananmenWhat He is describing is a phenomenon she says is increasingly happening at U.S. universities, where classrooms are filled with Chinese students. While the scholar cautions about making generalizations, she says that when confronted with a different historical narrative about Tiananmen, many Chinese students studying in the U.S. "immediately think it is a conspiracy to change their minds, to brainwash them." "They cannot distinguish between the regime and the nation and see any criticism to the Beijing government as insults to the Chinese people and to the Chinese culture," He says. Out of a tradition of academic freedom, liberalism and political correctness, U.S. educators are reluctant to push back, perhaps even because they are afraid of being labeled as anti-immigrant or anti-Chinese, He says. [MORE:Reliance on Chinese Students Worries Australian Education Officials]"This is where I see the danger," she says. "They are exporting all of these things to campuses. I notice people are becoming more and more careful to challenge these Chinese students." It is unclear whether the memory of Tiananmen could ever be completely eradicated. Outside China, scholars such as He say they believe the Chinese diaspora is still fighting to keep the memory alive and that one day the Chinese government will fully acknowledge the brutal events that occurred on June 4, 1989. "It is just a matter of time. Thirty years is not a long time," she says. "It has been a brutal battle, but I believe in history and that history is on our side." Arkansas-based journalist Lara Farrar spent nearly a decade working as a foreign correspondent in China.Graphic Picture, An altar mourning the victims of the June 4, 1989, Tiananmen Square crackdown in Beijing is displayed outside the Chinese liaison office during a march in Hong Kong on May 26, 2019., (PHILIP FONG/AFP/GETTY)Picture, A man stands alone to block a line of tanks heading east on Beijing's Cangan Boulevard at Tiananmen Square on June 5, 1989., (Jeff Widener/AP)Load-Date: June 4, 2019End of Document

Death by paperwork: Tariffs aren't China's only trade weaponPolitico.comMay 15, 2019 Wednesday 1:48 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 808 wordsByline: ABehsudi@politico.com,  (Adam Behsudi)Highlight: Here's how China could cause pain to American businesses without resorting to tariffs.BodyTariffs may cause sticker shock and send stock markets swooning, but the Chinese have an even bigger arsenal of economic weapons to hurt the U.S. businesses as the trade wars escalate.Beijing could take a death by regulation approach making it nearly impossible for American businesses to operate in one of the world's valuable consumer markets. Actions include tighter customs procedures, new paperwork requirements and extra scrutiny on business licenses. The government could also scrutinize visas, making it harder for U.S. business travelers to enter the country.Another way Beijing could hurt the U.S. is by appealing to Chinese patriotism by pushing its population to boycott U.S. products and prominent brands like Apple.These aren't just speculative ideas. Both Chinese state media and social media outlets reveal a population ready to fight alongside its leaders in the economic war against President Donald Trump and the United States."Any cursory reading of social media and public commentary in China at present clearly shows that a nationalistic pressure by civil society in China is building rapidly," said Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council. Allen, whose group represents major U.S. companies doing business in China, said the Chinese government has tried to reassure American investors that their interests should be protected and there have been no obvious cases of retaliation."Let's hope it stays that way," he said. "We should all be extremely cautious about stirring up anti-American sentiment in the second largest market in the world."But if the trade fight proliferates, China could quickly deploy many of these non-tariff actions in a bid to exert leverage. China has far fewer U.S. imports to hit with duties compared to the amount of goods that China exports to the U.S.Harsher rhetoric from Chinese officials in recent days has hinted that Beijing could be weighing its options for how to hit back against a decision by the U.S. to increase existing tariffs and impose new penalties on all remaining Chinese imports.Chinese President Xi Jinping warned in a speech on Wednesday that one civilization forcing itself on another would be "stupid" and "disastrous."A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said that China would "fight to the end.""That's always been their secret weapon, so called non-trade barriers," said Michael Pillsbury, an outside adviser to Trump on China issues. "The non-trade barriers are where you can really inflict damage."China's central government may have an interest in trying to keep any non-tariff responses firmly under its control for now. Boycotts and similar mass movements against U.S companies would not only damage Chinese business interests but could quickly morph into social unrest aimed at the government, said Deborah Elms, executive director of the Singapore-based Asian Trade Center."This would be playing with fire," she said.Instead, the Chinese government could ramp up "qualitative" actions that can remain firmly under its control. That could include tightening customs inspections, delaying regulatory approvals, invalidating patents, and other actions drawn from a playbook that Beijing has consistently relied upon in years past.China could also try to interfere with U.S. company supply chains. For example, it could inspect Apple iPhone supplier Foxconn's production facility and find violations to justify shutting them down for three months."Given the rate that Starbucks is expanding in China, my guess is the Chinese government will discover something that's not quite right," said Elms.Beijing could also try to undermine the impact of U.S. duties by letting the value of its currency slide, although that could bring larger problems it may want to avoid."These are not surgical tools," Elms said. "If I want to inspect the paperwork of a company, I can control that pretty well. When you start messing with currency, that effects the entire economy."For U.S. businesses, the calculus has changed as many companies now view China's growing middle class and 1.4 billion consumers as their primary market where they now build and sell products.With a middle class of 300 million people and growing, multinational companies like Boeing and General Motors are looking at futures more closely tied to China - where demand for aircraft and automobiles is expected to outpace the U.S. in the coming years. It's unclear if the pain of U.S. businesses in China will resonate with a president whose ultimate goal may be to decouple the U.S. and Chinese economies."I don't think [Trump] will want to hear directly from all the Dennis Muilenburg's of the world," a former senior U.S. official who was posted in China said, referring to Boeing's CEO. "If enough of them call, that might get his attention."Article originally published on POLITICO MagazineLoad-Date: May 16, 2019End of Document

Death by paperwork: Tariffs aren't China's only trade weaponPolitico.comMay 15, 2019 Wednesday 10:52 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 808 wordsByline: ABehsudi@politico.com,  (Adam Behsudi)Highlight: Here's how China could cause pain to American businesses without resorting to tariffs.BodyTariffs may cause sticker shock and send stock markets swooning, but the Chinese have an even bigger arsenal of economic weapons to hurt the U.S. businesses as the trade wars escalate.Beijing could take a death by regulation approach making it nearly impossible for American businesses to operate in one of the world's valuable consumer markets. Actions include tighter customs procedures, new paperwork requirements and extra scrutiny on business licenses. The government could also scrutinize visas, making it harder for U.S. business travelers to enter the country.Another way Beijing could hurt the U.S. is by appealing to Chinese patriotism by pushing its population to boycott U.S. products and prominent brands like Apple.These aren't just speculative ideas. Both Chinese state media and social media outlets reveal a population ready to fight alongside its leaders in the economic war against President Donald Trump and the United States."Any cursory reading of social media and public commentary in China at present clearly shows that a nationalistic pressure by civil society in China is building rapidly," said Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council. Allen, whose group represents major U.S. companies doing business in China, said the Chinese government has tried to reassure American investors that their interests should be protected and there have been no obvious cases of retaliation."Let's hope it stays that way," he said. "We should all be extremely cautious about stirring up anti-American sentiment in the second largest market in the world."But if the trade fight proliferates, China could quickly deploy many of these non-tariff actions in a bid to exert leverage. China has far fewer U.S. imports to hit with duties compared to the amount of goods that China exports to the U.S.Harsher rhetoric from Chinese officials in recent days has hinted that Beijing could be weighing its options for how to hit back against a decision by the U.S. to increase existing tariffs and impose new penalties on all remaining Chinese imports.Chinese President Xi Jinping warned in a speech on Wednesday that one civilization forcing itself on another would be "stupid" and "disastrous."A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said that China would "fight to the end.""That's always been their secret weapon, so called non-trade barriers," said Michael Pillsbury, an outside adviser to Trump on China issues. "The non-trade barriers are where you can really inflict damage."China's central government may have an interest in trying to keep any non-tariff responses firmly under its control for now. Boycotts and similar mass movements against U.S companies would not only damage Chinese business interests but could quickly morph into social unrest aimed at the government, said Deborah Elms, executive director of the Singapore-based Asian Trade Center."This would be playing with fire," she said.Instead, the Chinese government could ramp up "qualitative" actions that can remain firmly under its control. That could include tightening customs inspections, delaying regulatory approvals, invalidating patents, and other actions drawn from a playbook that Beijing has consistently relied upon in years past.China could also try to interfere with U.S. company supply chains. For example, it could inspect Apple iPhone supplier Foxconn's production facility and find violations to justify shutting them down for three months."Given the rate that Starbucks is expanding in China, my guess is the Chinese government will discover something that's not quite right," said Elms.Beijing could also try to undermine the impact of U.S. duties by letting the value of its currency slide, although that could bring larger problems it may want to avoid."These are not surgical tools," Elms said. "If I want to inspect the paperwork of a company, I can control that pretty well. When you start messing with currency, that effects the entire economy."For U.S. businesses, the calculus has changed as many companies now view China's growing middle class and 1.4 billion consumers as their primary market where they now build and sell products.With a middle class of 300 million people and growing, multinational companies like Boeing and General Motors are looking at futures more closely tied to China - where demand for aircraft and automobiles is expected to outpace the U.S. in the coming years. It's unclear if the pain of U.S. businesses in China will resonate with a president whose ultimate goal may be to decouple the U.S. and Chinese economies."I don't think [Trump] will want to hear directly from all the Dennis Muilenburg's of the world," a former senior U.S. official who was posted in China said, referring to Boeing's CEO.

COTTON, CORNYN OP-ED IN THE WASHINGTON POST 'KEEP THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT AWAY FROM 5G TECHNOLOGY'States News ServiceApril 2, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 951 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton:By: Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) and Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas)China's premier telecommunications company, Huawei, has risen to power through a combination of force, fraud and coordination with the Chinese Communist Party. Huawei has stolen valuable technology - and has allegedly stolen more, including the recent case of a high-tech robot arm - to get a leg up on the competition.Now, Huawei is constructing a global network of undersea Internet cables and next-generation mobile networks that could give China effective control of the digital commanding heights.Our European allies, including Britain, are deciding whether to allow Huawei to build their 5G wireless networks, which will soon facilitate everything from industrial manufacturing to NATO military communications. For Europe's sake and for the transatlantic alliance, our allies must keep Huawei as far from their 5G networks as possible. Adopting Chinese 5G technology will force the United States to reevaluate long-standing intelligence and military partnerships to protect our security interests.Some countries, such as Germany, have already indicated they'll allow Chinese technology into their 5G networks. Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly wants assurances from Beijing that it won't spy on Germany in exchange for using Huawei technology. This "no-spying agreement" will be as effective at abolishing spying as the Kellogg-Briand Pact was at abolishing war.Other European leaders claim that the risks posed by Huawei can be "managed" through vigilance and oversight. But the most effective way to mitigate risk is to avoid it in the first place. If you want to keep your enemies at bay, don't let in the Trojan horse.The African Union learned the hard way to be wary of strangers bearing gifts. Its $200 million headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, was a "gift" financed, constructed and outfitted by China with Huawei servers.

The African Union was forced to replace its servers and implement new security measures at great expense. It declined an offer from Huawei engineers to configure the new system; once burned, twice shy.The African Union's experience with Huawei should put to rest uninformed claims that Chinese telecoms don't pose a security threat. But if that isn't enough to convince our European friends, they should note how the countries closest to China's gravitational pull are acting to preserve the integrity of their telecommunications networks.

Even if Huawei's risks seem "manageable" today, are our allies so confident they'll remain so in the future? Huawei doesn't operate independently of its government, but even if it did, it would still be subject to Chinese laws that require companies to fully cooperate with its intelligence services.

China uses AI, facial recognition, and blockchain to monitor its farms - but it still can't stop the gruesome swine fever that will leave 200 million pigs deadBusiness Insider USMay 22, 2019 Wednesday 07:30 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1038 wordsByline: ama@businessinsider.com,  (Alexandra Ma)Highlight: Many Chinese tech firms, like Alibaba and JD.com, are kitting out the country's farms with advanced technologies to monitor their pigs' health.BodyChina• Many Chinese tech firms are equipping the country's farms with artificial intelligence, facial recognition, and blockchain technologies to monitor their pigs' health.• But none of this has managed to curb the biggest epidemic facing Chinese farms today - the outbreak of the African swine flu, a gruesome and deadly disease that's poised to leave 200 million pigs dead.• It shows the limit to China's technological ambitions, which many observers consider dystopian and Orwellian.• China is the world's largest consumer and producer of pork, and the swine flu is expected to affect the world's supply, demand, and price of pork.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.China is rolling out artificial intelligence, facial recognition and blockchain technology across its rural farms to protect its pigs - but it still isn't enough to curb a deadly swine flu that's spread across the country and is killing a third of its hogs.Tech firms, from small to large, have been developing various technologies to monitor the health and whereabouts of Chinese pigs. China is the world's largest pork producer and consumer.Chinese tech giants like e-commerce company Alibaba, its rival            JD.com, and gaming company            NetEase have already been developing advanced technologies to monitor the health and whereabouts of the country's pigs,            The New York Times and            The Daily Beast reported.China Daily via ReutersAlibaba has already developed voice recognition software to monitor pigs' coughs as well as cameras to monitor hogs' faces, the Times reported in February.AI systems on some farms determine how fast each pig is growing, and monitor whether it is healthy. Farms can then use that data to control the animals' feed and environmental factors, the Daily Beast reported.The sound sensors pick up on pigs' coughs and flag potential illnesses to farm operators, it added. Some farmers are also using blockchain technology to track pigs from their birth all the way to their slaughter and selling in the market.Here's how Jackson He, the CEO of Yingzi Technology, small facial and voice recognition company, sketched out his vision of a "future pig farm" to the Times: "If they are not happy, and not eating well, in some cases you can predict whether the pig is sick."Ryan Woo/ReutersBut the advanced technologies have still not managed to curb the biggest epidemic facing Chinese farms today - the outbreak of the African swine flu (ASF), a gruesome and incurable disease afflicting the country's pigs.Pigs that contract ASF can experience high fevers, diarrhea, depression, and bluish skin, and pregnant sows can lose their babies, according to the World Organisation for Animal Health. Animals with acute ASF typically die within days.Some 1.02 million Chinese pigs have already been culled this year because of the disease, according to the agricultural ministry. The country is expected to kill about a third of all its pigs this year alone,            Dutch bank Rabobank estimated last month.The country is expected to produce 150 million to 200 million fewer pigs, amounting to a 25% to 35% drop in production, Rabobank said. This fall in pork production is likely to push up the global demand for pork, which could result in supply shortfalls and price rises.Read more: China is killing a third of its pigs because of a gruesome and incurable fever, which could drive up the price of pork around the worldWong Campion/ReutersBeijing is desperately trying to stem the outbreak - which has spread to almost the entire country, and to Vietnam and Cambodia - by setting up buffer zones around infected areas, making slaughterhouse inspections more stringent, and            threatening to punish farmers who don't report outbreaks.But many farmers and producers are still failing to detect infections and aren't taking the correct safety precautions, with many adding that local officials were taking too long to respond to potential outbreaks, the Times and CNN reported.Some farmers have also been disposing of their pigs in an unhygienic way, in some cases burying dozens of them alive, or piling them in rivers and ditches.Jason Lee/ReutersLimits of China's 'Big Brother' technologyThe ASF epidemic is an example of how, despite the Chinese government's grand claims about its technological advances, there are still severe limits to what it can achieve.The country has over the past few years poured billions of dollars into AI, facial recognition, and blockchain research, with experts saying that the country's output of AI research could soon overtake the US.Many news outlets have likened China's technology, which the government claims is all-seeing and all-knowing, to "Big Brother," the all-seeing government in            George Orwell's novel 1984.Read more: In China you get a special warning before you call people who owe money, telling you to get them to pay upBut much of the technology remains fairly limited and            unreliable at this point.The country has dozens of datasets and systems containing citizens' - and perhaps even animals' - personal information, but many of the officials tasked with updating the systems are often too lax or overworked to maintain them, Human Rights Watch senior China researcher Maya Wang wrote in The Wall Street Journal.Data sharing across local governments also remains a problem in China, with some ministries and municipalities distrusting each other so much that they won't share information, New York Times China tech reporter Paul Mozur noted earlier this year.President Donald Trump's administration is reportedly considering a ban on exports of US components to Hikvision, a giant Chinese surveillance company.NOW WATCH: This startup turns 100 non-recyclable plastic bags into a high-end Bluetooth speakerSee Also:• In China you get a special warning before you call people who owe money, telling you to get them to pay up• Sheryl Sandberg revealed a new argument to stop regulators from breaking up Facebook• I've owned an Amazon Echo for over 3 years now - here are my 19 favorite featuresSEE ALSO: China's 'Big Brother' surveillance technology isn't nearly as all-seeing as the government wants you to thinkLoad-Date: May 22, 2019End of Document

As churches are demolished at home, Chinese Christians find religious freedom in KenyaCNN WireMay 22, 2019 Wednesday 3:49 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 2744 wordsByline: By Jenni Marsh, CNNDateline: NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) BodyNAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) --  Every Sunday morning in an affluent suburb of Nairobi, Kenya, the soaring song of Chinese hymns fills the empty corridors of a Monday-to-Friday office block.Inside a small makeshift chapel, a kaleidoscopic congregation of Chinese migrants gather to pray. Among them are underwear importers, health workers and operators of the controversial new $3.8 billion Chinese-built railway that slices through Kenya, the country's biggest infrastructure project since independence -- and a sign of China's growing investment and footprint on the continent. Some have married Kenyans, others have Chinese children who speak Swahili as well as they do Mandarin. But they all share two things. Each person here has re-rooted their life from Communist China to Kenya, a leading African economy where 80% of the nearly 50 million people are Christian. And they have all decided to openly embrace God. Their religious awakening comes at a perilous moment for Christians in China, as the Communist Party government bans online sales of bibles, dynamites churches and arrests Christians for "inciting subversion of state power." The Communist Party sees any large group outside its dominion as a threat."Publicly, it's dangerous to be a Christian in China right now," says Jonathon Chow, 43, a senior pastor at the Bread of Life Church, which is headquartered in Taiwan but has 500 ministries, including many in West Africa. Previously, the organization's churches in Africa tended to be run and attended by Africans, he says. But increasingly Bread of Life is seeing Chinese-led congregations forming across the continent, as more Chinese move to Africa and interact with local values. The Golden Lampstand Church, in China, was demolished with dynamite and heavy machinery in January 2018.Throughout the service, a middle-aged couple from Shandong province, who say they are new to Kenya and the ministry, post audio clips of hymns and photographs of readings onto WeChat, a social network closely monitored by the Chinese government. "Most of the congregation here got saved in Kenya," says Chow. "Unless they were a believer before they came, most don't know a lot about the Christian conditions in China." 'The Kenyan wedding everyone is talking about'The first time Liang Yongyu met Karen Ngunjiri at the billboard advertising company where they both worked in Nairobi, he told her she would be his wife. The pair dated for 6 months, then hit a roadblock that threatened to scupper his swaggering prediction. Liang, 33, was not a Christian. "That was a deal breaker for me," says Ngunjiri, 29, who spent four years studying Mandarin in Nanning, south-west China. "Him being Chinese? Not a problem. But him not being a Christian, I thought that was going to be a big issue. How would we bring up our children?" Liang had lived in Kenya for a "long time," could speak some Swahili and had been "hearing a lot about Christianity" from his Kenyan friends, Ngunjiri says. After some soul searching, he said he "was open to exploring what Christianity had to offer," she adds.Liang connected with a church in Nairobi that held services in Cantonese -- the language spoken in his home province of Guangdong, in southern China, and Hong Kong, where the pastors who founded the ministry were from.In December 2018, those Hong Kong pastors married the couple in a Christian ceremony in the shadow of Mount Kenya in front of 200 guests -- "a small wedding for Kenya," jokes Ngunjiri.Weeks later, a video of their wedding went viral on YouTube with the title: "THE KENYAN WEDDING EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT." Ngunjiri still doesn't know who uploaded it, but for months the newlyweds couldn't walk down the street in Nairobi without being recognized. The novelty of a Kenyan woman marrying a Chinese man had got people's attention."Some of the comments (online) were horrible," she says, of the video that has since been taken down, but at its peak had nearly 300,000 views, according to Ngunjiri. "Especially from Kenyans. There's this idea that the Chinese are here to steal our jobs or colonize us. So the joke was now they're stealing our women."In 2017, China was Kenya's largest trading partner and, in 2014, the country was home to an estimated 40,000 Chinese migrants. But their relations with Kenyans have, at times, been tense. In 2015, a Chinese restaurateur reportedly banned African patrons after 5 p.m., last year a Chinese boss was deported from Kenya after being caught on video calling an employee a "monkey," and local media has claimed that Kenyan workers on the Chinese-built railway have been treated like second-class citizens by their foreign employers. Kenyans are also concerned about how much debt their country owes to China. Last year, in a seeming show of strength against Chinese dominance President Kenyatta Uhuru banned imports of cheap Chinese fish, amid claims it was squeezing out local produce. But his ban was soon reversed: Kenya does not produce enough fish to feed itself. Kenyan workers on the Standard Gauge Railway; Chinese supervisors on the platform in Nairobi; Kenyan staff man the modern terminal.The anti-Chinese commentators on Ngunjiri's wedding video, however, had perhaps missed the point. Rather than Ngunjiri being overpowered by Chinese culture, it was Liang who had changed his faith and agreed to a Christian African wedding with just 20 Chinese guests who didn't include his mother, embracing a new culture 5,300 miles from home. A new door opens An estimated 1 million Chinese have moved to the African continent in the 21st century, according to journalist Howard French's book "China's Second Continent," amid growing trade ties between the two regions. But what is perhaps unique about Kenya's Chinese population, and why it is embracing the country's religious culture, is its diversity. A 2015 study found the Chinese in Kenya are spread "across every sector in a significant way." This makes a difference. Employees of government-owned giants, shipped out to build roads in Uganda or airports in Zimbabwe, for example, are typically bused to and from work and must stay inside their compounds in the evenings and at weekends unless given approval to leave by a manager. But in Nairobi -- a vibrant city home to African tech giant M-Pesa, which revolutionized mobile banking in East Africa -- a younger generation of Chinese are working in the private sector, freer to explore new cultures and belief systems through their personal connections with local people.Annie Hu, 30, began attending church in Kenya; Chinese and Kenyan employees mix at a media company office; the China Center where many Chinese expats have businesses.Among them is Annie Hu, 30, who relocated to Kenya five years ago and works for a Chinese financial technology, or fintech, giant. She says the 9-to-5 "pole pole" (meaning "slowly slowly" in Swahili) lifestyle here is more attractive than the 9-9-6 grind -- working 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week -- at some of China's biggest technology companies in the country's Silicon Valley city of Shenzhen, where she relocated from. "Living in a developing country and international city you encounter different nationalities, races and lifestyles," Hu says. After frequently traveling for work to the Muslim majority city of Dar es Salaam, in Tanzania, she went to Lebanon and Jordan last year to learn more about Muslim culture. "It opened a totally new door for me," she says. Asked how she felt about China's treatment of Muslims, Hu replies: "We need more understanding."Hu's family is Buddhist but in Nairobi she has attended Christian churches, including one led by Hong Kong pastors, as well as a Maasai church. "Kenyans believe in God more than my Western friends," she says. "Once we engage with the local community it's inevitable we are invited to join the church. These people are very friendly and reliable and they try to build a supportive community for the Chines e." Chow from Bread of Life agrees the church is an important social network for newcomers. "I also think the cultural differences and the hardship the Chinese experience here means they are more open to the gospel," he says. For Hu, flirting with various Christian communities hasn't resulted in a full conversion. "It's brought more different religions into my life ... But I didn't reach a point where I felt I want to become a serious Christian yet. Not yet," she adds.The world's biggest Christian nation?It is not only the Chinese in Kenya who are embracing Christianity. Many Chinese students in America, Australia and the UK are returning home Christian, says Ian Johnson, author of "The Souls of China: The Return of Religion After Mao." Their conversion chimes with a broader trend at home: China itself is on track to be the world's biggest Christian nation by 2030, by some estimates. For much of the 20th century, Chinese citizens were taught to worship the founding father of the Communist Party, Mao Zedong, the revolutionary leader who destroyed much of the nation's Buddhist and Taoist religious infrastructure during the Cultural Revolution. "There used to be 900 temples in Beijing alone," says Johnson. "Now there are 20." Mao's death in 1976 left the Chinese searching for a new value system. Christianity seemed fresh and modern to the country's newly urban residents, Johnson says, although more people in China are still Buddhist. By 2017, there were between 93 million and 115 million Christians in China -- around 5% of the country's population -- but fewer than 30 million practice in official churches, according to Purdue University scholar Yang Fenggang. If those estimates pan out, there would now be almost as many Christians in China as there are members of the Communist Party, which had an estimated 90 million members in 2016. That has riled the government. Under President Xi Jinping rhetoric has grown on the need to "Sinicize" religions perceived to be Western, despite the fact many Christians in China do not feel "un-Chinese or foreign," says Johnson. Today, only state-sanctioned Christian organizations are legal in China. Overcrowded state churches run as many as 5 services a day and their pastors' wages are paid by the government, says Johnson. The alternatives are so-called house churches which operate illegally but can offer a more personal ministry, with pastors on first-name terms with their congregation. For years, such churches were tolerated in China but recently they have become a target of the authorities and their requests to register with the state are often rejected.In December 2018, one of China's best-known underground ministries, the Early Rain Covenant Church, in Chengdu, was raided. The pastor and his wife were charged with "inciting subversion," which can carry a 15-year prison sentence, and more than 100 worshipers were arrested. An underground church in KenyaKenya is not a place you'd expect to find an underground church. Christianity is the lifeblood of the nation's politics and societal fabric, and is celebrated in huge, rambunctious services attended by thousands of dancing and singing worshipers.But, in the northern stretches of the sprawling, traffic-choked capital of 4 million people, an underground Chinese house church is exactly what May Li, wife of a Malaysian-Chinese pastor, helps to lead -- illustrating just how far the Communist Party's religious crackdown has traveled. Li and other Chinese Christians in this story did not want to use their real names for fear of being punished by the government when they return to China.The Chinese embassy in Nairobi has already reached out to the leaders of some Chinese Christian groups in the city and asked them to desist, says Li. Her service tries to stay below the radar. It's notable that the three main Christian churches in Nairobi are run by Chinese pastors from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Malaysia -- places outside mainland China where Chinese people enjoy more Christian religious freedom.A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Mofa) in Beijing said it was "not aware" of this situation, adding that China does not have "so-called house churches.""The Chinese government respects its people's religious freedom and protects normal religious activities and legitimate rights of religious organizations, and manages religious issues pertaining to national and public interests in accordance with law," the spokesperson said via fax. "At the same time, we require all religions to obey national laws and carry out activities within the law." On Sunday afternoons, Li's underground church meets in a small basement room of a huge Kenyan church. No photography is allowed. No names of attendees can be revealed. No Chinese person here wants to be outed as a Christian. "These people will one day go back to China," says Li, explaining that this congregation is a transient group often working in Kenya for short stints. Most were Christian before they came and, if they belonged to a house church, are aware of some of the risks. Church translator Grace Zhang, from Hubei province, falls into that category. "Things are very difficult for my church in China right now," says Zhang, who did not want her real name used. She became a Christian with her mother in 2002 and relocated to Kenya to proselytize to Chinese abroad, as well as to Kenyans. Despite her work, Zhang hesitates to call herself a missionary -- "that's a sensitive word," she says. Chinese law bans missionary work in China. Instead, Zhang prefers the term "cultural mediator."Many Africans from Uganda, Burundi, Kenya and Sudan also attend the bilingual service, which is delivered in English and Mandarin, hoping to improve their language skills or learn more about China. "God gave them the burden of loving the Chinese," Zhang says. Through their interaction at the church, Zhang helps Africans and Chinese better understand each other. She explains to the Chinese, for example, that Kenyans place a high value on in-depth greetings, meaning that asking about the well-being of multiple family members is a cultural necessity. She warns Africans that many Chinese do not respond well to overly physical greetings."We try to learn from both sides," she says.China vs God ... going homeIn Chinese state media, the clampdown on faith goes largely unreported and Christianity is "virtually invisible," says Johnson -- the government doesn't want to "encourage anyone to think about religion." That explains why worshipers at the Bread of Life church in Nairobi are open about sharing their Christianity. This is a more settled congregation. Having found religion abroad and been out of China for several years, in most cases, they often simply do not know the extent of their government's crackdown, says Chow -- although many have a sense the government is not enthusiastic about religion.When members want to repatriate, however, they have to be enlightened of the potential risks.Maggie Wong, 35, a pastor at Bread of Life, says the church tries to prepare them for what they will face and has a network of underground churches to connect them with. "It's very stressful," she says."From a spiritual perspective, I think it's not easy for returnees to survive when they go back to their home country if they live overseas," says Zhang, from the underground church. "When they go back we keep in touch with them and even Skype for bible study."Some Christians in Kenya, however, who learn of the potential dangers that await them in China say it could be a deterrent from returning.Jimmy Hong Zhen Wu, 53, a trader from Guangdong province, became Christian during the decade he has spent living in Kenya, where his wife has given birth to two daughters now under 8 years old. He travels to China regularly for work and says he is conscious of the double life he would need to lead back home. "In public, in China we can't speak about our faith," says Wu, who did not want his real name used. "Only with friends and family can we say we are Christian." Whether his daughters, who have spent their lives in a proudly Christian society attending church every Sunday, will understand those confines if their family one day heads back to China remains to be seen. Editor's Note: This story has been updated to clarify remarks by Annie Hu in her interview with Jenni Marsh on April 1, 2019.  TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

As churches are demolished at home, Chinese Christians find religious freedom in KenyaCNN.comApril 11, 2019 Thursday 11:49 PM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 2720 wordsByline: By Jenni Marsh, CNNDateline: Nairobi, Kenya BodyEvery Sunday morning in an affluent suburb of Nairobi, Kenya, the soaring song of Chinese hymns fills the empty corridors of a Monday-to-Friday office block.Inside a small makeshift chapel, a kaleidoscopic congregation of Chinese migrants gather to pray. Among them are underwear importers, health workers and operators of the controversial new $3.8 billion Chinese-built railway that slices through Kenya, the country's biggest infrastructure project since independence -- and a sign of China's growing investment and footprint on the continent.Some have married Kenyans, others have Chinese children who speak Swahili as well as they do Mandarin.But they all share two things. Each person here has re-rooted their life from Communist China to Kenya, a leading African economy where 80% of the nearly 50 million people are Christian. And they have all decided to openly embrace God.Their religious awakening comes at a perilous moment for Christians in China, as the Communist Party government bans online sales of bibles, dynamites churches and arrests Christians for "inciting subversion of state power." The Communist Party sees any large group outside its dominion as a threat."Publicly, it's dangerous to be a Christian in China right now," says Jonathon Chow, 43, a senior pastor at the Bread of Life Church, which is headquartered in Taiwan but has 500 ministries, including many in West Africa.Previously, the organization's churches in Africa tended to be run and attended by Africans, he says. But increasingly Bread of Life is seeing Chinese-led congregations forming across the continent, as more Chinese move to Africa and interact with local values.The Golden Lampstand Church, in China, was demolished with dynamite and heavy machinery in January 2018.Throughout the service, a middle-aged couple from Shandong province, who say they are new to Kenya and the ministry, post audio clips of hymns and photographs of readings onto WeChat, a social network closely monitored by the Chinese government."Most of the congregation here got saved in Kenya," says Chow. "Unless they were a believer before they came, most don't know a lot about the Christian conditions in China."'The Kenyan wedding everyone is talking about'The first time Liang Yongyu met Karen Ngunjiri at the billboard advertising company where they both worked in Nairobi, he told her she would be his wife.The pair dated for 6 months, then hit a roadblock that threatened to scupper his swaggering prediction. Liang, 33, was not a Christian."That was a deal breaker for me," says Ngunjiri, 29, who spent four years studying Mandarin in Nanning, south-west China. "Him being Chinese? Not a problem. But him not being a Christian, I thought that was going to be a big issue. How would we bring up our children?"Liang had lived in Kenya for a "long time," could speak some Swahili and had been "hearing a lot about Christianity" from his Kenyan friends, Ngunjiri says. After some soul searching, he said he "was open to exploring what Christianity had to offer," she adds.Liang connected with a church in Nairobi that held services in Cantonese -- the language spoken in his home province of Guangdong, in southern China, and Hong Kong, where the pastors who founded the ministry were from.In December 2018, those Hong Kong pastors married the couple in a Christian ceremony in the shadow of Mount Kenya in front of 200 guests -- "a small wedding for Kenya," jokes Ngunjiri.Weeks later, a video of their wedding went viral on YouTube with the title: "THE KENYAN WEDDING EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT." Ngunjiri still doesn't know who uploaded it, but for months the newlyweds couldn't walk down the street in Nairobi without being recognized. The novelty of a Kenyan woman marrying a Chinese man had got people's attention."Some of the comments (online) were horrible," she says, of the video that has since been taken down, but at its peak had nearly 300,000 views, according to Ngunjiri. "Especially from Kenyans. There's this idea that the Chinese are here to steal our jobs or colonize us. So the joke was now they're stealing our women."In 2017, China was Kenya's largest trading partner and, in 2014, the country was home to an estimated 40,000 Chinese migrants. But their relations with Kenyans have, at times, been tense.In 2015, a Chinese restaurateur reportedly banned African patrons after 5 p.m., last year a Chinese boss was deported from Kenya after being caught on video calling an employee a "monkey," and local media has claimed that Kenyan workers on the Chinese-built railway have been treated like second-class citizens by their foreign employers.Kenyans are also concerned about how much debt their country owes to China. Last year, in a seeming show of strength against Chinese dominance President Kenyatta Uhuru banned imports of cheap Chinese fish, amid claims it was squeezing out local produce. But his ban was soon reversed: Kenya does not produce enough fish to feed itself.Kenyan workers on the Standard Gauge Railway; Chinese supervisors on the platform in Nairobi; Kenyan staff man the modern terminal.The anti-Chinese commentators on Ngunjiri's wedding video, however, had perhaps missed the point.Rather than Ngunjiri being overpowered by Chinese culture, it was Liang who had changed his faith and agreed to a Christian African wedding with just 20 Chinese guests who didn't include his mother, embracing a new culture 5,300 miles from home.A new door opensAn estimated 1 million Chinese have moved to the African continent in the 21st century, according to journalist Howard French's book "China's Second Continent," amid growing trade ties between the two regions. But what is perhaps unique about Kenya's Chinese population, and why it is embracing the country's religious culture, is its diversity. A 2015 study found the Chinese in Kenya are spread "across every sector in a significant way."This makes a difference. Employees of government-owned giants, shipped out to build roads in Uganda or airports in Zimbabwe, for example, are typically bused to and from work and must stay inside their compounds in the evenings and at weekends unless given approval to leave by a manager. But in Nairobi -- a vibrant city home to African tech giant M-Pesa, which revolutionized mobile banking in East Africa -- a younger generation of Chinese are working in the private sector, freer to explore new cultures and belief systems through their personal connections with local people.Annie Hu, 30, began attending church in Kenya; Chinese and Kenyan employees mix at a media company office; the China Center where many Chinese expats have businesses.Among them is Annie Hu, 30, who relocated to Kenya five years ago and works for a Chinese financial technology, or fintech, giant. She says the 9-to-5 "pole pole" (meaning "slowly slowly" in Swahili) lifestyle here is more attractive than the 9-9-6 grind -- working 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week -- at some of China's biggest technology companies in the country's Silicon Valley city of Shenzhen, where she relocated from."Living in a developing country and international city you encounter different nationalities, races and lifestyles," Hu says. After frequently traveling for work to the Muslim majority city of Dar es Salaam, in Tanzania, she went to Lebanon and Jordan last year to learn more about Muslim culture. "It opened a totally new door for me," she says. Asked how she felt about China's treatment of Muslims, Hu replies: "We need more understanding."Hu's family is Buddhist but in Nairobi she has attended Christian churches, including one led by Hong Kong pastors, as well as a Maasai church. "Kenyans believe in God more than my Western friends," she says. "Once we engage with the local community it's inevitable we are invited to join the church. These people are very friendly and reliable and they try to build a supportive community for the Chines?e."Chow from Bread of Life agrees the church is an important social network for newcomers. "I also think the cultural differences and the hardship the Chinese experience here means they are more open to the gospel," he says.For Hu, flirting with various Christian communities hasn't resulted in a full conversion. "It's brought more different religions into my life ... But I didn't reach a point where I felt I want to become a serious Christian yet. Not yet," she adds.The world's biggest Christian nation?It is not only the Chinese in Kenya who are embracing Christianity. Many Chinese students in America, Australia and the UK are returning home Christian, says Ian Johnson, author of "The Souls of China: The Return of Religion After Mao." Their conversion chimes with a broader trend at home: China itself is on track to be the world's biggest Christian nation by 2030, by some estimates.For much of the 20th century, Chinese citizens were taught to worship the founding father of the Communist Party, Mao Zedong, the revolutionary leader who destroyed much of the nation's Buddhist and Taoist religious infrastructure during the Cultural Revolution. "There used to be 900 temples in Beijing alone," says Johnson. "Now there are 20."Mao's death in 1976 left the Chinese searching for a new value system. Christianity seemed fresh and modern to the country's newly urban residents, Johnson says, although more people in China are still Buddhist.By 2017, there were between 93 million and 115 million Christians in China -- around 5% of the country's population -- but fewer than 30 million practice in official churches, according to Purdue University scholar Yang Fenggang. If those estimates pan out, there would now be almost as many Christians in China as there are members of the Communist Party, which had an estimated 90 million members in 2016.That has riled the government. Under President Xi Jinping rhetoric has grown on the need to "Sinicize" religions perceived to be Western, despite the fact many Christians in China do not feel "un-Chinese or foreign," says Johnson.Today, only state-sanctioned Christian organizations are legal in China. Overcrowded state churches run as many as 5 services a day and their pastors' wages are paid by the government, says Johnson. The alternatives are so-called house churches which operate illegally but can offer a more personal ministry, with pastors on first-name terms with their congregation.For years, such churches were tolerated in China but recently they have become a target of the authorities and their requests to register with the state are often rejected.In December 2018, one of China's best-known underground ministries, the Early Rain Covenant Church, in Chengdu, was raided. The pastor and his wife were charged with "inciting subversion," which can carry a 15-year prison sentence, and more than 100 worshipers were arrested.An underground church in KenyaKenya is not a place you'd expect to find an underground church.

Pompeo: Huawei "is not telling the truth to Americans" about ties with the Chinese governmentCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 23, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 380 wordsBody       Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has argued that Huawei works with the Chinese Government and that its CEO is not telling Americans the truth.  In a context of growing tension between the United States and China, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday defended the restrictions imposed by the Trump administration on Huawei ensuring that the telecommunications giant works directly with the Chinese government, Beijing has always denied this connection.  "To say that they do not work with the Chinese government is false," Pompeo told CNBC. "About this, at least, the CEO of Huawei is not telling Americans the truth."  He continued: "If you are a state-run company and receive subsidies directly from the Chinese government, there is no doubt that you can take great advantage of it. I think the world wants systems that can be trusted."  Huawei, a leader in 5G technology, has been trying to secure contracts around the world - including the UK and Germany - to build the network that will make the Internet faster, while the United States has lobbied its partners to reject technology of the Chinese company. At CNBC, Pompeo explained that he has been "explaining the risks" related to national security as he travels around the world to meet with government leaders.  Last week, the Trump administration even decided to include Huawei on its "blacklist," preventing US companies from selling software and components to the Chinese company.  In addition to this dispute over security and technology, the United States and China remain engaged in a more comprehensive trade war with the Americans demanding a balance of trade balance and fair trade practices on the part of Beijing.  Negotiations between the two countries, however, have reached a deadlock, and there are no new talks on the agenda.  "It is important that the talks continue," said the Secretary of State. "I've seen them make real progress, and I hope they can continue to do so."  However, Beijing has already said that Washington needs to correct its actions so that negotiations between the two parties can be resumed. "If the US wants to continue to negotiate, they must honestly adjust their wrongdoing, so that negotiations can continue," said Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng on Thursday. Load-Date: May 23, 2019End of Document

Confucius Institutes are operated by China's Education Ministry and are a part of the "United Front"--the Communist Party's foreign influence operation. With 90 branches on college campuses across America, Confucius Institutes exert influence through Chinese language classes and cultural programming.Additionally, it was reported that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) will be severing its ties with Chinese telecommunications companies, Huawei and ZTE.

CHINESE AUTHORITIES DETAIN TIBETAN STUDENT WHO DECRIED LACK OF GOVERNMENT JOBS IN TIBETStates News ServiceApril 16, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 658 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Chinese authorities have detained a Tibetan student after an essay he wrote for his civil service exam lamenting a declining number of government job opportunities for Tibetans in Tibetan regions of China went viral on social media, according to sources.Sonam, a Tibetan master's degree candidate at Northwest Minzu University in Gansu province's Lanzhou city, was hauled out of classes earlier this month, according to a source inside Tibet, speaking to RFA's Tibetan Service on condition of anonymity."In the beginning of April, the Tibet Education Bureau in China forcefully took Sonam away from the school," the source said."Chinese officials have held him since then," he added.RFA could not independently verify whether officials from the Tibet Education Bureau, under China's Ministry of Education, or authorities acting on their behalf had arrested Sonam.A second source told RFA that Sonam was targeted because of the content of the essay he wrote for his civil service exam."Tibetan university student Sonam wrote the essay in Chinese about the annually declining number of seats [for Tibetans] for the Chinese government civil service exams," said the source, who also asked to remain unnamed."His essay was widely shared on social networking sites, including WeChat."The source added that Tibetan students at Northwest Minzu Universitya school formerly known as Northwest University for Nationalities which was the first minority institution for higher learning founded after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949who maintain contact with Tibetan exiles in India "are particularly under surveillance by Chinese authorities."The sources noted that Tibetans in Tibetan regions of China have increasingly expressed frustration over a lack of coveted government jobs in recent years, despite claims by local officials to have increased employment opportunities."Although the Chinese government claims to have created many [government] jobs in Tibet, only 210 [Tibetan] graduates were selected out of 70,000 to sit for the entrance test for the civil service exams this year," one source told RFA."Many Tibetan university graduates say it is increasingly difficult to find jobs in Tibet, and many of those who graduated in 2018 are still left without jobs."Increased competitionIn February, sources told RFA that Tibetan university graduates are facing increasing difficulty finding jobs in Tibetan regions of China, with Han Chinese flooding job markets and civil service exams slanted more and more toward Han applicants.The sources said that in 2018, there were 40,000 applicants in the Tibet Autonomous Region alone who sat for the entrance exam for positions in the Chinese civil service, but only about 3,000 passed their exams to become eligible to be considered for government positions.With more Chinese university graduates now coming into Tibetan areas to compete for jobs, they said, ethnic Tibetans are allowed fewer opportunities and have lost their competitive edge.The majority of Tibetan applicants are unable to find work in private companies and corporations, including high-tech firms or industry, in Tibet, making well-paying jobs in the civil sector a top priority.But in addition to competing with an increased number of Chinese applicants, requirements for proficiency in Mandarin Chinese in testing and consideration for employment have further disadvantaged Tibetan students, as China seeks to promote the dominance of Chinese culture and language in Tibetan areas, sources say.Language rights have become a particular focus for Tibetan efforts to assert national identity in recent years, with informally organized language courses typically deemed "illegal associations," and teachers subject to detention and arrest.Reported by Lobsang Gelek for RFA's Tibetan Service.

First of all, please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese government, to extend my heartfelt congratulations to Timor-Leste and its people on the commencement of the project. Today is a day worth celebrating, because the lunching of the project marks that Timor-Leste will soon have its own DTMB system. This will greatly improve the culture life and entertainment of Timor-Leste people, enhance the capacity building of media and social communications in Timor-Leste, and further strengthen bilateral understanding and friendship between our two countries. The project is a milestone in the media and social communications cooperation between our two countries.This project is also the fruit of friendship between our two countries and people, it witnessed the committed efforts we spared together. It has been 5 years since the Secretary of State for Social Communications of the acents Constitutional Government of Timor-Leste proposed this project to the Chinese government in January 2014. It witnessed 6 Timorese Governments and 3 Chinese Ambassadors. Through the years, though Timor-Leste has experienced changes of governments and the persons concerned, the China-Timor-Leste friendship always keeps the same and China has been consistent in its promise. With the constant and vigorous efforts from our two sides, this year, positive development has been achieved in this project. In March, Mr. "Akara" and I signed the Implementation Agreement for the Project. Today, we gather here to celebrate the unveiling of the project.Timor-Lest government put great efforts to develop media and social communications. The media software and hardware technology as well as journalistic quality have been constantly improved. Timorese media is becoming an important window for the world to observe and understand Timor-Leste. I hope that Timor-Leste media will keep objective and authentic in reporting, as well as more coverage about China and the works done by the Chinese enterprises and institutions here, who have created many job opportunities for the Timor-Leste, benefited local people, and contributed greatly to the economic and social development of Timor-Leste. Media plays a very important role in learning from each other and enhancing mutual understanding. I hope, through the media's role, the China-Timor-leste friendship and practical cooperation will be further developed.Since the beginning of the project, the Chinese team has been supported and helped by the successive governments especially the Secretary of State for Social Communications. I would like to take this chance to thank you all. We still depend on your support and cooperation in the future. Both the National Engineering Laboratory for Digital TV(Bei Jing) and the China Potevio Co., Ltd. are new to Timor-Leste. I hope that both can soon adapt to the new environment, be hard-working and trustworthy, operate according to the local rules and laws, cooperate closely with relevant Timor-Leste departments according the Implementation Agreement, and accomplish the great mission with high quality on time. In mean time, I also hope that both companies take on their social responsibilities, have more local employees and train them, share Chinese DTMB standard, technology and experiences with Timor-Leste government and people unreservedly and wholeheartedly.Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,We know that, China and Timor-leste enjoy a long-standing and well-established friendship. Upon the restoration of Timor-Leste's independence on 20th May, 2002, China established diplomatic relations with Timor-Leste. This year marks the 17th anniversary of the establishment of China-Timor-Leste diplomatic ties. Over the past 17 years, the bilateral relations have developed rapidly in an all-round manner; political trust has been continuously deepened; mutually beneficial cooperation in areas such as economy, media and social communications, agriculture and health has been steadily strengthened, therefore, bringing concrete and tangible benefits to people of our two countries. The China Timor-Leste relations can serve as an example of equal treatment, friendliness and win-win cooperation among all nations, large and small. 6 years ago, China proposed the Belt and Road Initiative that has attracted more and more active participants including Timor-Leste. In April, 2019, his Excellency, the former President and former Prime Minister, the Chief Negotiator for Maritime Boundaries, Mr. Kay Rala Xanana Gusmo attended the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation held in Beijing and delivered an important speech. During the forum, he had meetings with the Chinese vice foreign minister H.E. Mr. Kong Xuanyou, and some Chinese enterprise headquarters. I hope and I am sure that with the continuing high level exchanges between our two countries and the practical cooperation in different sectors, our bilateral relations will reach a new high.The world is now in the midst of profound and complex changes, both China and Timor-Leste are in an important period for development. China is willing and able to carry out comprehensive cooperation in different areas with Timor-Lest to achieve mutual development and win-win result. China is also willing to continue its support to the infrastructure and livelihood projects in Timor-Leste so as to contribute to the well-being of Timor-Leste people and improve their sense of fulfillment and happiness.In the end, again I hope this China-aided project a success under our joint effort; I hope the Timoreses a happier and more prosperous life; and I hope the friendship between our two countries long-lasting.Thank you!Load-Date: June 24, 2019End of Document

Rubio Requests Information From MSCI Over Controversial Decision to Add Chinese Companies in Its Equity IndexesTargeted News ServiceJune 13, 2019 Thursday 7:54 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1636 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, issued the following news release:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) requested information from MSCI, Inc. (MSCI) regarding the company's controversial decision to add Chinese companies in its equity indexes. MSCI indexes are listed on U.S. stock exchanges and available to retail investors. The MSCI Emerging Market Index includes 24 countries with emerging economies, including China. Specifically, Rubio requested information regarding whether MSCI examined the potential for funding Chinese companies involved in the Chinese government and Communist Party's military, espionage, human rights violations, and Made in China 2025 industrial policy when it performed due diligence on the Chinese firms that it includes in its indexes."We can no longer allow China's authoritarian government to reap the rewards of American and international capital markets while Chinese companies avoid financial disclosure and basic transparency, and place U.S. investors and pensioners at risk," Rubio said. "Firms like MSCI have an obligation to make sure investors know whether their investment dollars are unwittingly aiding Chinese state-owned and state-directed companies linked to China's efforts to steal American innovation, undermine fair competition, increase threats to U.S. national security and economic security, and support China's systemic and egregious human rights abuses."On December 7, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Public Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) issued a joint warning to investors about the challenges American regulators face when attempting to conduct oversight of U.S.-listed Chinese companies. Last week, Rubio introduced the bicameral, bipartisan EQUITABLE Act to increase oversight of Chinese and other foreign companies listed on American exchanges, and delist firms that are out of compliance with U.S. regulators for a period of three years.The full text of the letter is below.Dear Mr. Fernandez:I write to request information with regard to MSCI Inc.'s (MSCI) decisions to (1) include Chinese companies--such as Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co., Ltd; Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co Ltd; China Unicom (Hong Kong) Limited; AVIC Aircraft Co., Ltd.; and China Shipbuilding Industry Group Power Co Ltd--in MSCI equity indexes, and (2) increase the weighting of Chinese company shares in MSCI indexes. MSCI indexes, which are referenced by exchange traded products that are listed on U.S. exchanges, are made available for trading to American retail investors.China's economy is purposefully opaque. The Chinese Communist Party uses state-owned, and state-funded enterprises to control its production and compete in global markets. It is no secret that the interdependent nature of the government-business relationship in China is designed to serve and further the Communist Party's mercantilist goals. To this end, Beijing continues to openly disregard the rules of responsible involvement in global capital markets, and actively shields Chinese companies listed for trading on U.S. exchanges from complying with American disclosure and transparency obligations. This contempt for, and indifference to, complying with U.S. laws puts American investors at risk.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) have made clear that "for investors--both U.S. and non-U.S. investors--a U.S. listing carries with it the assumption that U.S. rules and regulatory oversight apply." While the PCAOB regularly inspects audits of U.S.-listed firms at home and abroad, Beijing consistently and systemically challenges those efforts.In fact, the SEC and PCAOB recently issued a joint warning to investors about the challenges that American regulators face when attempting to conduct oversight of U.S.-listed companies whose operations are based in China and Hong Kong. This warning pointed out some of the glaring conflicts between U.S. and Chinese law, including how Chinese law requires the books and records of a Chinese company to remain physically in China.The Communist Party has routinely used this law, as well as national security and state secrecy privileges, to restrict U.S. regulators from obtaining the basic accounting information of Chinese companies. This is just one example of how the Communist Party's disdain for complying with U.S. laws is designed to hide the truth from America's retail investors. These purposeful efforts severely undermine the disclosure and transparency requirements that have made the American capital markets the deepest and most liquid in the world.In its 2017 annual report to Congress, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission stated that "U.S. regulators have struggled to deter sophisticated efforts by some Chinese companies to defraud U.S. investors" and cited a report by GeoInvesting, a financial information website focused on small-cap stocks, that "found [that] China-based companies have perpetrated dozens of frauds on U.S. exchanges totaling at least $5 billion in losses." The dangers of fraud and deceit are far more severe for companies listed on Chinese exchanges. This past April, Kangmei Pharmaceutical Co., a Chinese company included in certain MSCI global indexes, admitted to falsely overstating the value of its cash holdings by approximately $4.4 billion.Chinese industrial policy, notably the Made in China 2025 plan, expressly seeks to supplant the U.S. as the global leader in innovation and manufacturing, devastating the American workforce in an effort to place the Communist regime in Beijing, notorious for its surveillance of its citizens and prevalent human rights abuses, at the helm of the global political order. Increasing the percentage weighting of China A shares in MSCI indexes provides an imprimatur that investing in these shares is acceptable. In reality, what MSCI is doing is allowing the Chinese Communist Party controlled market, and its state-owned national champion companies, to access a critical source of capital and clothe itself in a facade of legitimacy.As you are well aware, the inclusion of the equity of a company into an index can significantly increase the flow of retail and institutional investor money into that company. Given China's willingness to openly flout U.S. laws and its stated intentions to displace American industrial leadership, MSCIs decision to include Chinese companies in its indexes raises serious questions and concerns about the quality and depth of the diligence undertaken throughout its decision-making process.Accordingly, I ask that you provide my office with responses to the following:1. Please provide the criteria, beyond what is listed publicly on your website, used to make the decision to include Chinese companies in MSCI indexes.2. In conducting diligence on Chinese companies included in MSCI indexes, did MSCI ascertain the following information with regard to:a. the identity of the holders of company debt;b. the identity of the owners of company equity;c. any involvement of the owners of equity, debt, or other financial products with the Chinese government or Communist Party and whether any such involvement would allow the Chinese government or Communist Party to assert influence and/or control over the company;d. the relationship between the company and the Chinese government's military and intelligence services, including whether the company, for example, has served as a contractor to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) or Ministry of State Security (MSS);e. the relationship between the company and the Chinese government's systemic and egregious human rights abuses and its creation of high-tech policing and surveillance systems in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region; andf. the existence of any past national security or human rights-related abuses by the company (and any of its subsidiaries), including any direct or indirect information that MSCI reviewed linking the company to:(1) illegal island-building and militarization in the South China Sea;(2) militarily-relevant support for North Korea;(3) violations of U.S. sanctions or international sanctions;(4) known cyber hackers or perpetrators of intellectual property theft;(5) advanced weapons manufacturers;(6) ballistic missile proliferators;(7) acts of espionage; and(8) any other abuses that would contravene international norms?3.

RUBIO REQUESTS INFORMATION FROM MSCI OVER CONTROVERSIAL DECISION TO ADD CHINESE COMPANIES IN ITS EQUITY INDEXESStates News ServiceJune 13, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1621 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by Florida Senator Marco Rubio:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) requested information from MSCI, Inc. (MSCI) regarding the company's controversial decision to add Chinese companies in its equity indexes. MSCI indexes are listed on U.S. stock exchanges and available to retail investors. The MSCI Emerging Market Index includes 24 countries with emerging economies, including China. Specifically, Rubio requested information regarding whether MSCI examined the potential for funding Chinese companies involved in the Chinese government and Communist Party's military, espionage, human rights violations, and Made in China 2025 industrial policy when it performed due diligence on the Chinese firms that it includes in its indexes."We can no longer allow China's authoritarian government to reap the rewards of American and international capital markets while Chinese companies avoid financial disclosure and basic transparency, and place U.S. investors and pensioners at risk," Rubio said . "Firms like MSCI have an obligation to make sure investors know whether their investment dollars are unwittingly aiding Chinese state-owned and state-directed companies linked to China's efforts to steal American innovation, undermine fair competition, increase threats to U.S. national security and economic security, and support China's systemic and egregious human rights abuses."On December 7, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Public Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) issued a joint warning to investors about the challenges American regulators face when attempting to conduct oversight of U.S.-listed Chinese companies. Last week, Rubio introduced the bicameral, bipartisan EQUITABLE Act to increase oversight of Chinese and other foreign companies listed on American exchanges, and delist firms that are out of compliance with U.S. regulators for a period of three years.The full text of the letter is below.Dear Mr. Fernandez:I write to request information with regard to MSCI Inc.'s (MSCI) decisions to (1) include Chinese companiessuch as Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co., Ltd; Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co Ltd; China Unicom (Hong Kong) Limited; AVIC Aircraft Co., Ltd.; and China Shipbuilding Industry Group Power Co Ltdin MSCI equity indexes, and (2) increase the weighting of Chinese company shares in MSCI indexes. MSCI indexes, which are referenced by exchange traded products that are listed on U.S. exchanges, are made available for trading to American retail investors.China's economy is purposefully opaque. The Chinese Communist Party uses state-owned, and state-funded enterprises to control its production and compete in global markets. It is no secret that the interdependent nature of the government-business relationship in China is designed to serve and further the Communist Party's mercantilist goals. To this end, Beijing continues to openly disregard the rules of responsible involvement in global capital markets, and actively shields Chinese companies listed for trading on U.S. exchanges from complying with American disclosure and transparency obligations. This contempt for, and indifference to, complying with U.S. laws puts American investors at risk.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) have made clear that "for investorsboth U.S. and non-U.S. investorsa U.S. listing carries with it the assumption that U.S. rules and regulatory oversight apply." While the PCAOB regularly inspects audits of U.S.-listed firms at home and abroad, Beijing consistently and systemically challenges those efforts.In fact, the SEC and PCAOB recently issued a joint warning to investors about the challenges that American regulators face when attempting to conduct oversight of U.S.-listed companies whose operations are based in China and Hong Kong. This warning pointed out some of the glaring conflicts between U.S. and Chinese law, including how Chinese law requires the books and records of a Chinese company to remain physically in China.The Communist Party has routinely used this law, as well as national security and state secrecy privileges, to restrict U.S. regulators from obtaining the basic accounting information of Chinese companies. This is just one example of how the Communist Party's disdain for complying with U.S. laws is designed to hide the truth from America's retail investors. These purposeful efforts severely undermine the disclosure and transparency requirements that have made the American capital markets the deepest and most liquid in the world.In its 2017 annual report to Congress, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission stated that "U.S. regulators have struggled to deter sophisticated efforts by some Chinese companies to defraud U.S. investors" and cited a report by GeoInvesting, a financial information website focused on small-cap stocks, that "found [that] China-based companies have perpetrated dozens of frauds on U.S. exchanges totaling at least $5 billion in losses." The dangers of fraud and deceit are far more severe for companies listed on Chinese exchanges. This past April, Kangmei Pharmaceutical Co., a Chinese company included in certain MSCI global indexes, admitted to falsely overstating the value of its cash holdings by approximately $4.4 billion.Chinese industrial policy, notably the Made in China 2025 plan, expressly seeks to supplant the U.S. as the global leader in innovation and manufacturing, devastating the American workforce in an effort to place the Communist regime in Beijing, notorious for its surveillance of its citizens and prevalent human rights abuses, at the helm of the global political order. Increasing the percentage weighting of China A shares in MSCI indexes provides an imprimatur that investing in these shares is acceptable. In reality, what MSCI is doing is allowing the Chinese Communist Party controlled market, and its state-owned national champion companies, to access a critical source of capital and clothe itself in a fa ade of legitimacy.As you are well aware, the inclusion of the equity of a company into an index can significantly increase the flow of retail and institutional investor money into that company. Given China's willingness to openly flout U.S. laws and its stated intentions to displace American industrial leadership, MSCIs decision to include Chinese companies in its indexes raises serious questions and concerns about the quality and depth of the diligence undertaken throughout its decision-making process.Accordingly, I ask that you provide my office with responses to the following:Please provide the criteria, beyond what is listed publicly on your website, used to make the decision to include Chinese companies in MSCI indexes.In conducting diligence on Chinese companies included in MSCI indexes, did MSCI ascertain the following information with regard to:the identity of the holders of company debt;the identity of the owners of company equity;any involvement of the owners of equity, debt, or other financial products with the Chinese government or Communist Party and whether any such involvement would allow the Chinese government or Communist Party to assert influence and/or control over the company;the relationship between the company and the Chinese government's military and intelligence services, including whether the company, for example, has served as a contractor to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) or Ministry of State Security (MSS);the relationship between the company and the Chinese government's systemic and egregious human rights abuses and its creation of high-tech policing and surveillance systems in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region; andthe existence of any past national security or human rights-related abuses by the company (and any of its subsidiaries), including any direct or indirect information that MSCI reviewed linking the company to:(1) illegal island-building and militarization in the South China Sea;(2) militarily-relevant support for North Korea;(3) violations of U.S. sanctions or international sanctions;(4) known cyber hackers or perpetrators of intellectual property theft;(5) advanced weapons manufacturers;(6) ballistic missile proliferators;(7) acts of espionage; and(8) any other abuses that would contravene international norms?In making the decision to increase the weighting of shares in the China A International Index (A-Shares Index), did MSCI face any direct or indirect pressure from (a) large financial institutions, including those on Wall Street, or (b) from the Chinese government and Communist Party?MSCI acknowledges that 58 percent of the constituents in the A-Shares Index are controlled by the Chinese state.How does MSCI ensure retail investors, in America and other countries, know that any investment they make in an exchange traded product, which references the A-Shares Index, is or has the potential to be a direct capital transfer to the Chinese government and Communist Party?Has MSCI performed the due diligence necessary to ensure that investments made in an exchange-traded product, which references A-Shares Index, are not used to further the Made in China 2025 plan or similar industrial policies?I remain committed to ensuring American investors are better informed about their exposure to the financial risks, including material and asymmetric risks, of any direct or indirect investment they make in Chinese companies.

HONG KONG PROTESTERS REFUSE TO BACK DOWN CHINESE GOVERNMENT PRESSURED ON ALL SIDES AS MORE MASSIVE PROTESTS ARE PLANNED FOR SUNDAYStates News ServiceJune 13, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 545 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: ALEXANDRIA, VA BodyThe following information was released by the American Spectator Foundation:by John JiangIt has been a perilous few weeks for the Chinese Communist Party. The government faces wavering economic indicators compounded by the redoubling of its trade war with the United States, and mounting condemnation of the treatment of its Muslim Uighur population. To make matters worse for the Xi administration, protesters in Hong Kong have risen up in what could be one of the largest mass rallies in the region to date.The demonstrations are being held over an extradition bill proposed by the Hong Kong government, which may potentially give Beijing a legal excuse to abduct political activists from Hong Kong to face prosecution in mainland China under pro-communist judges. The bill is the latest in a long line of attempts to undermine the political and judicial independence of the city, which is one of two regions of China that maintains any semblance of democracy.CNN reported that the initial protest on June 9th drew as many as one million participants, more than the peak turnout during the Umbrella Movement protests that roiled Hong Kong in 2014. The protesters battled with riot police into the night, attempting several times to storm the legislative building. The debate that was scheduled for the bill was eventually delayed after entrances to the building were cut off, preventing legislators from entering. Another rally is planned for the weekend, promising continued unrest.The odds have, as always, been stacked against pro-democracy and pro-autonomy forces in the region. The 2014 protests, despite their scale and duration, failed to spur the government toward any meaningful reform. It appears that Beijing intends to pursue a similar no-concessions policy this time, dismissing the protesters as marginal troublemakers and using a mix of censorship and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks to prevent information from spreading to the mainland. Carrie Lam, the CCP-backed Chief Executive of Hong Kong, has followed her handler's line and refused to budge on extradition. It seems at first that the events of half a decade ago are likely to repeat themselves: huge protests that are ignored by the government and eventually die out, followed by clandestine crack-downs and arrests targeting the participants, sometimes years later.In 2019, however, the calculus appears to be somewhat different. The Chinese government is facing an unfamiliar crisis that is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon. Plunging consumption and a tightening job market suggest that an economic slowdown, or even a recession, is approaching. Its position is further being weakened by the United States' full-steam tariff policy, which President Trump is threatening to further escalate. An oft-repeated claim about China is that the Communist Party's legitimacy lives and dies with its ability to provide sustained economic growth. The next few years will test whether this is the case.As the gateway to China for foreign companies, Hong Kong will be central to any Chinese effort to avoid being economically isolated by America and her allies. Meanwhile, the city's democratic institutions will continue to stand as a testament to what is possible for the rest of the country.Load-Date: June 14, 2019End of Document

China has released its guidelines for approving new video games, one year after putting a freeze on new releases in the countryBusiness Insider USMay 3, 2019 Friday 12:12 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 706 wordsByline: kwebb@businessinsider.com,  (Kevin Webb)Highlight: China generated $34 billion for the video game industry in 2018, but new games must adhere to the country's strict standards to be approved for sale.Body"Monster Hunter: World"/Capcom• China has announced new regulations for publishing video games in the country after an eight-month freeze on new releases last year.• China is one of the most important markets in the video game industry, generating more than $30 billion in revenue each year.• While video games are popular in China, the Chinese government has strict regulations prohibiting violent or offensive media.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.China has officially introduced new regulations for publishing video games, clarifying how the world's largest video game market accepts new releases.China's State Administration of Press and Publication (SAPP) unveiled its guidelines for releasing new games in China during a press conference on April 10, according to Niko Partners.The Chinese government established the SAPP in April 2018 to oversee the approval of new media in the country. But as SAPP established its process for approvals, China halted the release of new video games in the country for nearly eight months.The SAPP eventually established the Online Games Ethics Committee to review new games and make sure they meet the government's standards. According to Niko Partners, the ethics committee prohibits anything that violates or threatens China's constitution, national security, or political climate; games that promote racism or religious cults; and obscene content featuring drug use, extreme violence, or gambling. Extreme violence would include images of dead bodies and pools of blood, though the country does accept some games with guns and other weapons.Read more: Kids in China are trying every trick in the book to beat the facial recognition software that puts a mandatory time limit on popular video gamesWith the new oversight committee in place, China has approved about 1,000 new video games for release since December 2018. But those games come from a backlog of titles that were originally submitted for approval between April and July 2018. The committee still has months-worth of old games to review and hundreds of new applicants will likely be submitting games through the updated application process.Chinese officials have expressed concerns about video games leading to addiction and an overall lack of productivity. Video game versions of poker and mahjong are wildly popular in China and made up about one-third of the country's new video games in 2017. The country's regulators are specifically looking to crack down on the number of gambling-related games moving forward.Chinese regulators have also been working to introduce mandatory time limits for gamers under the age of 18. Tencent, China's largest video game company and the world biggest publisher, began implementing mandatory age restrictions on its own last year, while the Chinese government was still blocking new releases.To manage the age restrictions, Tencent introduced a new program called the Real Name Identity System (RNIS). Players under the age of 18 were limited to playing just two hours a day, while those under the age of 12 were limited to one hour a day. Each player's name and age is checked against the national citizen database maintained by China's Ministry of Public Security. Tencent also introduced facial recognition software in September 2018, starting with thousands of randomly selected gamers living in Beijing and Shenzhen.Despite the country's strict regulations on video games, China's gamers generated an estimated $34.4 billion in revenue during 2018, according to NewZoo. With clear regulations in place, publishers will have a better idea of how to get their games into one of the world's most valuable markets for video games.NOW WATCH: 5G networks will be 10 times faster than 4G LTE, but we shouldn't get too excited yetSee Also:• The legendary creator of 'Metal Gear Solid' explains what his crazy new game is: 'It's really new, it's something new'• One photo perfectly captures the absurd technology used to turn real people into video game characters• Facebook has 2 new, $400 virtual reality headsets coming on May 21SEE ALSO: Kids in China are trying every trick in the book to beat the facial recognition software that puts a mandatory time limit on popular video gamesLoad-Date: May 3, 2019End of Document

Trade Talks To Break Down After US Slaps New Tariffs On ChinaLive Briefs PRO Global MarketsMay 10, 2019 Friday 1:00 PM ESTCopyright 2019 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 537 wordsBody US and Chinese trade delegations briefly held talks on Friday but appeared no closer to reaching a deal, hours after the US raised tariffs on USD200 billion worth of imports from the Asian giant.China has vowed to take "necessary countermeasures" after the tariffs were raised from 10% to 25% overnight, following a round of talks the previous day."Your all time favourite President got tired of waiting for China to help out and start buying from our FARMERS, the greatest anywhere in the World!" Trump tweeted, part of a series of messages he posted on social media."Tariffs will make our Country MUCH STRONGER, not weaker. Just sit back and watch! In the meantime, China should not renegotiate deals with the US at the last minute," the president tweeted.After the talks ended, Fox media reported that the US lead negotiators, including Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, had gone to the White House to meet Trump. Mnuchin indicated he did not expect more negotiations in this round.A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said as the tariffs kicked in that Beijing hoped to work together with the US in the spirit of cooperation and stability.The language suggested the government will probably wait until after the negotiations in Washington concluded to announce its next move.The Chinese Commerce Ministry issued a statement minutes after the tariff increases took effect, saying that "China deeply regrets it will have to take necessary countermeasures."The new tariffs affect consumer goods like suitcases and furniture along with certain food items.So far in the past year, the US has slapped tariffs on USD250 billion worth of Chinese goods, while China has retaliated with duties on USD110 billion worth of US imports.The Chinese government doesn't have much room to impose fresh tariffs, as US goods exports to China totalled USD120.3 billion in 2018, but could find other ways to penalize US businesses in China.The American Chamber of Commerce in China expressed concern over the tariff raise and China's retaliation threat. However, the business group said it supported a deal "that resolves the fundamental, structural issues" that US companies have faced in China.AmCham has said in the past that many US companies feel unwelcome in China and that they are being treated unfairly in comparison with domestic firms.On Thursday, Vice Premier Liu He, who is leading the Chinese delegation to Washington, told state broadcaster CCTV that increasing tariffs was "very unfavourable to both sides.""I came with sincerity," Liu said ahead of the talks, adding that he hoped to resolve differences "honestly, confidently and rationally."The talks began Thursday evening in the US capital.Trump announced the duty increase on Sunday, saying the move was necessary because trade negotiations were moving too slowly. On Wednesday he also accused Beijing of breaking provisions of the deal negotiated thus far in several rounds of talks.The US is angry over a trade gap with China that has vastly expanded in recent decades to about USD419 billion.Washington has accused China of unfair trade practices, including intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers and favouring domestic firms over foreign companies.Load-Date: May 11, 2019End of Document

HOW MASS SURVEILLANCE WORKS IN XINJIANG, CHINAStates News ServiceMay 2, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1130 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Chinese authorities are using a mobile app to carry out illegal mass surveillance and arbitrary detention of Muslims in China's western Xinjiang region.The Human Rights Watch report, "'China's Algorithms of Repression': Reverse Engineering a Xinjiang Police Mass Surveillance App," presents new evidence about the surveillance state in Xinjiang, where the government has subjected 13 million Turkic Muslims to heightened repression as part of its "Strike Hard Campaign against Violent Terrorism." Between January 2018 and February 2019, Human Rights Watch was able to reverse engineer the mobile app that officials use to connect to the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP), the Xinjiang policing program that aggregates data about people and flags those deemed potentially threatening. By examining the design of the app, which at the time was publicly available, Human Rights Watch revealed specifically the kinds of behaviors and people this mass surveillance system targets."Our research shows, for the first time, that Xinjiang police are using illegally gathered information about people's completely lawful behavior and using it against them," said Maya Wang, senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch. "The Chinese government is monitoring every aspect of people's lives in Xinjiang, picking out those it mistrusts, and subjecting them to extra scrutiny."Human Rights Watch published screenshots from the IJOP app, in the original Chinese and translated into English.The app prompts government officials to collect a wide array of information from ordinary people in Xinjiang.From a drop-down menu, officials are prompted to choose the circumstances under which information is being collected.The information it gathers ranges from people's blood type to their height,from their "religious atmosphere" to their political affiliation.The app's source code also reveals that the police platform targets 36 types of people for data collection. Those include people who have stopped using smart phones, those who fail to "socialize with neighbors," and those who "collected money or materials for mosques with enthusiasm."The IJOP platform tracks everyone in Xinjiang. It monitors people's movements by tracing their phones, vehicles, and ID cards. It keeps track of people's use of electricity and gas stations.Human Rights Watch found that the system and some of the region's checkpoints work together to form a series of invisible or virtual fences. People's freedom of movement is restricted to varying degrees depending on the level of threat authorities perceive they pose, determined by factors programmed into the system.A former Xinjiang resident told Human Rights Watch a week after he was released from arbitrary detention: "I was entering a mall, and an orange alarm went off." The police came and took him to a police station. "I said to them, 'I was in a detention center and you guys released me because I was innocent.'... The police told me, 'Just don't go to any public places.'... I said, 'What do I do now? Just stay home?' He said, 'Yes, that's better than this, right?'"The authorities have programmed the IJOP so that it treats many ordinary and lawful activities as indicators of suspicious behavior, for example:Officials are prompted to investigate those determined to have used an "unusual" amount of electricity.Officials can select from a list of reasons for unusual electricity consumption, such as: "purchased new electronics for domestic use" or "doing renovations."The system detects when the registered owner of the car is not the same as the person who is buying gasoline.The app's source code suggests that nearby are required to investigate by logging the reasons for the mismatch,and deciding whether this case seems suspicious and requires further police investigation.The app alerts officials to people who took trips abroad that it considers excessively long,then prompts officials to interrogate the "overdue" person or their relatives and other acquaintances, asking them for details about the travel.The system alerts officials if it has lost track of someone's phone, to determine whether the owner's actions are suspicious and require investigation.Some of the investigations involve checking people's phones for any one of the 51 internet tools that are considered suspicious, including WhatsApp, Viber, Telegram, and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), Human Rights Watch found. The IJOP system also monitors people's relationships, identifying as suspicious travelling with anyone on a police watch list, for example, or anyone related to someone who has recently obtained a new phone number.Based on these broad and dubious criteria, the system generates lists of people to be evaluated by officials for detention. Official documents state individuals "who ought to be taken, should be taken," suggesting the goal is to maximize detentions for people found to be "untrustworthy." Those people are then interrogated without basic protections. They have no right to legal counsel, and some are tortured or otherwise mistreated, for which they have no effective redress.The IJOP system was developed by China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC), a major state-owned military contractor in China. The IJOP app was developed by Hebei Far East Communication System Engineering Company (HBFEC), a company that, at the time of the app's development, was fully owned by CETC.Under the Strike Hard Campaign, Xinjiang authorities have also collected biometrics, including DNA samples, fingerprints, iris scans, and blood types of all residents in the region ages 12 to 65. The authorities require residents to give voice samples when they apply for passports. All of this data is being entered into centralized, searchable government databases. While Xinjiang's systems are particularly intrusive, their basic designs are similar to those the police are planning and implementing throughout China.The Chinese government should immediately shut down the IJOP platform and delete all the data that it has collected from individuals in Xinjiang, Human Rights Watch said. Concerned foreign governments should impose targeted sanctions, such as under the US Global Magnitsky Act, including visa bans and asset freezes, against the Xinjiang Party Secretary, Chen Quanguo, and other senior officials linked to abuses in the Strike Hard Campaign. They should also impose appropriate export control mechanisms to prevent the Chinese government from obtaining technologies used to violate basic rights. United Nations member countries should push for an international fact-finding mission to assess the situation in Xinjiang and report to the UN Human Rights Council.Load-Date: May 2, 2019End of Document

Rubio Urges Britain to Abandon Reported 5G Plans With China's HuaweiTargeted News ServiceMay 1, 2019 Wednesday 8:17 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4424 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe office of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, issued the following news release:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) urged the United Kingdom to abandon its reported plans to allow Huawei, a Chinese state-directed telecoms company, to participate in its 5G networks in remarks on the U.S.-China relationship at an event hosted by the Ronald Reagan Institute to mark the 35th anniversary of President Reagan's speech at Shanghai's Fudan University:"But we should be alarmed that one of our closest allies in the world, the United Kingdom, may choose to go in a different direction in 5G. There were news reports last week that Britain is may be set to allow China to participate in its 5G networks and these reports by the way coincided with the British Chancellor's trip to Beijing for the Second Annual Belt and Road Forum. It is my understanding, and frankly my earnest hope, that the decision may not yet truly be final, and that many British policymakers and intelligence officials internally share our fundamental concerns that this risk that's posed cannot be mitigated and therefore should not be permitted. So, I want to publicly urge our British allies not to endanger our decades of Five Eyes cooperation by partnering on 5G with Huawei or any other Chinese directed telecom company because there is too much at stake here."Senator Rubio's full remarks (https://www.facebook.com/SenatorMarcoRubio/videos/2311061245837741?s=100008394695091&#38;v=e&#38;sfns=mo) follow below.Rubio: Thank you very much. Thank you Fred for inviting me, for introducing me, that's very kind. I want to thank John Heubusch, Roger Zakheim, Rachel Hoff, and your colleagues at the Institute for giving me this opportunity and for organizing this event to mark the 35th anniversary of that speech, which you just saw a snippet of a moment ago. I wanted to spend today with you doing 3 things. The first, I wanted to talk about the historic significance of that speech, not just to U.S.-China relations, but to the cause of freedom and liberty around the world. Then I wanted to turn to the complex and challenging relationship today between China in the 21st century and our country. And third, some of the difficult choices we face with regards to that relationship.Let's talk first about the speech. Some of you here today probably don't remember that speech very well in 1984. I would have been in 8th grade. Actually, April 1984, I would have been in 7th grade. I remember that year only because it was Dan Marino's second year and the Dolphins were a football team. But we're coming back. Many people who work for me weren't even born in 1984.But it was a part, as you said, of that historic six-day visit, and it was directed at the Chinese people. And the speech was typical Reagan. It overflowed with hope and optimism. That short snip-it gave you some insight into that. And in it he spoke about growing educational and cultural exchanges, how it could increase mutual understandings between the United States and China. He called for greater bilateral cooperation in the fields of science, and technology, and medicine. And he aspired for the U.S.-China relationship to be one that realized the greater community of common interests, and to find a new political will to solve the world's intractable problems.Today, those optimistic words about cooperation with China seem naive, out of touch, and out of place. But that's 35 years later. The China of the 1980s was not yet the China that we know today. It was still emerging at that time from traumas and the tragedies of Mao's Cultural Revolution. It was in the process of industrializing, modernizing. And it was still having a very vibrant internal debate about how to engage with the wider world, economically culturally and in other ways.But there is something about that speech that stands the test of time, and that is championing the cause of individual liberty, freedom, and democracy.The America that Reagan described to his Chinese audience, which was an audience frankly that at the time was largely unaware -- it wasn't like the world today, where you have millions of Chinese citizens who travel throughout the world and are well aware of what the rest of the world looks like. China in 1984, the vast majority of its people, certainly the vast majority of the people that heard that speech live, had very little understanding about America or the West, at least as we would understand it. So they were largely unfamiliar.But the America that he describes is actually a challenge to us today where he talks about a resourceful nation of immigrants, including Chinese immigrants who were making important contributions. He extolled our fairmindedness, our idealism, our compassion, our religion and faith. And he also talked about our differences. About how we were a people who vibrantly disagreed with one another, yet held together as one nation.And it is a reminder and a challenge in our modern era why that is first and foremost the greatest contribution that we can make to the world, that is our own example. Not just our system of self-governance, not just our ability to hold elections that are valid and credible, but the ability to recognize that, despite our massive differences, we are of one people, united by one nation, who share this one nation, and a people who share a nation that was founded on the powerful belief in dignity of every and each man, woman, and child. And founded on our belief, as stated in the words of our Declaration of Independence, that all men are created equal, because they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights. Among those are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And it's important for us to continue to remember these things even in our modern era. Because if we lose that understanding, then we have no standing at all to speak about liberty and freedom and what it can produce in a society anywhere in the world.I would say in 1984 especially few of any Chinese had ever heard a foreign leader speak that way on their soil, and as he did so eloquently as Reagan always did. And he perhaps maybe even inspired young people in that crowd to dream for more. I certainly would like to think so.I would add that those daring remarks came about five years before the pro-democracy protesters took to Tiananmen Square to call for reforms and change. And while the Chinese Communist Party has spent the last three decades trying to erase the names, and the memory, of any of the Tiananmen protesters, the bravery of those young Chinese in the face of certain danger leaves us still in awe. Particularly, a reminder that the principles of freedom, democracy and self-rule that Reagan spoke about, these are not American principles. These are principles deeply imbedded in the heart and in the mind of every single human being. And history has always been a struggle between those fighting to defend those principles and those seeking to deny them. And that desire for liberty is universal, it is immortal, it is as old as mankind's presence on the Earth itself.Which leads us to the China in 21st century.As we approach this now 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, we are reminded that for three decades many had hoped for the development of a cooperative and mutual beneficial relationship with China. President Clinton pursued constructive engagement to help reenergize China's global integration. The Bush administration encouraged China a new role of responsible stakeholder in the international community. And then more recently President Obama advanced an Asia pivot, he of course declined to directly acknowledge China as the revisionist geopolitical rival that by then it had become.But now I believe we have reached a new turning point, and one of that must be handled carefully, but must be handled. And that is the growing and widespread recognition in this city and across American policymaking that China, under Xi Jinping and the Communist Party, has become a near-peer strategic competitor to the United States, and ultimately to the cause of freedom around the world. And I reiterate what I just said a moment ago, not China, but President Xi and the Communist Party of China, have positioned China to become a near-peer rival to the United States.Its military is growing in size, in sophistication, and aggressiveness. It's aligned geopolitically with Russia, with Iran, with Maduro in Venezuela, North Korea, to not just promote but to protect totalitarianism. In fact, to offer totalitarianism, their form of totalitarianism, as an acceptable alternative, perhaps even a more effective one than what they couch as the chaos and unruliness of the free world.It is also, by the way under President Xi and some of his predecessors, used our own open and free international order against us. The Communist Party of China is overseeing the greatest illegitimate transfer of wealth in human history using force technology transfer, and a whole-of-nation approach and espionage to steal American innovation and ingenuity from our companies, our centers of research, our universities. In fact, the U.S Office of the Trade Representative recently estimated that Chinese intellectual property theft cost the United States as much as 600 billion dollars annually, a staggering amount. A staggering amount. It exceeds the collective profit of the top 50 companies from the Fortune 500.Increased trade with China yielded some short-term benefits for consumers, there's no doubt about it, primarily in the form of oil prices and short-term advantages for American companies in the form of higher profit margins. But the so called "China Shock," the cumulative impact of China's entering the international trade system, wiped out more than 2.4 million American jobs from 1999 to 2011. And the "China Shock" devastated American small- and medium- size manufacturers in concentrated areas throughout the country. It is a result of that is some of the political anxiety that we see manifested in recent elections.Under President Xi, Beijing is just getting started. It's now boldly pursuing an industrial policy called "Made in China 2025" with the goal of eventually displacing America and other industrialized nations, and dominating global exports and key next-generation technology subjects. Beijing, for example, is subsidizing Chinese state-directed telecoms, companies like Huawei, and ZTE, to ensure that they dominate the future of emerging 5G networks around the world. As the Director of the FBI has warned, "such power over our telecommunications provides the capacity to exert pressure or control over our telecommunications infrastructure. It provides the capacity to maliciously modify or steal information, and it provides the capacity to conduct undetected espionage." By the way that was a quote, I should of said quote, from the FBI Director.China uses its growing and unfettered access to America's 40 trillion dollar capital markets to finance these threatening activities. American investors, and fund managers, and pension holders are often unwittingly investing in funds that hold Chinese companies like Hikvision and Dahua Technology with concealed ties to China's military, espionage or human rights abuses. And it uses the weight of its massive economy to extent the long arm of its authoritarianism in efforts to bully or to bribe other nations to bend to its will.One example of this is the "Belt and Road Initiative" through which it carries out "debt-trap diplomacy." Entrapping debt-ridden foreign governments with extravagant promises of investments for their infrastructure projects. Some countries have already learned the hard lesson of this debt-trap diplomacy. Sri Lanka for example, as many of you well know, it's well documented, lost control of a major port after defaulting on a Chinese loan. Other countries are naively ignoring the risks, like Italy, which became the first G7 nation to sign onto the Belt and Road Initiative.To cite another example, Beijing is increasingly using threats to deny access to its vast markets and economy if companies do not agree to its demands to isolate our ally Taiwan or to conform to Chinese political correctness on topics like Tibet, Hong Kong, and Macau.What's more is China is using a whole nation approach to exploit the open societies of democracy, including our political system and our universities and exert malign influence that is covert, coercing and corrupt, not only in places like Taiwan, Australia, Europe, and Latin America, but also here in the United States. It's malign activities include spreading propaganda and misinformation, censoring foreign criticism of the Communist regime, and even using Chinese students and academics to steal technology, and trade secrets, and proprietary data, and research and development.Last, but certainly not least, China has left no doubt that under President Xi it will continue to be a totalitarian power. In the decades since Tiananmen, the Chinese government and the Communist Party have only tightened their grip. This has only accelerated in the last few years.And they've only accelerated as well in brutally suppressing dissent at home. For example, they continue to perfect the surveillance and monitoring of its own people, including omnipresent cameras, artificial intelligence-driven facial recognition, and so-called "social credit system" that rates a Chinese citizen based on their compliance with the government. In fact, they are not just doing this at home, they are exporting it around the world as a "safety and law enforcement feature," and you can imagine how attractive this sort of technology is to totalitarian governments.They have also left no doubt that it's one of the worst abusers of human rights and the rule of law. Look no further than the disappeared of human rights lawyers, the imprisoned Christian pastor, or the unjust detention and tragic death of Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo.Look no further than Hong Kong, where Beijing continues to undermine and erode, not to mention break, the promises it made about Hong Kong's long cherished economy.Look no further than their harsh policies against unregistered Christian churches, Tibetan Buddhists, Falun Gong practitioners, and other religious adherents.And look no further than Xinjiang, where China has concentrated over one million Uyghurs and other religious and ethnic minorities in what they call "vocational schools" or "reeducation camps," but what we would recognize as prison camps. Establishing Orwellian levels of high tech surveillance and monitoring, including the forced providing of people's DNA.What Xi Jinping calls the "Chinese Dream," has for millions of people, become a brutal and unending nightmare.These are some of many challenges that the modern-day Xi Jinping-lead Chinese Communist Party pose to the free world. And so, while we hope for something different and believe that China has the potential for something vastly different, we must undertake the task of reordering our foreign and domestic policies to bring balance to our relationship with them. This new approach must be built on four imperatives. Those four imperatives are sovereignty, and reciprocity, transparency, and a commitment, a Reagan-like commitment, to protecting human rights, democracy, and a rule of law.The Trump administration's efforts to deal with unfair trade practices by China is not just about trade. At its core, it's about defending sovereignty and demanding reciprocity. We cannot give into some of the pressure that you read about to enter into a bad deal. A good deal, the right deal, an acceptable one is one that achieves the goals that the President himself outlined last year, namely, meaningful and fully enforceable structural changes on forced technology transfers, intellectual-property theft, non-tariff barriers and cybersecurity.Our efforts to defend our sovereignty and secure reciprocity also requires us to address "Made in China 2025" and other forms of industrial policy. As I outline in a report titled "Made in China 2025 and the Future of American Industry," which did out of the Small Business Committee in the Senate that I chair, this growth agenda requires us to focus on domestic physical investment and domestic labor market stabilization.This is not just something that we need to focus on externally, but internally, to prioritize national development and economic dynamism and business competitiveness at the small, medium, and large business levels. It also means that we have to enact in kind and reciprocal responses to malicious Chinese trade and industrial practices, including developing our own approach to industrial policy and strategy to compete and win in this new 21st century.The imperative of transparency requires that we must establish strength and disclosure requirements to alert American investors about the presence in the U.S. capital markets of Chinese companies that pose national security dangers or that are complicit in China's human rights abuses. Many Americans, if not most, would be rightly troubled, even outraged, to learn that their retirement and other investment dollars are funding companies with links to the Chinese government's security apparatus and malevolent behavior. Links that represent real, material, asymmetric risks to corporate reputation and share value.Sovereignty and transparency also require us not to cede the future of 5G networks to Chinese state-directed companies like Huawei. Ultra-fast 5G networks will fundamentally transform the speed, the magnitude by which we connect and do business in the 21st century. It will enable our innovators to develop the Internet of Things, smart cities, autonomous vehicles and the like. But whoever ends up developing and deploying 5G networks first, is going to determine what those standards of all the interests that depend on it are. Therefore, this is not just an economic security issue, it's a national security issue.On this point I know that the U.S. government is doing a lot. I've worked closely with my colleague from Virginia, Senator Mark Warner, the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, to do our part to warn our allies, including the so called "Five Eyes" nations, Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand about the threat that these 5G networks pose.Australia, for example, took a very significant step last year when it established country neutral criteria that prohibits foreign companies who are beholden in extrajudicial to foreign governments from participating in both the core and edge of its future 5G networks. This will effectively ban Huawei and ZTE from doing that in Australia.But we should be alarmed that one of our closest allies in the world, the United Kingdom, may choose to go in a different direction in 5G. There were news reports last week that Britain is may be set to allow China to participate in its 5G networks and these reports by the way coincided with the British Chancellor's trip to Beijing for the Second Annual Belt and Road Forum.It is my understanding, and frankly my earnest hope, that the decision may not yet truly be final, and that many British policymakers and intelligence officials internally share our fundamental concerns that this risk that's posed cannot be mitigated and therefore should not be permitted.So, I want to publicly urge our British allies not to endanger our decades of Five Eyes cooperation by partnering on 5G with Huawei or any other Chinese directed telecom company because there is too much at stake here.Countering these malign influence and interference in our democracies, our open society, and our universities, will require the government to partner closely with the private sector. On this point as well I've worked closely again with Senator Warner along with the chairman of the Senate Intel committee, Senator Burr, and the Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, and leading officials in the intelligence community and law enforcement. Together we've worked together behind the scenes to have candid, classified conversations with America's leaders in business, and venture capital, and higher education about the many threats posed by China to our national security, and to our economic security as well.I've also partnered with Senator Catherine Cortez-Masto of Nevada to reintroduce the Countering the Chinese Government Communist Party Political Influence Operations Act. We're going to work to shorten the title of bill. But it's bipartisan, and it aims to use transparency to combat China's political influence operations in the country and worldwide by requiring the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence to organize an interagency task force to compile an unclassified report to make more transparent China's disinformation, press manipulation, economic coercion, and influence operations in the U.S. and partner nations.I also believe the United States needs to find new ways to bring together partners from Japan, Taiwan, Australia, Latin America, Europe, and elsewhere who are dealing with the exact same malign influence and interference efforts. We need to learn from our experiences and fashion new ways to collectively counter this growing threat.And finally, just as Reagan did 30 years ago, we must never cease in advocating for the protection of human rights and the rule of law, freedom, and liberty.I continue to co-lead the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, where we hold hearings and publish an Annual Report to shine light on Communist China's human rights abuses and violations of the rule of law. From that forum, we seek to give voice to the voiceless inside of China -- to the disappeared human rights lawyer, to the detained Christian pastor, to the imprisoned Falun Gong practitioner. The list of political prisoners in China is unfortunately and long and growing longer.We continue to do our part to make sure the world knows about what's happening in Xinjiang -- the crimes against humanity, the crimes being committed against the Uyghurs and other religious and ethnic minorities.That's why in January, I re-introduced the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act with Senator Menendez, a bill that would require the Director of National Intelligence and the State Department to report about the regional security threat posed by this crackdown in Xinjiang, and to generate a list of Chinese companies that are involved in the construction and operation of these mass detention camps. It also requires a report on efforts how the FBI is helping to better inform and protect Uyghurs and others who are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents from Chinese government harassment and intimidation here in the U.S. on our own soil.I recently led 24 Senators and 19 House Members in a letter urging the State Department and the Treasury Department to impose Global Magnitsky sanctions against Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses. These sanctions are long overdue and it is time to take action on them.Co-led by Senator Menendez and Congressmen Jim McGovern and Chris Smith, our letter also urges the Commerce Department to update U.S. export controls to stop American companies from exporting equipment and technology that enables these crimes against humanity in Xinjiang.Advocating for human rights and the rule of law in China needs to be made integral to any discussion that the United States Government has with China, or with allies and partners about China.In closing, let me say that when the history of this new century is written, there is going to be pages -- well, much of what dominates cable news today, there may be some footnotes, maybe a chapter here or there, but most of it will be forgotten. The one thing I am certain, is that when the history of this century is written, it will largely be about the relationship between the United States and China. It is a relationship that will literally define this new era.Now, what do I hope for? I hope for something different.The path that China is currently on is not inevitable. I know, for a fact, that in the largest, most populous nation on Earth, there are millions and millions of people who aspire to more liberty, more freedom, more opportunity. I know for a fact that millions and millions of Chinese citizens travel abroad every year and see what life is like in the rest of the world. And I am hopeful, that the day will come when that opportunity will be presented to them in their own country. And that is not the direction their headed now.It's been an erratic departure from the past, in particular with President Xi writing out collective leadership, positioning himself as the core leader as he likes to call himself, making himself potentially president for life. And not just trying to control outside ideas, but to prevent them, to block them. The outside ideas he speaks of are individual liberty, human rights, democracy. The worthiness, the value, and the dignity of every single human being. These are the outside ideas he seeks to block. These are also ideas that are not simply American ideas, as I said earlier, they are universal. They also have to be definitional.And so in so many ways we are hopeful for a different China, with different leadership, that becomes our partner in solving the global challenges of our time. But we acknowledge that it is not what it is today and that it is increasingly headed in a different direction.And so we are left with a choice. And that is, in this new century, will the most powerful nation on Earth, or the most powerful nations on Earth, be free nations of free people who believe that every single human being has certain rights and has value? Or will the most powerful nation on Earth be one that does not believe in individual liberty and all of us exist to simply serve the state?It's a big difference. We have all been born and raised in a world in which its most powerful nation is one that believes that every single one of you, your rights come from your Creator. And the world is better for that. The world will not be a better place if the alternative is true. And that is above all else, the challenge before us.And so I thank you for the opportunity to talk about this. I believe we'll get it right, but we better start now. Because this new century is here and it is being even defined as we speak. So thank you for the opportunity to address you.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6716575 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: May 2, 2019End of Document

EU and China are different worlds and Huawei is the testCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 1, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1229 wordsBody HONG KONG (CNN) - Leading negotiators from the United States and China once again met in Beijing last Thursday and Friday, in the most recent attempt by the two largest economies in the world to negotiate a trade agreement.  Since the beginning of 2018, the two governments have been caught up in an escalation of the trade war, which has generated the imposition of tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of US and Chinese products.  The hopes of an imminent - and long-awaited - trade agreement were recently reinforced with reports of a possible summit in April between US President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping.  But regardless of the success of the talks, it is likely that the two countries remain unreconciled on certain key political and economic fronts.  The Chinese technological giant Huawei, which on Friday announced its annual results, is the clearest example.  During the past 12 months, the Trump government has put pressure on countries around the world not to use Huawei's equipment in the development of next-generation 5G networks, arguing that the products manufactured by the Chinese company represent a security risk  This month, in an attempt to push back Washington, Huawei filed a lawsuit against the US government, alleging unconstitutional discrimination.  The lawsuit serves as a reminder of the reasons for the start of the trade war: the apparent disparity between access and legal rights granted to Chinese companies operating in the West, compared to the difficult trade conditions facing US companies. in China, where some companies are required to form joint ventures with domestic partners in certain key sectors.  In addition, in China, US companies have few legal recourses against government policy.  "There have been many cases in which foreign courts in several countries give reason to the Western company," said Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. Often, when that same case arrives in a Chinese court, the foreign company loses.  "That seems to be a political bias," Atkinson added.  Point of pride  Since being a small company founded by a former Chinese soldier in 1988, Huawei has become one of the world's leading technology providers and a leader in super-fast 5G networking equipment.  In China, the firm is a symbol of the country's economic boom and a source of pride because its technology equals or surpasses its Western rivals.  But, for Washington, the technology giant is a private company in name only.  In August, the Trump government passed the National Defense Authorization Act, which prohibits US government agencies from using technology manufactured by Huawei or its smaller Chinese rival, ZTE, for fear that the company has close ties. with the Chinese government, and the use of its technology may leave the agencies exposed to Chinese surveillance.  Huawei has repeatedly denied that any of its products pose a risk to national security.  Months later, in December, Beijing was outraged after Huawei's financial director, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in Canada, facing extradition to the United States on charges of violating sanctions against Iran.  In 2019, Huawei began to press against. The founder Ren Zhengfei raised his voice to assure the clients the independence of his company.  "We decided tothat our voice is heard at this moment because the US government considers us a threat to national security ... Why is it only pointed to Huawei? "Ren asked.  The lawsuit, announced at the beginning of March, is the most recent step to take the fight back to the United States. But Atkinson said that US companies have been banned regularly in China for reasons of national security and that they have had access to few legal resources, unlike Huawei.  Zhang Lin, an independent Chinese economist and columnist, said he had never heard of a US company that brought the Chinese government to court.  "It is difficult for a company (China) to file an administrative claim, even more difficult for a foreign company. It could be blocked in the first place when I try to open a case, "he said.  'Rule of law'  Answering questions at the press conference in which he announced the demand for potential disparity between the systems of the two countries, Song Liuping, Huawei's chief legal employee, said China was "governed by the rule of law."  "There are specific courts that offer trials in every area of society and the government of China. I think that if other multinational corporations, or even Chinese companies, face illegal government actions, they can stand up for their rights, "he said. "Just as we are rising up in defense of our rights in the United States."  But Beijing has not been timid in the past about marginalizing US companies from obtaining contracts with Chinese government agencies, in a way that the US government considers protectionist.  In 2014, Reuters reported that numerous foreign technology brands had been removed from a "state-approved shopping list," which virtually prevented Chinese government agencies from using their products and services.  This is not the only reported example of foreign technology blocked by Beijing. In 2014, the Microsoft Windows 8 operating system was banned from all Chinese government computers. No explanation was given.  Both situations were similar to the one faced by Huawei. In neither case is there a public record that a lawsuit has been filed against the Chinese government.  One of the regular complaints of foreign companies in China, according to the US Chamber of Commerce in Beijing, is the inconsistent interpretation of the regulations by the Chinese authorities and the unclear application of the laws.  Shortly after imposing its first tariffs on Chinese products, Trump said those "unjust" barriers must fall.  "Measures should be taken to encourage China to change its unfair practices, open its market to US products and accept a more balanced trade relationship with the United States," Trump said in his official Twitter account in June 2018.  Ingrained inequality  However, there has been some progress in opening the Chinese economy to US and global interests.  For example, China's financial industry was finally open to international companies in November 2017, although many other sectors still have strict restrictions on the size of foreign investment.  "If you simply look at the access to the market that Chinese law firms have in the United States and compare it with market access (or the lack of it) that US law firms have in China, this is definitely an area in the that we have beendefending our rights repeatedly, "said Alan Beebe, president of the US Chamber of Commerce in Beijing.  The uneven playing field between US and Chinese companies remains one of the biggest obstacles in the ongoing trade negotiations, along with the trade deficit and the alleged forced transfer of technology.  But Atkinson said that even in the best of cases, it is unlikely that any trade agreement will resolve the great differences between the United States and China, their political systems and their economies.  "I do not think we'll ever level it out ... the distorted playing field is so ingrained in everything that China does. It would be a long, long time before it was completely leveled, "he said.  Serenitie Wang of CNN contributed to this article. Load-Date: April 2, 2019End of Document

The Pope sold himself to the communists, regrets Chinese cardinalCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 8, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1402 wordsBody        Cardinal Zen, who was imprisoned and exiled by the Chinese Communist regime, reproaches the Pope for his complicity with the repression of the faithful. (Facebook)  Bibles burnt down, churches demolished, crosses demolished with cranes and priests in forced labor camps are the consequence of living under a regime declared atheist, as is the Chinese communist regime.  That is why Cardinal Zen, who was persecuted and exiled by the Chinese communist regime, responded emphatically "Yes!" When asked if Pope Francis sold himself to the communists.  "The communists do not want to reach a consensus, they want you to surrender," said the bishop in the mini-documentary recently released "China's war against Christians."  "We forget that you can never really have a good agreement with a totalitarian regime," said Bishop Emeritus of Hong Kong, Cardinal Zen, in September 2018, when Pope Francis signed a Provisional Agreement between the Vatican and the Communist Government. of China for the appointment of bishops.  "Catholics and other believers were arrested and sent to labor camps. I returned to China in 1974 during the Cultural Revolution, and the situation was terrible, worse than you can imagine. It was a nation under slavery and we forgot these things easily, "he said. The clandestine church is the legitimate church Since 1949, when communism was established in China, the government ordered the expulsion of hundreds of priests and bishops, and for decades the Church functioned clandestinely.  This was aggravated by the so-called Cultural Revolution that began in 1966 when churches were destroyed by soldiers of the Red Guard and became deposits of state factories.  Now Pope Francis seeks to alleviate this separation, through an agreement with the Chinese Government that would allow Catholics to practice their faith, through the churches authorized by the Communist Party.  But the priests imprisoned and persecuted by the regime insist that "the clandestine church is the legitimate church."  "They are not going to choose good bishops for us," Zen exclaims. He insists that the regime chooses the bishops who obey the party and even called on the Catholics to return to the catacombs, since those who live their faith in the light of day have been and they are persecuted.  China's war on Christians  Almost 6 million Roman Catholics in China have underground churches, hidden away in buildings or homes, because they risk harassment and jail time for practicing their faith.  Posted by CBS News on Monday, April 1, 2019  With regard to Chinese priests and bishops, Cardinal Zen insists that "they will be forced to join the so-called conference of bishops. They will be forced to join others in that bird cage, and they will become a minority among them. The Vatican agreement, which sought the unification of the Church in China, means the annihilation of the true Church in China.

He does not know them as the persecutors in whom they once become in power, like the communists in China. "  And it is that Francisco was a young priest when the last military dictatorship in Argentina happened that crushed the Marxist and Peronist guerrillas in the 70s.  So much that it has come to romanticize this ideology claiming that "it is the communists who think like the Christians". Atheism and communism That is why the Zen Cardinal is not limited to the Chinese case, highlighting the abandonment by Francisco to his faithful in the most socialist country in America, Cuba.  He inquired "what did the visit to Cuba by Francisco in 2015 leave for the Church? What did he leave to the Cuban people? Almost nothing. Did he convert the Castro brothers? "  The truth is that when Cuba opened its doors to EE. UU Under the government of Barack Obama, the Cuban regime persecuted the practitioners more ferociously to "clean the streets" of their presence, given that they would receive diplomatic groups and tourists. And Catholics and Christians of all denominations suffered arrests, expropriations and torture because of it.  One of the released prisoners, from exile, gave his statements to PanAm Post.  Mario Felix Lleonart Barroso, Baptist pastor, founder of the Patmos Institute explains that the Cuban state has copied the Chinese system for religious repression. China has its State Administration for Religious Care (SARA), Cuba has its OAAR; China has its Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSMP), Cuba has the Council of Churches of Cuba (CIC).  Given its concern for the phenomenon of Christian growth, China is applying its "Operation Deterrence" where it tries to "guide" believers who attend unauthorized churches towards which the state controls and manipulates.  The State Security of Cuba tries to implement a similar system to control the Protestant denominations with legal recognition in the Register of Associations of the Ministry of Justice (MINJUS) to achieve the same thing that the Chinese Communist Party tries, and thus stop the growth, repress, and even, if possible, destroy Christian movements.  From the philosophical point of view, the pastor maintains, that atheism is another religion: the religion of "unbelief" in a divine being and in any aspect that can be classified as merely subjective.  He affirms that the confessional state is reflected in propagandistic terms like "the Party is eternal", granting metaphysical values and a credo to the ideology.  But this the Pope Francisco I does not see it. In the same way that ignores the persecution of the faithful in regimes such as China, Cuba and Venezuela, where the regime has taken the Our Father and has become the "Chávez Our".  For now there is hope among the faithful that Francis will learn from the martyrdom of the persecuted and follow the example of his predecessor, John Paul II, who managed to make the Nativity re-celebrate - after decades - in Cuba and was an active part of the fall of the Berlin Wall and with the socialism of the twentieth century.  .TF_1.ob-strip-layout .ob-widget-header {width: 100%; color: #ffffff; background: # 008ec5; padding: 6px 0px 2px 6px; font-family: \ 'notosans \', \ 'Arial \', \ 'Helvetica \', \ 'sans-serif \'; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 5px; border-bottom: 3px solid #ddd; font-size: 18px; text-transform: uppercase; background: # 003a5b! important; border-color:#bbbbbb;  margin-top: 20px;}.TF_1.ob-strip-layout .ob-rec-text {font-family:inherit;color:black;padding:3px 0 0px;text-align:left;line-height:1.25;font-size:12px;}.TF_1.ob-strip-layout .ob-rec-text:hover {color:#008ec5;}.TF_1.ob-strip-layout .ob-rec-source {font-family:inherit;color:#999;padding:2px 0 0px;text-align:left;font-size:10px;}/* Smartphones (portrait and landscape) ----------- */@media only screen and (min-width : 320px) and (max-width : 699px) {.OUTBRAIN .TF_1.ob-widget .ob-widget-items-container {  width: 100%;  float: left;}.OUTBRAIN .TF_1.ob-strip-layout .ob-dynamic-rec-container {  max-width: 100%;  width: 97%;}.OUTBRAIN .TF_1 ul.ob-widget-items-container.ob-multi-row.ob-row-1 {  padding-top: 0;}.TF_1 span.ob-unit.ob-rec-image-container {  width: 34%;  float: left;}.OUTBRAIN .TF_1.ob-widget .ob-dynamic-rec-container ~ .ob-dynamic-rec-container {  margin: 0;}.OUTBRAIN .TF_1.ob-strip-layout .ob-rec-text {  padding: 0px 0 0px 2%;  }  .OUTBRAIN .TF_1.ob-strip-layout .ob-rec-source {  float: left;  margin-left: 2%;}.OUTBRAIN .TF_1.ob-widget {  min-width: 320px;}.OUTBRAIN .TF_1.ob-strip-layout .ob-rec-text {  line-height: 1;  font-size: 14px;  font-weight: bold;  margin-top: 0px;}.TF_1 li.ob-dynamic-rec-container {  margin-bottom: 2.5%!important;}.OUTBRAIN .TF_1.ob-strip-layout .ob-rec-source {  font-size: 10px;max-width: 190px;}}.OUTBRAIN .TF_1.ob-widget .ob_what a, .OUTBRAIN .TF_1.ob-strip-layout .ob-rec-source {  font-weight: normal;} .TF_1.ob-widget .ob_what {  margin-bottom: 17px;}Load-Date: April 9, 2019End of Document

And happy Tuesday, everybody, I'm Maria Bartiromo, good to see you, it is Tuesday, June 25th, your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.We have breaking news once again this morning. Iran is slamming the U.S. sanctions, Tehran calling them outrageous. They end any chance of diplomacy, according to Iran.Border battle back on Capitol Hill, meanwhile, a $4-1/2-billion bill to provide more funding for migrant families detained at the border, is up for a vote today. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, facing backlash within her own party over this. This as Mexico sends 15,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border overnight.FedEx, suing the government over Huawei restrictions, the shipping giant is suing the commerce department now, find out what its claims are, coming up.And SpaceX blasts off, the first night launch, sending 24 satellites into orbit, what makes this launch so important, coming up. MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.BARTIROMO: And breaking news, Middle East tensions this morning. Iran says that new U.S. sanctions have closed the door at this point on any diplomacy. It has threatened global security and stability according to Iran. President Trump signed an Executive Order yesterday, designating Iran supreme leader in a new round of sanctions.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The supreme leader of Iran is one who ultimately is responsible for the hostile conduct of the regime. He's respected within his country. His office overseas is the regime's most brutal instrument, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.Sanctions imposed through the Executive Order that I'm about to sign, will deny the supreme leader and the supreme leader's office and those closely affiliated with him and the office, access to key financial resources and support.BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is the Chairman of the Institute for the Study of War, FOX News Senior Strategic Analyst, Retired Four Star General, Jack Keane, and General, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks so muchGEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: Good morning, Maria.BARTIROMO: -- for joining me. Your reaction first, to Iran's reaction to these sanctions, and then I want to talk a little more about the practicality of these sanctions, what they actually do.KEANE: Well, first of all, the Iranian reaction is predictable, whereas like, outrageous, it's not going to lead to diplomacy, but, look, what are we really doing here? The United States is removing the veil of deception that has shrouded this regime for years, and the pretense, though, the administrations have had about their behavior.The supreme leader was president from '81 to '89. During that time frame, the United States -- two embassies were blown up and a marine barracks in Lebanon was also blown up. In '94, when he was a supreme leader, we lost our barracks in Khobar Towers, and then the four-year campaign targeting Americans in Iraq which were poorly killed, over 600.And as a supreme leader, the IRGC or the Revolutionary Guard Corps could (INAUDIBLE) report to him. The IRGC runs the Civil War in Syria, Assad's generals report to the IRCG generals, and they've lost three or four of them. So, the 600,000 dead, Maria, in Syria, is the supreme leader has got that blood on his hands.While the -- while the ink was wet on the JCPOA deal in 2015, the supreme leader ordered the Houthis to topple the regime in Yemen, a regime that was (INAUDIBLE) United States. So, yes, it's about time we identify who is really behind this aggressive and malign behavior --BARTIROMO: Yes.KEANE: -- and who runs this repressive regime and we've called them out.BARTIROMO: So, I want to get to China in a minute, but real quick on these sanctions, what specifically do they do, I know that there are still waivers out there enabling certain European countries to still trade with Iran in terms of getting their oil and gas.KEANE: Well, the overall sanctions have really taken this toll and the administration is tightening the news as you know, announcing sanctions is one thing and forcing them, is quite another, and that's what's happening here, and that's why the economy is being crippled.The specific sanctions dealing with the supreme leader will largely -- I don't believe have major impact on Iranian economy, but he does own a number of companies out there that will tie him up, who are on the international market. And he uses the $100 billion plus, as a slush fund, to fund the IRGC and the Kurds force activities in Syria --BARTIROMO: I see.KEANE: -- Yemen, et cetera. So, it'll have that kind of operational impact.BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, all of this, as a new threat from China comes our way, hackers believed to be backed by the Chinese government infiltrating the cell networks of at least 10 global telecom carriers, according to a report cited by the Wall Street Journal this morning. The report says that hackers stole user's locations, along with call and text records.What should we look -- how should we be looking at this as the U.S. and China are going to be meeting, the President meets with President Xi, on Friday, at the G20 this week, this Friday, and then you've got this major attack from Chinese hackers on our global -- 10 global companies?KEANE: Yes, I mean, I believe there's a two-prong approach that's needed here. In concert with our allies, continuously expose China to the international community and what they are doing here with their offensive cyber operations, because it's not just the United States that's impacted, it's all of our allies and we've got to call them out.They are paranoid about adverse publicity. And the reason you can tell that is how quickly they react to it. The second thing is, the Trump administration is moving in the right direction to use our very sophisticated number one in the world, best in class, offensive cyber capability ourselves.We have reportedly just used it on the Iranians. We have got to fire back at these organizations that are doing this to us. And this administration is loosening up the regulations and issued executive orders to permit cyber command which owns the offensive capability to respond in kind.So, those are the two things I think we really truly need to do and take a multilateral approach to the problem with China.BARTIROMO: So you don't think that this is directed by the Chinese government to infiltrate the U.S.' telecom systems?KEANE: I think it absolutely is directed by the U.S. government -- I mean, by the Chinese government.BARTIROMO: The Chinese government.KEANE: Yes, absolutely. Everything that is done offensive cyber in China is largely done by the PLA, the People's Liberation Army. They have tens of thousands of people that are every single day, doing offensive cyber hacking around the world.BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. So, I mean, it's not a subject that the President would bring up with President Xi, though, in the middle of trade talks?KEANE: I think the more pressure on President Xi, the better, in my view, absolutely bring it up.BARTIROMO: OK. Well, this is going to be some meeting this week. General, it's good to see you, thanks so much.KEANE: Yes, good talking to you, Maria.BARTIROMO: General Jack Keane joining us there on a whole host of threats across the world. FedEx, meanwhile, is taking on the federal government, Deirdre Bolton this morning on that. Good morning, Deirdre.DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Good morning. This is really compelling. FedEx is suing the commerce department, so it's over restrictions on Huawei. Delivery giant is saying it's caught in the U.S.- China feud and cannot police shipments. Last month, FedEx misrouted some of Huawei's packages including two that went to its global hub in Memphis, Tennessee instead of China. Separately, China called on FedEx to explain why a parcel from Huawei to the U.S. went undelivered, so that's another spat between the two companies.CEO Fred Smith says sanctions are creating an impossible burden, his terms, for delivery firms. On the plus side, though, he's optimistic about the chances of the U.S. and China finding a trading framework.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We believe that the international situation will resolve itself, hopefully, maybe as early as this weekend, with President Trump, all 440 or 50,000 FedExers are one way or another, involved in international trade, so it's in everybody's best interest, hopefully, to resolve these issues and give back to open markets.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLTON: FedEx reports earnings after the close this evening. Maria?BARTIROMO: Wow, FedEx really being vocal there, in terms of this fight. Deirdre, thank you, we will see you in a little bit. Meanwhile, President Trump is calling for transparency in health care pricing, Cheryl Casone on that story and headlines this morning. Good morning to you, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, good morning, Maria, big news yesterday, the President signed an Executive Order that calls for up front disclosure by hospitals of actual prices for tests and procedures.The initiative calls for federal agencies to draw up rules to make public, details about the prices that hospitals and insurance companies actually negotiate between each other, patients are also to be told ahead of time what their out-of-pocket costs like, deductibles and co-pays will be, yesterday's event at the White House, all about transparency, Maria.Nissan shareholders, forcing the automaker to make some big changes to its board, new committees will be created for nominations and compensation. Nissan CEO was re-elected but not before shareholders criticized him for faltering sales and profits in the United States and in Europe. Nissan's poor performance follows last year's arrest of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn.Well, SpaceX launched its latest rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Houston this morning. The Falcon Heavy rocket carried 24 satellites for customers, including the Department of Defense, with SpaceX CEO, Elon Musk, calling it the most difficult launch, ever, but it worked, so I don't know what was so difficult about it, but that's what he said, Maria, that's all I got.BARTIROMO: All right.CASONE: If he calls me and lets me know any more details, I will happily bring them to you.BARTIROMO: Got it. Thank you.CASONE: You bet.BARTIROMO: All right. Quick break, and then the border battle, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is scrambling to secure a funding bill today, as she faces the revolt from within her own party. Then, begging for more taxes, more than a dozen of the wealthiest Americans have a plea for the 2020 candidates, tax us more, please, we'll tell you who signed that letter, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: We've got a big show this morning. Coming up, Commercial Metals Company Chairman and CEO, Barbara Smith is here, we want to talk tariffs with her.Former RNC Chair and former Mississippi Governor, Haley Barbour joining us this morning, along with former State Department Senior Adviser for President Trump and George W. Bush, Christine Whitman is with us this morning, and California Congressman, Member of the House Armed Services Oversight and Budget Committees, Ro Khanna joining us this morning as well. Big program, don't miss a moment of it.America's mega rich, meanwhile, sending a message to 2020 hopefuls, saying this, tax us more. A group led by billionaire George Soros, sent a letter yesterday, calling for a moderate wealth tax.In part, it reads this, we are writing to call on all candidates for president whether they are Republicans or Democrats, to support our moderate wealth tax, on the fortunes of the richest one-tenth of the richest, one percent of Americans, on us.The letter refers to wealth tax proposals by Democratic candidates, Elizabeth Warren, Beto O'Rourke and Pete Buttigieg, joining the conversation this morning, FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton is here this morning, along with Benchmark Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly, and RealClearPolitics Co-Founder and President, Tom Bevan, great to see everybody this morning.TOM BEVAN, CO-FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, REALCLEARPOLITICS: Good morning.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. So, we got the two -- the first of the Democratic debates coming up tomorrow and Thursday, this is obviously going to be hot-seat topic in terms of this letter from George Soros and his --KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK: Eighteen of his or seventeen of his closest allies --BARTIROMO: What do you think?KELLY: -- including an anonymous person --BARTIROMO: Yes.KELLY: -- who wouldn't even sign their name. Listen, I think this is more talking the talk than walking the walk. There's nothing precluding these billionaires from giving more money to the treasury. This s just virtual signaling at its finest, and so, I don't think it's going to go anywhere. They could've led by example, but they didn't.BOLTON: Yes, we saw Abigail Disney's name up there, right, and when you look at just Bob Iger's tenure as CEO, I mean, he has created so much value for Disney shareholders, for Disney employees, by the way, who are, in part, paid by stock offerings, so I'll see how this falls.But with the progressive, very progressive left, having a bigger and bigger voice, this may become a really hot topic.BARTIROMO: Look, this is a really important point that you make in terms of Abigail Disney and Iger, and the wealth that he's created. I mean, to me, this sounds like confiscation. You know, you work your whole life to create wealth, to make money, and then, you get to a point where you get into this one percent list, and you're asking for a wealth tax just on the wealth that you created. That's confiscation.BOLTON: He's done his job, right? He's done his job, he's created value for shareholders, he's built the company up, the stock is at an all-time high and trading at all-time high, so normally, you don't punish somebody for doing his or her job.KELLY: That will never happen to these people on the list, right? I mean, listen, they're protected, they're never going to pay it, if they wanted to pay it, they could literally give money to Treasury Department right now. And if you actually think about it, this is just cocktail party talk for them.It was published in the New York Times. They get to go to all their friends and say, oh, my gosh, this wealth inequality gap is happening. If they really wanted the middle class to succeed, they would advocate for a flat tax.The tax code is 74,000 pages of complicated tax code that protects these people's interest, make it flat, everyone pay 15 percent, 20 percent across the board, then, then the middle class will succeed.BARTIROMO: And in one of those people in the list, Chris Hughes, co- founder of Facebook, is also among those who has been calling for a break- up of Facebook.BEVAN: Well, look, this coincides with the Democrat who are going to stand on stage tomorrow night and the night after, and all of them are proposing these massive programs including Bernie Sanders, now wants to cancel student debt to the tune of $2 trillion.Elizabeth Warren has trillions and trillions of dollars-worth of plans and proposals, all of which call for extra taxes on the wealthy, so there's a nice little synergy there for the Democrats to take advantage.BARTIROMO: That's true. I'm going to be watching really closely to see how much they take -- attack at each other. I mean, they all have this one thing in common. They want to take down Donald Trump, but they also want to take down each other, so we'll watch that Wednesday and Thursday night.Let me ask you about the SALT cap repeal, new data shows that repealing the contested $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions would be a $40- billion boost for the wealthiest Americans. Of course, this SALT deduction law says, created a lot of debate because it's actually meant higher taxes for those people in high tax states like New York by losing that deduction.BOLTON: Listen, I know people who run their own businesses, whose kids are young enough for their families, circumstances permitted, who have actually left New York and they go set up shop in Florida, and they come back to town when they need to do business, so it has actually affected some people's decisions.BARTIROMO: For sure, for sure.KELLY: Yes, you can see it happen. And I think this is actually a great example of, sort of, what the Democrats are talking about the wealth inequality, because actually, the millionaires, how do they get wealthy? They own assets. Real estate is a big important asset class.And so, this is one of those asset classes that actually these progressives can go after, but if you look at the leadership in the progressive movement, they're actually seeking a repeal of this. So, they want to give all these entitlements out, yet they don't hold their millionaire friends accountable.BEVAN: I'm from Illinois, which is a blue state, and we are seeing massive exodus to not only just across the border to Indiana, but obviously to the south.BARTIROMO: It's underlying Deirdre's point as well. We'll take a break. When we come back, the President said, Jay Powell doesn't know what he's doing. We are watching the Fed chairman this morning. Jay Powell will be speaking about foreign relations this afternoon amid tensions with Iran and China, what the President said about his job status, coming up.And then, American pride on display, see where your state lands on the new list of the most patriotic places, that story, coming up. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Markets this morning are lower, take a look at Futures, indicating a decline at the start of trading, Dow Futures down 30 points, S&P Futures down 4 and 3 quarters, and the NASDAQ Futures down 22 right now.We are watching some geo-political tensions including new sanctions on Iran this morning, and the much anticipated meeting between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, coming up this week, at the G20 meeting in Osaka, Japan which begins on Friday.Joining us right now is Potomac Wealth Advisors Founder and President Mark Avallone. And Mark, it's always good to see you, thanks so much for weighing in this morning.MARK AVALLONE, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, POTOMAC WEALTH ADVISORS: Good to be here.BARTIROMO: Is there anything that could come out of this meeting that you think will move markets, tell us how you're expecting things to play out on Friday at the G20?AVALLONE: Well, I think any good news, any movement on the trade front is going to be good for stocks, right now, that's the number one driver for equity markets and it's for equity markets around the world. This tariff talk and the trade struggles have really depressed economic activity here and abroad, and especially in emerging markets.So, if we see progress, even if it's not the real, deep, and full deal that the President and his team want, I think it's good for stocks. And I think investors should also take a measured look at this, we're not going to get a detailed (INAUDIBLE) agreement with the Chinese, now.It's going to be a long-term, perhaps a decade-long struggle, but any good news coming out of the meeting will help stock prices.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, the real question, guys and gal on the panel, is what happens with the remaining $325 billion in goods of China coming to the U.S., does the President put then the tariffs on that money or does the President kick it down the road? Maybe kicking the can down the road on that would be a positive for the markets, what do you think, Kevin?KELLY: Well, yes, I've always maintained we're not going to get a deal done with China until we absolutely have to and that's going to be coming into the next election cycle, right? The Chinese don't need to make a deal, this president doesn't need to make a deal because he'll be worried, you know, it'll be gone by the next election cycle, right?No one is talking about the government shutdown, right? No one is talking about, you know, North Korea anymore, I mean, it's still there, but it's not moving markets. And so, I think this $325 billion worth of tariffs is just dangling out there as a carrot, to use, but, you know, I don't think a deal is going to get done.BOLTON: Well, I think, yes. I thought it was just an extra threat so that the talks are more productive at G20.BARTIROMO: All right. So you're just thinking it's leverage?BOLTON: Yes.BEVAN: The question for Mark would be what happens if there is no deal done, and what happens if Trump actually goes through with that threat, because we are already seeing some potential slowdown.AVALLONE: Well, if we don't have it -- I think the Fed is the wild card here. And I think this is why the President talked tough about Jerome Powell earlier this week. Remember, as Kevin just said, the Chinese is an autocratic government.They have tools at their disposal, they're not a democracy, they can lower their currency, they could make tax reform, they could do whatever they want to do to stay strong and look President Trump in the eye and say, we're not going to give.The President doesn't have that leeway, which is why he wishes he had the Fed in his back pocket, and he wants the Fed to help him in this fight against the Chinese. If we don't get a deal with the Chinese, then the Fed will become President Trump's friend, because a deal -- if a deal doesn't happen, that's going to slow the economy, it's going to spur talk about the Fed lowering rates.If we get a deal with the Chinese, I think the Fed stays on the sideline, and that's why this is an interesting triangle that we have --BARTIROMO: Yes.AVALLONE: -- between the Fed, Chinese president, and Trump.BARTIROMO: Well, that conversation has happened. We're talking about lowered rates. Jay Powell is going to speaking later today at the Council on Foreign Relations. The President commented on Powell's job status in an interview with the Hill. Here's what the President said when asked if he could fire the Fed chair. If I wanted to, but I have no plans to do anything.So, look, the President has been, you know, has not made a secret of the way that he feels about Jay Powell, says that he doesn't know what he's doing, frankly. Kevin Kelly, your reaction?KELLY: Listen, my reaction is the President can't have it both ways. He talks about how strong the economy is, how well the stock market is doing, that we have the strongest economy on record, best numbers here, here and here.Then, why do you want to cut rates, Mr. President, if we are so strong and we are doing so well, and then you want to fire, you know, the Fed president, right? I mean, that makes zero sense.BARTIROMO: Just to be clear, he didn't really say he was going to fire him. He was asked a question. He says we'll see what happens. He says we'll see what happens.KELLY: Right, but the President was -- you know, pounding his fist.BARTIROMO: He doesn't like Jay Powell, there's no doubt about it.KELLY: Yes, but guess who nominated Jay Powell?BARTIROMO: Yes.BOLTON: You called him a stubborn child.BARTIROMO: Yes, but what happened at the end of last year when we were all talking about three-rate hikes, OK?KELLY: Yes.BARTIROMO: And the unwinding of the balance sheet and then six months later, we're having a completely different conversation. So, obviously, Jay Powell made a mistake at the end of last year.KELLY: or the President's administration's policies, especially with coming on with tariffs and all these other things, where he did steel and alum tariffs against our allies, and then when the Europeans came over here and they were trying to strike a deal on auto --BARTIROMO: So you blame Trump for that?KELLY: Listen.BARTIROMO: You blame Trump for the --KELLY: I don't completely blame him, but he's part of the problem too, right?BOLTON: Powell is reacting to real-time conditions.BARTIROMO: Yes.KELLY: It's not an all or nothing thing. Listen, there's fiscal policy and --BARTIROMO: No, I think you make a good point.KELLY: -- monetary policy (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: You can't say things are great and then say you want to --KELLY: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- cut rates. Mark Avallone, you've got the final word here, go ahead, sir.AVALLONE: I think the President, on this one, is a little smarter than people are giving him credit for, I think he wants to threaten or intimidate the Chinese to think that he's going to get lower rates, that he can withstand more the trade war.I think he's going in there, wanting a deal, and he wants to start from position of strength. And I think that's what this round, this recent (INAUDIBLE) against the Fed chair is all about.BARTIROMO: Well, that's interesting that it's a message to the Chinese. Mark, it's good to see you this morning, thank you.AVALLONE: Good to be here.BARTIROMO: Mark Avallone joining us there. Quick break, and then the battle at the border, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi facing backlash this morning, from within her own party, to pass a funding bill today, what's at stake as Mexico takes more action to take on the immigration crisis.And then Bitcoin, extending the rally this morning, the crypto currency getting a boost, with Facebook's new offering, coming under congressional scrutiny, we're going to get into crypto when we come back. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, June 25th.Your top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast, we have breaking news right now. AbbVie, reportedly nearing a deal to acquire Allergan for more than $60 billion. This according to the Wall Street Journal, this is breaking right now.Allergan shares are soaring on the news. It is up 27 percent. As you see, AbbVie is down six percent. We are watching the story right now because this is probably going to impact other pharmaceutical companies, as well. Kevin Kelly, your reaction to Allergan's move here, 27 percent. And would this be a deal that you think would go through?KELLY: Yes, I think this is going to go through because Allergan's actually been in the news world. They been looking to break up, they -- there share has -- their share has -- their share's prices completely slid over the past year and it's only got a recent bid due to that breakup.So, I think this actually pretty interesting because AbbVie, if you -- if you look at it, they actually have the world's bestselling drug, Humira, but it's ending its patent protection. So, this merge actually makes sense for both sides. So I think it does go through.BARTIROMO: That's when you see a lot of deals when the patent expirations are nearing.KELLY: Yes.BARTIROMO: The company that has the patent expiration needs more growth, they acquire the growth. And this is basically the Botox company.(CROSSTALK)BOLTON: Yes, I mean, Allergan is great, right? Like beauty, drugs, Botox indeed, and with baby boomers, well, looking and enjoy themselves, and look good and feel good. I mean, the market for these kinds of products is going in the billions.BARTIROMO: Yes, you're right. It's an incredible market for Botox. And Allergan for a while was a star performer.KELLY: Yes.BARTIROMO: But your point is right, the last year has been an underperformance.KELLY: Yes, it's completely underperformed. And it's important to note that this is actually a cash and stock deal. And so, it's going to be interesting to see when they come out with the deal who's actually going to lead this company because Brent Saunders has done a good job, but this past year hasn't done well for him as CEO of Allergan.BARTIROMO: Yes, I remember when he was on the cover, I think, it was Fortune Magazine, talking about Allergan and his success. Brent Saunders (INAUDIBLE), Allergan up 27 percent right now. AbbVie down almost six percent.The Wall Street Journal reporting AbbVie is nearing this deal to acquire Allergan for more than $60 billion cash and stock. We'll be watching this, this morning.Meanwhile, our other top story this half-an-hour is the battle at the border. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi scrambling to secure votes for a $4-1/2 billion funding bill, aimed at helping migrant families detained at the southern border. This move is dividing Democrats in Congress, with some arguing that the bill does not go far enough. Speaker Pelosi weighed in on the border crisis yesterday. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): When I saw that the president was going to have this rate, I mean, it's so appalling, it's outside the circle of civilized human behavior to just be kicking down doors splitting up families, and the rest of that in addition to the injustices that are happening at the border. We have legislation to go forward to address those needs. A violation of status is not a reason for deportation. That's just not so. What we need there is comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: President Trump threatened a veto on this bill if it makes it to his desk. Joining us right now is Republican strategist John Thomas. John, it's good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.JOHN THOMAS, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Great to be here.BARTIROMO: Nancy Pelosi coming out with all of these things as far as separating families. I mean, it's really a mischaracterization of what's going on at the border right now. How does she get away with that?THOMAS: Yes, it's -- well, look, she's blinking because Trump was ready to put send ICE into the port a bunch of illegals. And now he's giving her a moment to give him some money. First of all, let's pause for a second, and flashback to the last several months.Democrats were twisting themselves into not saying there wasn't a crisis at the border. But now Democrats are saying, wait, all of these families are in cages, we've got a crisis at the border. So, number one, they were lying there.Number two, even if they manage to give Trump more funding, this is treating the symptom, not the cause. Because they're going to give him more funding for detention facilities, not to deal with the actual illegals' crossing.So, look, I hope that we get more money for this. I don't know that Nancy will get it done before the Independence Day break, the recess. But yes, the hypocrisy that the Democrats are dealing with on this issue is so wide.KELLY: I thought you were going to flashback into a few years ago, not a few months ago because a lot of these policies have been under the Obama administration and Nancy Pelosi was in office.THOMAS: Correct.KELLY: So, you are right, this is completely --(CROSSTALK)THOMAS: Well, and that's when those detention facilities were created with under Obama.KELLY: Yes, that's where the photos came from of the children in the cells.THOMAS: That's right.BARTIROMO: No, I mean, but now, what you see at the border now because we took the show at the border month and a half ago, and the kids that I saw there, coming across the border themselves, they were all sick. They had cold, they had been on their feet hitchhiking, and walking for four months.We didn't know if the people that we were through actually their family. I mean, it is a crisis. And the fact that they can't get anything done to close these loopholes, it's just ridiculous. And then, she's got the nerve to say that the president's is separating families. How do you see it, Tom?BEVAN: Well, the question John is, is there a chance that you know, Trump says famously, "Hey, if we can just get together for 15 minutes, we could solve this problem," right? Nancy Pelosi continues to insist that they need comprehensive reform, but you've got Lindsey Graham in the Senate proposing just an asylum bill. Is there a chance there could be something strictly done on asylum that can win enough support in the House among Republicans and a few Democrats to get something to the President's desk?THOMAS: You know that's, that's a good question. It's unlikely to happen, and here is why. We're in a presidential cycle and the Democrats cannot give this president a win. Even if it only takes 15 minutes, I don't see that on horizon.BARTIROMO: We've got this conversation, well, obviously be one of the talking points at the Democratic debates. The Democratic debates tomorrow night and Thursday night, 20 Democratic contenders facing off. In two separate debates tomorrow and Thursday.The fields so crowded that the group of candidates were randomly divided into these two nights. Current frontrunner. Joe Biden will appear in Thursday's debate. He'll face candidates including Mayor Pete Buttigieg, senators Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders. What's your prediction? Let's go through Wednesday and Thursday, see how you to see by now.THOMAS: Well, the first debate, Elizabeth Warren is the big name in the field. So, the question is not only she needs a command that night, but can she set the stage for the following night? Can she kind of set that media narrative? I'll be watching for that.The other is on the big night with most of the big candidates. I'm watching most closely for Joe Biden because he has the most to lose. When you're the front-runner, any slip-up will cause the narrative the next day, and the following week to be wow, maybe Biden doesn't have what it takes. So --(CROSSTALK)BOLTON: A hit just so gap frown.THOMAS: Yes, and Biden has to just do no harm, which is going to be hard especially when all these candidates have a vested interest in ganging up on him. What I would suggest to the former vice president is to say deflect that the attacks -- it's going to be hard, though in addressing the charges. And lay out his broader promise which is number one, I'm the only one who could beat Trump, which I would contend is not true.But, number two, its Biden's argument is fundamentally, we need to get away from these, you know, carnival barkers like Trump and the extremists in our party, and its returned to a time of civility and steady leadership.If he can drive that narrative, he might have a good night. Here is the last thing I would say. A bunch of the lesser candidates are all need breakout moments to stay alive in this process. It's going to be very hard. Trump had the same challenge in '16. Remember when -- but everybody was appearing on the stage at the same time.The difference in '16 was Trump differed in both style and substance from the rest of the field. Both stylistically, we know Trump. But on substance, he was the only one arguing against TPP. He was the only one saying, "Build that wall." Democrats are almost all the same on the policy. The only way they differ is an identity.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Yes, well, right. Well, Trump really, you know, put his finger on what the American people wanted. I mean, they -- you know, he was talking about the economy, and jobs, and work.THOMAS: That's right. If you remember that first Republican debate the Fox held in Cleveland in August, he was the first question. Was a raise your hand question of whether you would support the GOP nominee? And he was the only one who raised his hand to say that he may not.And that's how that -- that's how the debates --BARTIROMO: He stood out.THOMAS: Yes, absolutely, from the very beginning, he was willing to take that risk that none of these other Democrats, it will be hard for them.BARTIROMO: None of them actually have supported him. So, it's funny, actually.THOMAS: Yes.BARTIROMO: John, it's great to have your insights.THOMAS: Thanks.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. John Thomas joining us there. Chicago police, meanwhile, are releasing hundreds of files from the Jussie Smollett investigation. Cheryl Casone, with more on that right now in headlines. Cheryl.CASONE: With video, Maria. And it's pretty compelling stuff. The files include body cam footage. But when the actor spoke to detectives, and it showed the news, attackers allegedly put around his neck.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you want to take it off or anything?JUSSIE SMOLLETT, AMERICAN ACTOR, EMPIRE, FOX: Yes, I do. I just wanted you to see it. There's bleach on me. They poured bleach on me. I don't want to be filmed.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Police also released video of the arrest of two brothers that were implicated in the attack at the time. Charges against Smollett were dismissed by prosecutors. But a special prosecutor has now been appointed to investigate the case from the start and Smollett could be charged all over again.Well, the Bitcoin rally continues. The digital currency rising nearly four percent this morning. Taking a look at the contract up $371 and change $11,395. Veteran trader Peter Brandt has set a $100,000 target on Bitcoin. Calling the market, "like no other."Meanwhile, Fox Business has learned that Stephen Moore has joined a group of entrepreneurs creating an entity called the central. The company says it's going to attempt to perform Fed like duties in terms of regulating the supply of cryptocurrency, in the same way, that the Fed controls the supply of money for the U.S. economy. Stephen Moore failed in his bid to join the Fed, we should add.And this, Maxine Waters, chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, says her panel is going to hold a hearing next month on Facebook's Libra project. Remember, that's the company's payments system that's based on a cryptocurrency.Well, with one week to go before the nation celebrates the fourth of July. WalletHub has a list of the most patriotic States. The rankings are based on voter turnout, military enlistment, and veterans per capita.OK, New Hampshire, yes, you are the most patriotic state. Congratulations, you are followed by Wyoming, Vermont, and Utah. Guys, the least patriotic, New Jersey, baby. What's going on in Jersey, Maria?BARTIROMO: What's happened on taxes?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, yes.BARTIROMO: You followed by New York, I think, right? Right, Cheryl, the New York is the second worst in terms of the most -- least patriotic.KELLY: I can see that. I just wanted to see, it's nonsensical to come up with a cryptocurrency to perform fed like functions because the whole point of having a cryptocurrency is to get away from federal -- from a Fed intervention or Central Bank intervention. So, to come up with one to do the same processes, it just -- it just falls flat on me.But I would just like to say Bitcoin rally, it has a lot to do with other countries' currencies deep -- going down. And the U.S. dollar going up. So they're actually trying to protect their own assets.BARTIROMO: But, I mean, come on, $100,000 price started?KELLY: Oh, I didn't say that would happen. That's I know.BARTIROMO: I know.KELLY: That's -- and John McVie says a $500,000 a million, I mean, you've got -- you've got evangelist out there.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, meanwhile, they're probably buying --BARTIROMO: City getting rich.KELLY: Yes.BARTIROMO: The -- we're getting more details on AbbVie-Allergan deal. It's going to be $63 billion, you said earlier is cash and stock.KELLY: Yes.BARTIROMO: Allergan shares are up 33 percent. The Wall Street Journal is reporting this, this morning as we told you a few minutes ago, that AbbVie is nearing a deal to acquire Allergan for a price tag of $63 billion in cash and stock. The press release is coming up -- coming out right now. So, it is official, the journals work being confirmed with a press release that AbbVie is going to acquire Allergan for $63billion.There's the performance on the stocks this morning. This is going to certainly move markets this morning.When you see a deal as big as this, Kevin, you would imagine other companies in this space also move on the idea that perhaps this will trigger other deals.KELLY: Yes, yes. I think -- I think you're going to see an active season, especially because a lot of these big companies are seeing patent protection expire and you're also going into an election year where they don't know uncertainty what -- what's going to happen. So, I think you'll start to see a lot of deals in the healthcare space in over the next year.BOLTON: Allergan still based in Dublin, right?KELLY: Yes.BOLTON: So, but now that our corporate taxes have come down, perhaps, they don't need to all of a sudden move the entire headquarters.KELLY: Yes.BARTIROMO: That's a really important point. All right, Deirdre. We'll take a short break. When we come back, some big changes are about marijuana in Illinois. Illinois become the 11th state to legalize recreational marijuana. Residents will have to wait to light up though. We've got more details when we come back. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Headlines across America this morning. The Oklahoman reports, Oklahoma opioid trial. Announcements of Teba settlement. A judge approving the revised $85 million settlement between the state of Oklahoma and Teva Pharmaceuticals. The money will be used to try to end the state's opioid pain killer epidemic. Teva has denied any wrong doing.The Chicago Tribune this morning writes, Governor Pritzker expected to sign a bill into law Tuesday that would legalize marijuana in Illinois beginning January 1. The bill allows licensed growth, sales, possession and consumption of cannabis for adults 21 years and over. The plant remains illegal under federal law. Illinois has already decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana.And the L.A. Times this morning reports that L.A. is suing the FAA as residents say they're fed up with noisy planes in neighborhood. L.A. is looking to invalidate routes that jets now use for access to Los Angeles International Airport. Residents say that the planes bear down on their homes causing a thunderous and constant commotion. Makes sense.A quick break, and then all-American auto is the list of the top brands that contribute to U.S. economy. That's next, stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. American made vehicles, Cars.com out with its 2019 American made index ranking the most American cars that contribute the most to the U.S. economy. This year, the Jeep Cherokee take the number one spot. Joining me right now is Cars.com Executive Editor Joe Wiesenfelder. And Joe, it is great to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.JOE WIESENFELDER, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, CARS.COM: Thanks for having us.BARTIROMO: So, it's an interesting list. Tell us how a vehicle contributes to the U.S. economy?WIESENFELDER: Well, we started this 14 years ago, because we realized that people consistently and this is one thing that hasn't changed, though, the industry has, is that consumers say they want their considerable investment in a new car to contribute to the economy -- the U.S. economy. Our survey that we run in connection with the index every year, this year said 66 percent said they want that to be part of it. And that's been consistent the whole time, and it's hard to do that just based on the brand.As you know, vehicles are built all over the world. You may buy, for example, a Buick built in China, or you could buy a Honda that's built here. So, we decided to break it down by model. So, what we do is we look at one of the requirements that it'd be built in the U.S. But beyond that, we also look at the parts content, we look at source of American and Canadian parts -- unfortunately, those are not separated.There is no accounting of just American parts, so we try to offset that with the country of origin for the transmission and the engine. And we also have a labor component based on factory workforce versus sales, so we essentially try to put it altogether and figure out which vehicles are the most American at least in that regard.KELLY: Well, is this why the Chevy Corvette is number five, as opposed to number one? Because that is the most American car, I think, you can get on this list?WIESENFELDER: It's funny you say that, because in our survey, we ask people -- you know, what do you think is the most American car? And it's what you would think -- it's iconic vehicles, it's the biggest --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mustang.WIESENFELDER: Yes, it's the names you would expect. It's the Fords, it's the big stuff. But really, if you look at some of those, some of the big Fords or even the big G.M. vehicles, maybe built in the country but they may have less in the way of American parts. That's the kind of data that we dig into and that actually consumers can look into it as well, which is why the American-made index is kind of a highlight of 15 vehicles but it also points out that if you're shopping for a new car, go to the window sticker and it'll show you final assembly location.BARTIROMO: Oh, it does right there in the sticker.WIESENFELDER: Right. Percentage of parts. Where the engine and transmission come from, so you can essentially tell how much, you know, this contribution will be based on that.BARTIROMO: Yes, Tom, I thought it was interesting that this report found 50 percent of consumers are actually concerned about tariffs on automotive parts.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Obviously, this has been part of the discussion with President Trump trying to bring auto manufacturing back to the United States. Are you seeing that reflected in your survey the course of 14 years?WIESENFELDER: We actually asked ourselves last year, would we see a difference this year? And we actually haven't. And one of the reasons is that trade policy hasn't actually changed yet. It's still NAFTA. We're wait for USMCA to be the Mexico-Canada agreement to be ratified and when that happens, we do suspect that we'll start to see some changes but bear in mind, we expect it will be small. I mean, some of the provisions are an increase in that percentage of parts, more high-wage labor, stuff like that. That might tweak some of the numbers but we don't suspect that all of a sudden new model are just going to be flooding into the U.S. It's not that simple; it's a much more complex puzzle than that globally.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll leave it there. Joe, great to have you. Thanks so much.WIESENFELDER: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We'll be right back.Load-Date: June 25, 2019End of Document

IDTechEx Research Releases New Market Report on Electric Vehicles in China 2019-2029; China is the world's largest EV market and an increasingly formidable exporter, innovator and acquirer. The new report "Electric Vehicles in China 2019-2029" from business intelligence firm IDTechEx Research covers markets, technology, export/import prospects and more.PR NewswireApril 10, 2019 Wednesday 3:30 PM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1677 wordsDateline: BOSTON, April 10, 2019 BodyPR NewswireThe important new IDTechEx Research report, "Electric Vehicles in China 2019-2029" finds that the market penetration in China of electric buses is more impressive than electric cars. However, it cautions that, even here, two or more diesel buses are still made for every electric one in China. There has never been support to electrify one million polluting old school buses but IDTechEx predicts when their up-front price in electric form meets conventional and sales take off. The statement that China has 400,000 large pure electric buses and that is 99 percent of the number in the world is true but not the whole story. Performance comparisons, battery specifications and suppliers - it is all summarized in information-packed pages.Understand why electric bus exports but not car or truck exports are impressive but e-trucks will become a huge business in China. Learn how Chinese companies, often with Chinese government backing are continuing to buy brands, routes to market and advanced technology. Some new Chinese technologies are impressive but it eagerly seeks others. Which? The new data IDTechEx has gathered, using its multi-lingual Ph.D. level analysts, make it optimistic about solar roads and drone, hub motor and supercapacitor vehicle leadership. Discover which type of EV will sell from China at three times the volume of electric bikes.China is catching up in robot shuttles and software-controlled fleets and updates. It needs to do better in power electronic, high energy density supercapacitors, structural electronics and other identified aspects. With EV batteries becoming smaller soon due faster charging and other innovations, some Chinese gigafactories may become stranded assets. When? Understand how Chinese EV components will succeed hugely abroad and damage the business of traditional western Tier One suppliers insufficiently investing in R&D."Electric Vehicles in China 2019-2029" embraces 51 companies. The 34-page "Executive Summary and Conclusions" reveals new infograms, tables, graphs and detailed forecasts. They give rapid insight into good and bad EV sectors in China, largest manufacturers, export and import gaps in the market, technology trends and tools for prediction. The emphasis is on distilled information with many conclusions and predictions.The Introduction to the report then examines pollution, congestion, vehicle specifications and evolving capability in China and why certain vehicles are favored by the government. Regulatory, reuse, recycling and traceability in China are covered.Chapter 3 concerns small EVs in China - 2 and 3 wheel and car-like vehicles. It focuses on market slowdowns, restrictions and growth opportunities. Chapter 5 summarizes the electric car situation in China, with examples of sales and technology leadership by different companies.Chapter 4 is more detailed on the large activity in buses and, in the future, trucks and their batteries, which presently have the largest cost. Learn of the fuel cell vehicle strategy and initiatives and supercapacitor buses and trucks eliminating traction batteries. See negligence and innovation with buses and trucks. Chapter 6 profiles leaders BYD and Yutong in a critical but balanced manner. IDTechEx describes them as successful opposites both having big challenges and opportunities ahead.To find out more about this report contactresearch@IDTechEx.com or visithttp://www.IDTechEx.com/evchina.IDTechEx guides your strategic business decisions through its Research, Consultancy and Events services, helping you profit from emerging technologies.

The Global Data War Heats UpAtlantic OnlineJune 26, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1498 wordsByline: Samm Sacks and Justin ShermanBodyWorld leaders who gather in Osaka, Japan, for the G20 summit this week will begin a conversation on worldwide data governance-and though they are deeply divided on the question of who should control data, some nations could seek to devise a system that excludes China.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who is hosting this year's summit, says he sees data governance as a priority. Indeed, the fact that the internet has remained relatively global and open has enabled the growth of the digital economy. App stores on our phones, email accessible around the world, overnight shipping on our favorite goods, the sharing of news and medical research and stock information-they're all part of this global connectivity. Underneath it lie data, 1s and 0s that form everything from bank ledgers to social-media posts. Exchanges of data between organizations (companies, universities, governments, etc.) across borders are what contribute to companies offering services around the world in near real time, or to allied countries sharing law enforcement and intelligence information.At issue is how countries view data. Do companies own the information? Does an individual own it? Does a government have access to it? The problem is that governments across China, India, the European Union, Japan, and the United States have philosophical differences on how they view these issues. These are not merely technical problems, but deep divides that may not be possible to bridge. Add to this the fact that this conversation is taking place as the United States and China are locked in a rivalry focused on technology-and, by extension, data. Taken together, this means that the rules for who controls data-and therefore harnesses their value-are part of a bigger geopolitical competition that will shape the 21st century.Read: [Beijing wants to rewrite the rules of the internet]The Internet of Things and            5G communications will create an exponential increase in data, but from a geopolitical perspective, the greatest strategic impact arguably lies with machine-learning and artificial-intelligence (AI) systems. That's because researchers need data to train AI systems, and AI development has the capacity to improve everything from transportation safety to disease diagnostics to lethal-weapon accuracy.It's not just the volume of data that's important. In part, it's also the kind of data and where they originate; data on, say, Spanish speech patterns will not make a system robust at identifying Mandarin characters. This is where data governance comes into play.In a world increasingly underpinned and powered by AI, those looking to develop globally competitive AI systems-algorithms that will be precise and accurate in many parts of the world, across many demographics-will need access to data on those different demographics, from those different regions. The rules that governments put into place regarding such access will therefore influence AI competition, because not getting these data could limit how well tailored products are to different people. These rules will also determine the access that states have to data when it comes to law enforcement and domestic surveillance, making data an increasingly important element of national security as well as economic growth.It is no surprise, then, that governments are clashing over setting the rules for who has access to certain kinds of data. Two countries-India and China-and their approach to data have particular significance, because together they account for more than one-third of humanity.Indian draft rules would            require companies that operate in the country or collect data on Indian citizens to process certain kinds of personal data on servers in India-even if the companies aren't based in the country. Defenders of this approach see it as a pushback against so-called            data colonialism. Critics, however, are            concerned that this approach would give the Indian government unchecked power to surveil its own citizens. Last week at the U.S.-India Business Council, ahead of his trip to New Delhi, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo            said the U.S. would "push for the free flow of data across borders."The Chinese government also wants certain kinds of data to be            stored on local servers. U.S., European, and Japanese policy makers and industry groups have lobbied Beijing for years to change these provisions, because they could mean steep costs for foreign companies that would be required to build local data centers to store and analyze all company data. Chinese President Xi Jinping has            spoken           extensively about the importance of sovereignty in cyberspace, and data are clearly a related component of that vision.Chinese law explicitly states that the government has a right to demand that companies turn over data for unspecified            national-security reasons. As a result, EU officials            have indicated that China may never be eligible for a legal arrangement under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) called an "adequacy agreement," which would allow for data exchange with the EU. (The GDPR, which went into effect last year, set up strict privacy rules for those handling EU citizens' data.) Chinese companies may find that it's impossible to comply with GDPR and China's cybersecurity law at once. The irony is that those who drafted China's data-privacy rules            looked to GDPR as a model. But the version of GDPR they created for China's political system-where the government has expansive surveillance authorities-makes it hard to imagine how the two systems could ever be reconciled.Read: [           Online-privacy laws come with a downside]The Indian government has concerns about Chinese firms misusing Indian data, despite some similarities in how both countries store data locally. For example, Indian military personnel aren't allowed to install WeChat, the Chinese social-messaging app, on their phones, but can use Facebook's WhatsApp. The historically tense relations between the two countries are likely driving India's caution.Trying to find consensus on global data governance may look like an elaborate game of Twister. And some of these divides at hand may simply be insurmountable-perhaps splintering the data economy as we know it.Against this backdrop, Abe's government has floated "           data free flow with trust." We may learn more from Abe at the G20 meeting, but one interpretation is that if the United States, Japan, and the EU perceive that Chinese access to their citizens' data presents some degree of risk, they could build agreements to share data only with one another (or even a subset of that group), but restrict access for Chinese firms. This could make it much more difficult for Chinese internet platforms to develop AI platforms for places and demographics outside Chinese borders by cutting off access to necessary data. But such an arrangement would likely meet resistance in the U.S. if it looks too similar to GDPR in restricting U.S. companies.The United States, for its part, is already pushing for new restrictions that would prevent Chinese companies and the government from getting access to sensitive data on U.S. citizens. For example, in March, the U.S. government            told a Chinese gaming company called Beijing Kunlun Tech that it would need to sell Grindr, the U.S. gay dating app, because of the potential for blackmail if the app's data fell into the hands of Chinese intelligence.Read: [           How bad is Facebook's new China problem?]Privacy legislation being debated in the United States also plays a role in brewing geopolitical competition. India, Europe, and other places will increasingly use data to constrain market access for foreign-incorporated tech firms-for instance, requiring them to store citizens' data within the country, or to not collect it at all-if the U.S. does nothing to dispel the notion that Big Tech cannot be trusted to handle individuals' data in ways that are not exploitative. That means the United States will need to place privacy checks on companies such as Google and Facebook if these companies are to continue to have global reach and access to data. Creating policy that understands there is not necessarily a            trade-off between privacy and innovation will go a long way toward restoring trust in U.S. Big Tech at home and around the world while also helping fuel advances in AI. Rather than a            race to the bottom when it comes to privacy, this may be the better way to            compete against Chinese internet companies for AI leadership.The stakes are therefore quite high in the competition to set the rules for global data governance. Abe's ambition to find consensus on these issues may seem ludicrous, but starting a conversation that gets at the conflicting perspectives on data at the center of geopolitics could be among his most important legacies.Load-Date: June 27, 2019End of Document

United Chinese Americans (UCA) Raises Concerns For Chinese American Scientists as Collateral Damage in the Crossfire Between the United States and China Due to Deteriorating RelationsPR NewswireApril 25, 2019 Thursday 5:29 PM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1074 wordsDateline: WASHINGTON, April 25, 2019 BodyPR Newswire The United Chinese Americans (UCA), http://www.ucausa.org, expresses grave concern for Chinese American scientists, who have been made to feel increased scrutiny and increasing suspicion of their loyalties based on their ethnic background. Last week's news reports on what is likely the first wave of a crack down  targeting primarily Chinese American scientists at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston are unsettling, because of the manner in which the investigations were carried out, and the fear they have generated. No scientist has been charged with a federal crime. Yet, reportedly, at least 10 scientists have retired, resigned, been fired or placed on administrative leave, with more parties affected. Fifty-five other NIH-funded institutions are currently carrying out similar investigations in response to U.S. government concerns. UCA is closely monitoring these developments.More broadly, the sharp deterioration in U.S.-China relations of recent years has endangered academic freedom in American universities and research institutions as well as scientific exchanges between the two countries. At the same time, tighter scrutiny and growing distrust of Chinese Americans have had a profoundly adverse effect on this community, who historically has suffered profoundly from the notorious Chinese Exclusion Act and Red Scare. Once again, Chinese American scientists are caught in the crossfire between the two global powers, becoming collateral damage as a result of the charged atmosphere. Chinese American scientists, who have made tremendous contribution to America's scientific progress and technical prowess, are increasingly being questioned, investigated, suspended and even prosecuted. To avoid suspicion or to be able to continue their work, some scholars with Chinese background or ties have been forced to change the direction of their research or the nature of their grant application, or to reduce or end reciprocal scientific collaboration with China. But the vast majority of Chinese American scientists are law-abiding. Some who have been prosecuted with espionage related charges have turned out to be totally innocent. But to this day, their reputations, careers and lives remain in tatters. In many other cases, people have had multiple felony charges leveled against them but at the end, have been convicted of much lesser offenses, e.g., mishandling of data. Ever since 1996, altogether fewer than 200 defendants-about 31% or 58 of them ethnic Chinese or Chinese Americans - have been charged, not convicted, for trade secret theft, under the Economic Espionage Act. Of those, most were motivated by personal financial gains, not economic espionage carried out in collaboration with a foreign power or with the intent to benefit a foreign government. Let's be clear: American interests and national security, unquestionably, must be protected. Where a few wrongdoers have acted with intentional malice toward our nation, UCA condemns such behavior in the strongest terms and supports vigorous prosecution of them according to the law.  To address the current situation, UCA makes the following five appeals: We call on the U.S. higher education and scientific communities to continue to uphold and strengthen scientific collaborations around the world so they may continue to benefit all mankind. We salute the University of California at Berkeley, Stanford University, the University of Michigan and the University of California at Davis for their efforts to uphold these principles and ideals as well as for their civil rights concerns for their faculty members and students, and call on more institutions to follow their example. We call on Chinese American scientists to continue to carry on the indispensable role they have played in maintaining America's lead position in scientific research and global competitiveness. To this end, we fully endorse the strengthening of compliance efforts and ethical standards guiding scientific research and collaboration. We call on Chinese American scientists-indeed all scientists-to adhere strictly to all applicable laws, regulations and practices, and to cooperate in reporting any breaches to appropriate authorities. We call on Chinese American scientists - indeed, all Chinese Americans - to continue to strengthen U.S.-China people-to-people relations through scientific exchanges and educational efforts rather than retreating. An adversarial U.S.-China relationship is harmful to Chinese Americans, to the United States and China, and to the future of the world. Chinese Americans have a unique role to play as communicators, bridge builders and messengers of peace between the two peoples. We call on the Chinese government to earnestly protect U.S. intellectual property rights, as American scientists participate in its talent programs and other exchanges, and vigorously strengthen the standardization and transparency of those programs. The Chinese government should also improve its supervision and management of such programs, including sub-national ones, toughen two-way compliance requirements and enhance training to reduce or eliminate doubts and concerns other countries may have about such programs. Finally, we call on U.S. law enforcement agencies to strengthen internal training and safeguards to reduce implicit bias and discrimination, to enhance communication with Chinese American communities and to ensure that the freedom and civil rights of all Chinese Americans are rigorously protected.The United Chinese Americans (UCA) stands at the forefront of safeguarding the rights and interests of Chinese Americans. We will continue to conduct legal awareness education in the Chinese American community, to promote dialogue and communication between the Chinese American community and the FBI, the Justice Department and other government agencies so that Chinese American scientists may lead normal, peaceful and productive lives.UCA is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization whose members across the nation comprise Chinese American immigrants dedicated to contributing to and participating in the full civic life of American society. View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/united-chinese-americans-uca-raises-concerns-for-chinese-american-scientists-as-collateral-damage-in-the-crossfire-between-the-united-states-and-china-due-to-deteriorating-relations-300838772.htmlSOURCE United Chinese Americans (UCA)CONTACT: Haipei Shue, 202-642-5060, haipeishue@gmail.comLoad-Date: April 26, 2019End of Document

Pompeo: Huawei an 'Instrument of the Chinese Government'Stillman Advance: Stillman CollegeMay 31, 2019 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MARKETS; Pg. 1Length: 481 wordsByline: Jean GarciaBodyOther trade experts also pointed out that the White House may have pushed a trade deal farther from reach due to its Huawei ban order.Meanwhile, adding that Huawei may have a turbulent period ahead, a senior research director at Gartner, Anshul Gupta said, "Unavailability of Google apps and services on Huawei smartphones, if implemented, will upset Huawei's global smartphone business which is nearly half of its worldwide phone business".Huawei would certainly prefer for all of this to end without going through months of legal battles with the US government, but given the situation it's now facing there's no other choice.Al Jazeera's Adrian Brown in Shenzhen says the company seems confident of the legal challenge it has filed.The Chinese tech giant, the world's top producer of telecoms equipment, said it planned to invest about $5 million in the lab in the Junggu district of Seoul."This decision threatens to harm our customers in over 170 countries, including more than three billion consumers who use Huawei products and services around the world".Dale Steyn Ruled Out Of Tournament-Opener Against EnglandBut it's now been confirmed that the 35-year-old has been ruled out of their match against England , on Thursday (May 30). However, the match against West Indies was called off due to rain where they managed to score 95 runs in just 12.4 overs.The tech giant filed suit against the US bill in March, calling it "unconstitutional" and saying the US Congress had failed to provide evidence to support its restrictions on Huawei products. "This will affect tens of thousands of American jobs".Huawei has called for a speedy end to the conflict between itself and the United States government. Huawei hopes a summary judgement will speed up the process of stopping "illegal action against the company".Escalating the bruising trade war with China, the US Department of Commerce recently blacklisted Huawei over security concerns and barred American companies from installing its telecom equipment."There is no gun, no smoke, only speculation", he said, accusing the USA of setting a "dangerous precedent". "The only speculation", Song argued.A hearing on the motion is set for 19 September 2019, approximately one month after the 90-day reprieve. Huawei relies heavily on US components, including computer chips, and about one-third of its suppliers are American. It complains that the USA ban "denies Huawei any procedure for providing rebuttal". "We are compelled to take this legal action as a proper and last resort", said Guo Ping, Huawei's rotating chairman. The media was also not invited to cover the event that was attended by Meng Shaoyun, a head of Huawei Korea, and other senior Huawei officials.Earlier this month, President Trump passed an executive order stopping US corporations from buying telecoms equipment from companies classed as national security risks.Load-Date: May 31, 2019End of Document

Analysts, industries have differing views on Trump's trade fight with ChinaThe Breeze: James Madison UniversityMay 29, 2019 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 786 wordsBodyAs the Trump administration overhauls U.S. trade policy with China, the Chinese government imposed a 25 percent tariff on some U.S. imports this month, and plans to extend it to an additional 5,000 products on June 1.Trump says he faults U.S. trade representatives and former presidents for a $500 billion trade deficit, arguing, "We've never had a situation, nor has there ever been a situation in history where a country has done that to another country."China has not only undercut American workers through its low-wage manufacturing companies, but its government also requires U.S. companies to surrender their proprietary technology in order to do business there, the administration argues, which has led to theft of trade secrets and cyber-theft."We also have the theft of intellectual property that is probably in the neighborhood of $200 [million] to $300 million every year," Trump said.Depending on the industry or analyst, the tariffs are either great or terrible for the economy, U.S. businesses and the consumer.In 2015, nearly one in three tons of steel sold in the U.S. was produced outside the country, with record amounts flooding into the U.S. eliminating American steel workers' jobs, the American Iron and Steel Institute argues.Today, "the Administration's trade actions and tax and regulatory reform policies, in addition to the strong economic climate enabled by those policies, have allowed the American steel industry to begin to recover after more than a decade of low capacity utilization and weaker earnings due to repeated surges in imports fueled by global steel overcapacity," AISI states. In early 2019, capacity utilization at existing mills increased to more than 80 percent, levels they hadn't seen in a decade.Additionally, previously closed plants have been or continue to be re-opened, laid-off workers are now working, and companies are making investments in new steel production facilities, AISI notes."But this recent progress will disappear, and our steel industry will again suffer dire circumstances, if the tariffs are prematurely terminated," AISI said in a statement.In April, 263,000 new jobs were added, including 24,000 new manufacturing jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The bureau predicts the industry will need to hire an additional 29,000 machinists alone by 2024.The bureau also reported a half-century low national unemployment rate of 3.6 percent."Comparing the last 21 months of the Obama administration with the first 21 months of Trump's, shows that under Trump's watch, more than 10 times the number of manufacturing jobs were added," Chuck DeVore, vice president of national initiatives at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, says."One can find winners in consumer goods industries that normally benefit from high employment and a pro-growth environment," Juscelino Colares, a business law professor at Case Western Reserve University, told U.S. News and World Report. Tariffs represent "a short-term, occasionally painful strategy, the timing could not be better because the U.S. economy is running hot and some lost demand in China can be made up here," he added.However, according to anew report by researchers at the National Bureau of Economic Research , the tariffs created an added tax burden on consumers and deadweight or efficiency loss."Studies, including our own, have found that the tariffs that the United States imposed in 2018 have had complete pass through into domestic prices of imports, which means that Chinese exporters did not reduce their prices," the authors write.For example, a U.S. purchaser of an imported Chinese product now has to pay the import tax on top of the base price. A product that costs $100 now costs $110.In 2018, Chinese tariffs imposed an annual cost of $419 for the typical household, the authors calculate. They project the new round of tariffs could increase that cost to $831.Deadweight or efficiency loss refers to companies choosing different suppliers to avoid paying the Chinese tariff. But they still pay a higher price to import from a different country.The president encouraged U.S. companies this month in a tweet to "Make your product at home in the USA and there is no Tariff. You can also buy from a non-Tariffed country instead of China. Many companies are leaving China."Many trade organizations, including the Association of Equipment Manufacturers and the Consumer Technology Association, have said theirs members are looking into what this would mean and cost in real terms.This article originally ran on thecentersquare.com.• Facebook• Twitter• SMS• Email• Print• SaveTags• China• Company• Import• Commerce• Economics• Product• Trump• U.s.• Tax• Tariff• Trump Administration• GovernmentLocations• Illinois• ChicagoLoad-Date: May 29, 2019End of Document

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, what a big Thursday we have, it is Thursday, June 27th.Breaking news this morning, in trade tensions, President Donald Trump has arrived in Japan for the G20. He arrived just moments ago. There's a shot of Air Force One. Chinese officials say that President Xi Jinping is about to present President Trump with "terms" for settling the trade fight, according to the Wall Street Journal this morning.The 2020 race is on, the first Democratic debate focused on the economy and President Trump.

While he is there, he could sign off on a trade deal with China. Take a look. There is the shot of the President just moments ago, departing from Air Force One. And we've got these new details from the Journal this morning about what China is planning to present to the President in terms of moving this trade deal one step forward.Blake Burman is live this morning, in Osaka. He joins me now with the very latest. Good morning to you, Blake, or good evening, actually.BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Good evening. It is good morning, good evening, everyone, I put it, Maria. It is 7:00 here, local time. You just saw President Trump departing Air Force One moments ago, in a rainy Osaka, Japan, as he is set to start the G20 summit and the meetings around it, 7:00 tonight, as we mentioned, so it will be a short day here for him.The President is set to meet with the leader of Australia first, and then the meetings really pick up tomorrow as the President, in bilateral meetings alone, will meet with leaders of Japan, India, Germany, Brazil, and then he will have his one-on-one as well, with Russia's Vladimir Putin.Then, on Saturday, he'll have breakfast with the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, meet with Turkey's Erdogan, and, of course, have that "extended" meeting with the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping.Just minutes before the President touched down here in Japan, the Wall Street Journal broke the news that according to the Journal, that China's Xi, is preparing to present the President, with "terms" as to how to dial back the temperatures in the trade war between the two nations.According to the Journal, those terms would include removing the ban, the Huawei ban that is currently in place, and also, Beijing wants all punitive tariffs to be lifted. Now, ahead of the meeting, the President still was talking up the idea of future tariffs when he spoke with you yesterday. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Look, we have lost billions and billions and trillions of dollars with China, right? We're now taking in billions and billions of dollars, and I've only done phase one. Phase one is 25 percent on $250 billion. I haven't done phase two yet.Now, phase two doesn't have to be 25 percent, it could be 10 percent, which people can absolutely handle. But our people aren't going to pay for that either.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: This will be the first meeting between President Trump and President Xi, since both met last year, at the G7, November, December, in Argentina. You remember, Maria, leading up to that sit-down dinner between the two.There was all of this discussion, all of these talks about tariffs and what would happen next. Those two met and then the tariffs were put on hold, coming into this. The President is, once again, talking about tariffs. But now we are learning that Xi Jinping is set to present the President with terms that might stop all of that, potentially.But you've got to wonder to the flipside of that, if this is what China wants and the U.S. agrees to it, what might the U.S. get out of the equation? Remember, we heard from the Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, leading into these talks that about 90 percent of the deal was done before China backed away as the U.S. sees it.So, that is, sort of, the stage that is set as the President is here, in Osaka, Japan, to begin the G20 summit. Maria?BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, we know how the President feels about tariffs. He's called himself a tariff man, yesterday, when I asked him about --BURMAN: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- what's Plan B, if you don't get a deal? He said (INAUDIBLE) Plan A, there's Plan B, and that is continuing the tariffs.BURMAN: Right.BARTIROMO: And he even threw out the fact yesterday, saying, you know what? It doesn't have to be 25 percent. It could be 10 percent on that $300 billion, so --BURMAN: Right.BARTIROMO: With the Chinese saying, look, we want all the tariffs lifted, that's a big step. It probably will require China to do a lot, as well.BURMAN: That's like going home, Maria, and saying, you know, to my wife, I want the dishes done, I want the trash taken out and I want all of this. She might look back and me and say, well, what do I get out of it? Right?BARTIROMO: Yes.BURMAN: You know, they're going to bring their -- they're going to bring their terms, they're going to bring what they want. But the U.S. side --BARTIROMO: Yes.BURMAN: -- is going to have to get something in return, if the U.S. were to agree to that, and keep in mind, in the lead-up to all of this, senior administration officials were saying that if nothing happened at all, the President would still be, as they put it, comfortable.BARTIROMO: Yes.BURMAN: So President Trump walking into this comfortable with tariff, as China is clearly trying to dial it back a notch.BARTIROMO: Blake, thank you. We'll be watching, big weekend for you, Blake Burman joining us in Osaka, Japan this morning. And joining me right now, Texas Congressman Michael Burgess, he's in Washington this morning, and Congressman, it's good to see you this morning, your reaction to what we're hearing here, that the Chinese want all the tariffs lifted?REP. MICHAEL BURGESS (R-TX): Well, the good news is that the talks are going on. I -- like you, concerned that the last time they thought they were -- the president thought he was closed to a closure (ph) on this, and the parameters all changed rather rapidly. I think, in fact, I was on your show the day after that happened, so that was startling.So, we know these things can take stops and starts. But the good news is that they are -- it looks like they're on again and they're talking, and that's a positive step.BARTIROMO: All right. So, we'll see what comes out of this. I assume you agree the president is likely not to agree to any deal or agree to lifting tariffs, if unless, the Chinese agree to stop stealing intellectual property from the west.BURGESS: I would think that would have to be the opening -- the opening start.BARTIROMO: Exactly, all right. Let me move on to the excitement of last night. Democratic presidential candidates took to the stage last night, trading barbs on healthcare, taxes and the economy. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. BETO O'ROURKE (D-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This economy has got to work for everyone. And right now, we know that it isn't. I would support a tax rate and a tax code that is fair to everyone. Tax capital --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Seventy percent?O'ROURKE: -- the same rate that you tax ordinary income. Take that corporate tax rate up to 28 percent.SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This economy is not working for average Americans.SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There are a lot of politicians who say, oh, it's just not possible, we just can't do it, have a lot of political reasons for this. What they're really telling you is they just won't fight for it. Well, healthcare is a basic human right.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Congressman, your reaction to what you heard last night?BURGESS: Did I just hear Beto O'Rourke advocate for the Steve Forbes flat tax?BARTIROMO: It sounded like it.BURGESS: So, it was -- you know, I -- of course, I work in the United States House of Representatives, the Democrats are the majority. I hear their arguments for things all day long. But even coming from that environment, I was startled last night by, really, how far-left the Democratic Party has moved and it was -- the president said it was boring.I would say, perhaps, it was a little concerning to me, just exactly how far left they have moved on some of these things. Look, I did think the whole process was unfair to Elizabeth Warren. She's the frontrunner on the stage and it was -- it was hard for her to get any words in.But the entirety of the night, it was just who can go further left of the person who just spoke. And it's an odd process. I know we went through a 16-candidate process --BARTIROMO: Yes.BURGESS: -- on the Republican side, four years ago, but there's just got to be a better way to do this.BARTIROMO: Do you think that's going to fly with the American people come 2020? These ideals of, really, socialism, when you look at Medicare for All or when you look at - well, Elizabeth Warren, wants a wealth tax, 70 percent rate.BURGESS: I don't, but I'll be honest with you, I did not think there was any way the Republicans could lose the majority of the House of Representatives with the economy doing as well as it was, in 2018 --BARTIROMO: Yes.BURGESS: And clearly, I was wrong on that.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a good point (ph).BURGESS: What I was seeing last night -- we get round two tonight, but it's -- I would use the word, concerning, how far left -- and everyone who spoke got a little farther to the left. I served with several of the -- of the folks who were on the stage. I know Jay Inslee and --BARTIROMO: Sure.BURGESS: -- he was not surprising. I didn't know the gentleman from Maryland that well. He actually had the only, sort of, reasonable comments during the night. But obviously, that was not the -- that was not the coin of the realm.BARTIROMO: We're looking at a number of movers this morning, Rite Aid, Boeing, we're going to get to that in a moment, but I got to get your take on the border crisis. Attorneys are filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging the children are being held in detention centers and they are being mistreated.This, as Bank of America says it will stop lending to companies that do business with the detention centers. Your Senate colleagues passed $4.6- billion aid package for migrants at the border, after failing to pass the House bill earlier in the week. Tell me your reaction to all of these and where you see this going.BURGESS: When they said detention centers, I don't know what they're talking about. Obviously, people who are picked up on the border are taking to a Customs and Border Protection facility. That is the law. That's what Congress requires them to do.Children are not supposed to stay there longer than 72 hours. The reason that some have, is because the receiving facility, the next facility that should be involved is Department of Health and Human Services, and because of the funding constraints, their beds are -- they have a -- they have a bed problem. They need -- they need space. They need capacity. And they can't take a child out of Customs and Border Protection and move them to HHS, unless there's a bed there.BARTIROMO: Yes, which is why I'm questioning this whole Wayfair thing, you know, the employees walking out of Wayfair, because they don't want Wayfair to provide the beds. I mean, who are you hurting?BURGESS: Well, there is a distinction. In Customs and Border Protection, we require them. They're there to protect the country. That's what we've asked them to do. Health and Human Services is there to provide care for the children until they get settled in whatever their next location is.BARTIROMO: Yes.BURGESS: That's also under law that Congress has provided. I think the funding part of this has really been mystifying because the president asked for this May 1st.BARTIROMO: Yes.BURGESS: So it's not a surprise.BARTIROMO: Right. They said they didn't want any more beds, by the way, the Dems, your colleagues on the left said, no more beds, you're at capacity, leave it there. And, of course, these centers are being overwhelmed. Congressman, it's good to see you, lot of insights from you, we appreciate it.BURGESS: All right. Thanks very much.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Congressman Burgess there. More trouble for Boeing, as I mentioned, another software issue has been discovered in the 737 Max jet, Cheryl Casone on headlines now, Cheryl?CASONE: Yes, Maria, here we go. The Federal Aviation Administration has found a flaw that could push the plane's nose down automatically. Fixing the problem will likely delay the 737's return to service through late summer, following two deadly crashes.Boeing says it agrees with the FAA, and it's working to address the problem. Again, this could be past Labor Day, folks, Boeing shares, lower in the premarket, down about four percent. That is a loss of almost 15 bucks. There is Boeing, folks (INAUDIBLE)All right, the FCC is investigating Sinclair Broadcast Group, the agency reportedly concerned it was misled during Sinclair's unsuccessful attempt to buy Tribune Media last year. This is according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. Nexstar Media is set to buy Tribune, in a deal valued at $4.1 billion. That is pending FCC approval right now.Well, Amazon is adding another option for customers to get packages from them. They're picking them up at Rite Aid stores. Yes, you can pick your stuff up at Rite Aid. Amazon's shoppers can pick up purchases at the specialized counters in more than 1,500 Rite Aid locations by the end of this year.And mid-July shaping up to be a wall shopping delight, Wal-Mart, the latest retailer to announce some special deals aimed at taking on Amazon's Prime Day, the sale from July 14th through the 17th, hopes to steal some Amazon's thunder Prime Day, starts on July 15th. A great idea is always one to be stolen, and it has been, Maria, back to you.BARTIROMO: There you go. Cheryl, thank you.CASONE: You bet.BARTIROMO: Join us in the 8:00 a.m. hour, I'll be speaking with the chief security officer of Huawei Technologies, he is here this morning, so don't miss this important interview, coming up, right in the middle of the meeting between the U.S. and China, on these new terms that Xi Jinping apparently is going to present to the President.Coming up, the tariff threat, big companies claiming that they'll be hit hardest during the holidays, the numbers coming up next, and then hidden talent, Attorney General William Barr busts out the bagpipes, his amazing performance, right after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Big show this morning, coming up, Huawei Technologies Chief Security Officer is with us this morning, Andy Purdy, my special guest, coming up.Former Presidential Envoy to Iraq and former National Commission on Terrorism, Chairman Paul Bremer, joining us this morning, along with the co-host of "THE FIVE" Juan Williams, weighing in also. Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big 2-1/2 hours coming up.And we're talking trade and tariffs right now, Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo, joining the list of companies opposing China tariffs.The three, saying in a statement, while we appreciate the administration's efforts to protect U.S. intellectual property and preserve U.S. high-tech leadership, the disproportionate harm caused by these tariffs to U.S. consumers and businesses will undermine, not advance, these goals.The companies say that the tariffs could cost American consumers $840 million this holiday season. President Trump is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday, during the G20 summit in Japan. And yesterday, I spoke with the President in an exclusive interview right here. Here's what he said about a potential trade deal and those tariffs.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Do you think that they can do anything, you could hear anything from this meeting on Saturday, with Xi Jinping that would push you to put that aside and not put that remaining $325 billion in products on tariff?TRUMP: No, it's possible. It's absolutely possible.BARTIROMO: What could he say?TRUMP: We have to get a good deal. Look, they have taken advantage of us, as a country, for so long, they're so far ahead. On average, this country is losing more than $500 billion a year with China. We've rebuilt China. They've done a great job. They're smart. They're genius. They're great.But you know what? They're so far ahead, what they've done to us. And primarily, I said they've done well with Europe, they've done well. But what the money they make with us, I mean, if I do what I'm doing, we totally cut that off. We totally cut it off. There's no more $500 billion. It will go down to a trickle.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining the conversation this morning, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Washington Examiner Commentary Writer and Editor, Siraj Hashmi, and FOX News Contributor, The Hill Columnist, Liz Peek, great to see everybody this morning.LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.SIRAJ HASHMI, COMMENTARY WRITER AND EDITOR, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Good morning.BARTIROMO: Good morning to you.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. You know, when I see those statements -- that statement from American companies, it makes me feel like it's more of the same over these last couple of decades, where American companies were so interested in selling to the 1.4 billion person population of China, they forgot to protect their own products.You know, the U.S. administration sees this as an a national security risk, I don't know that the CEOs are really understanding that.PEEK: Well, they also wanted to access cheap labor, I mean, let's face it. American corporations and, by the way, they were bashed last night, incessantly, during the Democratic debates, I don't want to pile on.But the truth is, they have enabled our situation now, where we are so dependent on China, I mean, why didn't any of these companies think to diversify their resources, their supply chains, when China came increasingly authoritarian and, you know, basically stealing their property, I mean, it's amazing the story, really.BARTIROMO: It really is.MCDOWELL: But, if it is a national security issue, the President needs to hit that harder than he has been --PEEK: Yes, I agree.MCDOWELL: -- rather than talking about we're losing money to China. The half a billion dollars he's talking about is a trade deficit.PEEK: Right, which a lot of people disagree.MCDOWELL: Right. From an accounting perspective, it's not a loss, number one, and ultimately, Americans will feel these tariffs. They might not feel a lot of them, but, again, it illustrates that we do bear the cost as a nation. China doesn't pay these tariffs, we do.BARTIROMO: Secretary Pompeo has been pretty significantly, you know, consistent on this national security risk. You're right. The President keeps bringing up the trade issue.MCDOWELL: But, it's the President who does -- who is anywhere, everyone and on Twitter, all day long, particularly on the weekend. He needs to do a better job of messaging that.HASHMI: One of the interesting things about this video game, particular issue, is that President Trump, actually, after the Parkland shooting, blamed the video games as the reason for all this violence, so if these tariffs, sort of, prevent American families from getting more video games, that actually will work in his favor.BARTIROMO: We've got an impact on markets right now with these headlines, China wants the U.S. to lift the ban on Huawei, and as a result we're seeing a real --BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We want to show you a developing situation this morning. Futures are down. There is news today from the Wall Street Journal, that China wants the Huawei ban lifted, as well as punitive tariffs off. The Dow Futures right now, down 86 points. S&P Futures are still up 3-1/2 and the NASDAQ Futures, up 15 points.But let's take a look at what the Journal is reporting, because I want to get your take on this. President Trump set with terms, the U.S. should meet before Beijing is ready to settle a market rattling trade confrontation, according to the Wall Street Journal.Chinese officials with knowledge of the plan are insisting that the U.S. remove its ban on the sale of U.S. technology to Chinese telecom giant, Huawei Technologies, Liz, your reaction?PEEK: Well, I think Xi is -- President Xi is coming into this meeting being very tough, so is President Trump. On your program yesterday, he declared that he is perfectly happy with tariffs and he might raise them more. So, I think both of them are coming together. I assume both want a trade deal.Look, President Xi is seeing his economy slip. He's got problems in Hong Kong. His authority is being tested, as not before, in his tenure as head of state. I just think this is a negotiating position. And it's not going to happen, by the way.BARTIROMO: I don't think it's going to happen either. Go ahead, Dagen.MCDOWELL: So, Beijing also wants the U.S. to lift all punitive tariffs, drop efforts to get China to buy even more U.S. exports than Beijing said it would, when the two leaders met last December. However, the Journal reports Xi Jinping is not expected to take a confrontational tone with President Trump. This is a back to square one.BARTIROMO: It really is.MCDOWELL: That's why that other network totally fouled up the Steven Mnuchin interview, with the 90 percent done on the trade deal. Wrong. This is -- this moment one. This is the starting point.BARTIROMO: That's exactly right. And the 90 percent was back in April. Yes, they were 90 percent there, maybe, back in April, before the Chinese reneged.MCDOWELL: This is a five percent.HASHMI: Since we're back to square one, maybe President Trump can go after China for the human rights abuses, specifically the Uyghur Muslims in the Xinjiang province and the 1 million plus of them who are in re-education camps.BARTIROMO: You make a great point. Yes, the Chinese have been rounding up Muslims and putting them in these camps.PEEK: Oh, it's horrifying.BARTIROMO: And then they're being guarded with guns.PEEK: That's not -- there's so many infringements of human rights going on in China --BARTIROMO: Exactly.PEEK: -- right now, it's staggering. But that, I don't think is Trump's number one concern.BARTIROMO: No.PEEK: I think Trump's number one concern is changing the way they do business, and you know what? This isn't a very good opener.BARTIROMO: But the markets' concerns have been China, tariffs and the Federal Reserve. I spoke with (INAUDIBLE) Hodges Capital Management, Craig Hodges. And here's what he said he's looking at in terms of driving markets right now.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: We've got $1-1/2 billion under management. You've got to put that money to work, in what has become a confusing market. Are you looking for growth in terms of the market right now, still?CRAIG HODGES, FOUNDER, HODGES CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Yes, growth is where it's at, of course, but what's surprising in the market today, you can find growth stories that trade at value prices. There's a lot of that. There's been -- it's kind of a have and have not market.And, you know, we're (INAUDIBLE) at Hodges Capital, we do about, you know, 2,600 company touches over about 800 different companies, and we're finding ideas that are, you know, like a -- like a -- let's say a Norwegian cruise line that should grow 12, 15 percent, that's trading around 10 times earnings.BARTIROMO: Wow, that's a good opportunity.HODGES: Yes. There are a lot of those. And, you know, my favorite idea out there right now is commercial metals which, you know, the steel business, which I know in your interview with President Trump, he talked about the steel, how much better it's doing.BARTIROMO: Yes.HODGES: There's a company that has a 50 percent share of the rebar market, of course, rebar goes into construction, roads, bridges and such, a little company with a $2 billion market cap that has a 50 percent share of that. And the chances are over the next year, we'll have an infrastructure bill through, and that's going to benefit, and that stock is trading around six times earnings.BARTIROMO: Wow, six times earnings.HODGES: Yes.BARTIROMO: That is low.HODGES: Just incredibly cheap. And so, there's parts of the market that are very forgotten, that are kind of left for dead, and that's where Hodges Capital, where we're focused.BARTIROMO: Which is a really big opportunity for stock picker and for someone who's actually looking for specific ideas. Let's talk, before we get to ideas, about the broader market --HODGES: Yes.BARTIROMO: Because the Federal Reserve, potentially, cutting interest rates has become a big theme. Is that what you're expecting?HODGES: Yes, you know, I don't know that I know how to handicap it. I mean, you can listen to people, and just about 50 percent say they're going to cut, 50 percent say they probably aren't, they're kind of (INAUDIBLE) when they're not. To us, it really doesn't matter.If the volatility, which I know we'll have volatility, if the volatility presents itself, we'll go in and buy companies -- good companies that go on sale. So, the positive is that rates are low, that's going to stimulate the economy and whether it's this month or here in six months, what they do, I don't know that it has a whole lot of effect.BARTIROMO: But the backdrop feels good to you, right?HODGES: It does.BARTIROMO: Because you're talking about unemployment at a 51-year low, 3.1 percent economic growth in the first quarter. We're about to start earnings season. What kind of an earnings period are you expecting for the second quarter?HODGES: I think it will be a little disappointing and that you're seeing most of -- most of the management teams we're talking to. They're using the tariff situation as a way to bring down expectations a little bit. I think they're do -- going to do some under-promising and over-delivering is what the hope is.So, maybe a little bit of an adjustment. But like you said, the economy is in -- is in a good strong place, full employment, low rates, and surprisingly, investor sentiment is not that great. You know, the markets close to highs but every time the market should get to highs, optimism should be out there, we don't have that.BARTIROMO: Yes.HODGES: So, I think that that's a positive.BARTIROMO: Market climbing a wall of worry again. Right?HODGES: Absolutely, absolutely.BARTIROMO: As this the old saying that we always used to say.HODGES: Yes.BARTIROMO: OK, then, there's China. So, the president's headed to Japan. He's got to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday. Anything coming out of that, that you think could be a market mover.HODGES: Yes, I think expectations are very low that something will happen. So, if surprisingly something happens, I think that will be extremely bullish for the market, of course, the market hates the uncertainty.So, if nothing's done, you'll probably get more volatility. You'll probably have some -- you know, some five percent corrections along the way.BARTIROMO: But that's not going to just wait you, you're still looking for those growers.HODGES: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: All right. So, you mentioned one, where else are the growth stories in the market today?HODGES: You know, a lot of the some retailers that have really been hit hard like a restoration hardware, it's another one that trades below its growth rate.BARTIROMO: I like that company.HODGES: Yes, and you know, it's come down from 150 into the 110 area. Had -- just had a great quarter. Capri is a stock that's come off about that's been cut in half this year.It's still growing around 15 percent trading around eight times earnings. So, there are parts of that you can find growth. And you're not having to pay crazy multiples.BARTIROMO: So, you want to buy into this whole notion that things are slowing now.HODGES: Yes, I think it's evident that it's slowing, but not dramatically. Things are still good. The thing that Trump has done, it's given company executives a lot more optimism, a lot more opportunities. You know, the eight years of Obama, we'd have companies come in and say, you know, this is an anti-business president.BARTIROMO: But?HODGES: It's the opposite with Trump. These executives feel like Trump is actually working for them. And I think he really is --(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: Yes -- he, that was Craig Hodges with Hodges Capital Management. The news of the morning, of course, is the news coming out of the Wall Street Journal about the terms that China is setting in terms of getting any agreements with the U.S. Markets are moving on that. We'll take a short break. When we come back, we're looking at big tech. President Trump hints that the U.S. could bring legal action against companies such as Facebook, Google, over online bias. That's next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, June 27th. Your top stories right now. 6:35 a.m. on the East Coast."BREAKING NEWS" this morning. President Trump arriving in Japan for the G20 summit. A short time ago, Chinese officials say President Xi Jinping will present President Trump with terms for settling the trade fight. This is according to The Wall Street Journal.We want to bring you the terms. The terms include lifting the ban on Huawei and lifting all punitive damages. Lifting all of the tariffs, and not forcing Beijing to buy a significant additional amount of goods from the U.S.In the 8:00 a.m. hour this morning, I'll be speaking with Huawei Technologies chief security officer Andy Purdy. We're going to talk about why this is one of the terms of the Chinese government that the ban is lifted on Huawei.Markets this morning, a mix. Take a look at the Dow Industrials lower this morning, 67 points, following the trade news this morning from The Wall Street Journal that President Trump is going to talk with Xi Jinping, and Xi Jinping is going to present these terms.Yesterday, the market ended mixed and really little change. Take a look, when all was set and down, the Dow Industrials were down 11 points, even though in the morning the market was trading on a false report about being 90 percent there. Most people recognize that, that was not true.The S&P was down 3-1/2 points yesterday. And the Nasdaq was up 25. The Dow and the S&P ended near session lows pairing gains in the last half hour of trading. European Indices this morning look like this. FT-100 down 33, CAC Quarante down, 19. The DAX Index lower by three points.And in Asia, overnight markets rallied on the US-China trade optimism. Hang Seng Index was up almost 1-1/2 percent.There is more trouble for Boeing this morning. A new software problem has been found in the 737 MAX. The stock taken a hit in the pre-market down five percent. That's an issue obviously for the Dow Jones Industrial Average as well. Boeing shares down better than five percent again this morning.Then, there is Bitcoin, sliding after a big rally recently. The cryptocurrency pulling back following the recent rapid rise. We're taking a look at what's causing this down 761 right now.Barr's bagpipes. Check this out. We've got the Attorney General's surprise performance rocking the house. All of that coming up this morning.But looking at big technology this morning. President Trump slammed Google and Facebook yesterday. In my exclusive interview, the U.S. could bring legal action over alleged bias, said the president.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Look, we should be suing Google and Facebook and all that, which perhaps we will, OK? But, you see or Apple, they're suing Apple for billions of dollars. They're suing everybody. They make it very almost impossible to do two-way business.BARTIROMO: Yes.TRUMP: So, what happened, I said folks, they are worse than China, except smaller. It's smaller than China, but they're worse than China.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg endorsed federal privacy legislation, meanwhile, and greater regulation of political advertising yesterday at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARK ZUCKERBERG, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, FACEBOOK: Look in the absence of regulation on some of these things, we're going to do the best that we can and build up very sophisticated systems to be able to handle these issues. But at the end of the day, I don't think that, that is necessarily the ideal state that we all want to be in. I think, we would be better off if we had a more robust democratic process setting the rules on how we wanted to arbitrate and draw some of the trade-offs between a lot of these values that we hold dear.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is the founder and chief analyst at disruptive tech research, Lou Basenese. Good to see you, Lou. Thanks so much for being here.LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER OF DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH: Good to be here, Maria.BARTIROMO: What do you think? Do you think the U.S. government is going to sue some of these companies?BASENESE: Look, I think its verbal intervention for now. I mean, President Trump is saying not that he's going to, but that we should. And I think he's keeping him -- keeping him accountable, keeping him guessing what he's going to do next. I mean, I think it's the adage I grew up it was, trust your mother, but cut the deck.So, he's trusting that they're going to be accountable, but threaten verbal (INAUDIBLE), threat actual suit. I mean, it's happening in Europe, I mean it wouldn't be unprecedented.BARTIROMO: Yes, I don't even think the president or this administration trusts, by the way. The social media companies. Dagen, you've reported a lot on the fact that they have all of this terrible content and they've been so slow to take the content down. But it's even more than that. They are censoring conservative conversation. We've seen evidence of that.MCDOWELL: When in doubt, blame the algorithm. That is the message out of -- out of social media companies and Silicon Valley. One thing that I keep pointing out as well is these social media companies have legal cover. They are not considered media companies in the eye of the law -- in the eyes of the law, and they cannot be sued for defamation.They have this goes back to a law that was passed in the 90s kind of that the -- at the real beginnings of the growth in the Internet. And I think that if somebody really wants to put the hammer down on these companies, that's something you take -- you take aim at. And you're going to hear a lot more of this from say, Elizabeth Warren as these debates pick up steam, as the Democrats really try to make a name for themselves. So, they're in agreement with Trump on this.HASHMI: Interesting you bring up Elizabeth Warren in March. She had a post that was taken down on the Facebook, calling for the breakup of Facebook. And also, Google who's you know, obviously, the subject of this conversation.In the past year, they have to pay a $1.7 billion fine to the European Union for antitrust violations. So, the Department of Justice looking into this. It's a -- it's a big deal.(CROSSTALK)BASENESE: Right, Facebook -- Yes, and Facebook is facing what? Maybe a $5 billion fine which would be record fine from the FTC. Look, self- regulation does not work with social media. I think you've said it like it's become the algorithm. And that we blame it on the algorithm. There's been no responsibility, you've seen Mark Zuckerberg come before Congress multiple times and he makes a half-hearted apology but makes more excuses.(CROSSTALK)PEEK: Right, yes, and he calls for regulation knowing that that's the best thing that could happen to Facebook. Because A, Congress has no idea how to cut -- how to regulate these companies.BASENESE: Right.PEEK: And the bigger you are, the more protected you are from any kind of regulation, which will completely clobber newcomers startups et cetera that might challenge you.BARTIROMO: And when I said to the president yesterday, I said, "Listen, Mr. President, would you rather see competition coming to this market, would that fix the problem? Or do you want to actually see legislation?"He said, "I think, we need legislation to see competition."BASENESE: Yes, I would agree. I mean, look at what Facebook's done. I mean, we know now know that they were using monitoring software to figure out to acquire WhatsApp early. They knew that it was going to be the next big social media network and they pounced on that. That they're using the network and the data that they have to their ultimate advantage. It's anticompetitive.MCDOWELL: But they -- but they again, for month after month, over a period of over a year, people were committing murders and committing suicide on their live video streaming service.BASENESE: Right.MCDOWELL: And that you had the massacre in New Zealand. That video was up for roughly an hour after the massacre started. So, again, they're concerned about making money growing their business, but they really don't give a flying you-know-what about people committing murder.BASENESE: I agree with --(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: There was a man who killed his child on Facebook and that was over a year ago.BASENESE: Well, here is my thing. They can figure out everything else. They can figure out all your preferences. But you're telling me that they can't spend billions of dollars to figure out how to keep that content offline. I'm sorry, I just don't buy that.MCDOWELL: I don't want too.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: So, what do you like -- what do you want to do with these stocks at this point. I mean, let's say is as an investor, you own these stocks.BASENESE: Yes.BARTIROMO: It will in -- incoming legislation, hurt the prices.BASENESE: Look, I would tell you history is instructive here. Facebook really hasn't gotten hurt as a stock because of the threat of regulation. Last July, it got hit the hardest because of a revenue warning. So, we've talked about this before, it's profits over principles in Facebook. And for most investors, they're turning a blind eye to this. I think they --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: But doesn't increase legislation or regulation, doesn't that mean that it's going to cost the more money? Doesn't that impact profits?BASENESE: Yes. But I mean, you think about Facebook makes 30 bucks per user in revenue. I mean, you said it, Liz, like they're fighting the fight of we're just going to drag this out. Regulation is going to take a long time, we'll just play -- we'll play good citizen and we'll see how long it takes.BARTIROMO: Yes, all right. We will leave it there. It's good to have you this morning, Lou.BASENESE: Thanks, Maria. I appreciate it.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Lou Basenese. Let me ask you, you know for a long time, Huawei has been saying, look, we're not attached to the Chinese government. Right? We're not being told to spy on anybody from the People's Liberation Army.And yet here you have Xi Jinping, saying he wants the ban on Huawei lifted as part of any agreement with the U.S.MCDOWELL: And there's a story. Just -- I don't know if this is exclusively Bloomberg, but Huawei personnel worked with China's military on research.BARTIROMO: Yes, but that's just came out this morning. I think that's going to be big news.MCDOWELL: That's right.HASHMI: The same deal with Alibaba. People didn't think they were -- people thought they're independent of the Chinese government. And later developed that they were actually (INAUDIBLE).PEEK: Look, there's a -- there was a 2017 law passed in China, saying every company had to be responsible to help intelligence gathering.HASHMI: Yes. OK, well.BARTIROMO: I mean it's no secret that Huawei has worked with the military. I mean, there is something called civil-military fusion. Where when you have an innovation in China, first, it goes to the military to see that it can be applied they're -- then, it can be use (INAUDIBLE).(CROSSTALK)HASHMI: Different. Different that -- it's different being in a remote studio where you're just like --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: There are a lot of microphones going on right now, guys.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: Somebody needs to turn the (INAUDIBLE).BARTIROMO: OK, we're going to take a short break, and take a look of the democratic debate when we come back.

OK, we're going to take a short break and take a look at the Democratic debate when we come back stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The Notre Dame fire investigation revealing that the inferno was probably sparked by an accident. Cheryl Casone with the headlines right now, Cheryl.CASONE: There had been suspicions about this, Maria. Prosecutors say that there is no evidence the fire was deliberately started. So, among the possible causes, a power failure or possibly a cigarette. The April 15th fire destroyed Notre Dame's (INAUDIBLE) and the wooden beams supporting the roof. French President Emmanuel Macron wants the cathedral restored by 2024, in time for the Paris Summer Olympics. There had been construction going on at the same time, we should add here.Pier One imports closing more stores this year than originally planned. The retailer is looking to close 57 locations, 12 more than it announced back in April. And the CEO says there could be more to come. The company posted its seventh straight sales decline last quarter. Same store sales falling 13 percent.And an impressive performance from Attorney General William Barr who surprised the U.S. Attorney's National Conference with his hidden talent. Turns out the nation's top law enforcement guy plays the bagpipes.CASONE: The crowd gave him, Maria, a standing ovation and we should add that he was playing with the pipes and drums bag pipers on the stage from the NYPD. So, it's a pretty cool moment.BARTIROMO: I love it. Thank you, Cheryl.CASONE: You bet.BARTIROMO: Coming up --MCDOWELL: Name that song!UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Careless whisper.MCDOWELL: No.BARTIROMO: All right. Well, we have the first night of the Democratic debate last night, did you watch it? A look at what's trending. Plus, the microphone glitch. Wait until you see what happened. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: The first 2020 Democratic presidential debate. Lauren Simonetti with what's trending this morning and the details on a microphone glitch last night. That was horrible.SIMONETTI: It was. It was embarrassing. It's always funny that what is exactly trending and what people talk about and this is an exchange that they certainly talked about. A hot mic issues. Let's watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RACHEL MADDOW, HOST, MSNBC: What's happening?CHUCK TODD, HOST, MSNBC: We are hearing our colleagues' audio. If the control room could turn off the mic. If the control room could turn off the mics of our previous moderators, we will --MADDOW: You know, we prepared for everything. We did not prepare for this.TODD: Guess what, guys, we are going to take a quick break.(END VIDEO CLIP)SIMONETTI: They tossed to commercial break. But unfortunately, Savannah Guthrie and Lester Holt's mics were open when they were done, and they coming up on Chuck Todd's question to Elizabeth Warren. Donald Trump having fun with this. One of two tweets sent last night: "NBC News and MSNBC should be ashamed of themselves for having such a horrible technical breakdown," he on, "truly unprofessional and only worthy of a fake news organization, which they are."Google trends show that most people searched for Tulsi Gabbard, the Iraq war veteran and the Hawaii congresswoman, across the nation, probably because nobody knows who she is nationwide and she also had the least amount of time to speak. Something her sister tweeted about saying: "Well, NBC must love Elizabeth Warren because she's having the most amount of time to speak." The number two candidate was Cory Booker. Interesting, look at the red part. We know him here as a New Jersey senator in the northeast but the southern part of the country not sure who Cory Booker is. And odd they that Elizabeth Warren was also searched. But it could be for a variety of reasons, why viewers are looking up these candidates.And finally, we had fun with it. Bars offering all sorts of promotions and drinking games, like every time you hear the word impeach, drink up; no border wall, drink up. They should include "free" on that list. The word "free," right?BARTIROMO: Well, Elizabeth Warren did get the bulk of time.SIMONETTI: Yes, she did get a lot of time. If you ask who the winner was last night, you know, ten down, ten to go, who won in the first round, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker I thought did really well and also Julian Castro -- he had a specific answer on immigration and his exchange with Beto O'Rourke who basically comes out very shallow, where are his policies?MCDOWELL: Beto is (INAUDIBLE).SIMONETTI: Beto is (INAUDIBLE).MCDOWELL: But he looked like he had eaten bad sushi for dinner. He wasn't sure what was about to happen.SIMONETTI: And what was that that came out with his opening line was in Spanish. I mean, you're trying to get the Spanish voters.BARTIROMO: The Spanish was just too much.MCDOWELL: A little bit pandering.PEEK: But that's kind of who he is, you know. The dental thing -- when he's videotaping himself -- it's about himself and showboating. I mean, and I think voters are done with that.SIMONETTI: All-in, they were boring as the president said: "We need a (INAUDIBLE) Ted, or like boring --"BARTIROMO: Gracias.SIMONETTI: De nada, Maria.BARTIROMO: Breaking news, new reports that China wants the Huawei ban lifted and the punitive tariffs removed. These are the terms if China's going to agree to any deal. The president has arrived in Osaka, Japan for the G20 meeting.Load-Date: June 27, 2019End of Document

SENATORS SEEK DETAILS ON SHARING US GENOMIC DATA WITH COMPANIES LINKED TO CHINA'S GOVERNMENTStates News ServiceJune 13, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 424 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: ROCKVILLE, MD BodyThe following information was released by the Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society:By Zachary BrennanSens. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Marco Rubio (R-FL) sent a letter earlier this week to the Acting Inspector General of the US Department of Health and Human Services raising concerns about the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) paying for genetic testing or analysis services from companies with ties to the Chinese government.The letter singles out WuXi Nextcode Genomics (WuXi) and Shenzhen BGI Technology Company (BGI) as publicly touting their partnerships with Huawei, a state-directed Chinese telecommunications company, to expand genomic analytics.WuXi in 2016 became the first genetic sequencing facility in China to gain CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) certification from CMS, while in March 2019, MGI announced plans to expand into the US market.We therefore request that the OIG, in coordination with relevant Intelligence Community agencies, review CMS payments to determine whether it has made payments for genetic testing to U.S. entities with partnerships to BGI, WuXi and any other company with ties to the Chinese government, Grassley and Rubio write.They also requested that the OIG determine whether CMS considers national security risks when determining whether payments are permissible to providers with partnerships with Chinese-affiliated companies. And they sought OIG recommendations "on ways to mitigate national security risks related to Americans' genomic data with respect to CMS payments."Grassley and Rubio noted that taxpayers cover the costs of CMS payments, so, They have every right to know if their money has gone to entities connected to the Chinese government.In a statement, WuXi did not deny its connections to Chinas government but clarified that its headquarters is in Cambridge, MA, and that the majority of senior management and board members are US citizens.With respect to the concern of genomic data storage in the Letter, we would like to emphasize that we always separate the genomic data storage for our business in the U.S. and our business in China, WuXi said. For our U.S. business, we currently use a leading U.S. cloud service provider; and for China-based business, we currently use a leading Chinese cloud service provider (which is not Huawei).The letters release follows a recent Senate Finance Committee hearing, chaired by Grassley, investigating actions by foreign entities to disrupt or influence research from the National Institutes of Health.Load-Date: June 14, 2019End of Document

Analysts, industries have differing views on Trump's trade fight with ChinaCollege Heights Herald: Western Kentucky UniversityMay 29, 2019 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 796 wordsBodyclass="asset-contentsubscriber-premium">As the Trump administration overhauls U.S. trade policy with China, the Chinese government imposed a 25 percent tariff on some U.S. imports this month, and plans to extend it to an additional 5,000 products on June 1.Trump says he faults U.S. trade representatives and former presidents for a $500 billion trade deficit, arguing, "We've never had a situation, nor has there ever been a situation in history where a country has done that to another country."China has not only undercut American workers through its low-wage manufacturing companies, but its government also requires U.S. companies to surrender their proprietary technology in order to do business there, the administration argues, which has led to theft of trade secrets and cyber-theft."We also have the theft of intellectual property that is probably in the neighborhood of $200 [million] to $300 million every year," Trump said.Depending on the industry or analyst, the tariffs are either great or terrible for the economy, U.S. businesses and the consumer.In 2015, nearly one in three tons of steel sold in the U.S. was produced outside the country, with record amounts flooding into the U.S. eliminating American steel workers' jobs, the American Iron and Steel Institute argues.Today, "the Administration's trade actions and tax and regulatory reform policies, in addition to the strong economic climate enabled by those policies, have allowed the American steel industry to begin to recover after more than a decade of low capacity utilization and weaker earnings due to repeated surges in imports fueled by global steel overcapacity," AISI states. In early 2019, capacity utilization at existing mills increased to more than 80 percent, levels they hadn't seen in a decade.Additionally, previously closed plants have been or continue to be re-opened, laid-off workers are now working, and companies are making investments in new steel production facilities, AISI notes."But this recent progress will disappear, and our steel industry will again suffer dire circumstances, if the tariffs are prematurely terminated," AISI said in a statement.In April, 263,000 new jobs were added, including 24,000 new manufacturing jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The bureau predicts the industry will need to hire an additional 29,000 machinists alone by 2024.The bureau also reported a half-century low national unemployment rate of 3.6 percent."Comparing the last 21 months of the Obama administration with the first 21 months of Trump's, shows that under Trump's watch, more than 10 times the number of manufacturing jobs were added," Chuck DeVore, vice president of national initiatives at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, says."One can find winners in consumer goods industries that normally benefit from high employment and a pro-growth environment," Juscelino Colares, a business law professor at Case Western Reserve University, told U.S. News and World Report. Tariffs represent "a short-term, occasionally painful strategy, the timing could not be better because the U.S. economy is running hot and some lost demand in China can be made up here," he added.However, according to anew report by researchers at the National Bureau of Economic Research , the tariffs created an added tax burden on consumers and deadweight or efficiency loss.More from this sectionWA: 6-MONTH-OLD HAS NEWEST CONFIRMED MEASLES CASERapper Meek Mill says Las Vegas hotel is racistThe Supreme Court confirmation process in 60 seconds"Studies, including our own, have found that the tariffs that the United States imposed in 2018 have had complete pass through into domestic prices of imports, which means that Chinese exporters did not reduce their prices," the authors write.For example, a U.S. purchaser of an imported Chinese product now has to pay the import tax on top of the base price. A product that costs $100 now costs $110.In 2018, Chinese tariffs imposed an annual cost of $419 for the typical household, the authors calculate. They project the new round of tariffs could increase that cost to $831.Deadweight or efficiency loss refers to companies choosing different suppliers to avoid paying the Chinese tariff. But they still pay a higher price to import from a different country.The president encouraged U.S. companies this month in a tweet to "Make your product at home in the USA and there is no Tariff. You can also buy from a non-Tariffed country instead of China. Many companies are leaving China."Many trade organizations, including the Association of Equipment Manufacturers and the Consumer Technology Association, have said theirs members are looking into what this would mean and cost in real terms.This article originally ran on thecentersquare.com.Load-Date: May 29, 2019End of Document

House Transportation Committee Issues Testimony From Auburn UniversityTargeted News ServiceMay 16, 2019 Thursday 8:01 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 5549 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee issued the following testimony by Frank J. Cilluffo, director of Auburn University's McCrary Institute for Cyber and Critical Infrastructure Security, at a hearing entitled "Impacts of State-Owned Enterprises on Public Transit and Freight Rail Sectors":"Thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today on a subject that is clearly of national importance. Your leadership in examining the impacts of foreign-owned enterprises on critical U.S. infrastructure and in the transportation sector in particular is commendable. The subject is as timely as it is concerning."In this testimony, my goal is threefold: First, to offer a snapshot of the threat. Second, to place that threat in context by elaborating upon why it matters. And, third, to suggest a handful of feasible, impact-oriented policy recommendations that fall within the Committee's jurisdiction. However, before proceeding, I offer one caveat. Whereas other witnesses will focus deeply on the specifics of particular modalities of transportation and the impacts in connection thereto, my contribution will reside more at the strategic level. I will speak to the broader challenges, primarily the threats to critical U.S. infrastructure posed by foreign-owned enterprises and the response. This approach is intended to add value by acknowledging and emphasizing that the transportation sector must not be examined in isolation."Pursuant to this approach, there are three chief concerns on the cyber side. One, the theft of information for the purpose of espionage or computer network exploitation, to include the mapping of critical U.S. infrastructure. Two, the theft of information to enable disruptive or destructive computer network attack, including hybrid cyber/physical attack. And, three, the insider threat, which cuts across all of these categories. In relation to foreign state-owned enterprises, it is also important to recognize that the potential threat is equally acute. It may arise deliberately with the foreign company acting as a willing conduit for its state of origin or inadvertently with the foreign company simply being subject in principle and/or by law of the state of origin to provide assistance upon request.The State of Play: Risks to National &#38; Economic Security"Foreign state-owned enterprises and China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation (CRRC) in particular is increasingly taking center-stage when it comes to building new rail cars for major American cities. Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia have each awarded contracts recently to CRRC, which placed markedly lower bids than the competition. The company is also expected to bid on upcoming rail-car contracts with the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and the Washington (DC) Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.1"These procurement decisions and processes raise multiple concerns. First, the playing field is tilted: CRRC is able to underbid others because it benefits from state support.2 Second, this support is just one element of a much broader strategy on China's part to challenge and undermine America economically.3 Third, these economic factors are inextricably intertwined with U.S. national security because to undercut America's competitiveness is to damage the engine that powers our national security. And, fourth, CRRC's foothold in the supply chain of public transit to some of the largest cities in America effectively provides China with a wealth of intelligence, accessible through cyber means and vulnerabilities, among others. In military terms, such gathering of information for future exploitation and potential attack is called Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield (IPB) -- an important concept here, as China conceives of cyber, economic, military, and other measures as interconnected tools to achieve the country's larger geopolitical aims and ambitions. Looking beyond public transit and beyond China alone, the unfortunate reality that we must take as our operating assumption, is that U.S. critical infrastructures have already been mapped by our adversaries."The situation is no less concerning in the air, where the use of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) is becoming ever more common, for a range of purposes including surveying and securing large tracts of land. Notably, a Chinese manufacturer--DJI--has largely captured the American market for UAS. While UAS serve valuable functions, use of these Internet-connected systems entails risks. Most importantly, the using entity's sensitive data may be exposed and accessed.4 This type of breach is especially problematic if the using entity supports a critical U.S. sector or function, and the manufacturer of the UAS is a foreign state-owned enterprise. Chinese companies, for example, may be legally required to help advance the mission and goals of China's security and intelligence services. The use of UAS also raises the prospect of cyber/physical convergence, whereby cyber tools and operations may be invoked (particularly by an adversary with hostile intent) to generate kinetic or real-world consequences. Notwithstanding this background, the UAS issue has yet to receive in this country the attention and commensurate timely action that this concerning matter deserves."Within the transportation sector alone, the potential vulnerabilities are manifold. Public transit, freight rail, UAS, seaports, and so on -- each presents a tempting target on its own.5 At the same time however, these transport hubs in surface, air and maritime also individually and collectively support and enable the U.S. military to achieve its ends and operations both at home and abroad. The ability of U.S. forces to complete these activities successfully and in service of the national interest is what the U.S. defense community refers to as Mission Assurance. Continuity of these operations, and resilience in the face of disruptive or destructive events, is of fundamental importance. National defense priorities thus intersect and, to a certain extent, depend upon the integrity of the transportation sector. If the latter is compromised that may put Mission Assurance at risk, since logistics are the lifeblood of the U.S. military; and to hamper that planning and execution is to jeopardize our ability to deploy forces and prosecute war. Put differently, the impacts of foreign state-owned enterprises on the transportation sector range well beyond the economic and stray deeply and directly into the realm of national security. Again, the potential for cyber/physical convergence, with resulting consequences on the battlefield, is concerning. Indeed, the Center for Cyber and Homeland Security will be releasing a report shortly entitled "Strengthening Defense Mission Assurance Against Emerging Threats." We will make it available to the Committee."Foreign state-owned enterprises and the advanced technologies that they offer, often at highly competitive prices and frequently accompanied by additional concessionary financing, present a dilemma for other critical infrastructure sectors, too. 5G telecommunications technology proffered worldwide by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE is a clear and prominent example. 5G will be the foundation upon which next-generation networks, globally, will rest. Currently, countries are in the process of selecting the entities that will build and contribute to that foundation. This is a seminal decision that will affect not only the telecommunications sector in each country, but all of the other sectors that the telecommunications industry supports and services (such as transportation -- including autonomous vehicles where the cyber domain meets and melds with the physical world)."As such, 5G will be the hub powering many spokes that in turn may be critical sectors or functions. To be selected a preferred provider of the components for the hub is a tremendous economic opportunity. Huawei and ZTE are therefore competing aggressively to act as suppliers, including to the United States. Based on evidence of these companies' complicity with the Chinese government, and the national security concerns that this raises (e.g., espionage, IPB, intellectual property theft, etc.), the United States has rejected these overtures, and urged its allies and partners to do the same.6 While paths forward may ultimately diverge, the U.S. way ahead is clear, and it will not engage Huawei or ZTE. Significantly, the strategic significance of 5G, as the bedrock upon which telecommunications and so much more will rely, has also been recognized by more than 30 countries, which met recently in Prague, and produced a series of principles regarding the "cyber security of communications networks in a globally digitized world."7"Other products and technologies supplied by Chinese companies that have raised security concerns in the United States include cameras, such as video surveillance equipment, manufactured by Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology. The company, a global giant in its field, began as a Chinese government research institute. Today, three Chinese state-owned enterprises retain a large ownership stake of more than 40 percent in the company. Nevertheless, Hikvision cameras have been used in U.S. prisons and schools, and "sensitive sites such as the Fort Leonard Wood army base and the U.S. embassy in Kabul." Hikvision has also been the subject of allegations that the company maintains access to its devices "even if you change the admin [passwords] and the firewall."8"Many other smaller but still important opportunities exist for foreign state-owned enterprises to make inroads into U.S. critical infrastructure either directly or indirectly. Flush with the financial backing of their state sponsors, these foreign proxy entities can step in and scoop up U.S. assets and entities that are on the verge of bankruptcy or in need of start-up capital.9 Such acquisitions may relate to a niche or component that may seem minor to the untrained eye, but may bear significant import. Consider switches, for instance. They play a crucial role in freight and passenger rail, and the ability to alter their activation or operation could cause substantial harm to both persons and property. Nor would such alteration be necessary to perform in person or onsite. Instead, tampering could take place from afar through silent and stealthy cyber means."This scenario also highlights the criticality of time, as invoked by the phrase Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT). Accuracy of time and the positioning and navigation functions that it enables is too often overlooked, underplayed, or taken as given. We do so at our peril. Here again, China is investing heavily with the dual goals of enhancing its ability to safeguard its own PNT and undermine others, such as through anti-satellite capabilities that could blind and bind the U.S. military. Modern militaries rely heavily on space-based assets for their transit and targeting requirements and other needs, thereby expanding the potential surface of attack. In addition, the continued expansion of the Internet of Things and the related number of connected devices worldwide that are giving us smart cities, smart cars, and sensors galore, likewise serves to increase exponentially both vulnerabilities and possibilities for attack. Heightened functionality comes at a price for soldiers and consumers alike.10 The ever-present criticality of PNT functions and the coming ubiquity of 5G technology each underscore the need to remain resilient, including by considering alternatives to our heavy reliance on the space-based Global Positioning System (GPS), as a precautionary measure."Supply chain concerns are by no means limited to goods or services of Chinese origin.11 Software produced by the Russian anti-virus company Kaspersky Lab is the subject of a ban on use by U.S. federal agencies. Kaspersky Lab's leadership has close ties to Russia's leadership, and the Lab may be legally obligated to assist Russian security and intelligence officials with espionage efforts directed against the U.S. government.12 Indeed, even if the assist to foreign state officials in Moscow, Beijing, or elsewhere, were inadvertent or unwitting on the part of the foreign supplier, the possibility for that enterprise and its products, technologies and services to serve as conduit is simply unacceptable."Despite measures like the Kaspersky software ban that are intended to mitigate harm to U.S. national security, the imprint of foreign state-owned enterprises upon critical U.S. infrastructure today remains troubling. Consider the grid. According to the deputy director of counterintelligence at the Department of Energy, more than 200 Chinese transformers have come into the U.S. energy sector during the past decade. Previously there were none.13 The groundwork for future sabotage, actioned remotely by digital means, is now in place."In some instances, the problem is low-tech, at least on its face. A recent GAO report revealed that just six TSA employees were responsible for overseeing the security of 2.7 million miles of oil &#38; gas pipeline.14 This is patently insufficient, regardless the degree of foreign state-owned enterprise involvement in this area. The problem appears to be compounded by shortfalls in cybersecurity expertise on the part of relevant personnel, and this further inhibits robust oversight at a time when pipeline operations are increasingly computerized."In short, we have failed to inoculate ourselves against the many and varied threats to U.S. critical infrastructure posed by nation-state actors and their proxies. This, despite the fact that our adversaries have demonstrated their interest year after year in mapping our architectures and engaging in persistent computer network exploitation efforts that have no benign purpose and could ultimately be combined with kinetic measures. China and Russia are not alone in these pursuits. Iran and North Korea join them and possess a degree of hostile intent that more than makes up for any shortfalls in their respective capacities and capabilities. In this regard, we ought not to forget Iran's past cyber-targeting of U.S. banks (DDoS attacks) or its cyber-foray into the workings of a New York State dam.15 The 2018 Foreign Economic Espionage in Cyberspace Report produced by the National Counterintelligence and Security Center notes also, "Iranian hackers target U.S. aerospace and civil aviation firms."16 Nor should we forget North Korea's destructive cyber-attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment.17Proposed Response: Selected Action Recommendations"The magnitude of the challenge is daunting, but there are steps that we can and should take in order to confront and counter the array of threats and problems that prevail, particularly those of highest potential consequence. What we cannot afford to do is grind the U.S. economy to a halt by introducing blanket and overly blunt security measures. Instead, we must tailor and calibrate our responses to limit any collateral damage to U.S. interests, separate and apart from national security concerns. In practice, this means working to elevate security concerns, monitor them, test our responses, and continually refine those regimes. Admittedly, this is a tall order. But, like any complex task, it can be broken down into a series of steps to be taken in a sequence that deals with first things first:"Prioritize Lifeline Sectors and National Critical Functions. If everything is critical then nothing is, and since we cannot protect everything, everywhere, all the time, we must focus our limited human, capital and other resources on those assets and operations whose takedown or undermining would be most damaging to the nation. Put differently, we must manage risk since we cannot eliminate it. To this end, a good place to start would be to direct our attention to the so-called "Lifeline" Sectors, which have already been identified as the most critical of the critical. These include the defense industrial base, energy, financial services, transportation, telecommunications, and water. In addition, the list of National Critical Functions (NCF) recently released by the National Risk Management Center, nested within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)'s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), provides another series of guideposts for prioritization. The NCF list addresses cross-sector and system-wide risks, and thereby complements a focus on lifeline sectors, by taking the logical next step, which is aligning and calibrating the most critical of sectors and the most critical of functions."Know and Scrutinize Your Supply Chain. It should be patently clear from the above-described state of play that any entity is only as strong as the weakest link in its chain. In the context of business operations or government enterprise, this means that knowing and scrutinizing your supply chain is a prerequisite to public safety and security. However, while few would argue with this statement as a matter of principle, not enough businesses or government officials and contractors are paying this principle the heed that it deserves in practice. Instead of acting according to the old adage, "trust but verify," too many of us are relying on trust alone18. In the context of critical infrastructure, this could have catastrophic consequences. Executive Order 13806 on Assessing and Strengthening the Manufacturing and Defense Industrial Base and Supply Chain Resiliency of the United States19 was assuredly a helpful initiative in this respect as was the Department of Defense-led Interagency Task Force Report20 and, the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Supply Chain Risk Management Task Force launched recently by DHS CISA.21 However, it is incumbent upon all of us to widen and deepen the effort.22"Empower CFIUS to better Protect Critical U.S. Infrastructure. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is an interagency body mandated to review the national security implications of certain transactions. Taken together with the 2018 Foreign Investment Risk Review and Modernization Act, and our export control regime, we have in place an architecture and mechanisms to assess and thwart significant, negative consequences for U.S. national security that might arise from foreign investment or technology transfer. The system in place entails evidence-based inquiry and analysis but contains some important gaps. These are identified and discussed in specific bilateral context in a staff research report of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission released earlier this month. The report includes the concern that "investments in U.S. critical technologies based outside the United States" fall beyond the detection ambit of CFIUS.23"Develop Strategy, Not Just Tactics, and Integrate Cyber. American economic advantage, military strength, innovation, jobs and many other important national equities are at stake.24 There is a resultant compelling need to address the ecosystem of threats in a comprehensive and contextualized manner that balances and accommodates the tensions that may exist among the various equities at play. At the same time, cybersecurity factors, such as risk assessments and risk management strategies, should be woven into strategy at inception and across the board, rather than treated as a separate vertical, that must be retrofitted. To these ends, a domestic version of The Prague Proposals, which are principles regarding the "cyber security of communication networks in a globally digitized world" generated at the recent 5G Security Conference in which 32 countries participated, could prove useful for safeguarding U.S. Lifeline Sectors and National Critical Functions in connection with the widespread rollout and implementation of 5G technology.25"Make Building the Cyber Workforce and a Network of Critical Technologies Testbeds National Imperatives. Report after report has identified large shortfalls in the supply of skilled cyber professionals relative to U.S. demand for them in both the public and private sectors. Yet, cyber practitioners are crucial to identifying, assessing, and responding to the threat as manifested and previously described. For government, the under-supply problem is magnified because private industry can offer prospective and existing employees greater salary and benefits. Although psychic income derived from the government mission of serving the national interest is a significant pull and retention factor, the fact remains that the pool of qualified candidates is itself too small. It must be expanded, urgently, to address the deficit of knowledge and bandwidth that is needed in our public institutions and in our companies to counter and thwart cyber threats posed by state actors to U.S. critical infrastructure. The recent Executive Order on America's Cybersecurity Workforce recognizes this challenge,26 but continued and whole-of-society efforts will be required. In addition, on the technology side, we lack a strategic approach to integrating advancements into the broader ecosystem. An R&#38;D effort, in the form of a nationwide network of technology testbeds that simulate a realistic pan-sectoral environment, is needed to remedy this shortfall. Taken in aggregate, such a platform would identify and explore the various national and economic security implications of new and critical technologies before they are in widespread use.Conclusion"National security and free markets need not be an either/or proposition -- we need both. With leadership and sustained determination on the part of both government and industry, complemented and supported by robust partnership of the two, we can meet that goal. Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you today. It is a privilege to contribute to this important conversation and analysis,27 and I look forward to trying to answer any questions that you may have."* * *Footnotes:1 Candice Norwood, "As China Builds Transit Cars for U.S. Cities, Congress Seeks to Ban Them," Mass Transit (March 19, 2019), https://www.masstransitmag.com/rail/vehicles/news/21072662/as-china-builds-transit-cars-for-us-cities-congress-seeks-to-ban-them2 "CRRC has been winning U.S. procurements by bidding anywhere from 20 to 50 percent below bids from its non-subsidized, private sector competitors."

'Made in China 2025' is as much a roadmap to theft as it is guidance to innovate.

Over a longer time period, since 2011, more than 90 percent of the Department's economic espionage prosecutions (i.e., cases alleging trade secret theft by or to benefit a foreign state) involve China, and more than two-thirds of all federal trade secret theft cases during that period have had at least a geographical nexus to China. Some of those cases demonstrate that China is using its intelligence services and their tradecraft to target our private sector's intellectual property.

"This kind of deliberately provoking trade disputes is naked economic terrorism, economic chauvinism, economic bullying,"Zhang's comments to the press come ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping's state visit to Russia next month, where Xi will attend a major economic forum and strengthen trade relations with Moscow, one of its most strategic allies.Of China's relationship with Russia, Zhang said China was prepared to deal with any "external challenges" that may threaten their close relationship.Read more: Xi Jinping says China is embarking on a 'new Long March,' a signal the US trade war is far from over"We will definitely properly deal with all external challenges, do our own thing well, develop our economy, and continue to raise the living standards of our two peoples," he said. "At the same time, we have the confidence, resolve and ability to safeguard our country's sovereignty, security, respect and security and development interests."Clashes between Beijing and Washington have heightened this month after negotiations between Chinese and US trade officials failed to produce a deal and resulted in a series of tit-for-tat tariffs between the nations.The Trump administration ramped up tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, accusing China of            reneging on its previous trade commitments. China fired back by            hiking tariffs on $60 billion worth of American imports as of June 1, with Chinese state media slamming US "           greed and arrogance."Tensions are also brewing between major US and Chinese companies as the trade war pours into the tech sector, a key trade point for both countries.President Trump has stepped up action against Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei and recently suggested the company could be used as a bargaining chip in ongoing trade negotiations.Last year, the Trump administration banned US government agencies from buying or using Huawei equipment, citing concerns that the company's technology could be used as a backdoor for Chinese government espionage. In response, Huawei            filed a lawsuit against the US government, claiming that no evidence has been produced to back up concerns that the company poses a security threat.Friction between the Trump administration and Huawei further escalated this month after the the US Commerce Department added Huawei to a trade blacklist, which prevents the company from buying parts and components from American companies without US government approval.The placement of Huawei on the US trade blacklist has led to many major US tech companies and suppliers - including Google- to cut its ties and a flow of critical software to the company.Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei responded to the strained relations between Huawei and US tech companies, telling Chinese media that the company is "fully prepared" for a tech clash with the US. He added that            he would ignore Trump's call should he try and negotiate a trade deal with the company."Even if the US wants to buy our products in the future, I may not sell to them," Ren said in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Monday. "There's no need for negotiation."NOW WATCH: White House photographer Pete Souza reveals what it was like to be in the Situation Room during the raid on Osama bin LadenSee Also:• China drops heavy hint it is about to pull the trigger on its most powerful weapon in the trade war• Trump says the US suffers 'tremendous imbalance' with Japan on trade but is hopeful the 2 sides can reach a deal• Trump and Iran may be on the brink of a war that would likely be devastating to both sidesSEE ALSO: 'No gun, no smoke, only speculation': Huawei ups its legal battle against the US over federal banLoad-Date: May 30, 2019End of Document

US, China appear to brace for long haul in trade disputeAssociated Press Financial WireMay 22, 2019 Wednesday 7:33 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: WASHINGTON DATELINELength: 938 wordsByline: By PAUL WISEMAN and JOE McDONALD, AP Business WritersDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - With negotiations on hold and tariffs piling up, the United States and China appear to be bracing for a prolonged standoff over trade.Beijing is airing Korean War movies (antagonist: America) to arouse patriotic feelings in the Chinese public and offering tax cuts to software and chip companies as U.S. export controls threaten Chinese tech companies.In Washington, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is talking to Walmart and other companies about finding ways to ease the pain if President Donald Trump goes ahead with plans to extend import taxes to the $300 billion in Chinese products that haven't already been hit with tariffs.And the Trump administration is working on an aid package for American farmers hurt by China's retaliatory tariffs on soybeans and other U.S. agricultural products - on top of last year's $11 billion farm bailout.Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer wrapped up an 11th round of talks with the Chinese earlier this month without reaching an agreement to resolve a dispute over Beijing's aggressive efforts to challenge American technological dominance. The U.S. charges that China is stealing technology, unfairly subsidizing its own companies and forcing U.S. companies to hand over trade secrets if they want access to the Chinese market."It's really hard to identify whether this the beginning of a prolonged conflict or just negotiating tactics," said David Dollar, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former official at the World Bank and U.S. Treasury. "I increasingly think that this is going to turn into a long-term trade conflict. We have to entertain the possibility that there is no deal."Dollar points to the airing of Korean War movies and comments by President Xi Jinping suggesting that the Chinese people need to steel themselves for another "Long March" - a reference to the legendary and arduous trek Mao Zedong's Communists made to escape pursuers from China's ruling Nationalist government in 1934-1935.The world's two biggest economies are already locked in the costliest trade combat since the 1930s.The United States has imposed 25% tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports and is planning to target another $300 billion - a move that would cover everything China ships to the United States.China has targeted $110 billion in U.S. products in retaliation.China is also looking at other ways to pressure the United States.President Xi made it a point to visit a Chinese factory this week that processes rare earths - minerals used in things like mobile phones and electric cars. The unspoken message: The United States needs China to supply the exotic minerals.China also turned up the heat on Boeing Co.: On Wednesday, two of China's three major state-owned airlines - Air China Ltd. and China Southern Airlines Ltd. - demanded compensation for the grounding of the plane maker's 737 Max jetliners after fatal crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia. The third state-owned carrier - China Eastern Airlines Ltd. - made a similar request last month.Meantime, the Chinese government took steps to protect tech companies from becoming collateral damage in the U.S.-China conflict.Under the new measure, most software and integrated circuit companies can skip paying income taxes for two years and will see their tax bills cut by half for three years after that, the Finance Ministry said.Most smartphones, tablet computers and other electronics are assembled in China. But Chinese manufacturers typically use U.S., Japanese or Taiwanese microchips and other components.The United States has squeezed Chinese companies by threatening to shut off supplies of those key components. The Trump administration issued an order last week that will curb or end Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies Ltd.'s access to American chips and to Google, which provides the Android operating system and services for Huawei smartphones.A similar export ban almost put the Chinese telecom firm ZTE Corp. out of business last year. The U.S. charged that the company had violated sanctions by selling equipment to Iran and North Korea. Eventually, ZTE escaped the export ban by agreeing to pay a $1 billion fine and to replace its management team.In Washington, members of the House Financial Services Committee pressed Mnuchin Wednesday on the costs of the trade war with China. Mnuchin said he'd spoken to Walmart and other firms about how to limit the effect of higher tariffs on American consumers. "I don't expect there will be significant costs on American families," he said.But many American businesses are not so sanguine.Nearly 200 footwear retailers and brands including Adidas and Shoe Carnival wrote a letter to Trump on Monday, calling on him not to slap tariffs on footwear imported from China.The group, the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, estimates that Trump's proposed actions will add $7 billion in additional costs for customers every year.Can the United States and China break the impasse?No talks have been scheduled, and many analysts suspect a breakthrough will require an intervention at the top before the Group of 20 major economies meets next month in Osaka, Japan."For a deal, there needs to be a Trump-Xi call, which would enable a useful Lighthizer visit to Beijing," said Derek Scissors, a China specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "Then the two leaders could meet in Osaka and compromise on at least one major issue: reinvigorating the talks."___AP Economics Writer Martin Crutsinger in Washington and AP Retail Writer Anne D'Innocenzio in New York contributed to this report.Load-Date: May 23, 2019End of Document

Democrats Are Avoiding the China QuestionAtlantic OnlineJune 10, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1850 wordsByline: Peter BeinartBodyListening to the Democratic candidates for president, you would probably not know that globalization, as it has existed for the past several decades, may soon cease to exist. Since at least the turn of the century, the close ties between the United States and China, which together constitute 40 percent of the world's GDP, have bound the world economy together. But this deep interdependence-which is sometimes called "Chimerica"-may not survive Donald Trump. It's not just his tariffs on Chinese goods, and China's retaliatory tariffs on American products, which if not repealed will likely depress trade between the nations. Trump is also building a wall between China's and America's biggest companies. In May, his administration forced Google to stop supplying crucial software to Huawei, the world's second-largest smartphone maker. China will likely respond by bolstering its own suppliers so it's never at America's mercy again.The U.S.-China split is even influencing global travel. This week, China warned its citizens against visiting the United States, and Chinese enrollment in American universities is dropping. Trump and Xi Jinping may be leading the world into an era in which money, goods, information, and people flow less freely across national borders than they have for the past quarter century. The headline of a recent op-ed by former German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer calls this "           The End of the World as We Know It."How do the major Democratic presidential candidates feel about this potentially epic shift? We don't really know. They rarely bring it up on their own. Bernie Sanders says nothing about China on his            website. Neither do            Elizabeth Warren,           Pete Buttigieg,           Beto O'Rourke,           Cory Booker, or           Kirsten Gillibrand. All Joe Biden says about China on his website is that it's "           rising." On hers, Amy Klobuchar            pledges to "invest in diplomacy and rebuild the State Department and modernize our military to stay one step ahead of China."            Kamala Harris's website says the United States should "work in lockstep with our partners" to confront "China's unfair trade practices." That's about as substantive as it gets.To be fair, presidential candidates tend to talk about what voters want them to talk about. And despite Trump's trade war, Democratic voters are most concerned about            health care, education, the environment, and            abortion. When the Pew Research Center            asked Democrats in January which issues should be a top priority in Washington this year, trade came in 17th out of 18.Leading media outlets aren't doing nearly enough to jump-start the conversation. CNN, MSNBC, and Fox have all hosted town halls in which moderators and potential voters ask the presidential candidates questions.            In           many           of           them, transcripts suggest,            China           hasn't           come up            at           all. As far as I can tell, Huawei hasn't been mentioned once.When the candidates are forced to discuss China, you can glimpse the faint outlines of a divide between the more left-wing and more centrist contenders. In an interview on PBS last year, Sanders            said he "strongly supports" tariffs against China, but thinks "Trump gets it wrong in terms of implementation." Warren has            said that "tariffs are one part of reworking our trade policy." By contrast, Buttigieg, in his MSNBC town hall,            said "a tariff is a tax" that will make Americans "all pay, on average, 800 bucks more a year, starting now." In hers, Harris also            slammed the "Trump trade tax," which means "we are paying more for washing machines and shampoos." The implication is that unlike Sanders and Warren, Buttigieg and Harris don't just oppose the way Trump has imposed tariffs. They oppose tariffs in general.But the debate the candidates should be having-and media interviewers should be nurturing-is about much more than tariffs. It's about whether and how to alter the terms of Chinese-American interdependence. Right now, Trump's efforts to change the relationship seem likely to break Chimerica apart and end globalization in its current form. Yet most Americans haven't heard a clear Democratic alternative.There are three broad arguments that Democratic hopefuls could make. The first is that Trump is right to pressure China to open its economy to U.S. corporations, but that he shouldn't do so unilaterally. Yes, Democrats might argue: Trump is right to demand that Beijing permit American companies to do business in China without forming joint ventures with Chinese counterparts. He's right to demand that China do a better job of protecting intellectual property so Chinese companies can't create cheap knockoffs of American goods. Where he's wrong is in trying to accomplish all this on his own. In Beto O'Rourke's CNN town hall, the former Texas representative brought forth the kernel of this argument. "When in the history of this country have we ever gone to war, a military fight or a trade war, without allies?" O'Rourke            asked. "Because that's exactly what we are doing now with China."The implication is that the U.S. should quickly settle its trade disputes with Japan, South Korea, and Europe. If they band together, the democracies can focus instead on pushing China to accept the responsibilities that come with being the global economic power that it is. In trade matters, China still portrays itself as a developing country, a status that allows it to protect Chinese companies and impose unfavorable conditions on Western firms that want to sell to Chinese consumers. The natural forum in which to pressure Beijing would be the World Trade Organization, which the United States could empower rather than            trying to cripple, as Trump has.For Democrats, such a strategy would make intuitive sense. In economics, as in war, Democrats tend to prefer multilateral to unilateral interventions, and to support international institutions that legitimize American power. Barack Obama's administration was thinking in these terms when it tried to create the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which it hoped would create rules for trade and investment across Asia that China felt pressured to match. Politically, the current Democratic candidates probably can't endorse the TPP, because sentiment in the party has shifted so far against the proposed agreement. But it's easy to imagine the more moderate Democrats-Biden, Buttigieg, Harris, and O'Rourke-pursuing a modified version of Obama's strategy of preserving the Chimerica relationship while making it work better for American businesses.Secondly, Democrats could make a different, more radical, argument: Opening up China's economy to American companies and American investment isn't the answer at all. In this view, the larger problem at the heart of globalization is that big corporations can scour the world seeking the cheapest workers with the fewest labor and environmental protections.By this logic, Democrats shouldn't assemble foreign partners to achieve Trump's current trade goals, because the goals themselves are wrong. America should only seek trade agreements with strong, enforceable labor and environmental standards, and perhaps even some form of global minimum wage. The University of Rhode Island historian Erik Loomis has            proposed that future trade deals create international courts that, rather than allowing corporations to sue governments for impeding investment and trade, as the TPP would have, allow citizens to sue corporations for mistreating workers or harming the environment.The goal of this approach would be less to recalibrate the relationship between America and China-which now possesses its own "           Rust Belt" as corporations shift to poorer countries with lower wages--than to recalibrate the relationship between corporations and workers. America would focus not on pushing China to better protect the intellectual property of American businesses but to allow independent labor unions so American and Chinese workers can together pressure their employers to raise wages and improve working conditions. Democrats,            wrote the activist Tobita Chow in a plea to the 2020 contenders, should "recognize Chinese workers as potential comrades in a shared struggle against global corporate power."For anti-corporate Democrats such as Sanders and Warren, Chow's argument might constitute a natural international extension of their domestic agenda. But this more dramatic rewriting of globalization s rules is likely harder to achieve. Permitting more foreign investment doesn't threaten the Chinese government's hold on power; permitting independent labor unions could. Beijing surely remembers that Solidarity, the independent labor union led by Lech Walesa, was what helped bring down the Communist government in Poland. Sanders and Warren are not Trump-style hyper-nationalists. They don't want to undo globalization; they want to stop corporations from defining it. But the more ambitious your goals for a trade deal, the harder that deal is to reach, which for Sanders and Warren may be an acceptable risk. If America and China can't reach an agreement, the tariffs remain-an outcome that the two liberal senators appear more comfortable with than their more centrist opponents.The third Democratic approach for remaking Chimerica would be, politically, the easiest. It's to focus not on China but on America. Instead of decrying the Made in China 2025 initiative, in which Beijing subsidizes crucial emerging industries such as robotics and green energy, the MIT economist David Autor has            suggested that the U.S. adopt something similar-for instance, by dramatically boosting investment in the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. Democrats could frame their openness to immigration as a way to bring in the talent necessary to compete with China. And they could propose infrastructure investments that, for instance, accelerate America's transition to 5G. Rather than breaking up Chimerica, the United States would strengthen its competitive position within the relationship by making changes at home.The third option isn't incompatible with the first or second one. But so far, it's hard to know which approach the Democratic candidates prefer, because while they are laying out proposals for expanding health-care coverage, making college cheaper, saving abortion rights, and converting to green energy, they are barely debating the U.S.-China relationship at all.When the primary debates begin, at the end of this month, the networks must pin the Democratic candidates down. If voters go to the polls early next year knowing nothing about how the Democratic contenders envision the future of a relationship that for decades has anchored the world as we know it, those candidates and the media will both have failed.           Faith Hill contributed research to this article.Load-Date: June 12, 2019End of Document

House Oversight &#38; Reform Committee Issues Report on Authorization, Oversight Plans for All House Committees (Part 6 of 14)Targeted News ServiceApril 19, 2019 Friday 11:21 PM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 9916 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON, April 19 -- The House Oversight and Reform Committee issued a report (H.Rpt. 116-40) on authorization and oversight plans for all House committees. The report was advanced by Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, on April 12.COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRSOversight Plan116th Congress1. INTRODUCTIONPursuant to the requirements of clause 2(d) of House Rule X, the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs ("the Committee") has prepared this oversight plan for the 116th Congress, which will be submitted to the Committee on Oversight and Reform and the Committee on House Administration. This plan summarizes the Committee's oversight priorities for the next two years, subject to the understanding that new developments will undoubtedly affect priorities and work assignments in the months ahead.Agency and program oversight are key responsibilities of the legislative branch. Committee Rule 15 requires each Subcommittee to hold regular oversight hearings that, according to usual practice, include an annual hearing on the portions of the Administration's budget request within that Subcommittee's jurisdiction. A new Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations has been created to enhance the Committee's oversight capabilities. Oversight activities will be coordinated between the Committee and the Subcommittees in order to facilitate comprehensive and strategic review of the programs and agencies within the Committee's jurisdiction.These Committee activities may include hearings, briefings, reports, and investigations, Member or staff-level meetings, correspondence, fact-finding and oversight travel, reports, and public statements. They may also include effective use and review of reports by the Government Accountability Office and by statutory Inspectors General, as well as Congressional Notifications submitted by executive branch agencies. The Committee will consult, as appropriate, with other committees of the House that may share jurisdiction over relevant issues and activities.The Committee's authorization and oversight activities will emphasize:- effectiveness of U.S. foreign policy;- effective implementation of U.S. law;- the review of agencies and programs in the Committee's jurisdiction;- effective management and administration, and institutional modernization;- appropriate resourcing of U.S. foreign policy and programs.2. PRIORITY OVERSIGHT MATTERSa. Russia: The Committee will address the impact of Russia's foreign policy on U.S. security, political, and economic interests, as a result of its aggression and related hostile actions regarding NATO, Ukraine, Georgia, and other countries. It will also examine Kremlin-driven efforts to undermine the governments and other institutions of the U.S. and other countries through cyber intrusions, propaganda and other tools. The Committee will examine the range of options available to the U.S. to respond to these actions, including legislation to impose further sanctions on Russia and provide assistance to vulnerable countries. The Committee will also review the deteriorating domestic situation in Russia regarding democracy, civil society, the rule of law, and human rights.

Ukraine/Georgia: The Committee will closely monitor Russian-supported separatist activity and other aggressive actions aimed at undermining Ukraine's sovereignty, including the forcible and illegal annexation of Crimea. The Committee will continue to examine the U.S. response to this aggression in light of the long-standing U.S. foreign policy doctrine of non-recognition of territorial changes effected by force alone. The Committee will assess the situation in Georgia and consider measures the U.S. Government can take to promote effective, democratic governance in these while turning back Russian intrusion. In addition, the Committee will actively oversee efforts to work with these countries to strengthen their military and security services, promote economic growth, combat corruption, and promote an effective and democratic government.c.

Particular attention will be paid to the Administration's decision to withdraw most U.S. forces from Syria, and the implications of that decision on U.S. personnel, allies, and interests. The Committee will also examine the consequences of the Administration's decision to suspend stabilization assistance in Syria and evaluate U.S. efforts to prevent international reconstruction funds from assisting the Assad regime until a sustainable political solution is achieved and the regime allows for the safe, dignified and voluntary return of the outstanding six million displaced Syrians. The Committee will examine the impact of Syria's refugee crisis on regional states including Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon.

State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development Oversight, Authorization, and Modernization: The Committee will seek to pass a State Department Authorization bill as one has not been enacted since 2002. Emphasis will also be placed on modernizing personnel systems and practices, increasing workforce flexibility and improving recruitment and retention processes, with a focus on ensuring that Department of State personnel better represent the diversity of the United States. The Committee will continue to monitor and examine the operations, budget, programs, planning, workforce training, building, and security policies with an eye toward authorization for Fiscal Year 2020. In addition to hearings with the Secretary of State and other Administration officials regarding their budget proposals for the upcoming year, such efforts may include: revisions to the Foreign Service Act; the Foreign Assistance Act; consideration of reforms to Executive Branch reporting requirements; and a reduction or consolidation of offices with duplicative mandates and overlapping responsibilities. In the wake of increasing threats to U.S. personnel serving overseas, the Committee will continue to evaluate the security of our embassies and consulates, along with proposed reforms to the State Department's diplomatic security service to promote the personnel safety in the context of appropriate evaluation of risk.t. Employee Retaliation: The Committee will investigate ongoing allegations of politically-motivated retaliation against State Department and USAID employees, including individuals who have alleged they were subjected to prohibited personnel practices on account of their national origin, sexual identity, perceived political views, or in response to whistleblowing.u. Foreign Assistance: The Committee will review the underlying authorities for U.S. foreign assistance with an eye towards reducing duplication, increasing transparency and effectiveness, and modernizing the foreign assistance workforce. It will also review issues related to the implementation of U.S. foreign assistance programs and projects, including the role of U.S. missions and embassies in overseeing grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements. In addition, the Committee will review issues related to coordination between the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and other U.S. Government agencies and departments involved in carrying out U.S. foreign assistance, as well as USAID's proposed Redesign of its internal structure to ensure its congruency with foreign policy priorities and the appropriate use of U.S. foreign assistance. Among a broad range of issues, the Committee will review U.S. foreign assistance initiatives aimed at providing life-saving humanitarian assistance, catalyzing economic growth, reducing aid dependence, and addressing food security and global health challenges, including food aid reform, maternal health and child survival, infectious disease surveillance and control, and resilience of developing communities to weather shocks and stresses, including climate change. The Committee will also exercise oversight over the implementation of the BUILD Act, P.L. 115-254, which will transform the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) into the International Development Finance Corporation. Assistance provided through the Millennium Challenge Corporation will also receive close scrutiny.v. Global Health: The Committee will examine key global health issues, in particular the harmful impacts of Administration policies of re-imposing the Global Gag Rule and eliminating funding to UNFPA on women's health services and access to reproductive health.

U.S. Nonproliferation Policy: The Committee will examine the effectiveness of U.S. nonproliferation policy and the international nonproliferation regime in preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction. The Committee will address opportunities to strengthen existing nonproliferation organizations, especially the International Atomic Energy Agency, increase cooperation with other countries, and enhance international nonproliferation agreements and mechanisms. Prominent issues will include the global expansion of civil nuclear power and the potential spread of technology, equipment and material useful in the development of nuclear weapons capabilities. The Committee will closely examine proposed and existing bilateral nuclear cooperation agreements with other countries, including their potential to promote U.S. nonproliferation objectives and commercial interests.aa. Security Assistance and Arms Transfer Policy: The Committee will assess the effectiveness of security assistance programs authorized under the Foreign Assistance Act and the Arms Export Control Act in advancing U.S. national interests.

The Committee will also review law and policy relating to U.S. arms transfers and related end-use monitoring, as well as various counterterrorism tools that impact foreign policy. The Committee will also continue to carefully review proposed arms sales to ensure they comport with U.S. foreign and national security policy and benefit the legitimate defense needs of the recipient countries, as well as the process by which the Administration consults with the Committee and the Congress on such sales to ensure proper oversight.bb. U.S. International Broadcasting: The Committee will continue to actively monitor and review the operations and organization of U.S. government-supported, civilian international broadcasting to respond more effectively to the challenges presented by state and non-state actors using modern communication platforms. The Committee will closely oversee the implementation of the reforms enacted in the 114th Congress, and seek further improvements in this critical area.cc.

Close attention will be paid to the extent to which the Administration's strategies in international organizations has led to better treatment of Israel and increased transparency, accountability, and reform of those organizations.ee. Cybersecurity: The Committee shall conduct oversight over U.S. efforts to examine and devise appropriate responses to cyber threats from foreign governments, non-state actors, and criminal networks that target the United States. The Committee will also examine efforts by U.S. adversaries to undermine the government, democratic and other institutions of the United States and other nations through cyber intrusions.ff. Conflicts of Interest Abroad: The Committee will investigate possible conflicts of interest presented by members of the Administration's personal and business interests abroad and the impact of such interests on the development and implementation of U.S. foreign policy.ADDITIONAL VIEWSI appreciate being provided the opportunity to review the text of the Chairman's proposed oversight plan for the 116th Congress, pursuant to the recently revised House Rule X(2)(d). According to that revision, the formal author of the report is now the Chairman, rather than the Committee as a whole. As such, wherever the new report speaks of what "the Committee" intends to do, it should be read as reflecting the intent of the Chairman, exercising his prerogatives under House and Committee rules, rather than the Committee as a whole. Committee Rule 11(b) continues to preclude the release of any document purporting to express publicly the views of the Committee unless it has been approved by a majority of the Committee.In recent years, the Committee has exercised significant, proactive oversight over the agencies and programs within our jurisdiction, on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis. I am hopeful that this commitment to even-handed oversight will continue into the future. To that end, I am encouraged to note the significant continuity between most of the Chairman's plan for the 116th Congress and the prior Committee Oversight Plan for the 115th Congress.Of course, the new oversight plan also includes changes and additions. Some are updates that reflect new circumstances and developments in the world. Others reflect the differing priorities of the new majority. Unfortunately, some changes are objectionable, and reflect the injection of partisan oversight priorities beyond what the prior majority indulged, even during a Democrat administration. It is unfortunate that their plan personally identifies the President and certain interactions with foreign leaders that fall within the constitutionally rooted Presidential Communications Privilege identified by our courts. It is also problematic that the "Global Health" subsection inserts new priorities related to abortion advocacy. Republican Members of the Committee continue to believe strongly that maintaining broad public support for our overseas programs requires precluding the expenditure of taxpayer funds for divisive and deeply objectionable purposes, such as funding for organizations overseas that perform or promote abortion as a method of family planning, or that support or participate in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. It is my sincere hope that the Committee will not expend its energies on these partisan pursuits when there are so many other issues vital to our national security that demand our attentions.I look forward to working with my friend Chairman Engel to maintain the traditional oversight standards of the Foreign Affairs Committee during the 116th Congress.Michael T. McCaul, Ranking Member.DISSENTING VIEWSThe Committee on Foreign Affairs Oversight Plan for the 116th Congress states, "The Committee will examine key global health issues, in particular the harmful impacts of Administration policies of re-imposing the Global Gag Rule and eliminating funding to UNFPA on women's health services and access to reproductive health." Incorporating Ranking Member McCaul's objection with respect to use of the term "Committee" and noting that this Oversight Plan reflects the personal views of Chairman Engel as it was never subject to vote by the Committee, we believe that foreign assistance should be life-affirming: it should support the health of both women and their unborn children. Global health goals should be evaluated with this aim in mind.Use of the term "Global Gag Rule" is inartful and needlessly polemical. Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance (PLGHA) affirms respect for unborn life in foreign aid funding by requiring foreign nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to agree, as a condition of their receipt of US federal grant money, to neither perform or promote abortion as a method of family planning overseas. Issued by President Trump on January 23, 2017, the PLGHA policy was implemented on May 9, 2017, by the Secretary of State in coordination with Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). It applies to funds appropriated for global health assistance through the Department of State (DOS), U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Department of Defense (DOD).DOS, USAID, DOD, and HHS have been applying PLGHA to new grants and existing grants eligible to receive new funding. On February 7, 2018, DOS released a six-month review of PLGHA. At that point, PLGHA had been applied to 733 awards. Prime partners declined to sign in only four instances out of 733 awards, so roughly 99.5% of prime partners who had the opportunity to accept the terms of PLGHA did so. If a partner declines to agree to the terms of PLGHA and funds are redirected to other organizations, the level of funding available for that country remains the same.U.S. foreign assistance should invest in women's healthcare, not abortion. PLGHA does not reduce funding for international health assistance or family planning. The choice is up to these organizations to either change their business practices or forego federal funding. If NGOs choose to stop performing and promoting abortion, they can again be eligible for federal grant money.For three decades, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has been widely denounced for its involvement in China's birth-limitation policy, which relies on coerced abortion. Yet it has refused to sever its links with the Chinese government.In 2016, China transitioned its "one-child-per-family" policy to a "two-children-per-family" policy. However, this revised state-imposed birth limitation does not eliminate the penalties that citizens face for violating the law. In China, reports of coerced abortions and sterilizations continue. According to DOS's 2017 Human Rights Report on China, many provinces require women who violate the family-planning policy to obtain an abortion. Some provinces, including Hubei, Hunan, and Liaoning, declare this explicitly; other provinces refer euphemistically to "remedial measures."2 Even in provinces that do not officially require abortions, local officials may still choose to coerce women into obtaining them.2/https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/ index.htm?year=2017&#38;dlid;= 277073#wrapper.The Kemp-Kasten Amendment mandates that no U.S. government funds be distributed to "any organization or program which, as determined by the President of the United States, supports or participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization." Applying the Kemp- Kasten Amendment, the Trump Administration determined for both fiscal year 2017 and 2018 that UNFPA had participated in China's coercive population programs. Funds were redirected to USAID's family planning, maternal health and reproductive health activities, thus vitiating any assertion of aggregated "harmful impact" upon "women's health services and access to reproductive health."Until UNFPA recognizes China's coercion and disassociates itself, contributing to UNFPA would send a signal of U.S. approval for China's government control over birth permits and its forced sterilization and abortion. Redirecting U.S. foreign aid dollars sends a message that coercion is unacceptable and we will fund programs that provide true health care.

This is the oversight plan of the Committee on Homeland Security for the 116th Congress. The oversight plan includes the areas in which the Committee expects to conduct oversight this Congress but does not preclude oversight or investigation of additional matters.OVERSIGHT, MANAGEMENT, AND ACCOUNTABILITYDuring the 116th Congress, the Committee will conduct oversight of the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) activities relating to human capital recruitment and retention, acquisitions, systems modernizations and other departmental functions essential to the Department effectively and efficiently fulfilling its critical missions. The Committee will also examine the Department's ongoing efforts to consolidate its headquarters at St. Elizabeths. Additionally, the Committee plans to conduct oversight of the Department's capstone strategy document, the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (QHSR), which was required by law to be published in December 2017 but has not yet been released. Finally, the Committee will investigate homeland security programs and practices, as warranted.Human Capital ManagementThe Committee will monitor the Department's efforts to plan and implement strategic human capital management programs that address current and emerging human capital challenges, including persistent low morale among the Department's workforce and ongoing problems with retention and hiring at U.S. Customs and Border Protection as well as other components within the department. Additionally, the Committee will examine the authorities and activities of the Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO) and the coordination of policy between and among the Department's CHCOs.Acquisition, Procurement, and Contract ManagementThe Committee will review the Department's major acquisition programs and procurement and contracting practices to promote efficiency and effectiveness and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse.

Additionally, the Committee will analyze and conduct oversight on the statutorily required security assessment of the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) program.INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERTERRORISMDuring the 116th Congress, the Committee will examine the capabilities and efforts of the Department, along with its Federal, state, and local partners, to identify, prevent, deter, and respond to threats to the homeland. The Committee will examine worldwide threats to the homeland from foreign terrorist groups, including the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), al Qaeda, and other groups that seek to carry out attacks against the U.S. and its interests. The Committee will also examine the threats from homegrown violent extremists and terrorist networks in this country. Additionally, the Committee will review the growing threats to the U.S. from domestic terrorism movements.Homeland Security Intelligence EnterpriseThe Committee will conduct oversight of the Department's Intelligence Enterprise, including intelligence activities throughout the Department and component agencies. This will include a focus on the coordination and collaboration across intelligence offices and personnel within the Headquarters and component agencies. Additionally, the Committee will review efforts to build the intelligence, analytical, and assessment capabilities of the Department and to ensure its full participation in the Intelligence Community as part of its homeland security mission. The Committee will also examine the Department's role in managing, distributing, and using terrorist intelligence and threat information in furtherance of its homeland security mission. Furthermore, the Committee will monitor the extent to which DHS effectively coordinates and collaborates with other Federal, State, and local agencies to mitigate threats to the homeland. The Committee will also review how DHS agencies collect and share information, including through vital security vetting programs.The Committee will continue to assess the development of DHS counterintelligence and insider threat programs, including Departmental organizational changes, resources, monitoring programs, and training initiatives. DHS's counterintelligence efforts are intended to prevent adversaries from penetrating the Department to exploit sensitive information, operations, programs, personnel, and resources.Information SharingThe Homeland Security Act of 2002 mandated routine sharing of homeland security-related information between and among Federal, State and local officials to assess the nature and scope of terrorist threats to the United States and to evaluate and act on that information. The Committee will examine information sharing among Federal, State and local governments, law enforcement entities, first responders, and emergency management personnel. The Committee will also examine the Department's initiatives to coordinate information sharing to and from state and local fusion centers throughout the country and will continue to evaluate the National Network of Fusion Centers to determine their impact on securing the homeland. The Committee will review coordination and information sharing procedures between state and local fusion centers and Joint Terrorism Task Forces as well. Additionally, the Committee will review U.S. counterterrorism cooperation with foreign partners, with the goal of improving the effectiveness of international information sharing, training and best practices, and coordination.Privacy and Civil LibertiesDuring the 116th Congress, the Committee will monitor the Department's efforts to ensure appropriate privacy and civil liberties protections in its intelligence and information sharing programs and activities.United States Secret ServiceThe Committee will examine the homeland security operations of the United States Secret Service, including protecting the President of the United States and other Executive branch officials and investigating financial and cybercrime, and review the agency's staffing model to determine whether it has adequate resources to meet its current and projected needs.

Additionally, the Committee will conduct oversight into whether the agency is taking steps to address persistent concerns about hiring practices, promotion policies, and morale.CYBERSECURITY, INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION, AND INNOVATIONDuring the 116th Congress, the Committee will conduct oversight of the cybersecurity, infrastructure protection, and science and technology activities of the Department.CybersecurityThe Committee will examine implementation of H.R. 3359, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act, which operationalized the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). The Committee will also conduct oversight of activities related to Executive Order 13800, Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure, Presidential Policy Directive 41 (PPD-41), United States Cyber Incident Coordination, and implementation of the National Cyber Strategy. Toward that end, the Committee will continue to its oversight of CISA's EINSTEIN and Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) programs for securing Federal networks, as well as strategic initiatives carried out by the new National Risk Management Center to identify interdependencies and mitigate vulnerabilities across critical infrastructure sectors. The Committee will also examine ways to further build the Department's cybersecurity capability and capacity to implement its cyber statutory authorities.Additionally, the Committee will continue its work examining the implementation of cybersecurity legislation, including the National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014, (Pub. L. 113-282) (authorizing the National Cybersecurity Communications and Integration Center, or NCCIC); the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014, (Pub.

L. 113-246) (calling for a comprehensive cyber workforce strategy with workforce assessments every three years). The Committee will also examine CISA's election security activities.Infrastructure ProtectionThe Committee will examine CISA's programs to protect critical infrastructure, with key focus on internal coordination mechanisms to ensure that expertise can be leveraged efficiently and effectively and encourage CISA to proactively respond to new and emerging threats, such as the threat of unmanned aerial vehicles detected in sensitive airspace. The Committee will also review how DHS, through CISA, works with the various critical infrastructure sectors pursuant to Presidential Policy Directive 21, Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience (PPD-21). During the 116th Congress the Committee will examine and work to reauthorize the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standard (CFATS) program, which requires high risk chemical facility owners and operators to report chemical holdings, perform vulnerability assessments, and adopt risk-based security measures to protect against the threat of a terrorist attack. Further, the Committee will continue to monitor the Department's efforts to establish a program to secure the sale and transfer of ammonium nitrate, as required by the Secure Handling of Ammonium Nitrate Act of 2008, and potentially develop new access controls to prevent the illicit flow of other precursor chemicals commonly used in Improved Explosive Devices (IEDs).Federal Protective ServiceThe Committee will continue to monitor the security of Federal buildings and facilities, including the role and effectiveness of the Federal Protective Service (FPS) and will review the Secretary's recommendation regarding the appropriate placement for FPS pursuant to H.R. 3359. The Committee will also continue to examine the general management of FPS, including its personnel policies, training program, and oversight and management of Federal facility contract guard personnel.Science and Technology DirectorateThe Committee will conduct oversight of the coordination of homeland security-related research, development, testing, and evaluation (RDT&#38;E;) within the Department and the adequacy of mission support provided by the Directorate to operational elements of the Department, state and local authorities, and the private sector. The Committee will also review the Department's efforts to attract the Nation's most talented scientists and build partnerships with the academic community through its Homeland Security Centers of Excellence and University Programs.EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS, RESPONSE, AND RECOVERYIn the 116th Congress, the Committee will continue to conduct oversight of the Department's efforts to prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from acts of terrorism, natural disasters, and other major emergencies.Preparedness, Response, and RecoveryThe Committee will examine the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) response and recovery efforts for declared disasters to ensure capabilities incorporate lessons learned and Federal resources are used appropriately. Focus will include lessons learned from the 2017 disaster season, including Hurricanes Maria, Irma, and Harvey, ongoing recovery efforts in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, addressing the needs of underserved and vulnerable populations, and the impact of global warming on disasters. The Committee will also review the Department's training and exercise programs, including awareness of these resources among first responders and state and local governments. Further, the Committee will monitor the extent to which FEMA is incorporating information from national exercises into future training, planning, and response, recovery, and mitigation activities. Additionally, the Committee will conduct oversight of the Department's Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office efforts to counter threats from chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons.Assistance to State and Local Governments and First RespondersThe Committee will examine FEMA's allocation and administration of grants to enhance the ability of state and local governments and emergency response providers to prevent, prepare for, respond to, mitigate, and recover from a terrorist attack or other disaster. The Committee will review the coordination of grant programs within the Department in developing guidance and administering grants; the ability of state and local governments to access, obligate, and expend funds; the strength of regional partnerships developed through grants; and the risk-based distribution and expenditure of such grants at the state and local levels. Additionally, the Committee will examine the Department's work with state and local partners to support school safety and security and preparedness.Emergency CommunicationsThe Committee will examine the coordination of various communications programs and offices within the Department, including the achievement and maintenance of interoperable communications capabilities among the Department's components, as required by the Department of Homeland Security Interoperable Communications Act (Pub. Law 114-29). The Committee will monitor activities of the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) and the development of the public safety interoperable wireless broadband network.

Update: Advanced Micro Devices Drops as JV Partner in China Among Five Chinese Firms Put on US 'Entity List'MT Newswires Live BriefsJune 21, 2019 Friday 3:49 PM ESTCopyright 2019 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 356 wordsBody (Updates with information about the impact on Advanced Micro Devices in the first, third, and fourth paragraphs.)Shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) dropped more than 3% intraday, along with declines in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index and peers such as Micron Technology (MU) and Broadcom (AVGO), after the US Commerce Department placed five more Chinese entities on its so-called Entity List, effectively precluding them from purchasing US components.The five companies are Chengdu Haiguang Integrated Circuit, Chengdu Haiguang Microelectronics Technology, Higon, Sugon, and Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology. Included in the list is one of Higon's five affected aliases, Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co. (THATIC),THATIC is a joint venture Advanced Micro had set up with the Chinese government in 2016. AMD works with THATIC to license its microprocessor technology to Chinese firms, including Higon."We are currently evaluating the addition of five new entities," AMD spokesman Drew Prairie was cited as saying in a report from Bloomberg. "AMD will comply with the regulations governing that list, just as we have complied with US laws to date. We are reviewing the specifics of the order."The US move follows a decision on May 15 when the Commerce Department had put Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies on the same list, leading to accusations of "bullying" by the Trump administration. Huawei is currently under a 90-day grace period before it is effectively blacklisted from doing business with US firms, who will, going forward, require a license from the US government to operate with the world's largest maker of smartphones. Huawei called the US action "unfair." "These five entities have been determined by the US government to be acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the US," the Commerce Department said in a statement. "These entities will be listed on the Entity List under the destination of China. This rule also modifies one entry on the Entity List under the destination of China."Price: 32.99, Change: -1.16, Percent Change: -3.38Load-Date: June 22, 2019End of Document

FEINSTEIN STATEMENT ON 5G NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNSStates News ServiceMay 14, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 658 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by California Senator Dianne Feinstein:Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today spoke about the risks of using foreign 5G equipmentparticularly Chinese-made equipment and the need to protect our internal telecommunications networks against foreign espionage and interference.What we see is a transition to fifth generation wireless technology, and thats 5G. And what Im told is that its going to fundamentally change our society, our economy, and our national security, so we all need to be concerned.Im told its expected to provide exponential increases in speed, capacity and reliability of internet-connected devices. That will include a variety of revolutionary technologies from new methods of transmitting data; to new, advanced cell tower infrastructure and an untold number of new smart devices.Im told 5G is expected to provide not only 20 times faster network performance, but also generate $12.3 trillion in global sales activity by 2035. Im told its going to create millions of new jobs, and launch entirely new industriesHowever, 5G also represents serious consequences for our national security. So, I think its very critical to understand and explore those issues as well. All of this is the purpose of todays hearing.I thought FBI Director Wray said it well when he said this: [foreign] 5G technology provides the capacity to exert pressure or control over our telecommunications infrastructure. It provides capacity to maliciously modify or steal information. And it provides capacity to conduct undetected espionage. Undetected espionage.Because of its economic and security implications, the race to 5G has elicited fierce competition among companies and governments around the world.5G is a national, strategic priority of China. The Chinese government has invested more than $400 billion in development. It has supported Chinese industry efforts in international standard setting bodies. It has allocated domestic spectrum for 5G. It has supported deployment of over 350,000 5G stations in China - which is nearly 10 times as many as are deployed in the United States.Huawei alone has grown its global revenue from $28 billion in 2009, to $107 billion in 2018. One year ago, Huawei held 28 percent of the global telecommunications market, up four percent from 2015 alone. Today, 59 percent of all handsets sold in India are Chinese made.However, the root of our concerns with Chinese companies like Huawei is not their growth, but requirements placed on them by the Chinese government.According to a recent letter from Admirals Stavridis, Breedlove, Locklear, Keating, General Clapper, and General Alexander, Chinas 2017 intelligence law requires all Chinese companies to support, assist, and cooperate with the security services of Chinas one-party state. The letter further states, The Chinese cyber security law and other national strategies like Military-Civil Fusion mean that nothing Chinese firms do can be independent of the state. Firms must support the law enforcement, intelligence and national security interests of the Chinese Communist Party a system fundamentally antithetical to the privacy and security of Chinese citizens and all those using Chinese networks overseas.So, exactly what does that mean? I think thats a crucial question in this because this is so big. Ive visited China for 40 years. Assuming the interpretation of this law is correct, I find this deeply troubling and I think every nation ought to think long and hard about the consequences of opening their internal telecommunications networks to this kind of data extraction and potential espionage. So we need to lead, but with caution.As a member of the Intelligence Committee for a long time nowand other members of this committee join me in thatI really view, Mr. Chairman, this hearing as just a beginning. This is revolutionary and we must note well all its aspects.Load-Date: May 16, 2019End of Document

Can you be gay online in China? Social media companies aren't sureCNN WireApril 17, 2019 Wednesday 8:48 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 819 wordsByline: Analysis by James Griffiths, CNNDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyEditor's note: James Griffiths is a Senior Producer for CNN International and author of "The Great Firewall of China: How to Build and Control an Alternative Version of the Internet."HONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Weibo can't seem to get it right. After apparently censoring a popular hashtag related to LGBT issues, the Chinese social network restored access Tuesday following a major backlash from users. That backlash saw Weibo filled with rainbow flags, while related hashtags attracted millions of views and posts. In many ways, it was a repeat of what happened last year, when Weibo launched a campaign to "clean up" the platform, including the removal of all gay-themed cartoons and videos --- along with pornographic and violent material --- to comply with Chinese laws and regulations.The Twitter-like service, which boasts nearly 400 million active users, had to backtrack then too after an uproar from activists and ordinary users. Both incidents show just how difficult it can be for even some of China's largest internet companies to toe the government's ever-moving line on what is permitted on the internet. A spokesman for Weibo did not respond to CNN's request for comment for this article. Great FirewallWhile there are some hard and fast rules for what content is banned in China --- pornography, separatism, terrorism, for example --- for the most part companies are expected to regulate themselves. There is no comprehensive blacklist of sensitive topics, so companies, and their legions of censors, must second-guess whether individual posts or discussions are to be allowed, based on their interpretation of public pronouncements and campaigns. "Due to the lack of transparency in censorship decisions by the Chinese government and Chinese social media companies, we won't be able to really know who was behind the censorship and then the reversal," Yaqiu Wang, a researcher at Human Rights Watch and expert on Chinese media, told CNN. She said that a vague clause in the recently passed Cybersecurity Law, on respecting "social morality," may "have driven Weibo to censor LGBT content." The general lack of certainty about what they're supposed to police often leads companies to err on the side of caution, fearing potentially ruinous punishments for failing to censor something they should have. Last year, Quora-style question and answer service Zhiyu was removed from app stores for a week "due to lax supervision and the spread of illegal information," according to a leaked censorship directive. Other companies have faced major fines and suspensions in the past. But taking the initiative on censorship can also get companies in trouble, as Weibo has learned twice now. While the Chinese government has stepped up restrictions on the country's LGBT community in recent months, there has been no official directive --- yet --- that anything to do with gay or lesbian issues should be censored. This appears to have left Weibo stuck between its young, more liberal users, and the old, conservative men who run the Communist Party, unsure of who to please and running the risk of angering both. Crackdown? Weibo's brief censorship of LGBT content is not the first sign that official attitudes may be hardening.Homosexuality is not illegal in China and the authorities removed it from the official list of mental disorders in 2001. But in recent years, the Communist government under President Xi Jinping has taken an increasingly hardline stance on LGBT rights, banning portrayal of same-sex relationships on television and online.In March, most mentions of homosexuality were removed from "Bohemian Rhapsody," the award-winning biopic of British rock band Queen's frontman Freddie Mercury, prior to its release in China. Among the clips that were removed were scenes of men kissing and the word "gay" for the Chinese audience.According to the South China Morning Post, several LGBT organizations, including the Guangzhou Gender and Sexuality Education Centre, have been shut down in recent months. Speaking to the Financial Times before the Weibo ban was rolled back, a spokesman for the Beijing LGBT Centre predicted that "China's censorship of LGBT content will be ever more strict this year compared to last year." Wang, the HRW researcher, saw two reasons for the government's apparent hostility to LGBT issues. "The Communist Party wants to assert itself as the only moral authority in Chinese society and dictate ... what is not for the public to consume, often in the name of national security and social stability," she said.The Chinese government considers independent civil society groups and organized protests as threats to its rule, Wang added. "It certainly does not want to see China's LGBT community becoming more empowered through online organizing."CNN's Steven Jiang contributed reporting.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Questions and answers to understand the Huawei caseCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 20, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1340 wordsBody       Huawei Technologies, one of China's largest global companies, is increasingly in the sights of the US Government and its Western allies as it is trying to play a leading role in the new mobile telecommunications network, known as 5G. The telecommunications giant faces multiple battles, including the arrest of its financial administrator in Canada, criminal charges in the United States and the prospect of being barred from buying US components and away from new infrastructure projects around the world. This struggle comes at a time when the commercial war between the United States and China intensifies, in which Chinese technology has been the special ghost of President Donald Trump.  Why the US have a problem with Huawei?  What did the Trump administration do?  Why does the equipment matter?  What does Huawei say?  What happened to Meng?  Are there other cases?  Is Huawei really a giant?  Are there more Chinese companies under pressure? Why the US have a problem with Huawei? The company has benefited from special treatment in China, and US government officials and industry managers in the country have raised suspicions that Huawei works in the interests of the Chinese government. A report published by the US government intelligence services in 2012 classified Huawei and ZTE as potential security threats, saying there is no evidence to alleviate fears that these companies are subject to political pressure in their home country. This report also noted that Huawei refused to describe the "fully dedicated to the military" of Ren Zhengfei, a former Chinese Army engineer who founded Huawei in 1987. Concerns about Huawei led the US Government to block OPA hostile move that Broadcom (of Singapore) launched in 2018 over US chipmaker Qualcomm. An operation that, if put into effect, could cut US investment in the mobile chips and telecommunications sector, delivering world leadership in this area to Huawei.  back to index What did the Trump administration do? It cut off Huawei's ability to sell equipment in the United States and, more significantly, buy components from its US-based suppliers. He advanced with executive action and, on May 17, added Huawei to the Commerce Department's blacklist, which compels US companies tolicense to sell products to Huawei. Qualcomm, Intel, Google and other companies quickly began to freeze the supply of software and key components for Huawei, calling into question the ability of the Chinese company to manufacture its products. This action may delay the development of 5G networks around the world and lead several countries to opt for the more expensive equipment of other companies such as Nokia and Ericsson.  back to index Why does the equipment matter? The US government - like China and other countries - is wary of using foreign technology in its vital communications because of fears that equipment manufacturers leave an open door that will allow intelligence services in their countries to access information . Or that the companies themselves take over sensitive information. Vodafone found vulnerabilities in Huawei equipment provided to the Italian market between 2009 and 2011. Although it is difficult to confirm whether these vulnerabilities were purposeful (and therefore perverse) or minor (and therefore accidental) errors, the news represented a blow to the reputation of the Chinese company. US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said the country may not share intelligence with its NATO partners if they use equipment from Huawei. Still, some of these countries, such as France and Germany, took the scenario out of preventing Huawei from participating in the construction of its 5G networks, mainly because of the lower price.  back to index What does Huawei say? It has repeatedly denied that it helps Beijing to spy on other governments or companies. And he notes that no one has ever provided evidence to support such charges. The company, which claims to be owned by Ren and several workers through a union, has begun in recent years to disclose financial information, increased the marketing budget and involved foreign media in an effort to increase transparency. In January, Ren, a very secretive CEO, talked about the challenges the company faces, including the arrest of CFO Meng Wanzhou, who is his daughter. Despite denouncing pride in his military career and joining the Communist Party, Ren has refused to serve Beijing or that Huawei illegally obtains information from its customers. In March, Huawei left for the attack, filing a lawsuit in federal court over a bill that bars US agencies from using their equipment. He also criticized the restrictions he faces for doing business in the US, calling them "irrational."  back to index What happened to Meng? She was arrested in Vancouver on December 1, at the request of the United States, which filed a formal extradition request in the context of a criminal case, claiming that the Huawei CFO conspired to defraud the banks that unwittingly allowed transactions with Iran, which violated US sanctions. Meng and the company deny any misconduct. The manager, who is also vice president of Huawei, has filed a lawsuit against Canada for illegal detention. She was released on bail December 11, currently living in a luxury home in Vancouver while the courts decide her fate. His residence is in Shenzhen, city where Huawei is based.  come backto index Are there other cases? Yes, and many years ago. In 2003, Cisco Systems sued Huawei for allegedly infringing its patents and illegally copying computer code from routers and other equipment. Huawei has removed the code from its products and services and the case has been terminated. But there are more cases where the Chinese company was accused of stealing intellectual property from other US companies. Motorola sued the company in 2010 for allegedly conspiring with former company employees to steal trade secrets.  Both parties reached agreement later. In 2017 a jury found in court that Huawei was responsible for the theft of technology to T-Mobile US and on January 28 the Justice Department accused the company of stealing secret information related to this case. Meanwhile, Poland (a loyal US ally) has arrested a Huawei worker on suspicion of espionage for the Chinese government. Huawei dismissed the worker and denied any involvement in the allegations.  back to index Is Huawei really a giant? In just three decades, she switched from an electronic vendor to one of the world's largest private companies with leadership positions in the telecommunication equipment, smartphone, cloud computing and cyber security segments. It is present in Asia, Europe and Africa. By 2019, it has a revenue target of $ 125 billion, more than a year earlier for companies like Home Depot and Boeing. It has applied billions of dollars in the development of 5G and is now one of the Chinese companies with the highest number of patents. He has collaborated in the construction of 5G networks in more than 10 countries and estimates to do the same in another 20 by 2020. In a direct threat to Qualcomm, Huawei is developing its own semiconductors. The Kerin series of mobile processors, made through its subsidiary HiSilicon, competes directly with Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips, which equip handsets from Samsung and other handset manufacturers around the world. Kunpeng, who is also from Huawei, is threatening Intel's dominance of servers.  back to index Are there more Chinese companies under pressure? Yes. ZTE almost collapsed after the Commerce Department stopped the company from buying US technology for three months. The Justice Department indicted China's state-owned Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit, its Taiwanese counterpart and three people stealing secret information from Micron Technology. On the same day, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the US government would allocate more resources to combat the threat of "Chinese economic espionage."  Original text: How Huawei Became a Target for Governments back to the index Load-Date: May 20, 2019End of Document

This, as public hearings are beginning this morning on new China tariffs in Washington.Boeing startling admission, the CEO Dennis Muilenburg says his company did, in fact, make a mistake, in its handling of the cockpit warning system, the problem before those deadly crashes, plus, the latest on the FAA flight trials of the 737 Max jet.Trouble at Target to report, the retail giant, hit with a nationwide register outage, what Target is blaming for the glitch. Plus, Elon Musk's new eyebrow-raising tweet, find out what he's changed his Twitter handle to, this time.A lot right now, right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.And we are coming to you what is being called the most creative week of the year where marketers and media companies come together for Cannes Lions. We're talking about branding and rebranding.Markets are higher, take a look at Futures this morning, as we kick off a new week, Dow Futures up 28 points, S&P Futures up 3 and a quarter, and the NASDAQ Futures right now, up 16-1/2 points.Looking like a firmer tone to the start of trading this Monday morning. The office of the U.S. Trade representative will begin public hearings today on President Trump's plan to slap an additional $300 billion-dollar worth of Chinese goods with tariffs.We've got new FOX News poll showing that 45 percent of those surveyed, feel that tariffs on imports from other countries will hurt the U.S. economy.Joining right now is the Editor-at-Large for the Wall Street Journal, Gerry Baker. Gerry, it's great to see you --GERRY BAKER, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Thank you, Maria. Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: -- in this beautiful spot, by the way.BAKER: Not a bad place to be.BARTIROMO: All right. You are just back from Hong Kong, let's start there.BAKER: Yes.BARTIROMO: What did you see in terms of -- and what did you get in terms of unrest, sentiment from the people, after those incredible pictures that we have been looking at?BAKER: So, it's remarkable, Maria, you know, we had these protests last week, against the bill introduced by the government. Remember, the government is essentially appointed by China, even though Hong Kong has a large degree of independence, the Chinese government appoints the chief executive.That chief executive wants to introduce a law that would make it easy for people in Hong Kong to be extradited to China. That terrifies the people in Hong Kong. They came out an incredible numbers last week and they actually managed, as a result of those protests, to get the chief executive to back down and she said to suspend implementation of this bill or the (INAUDIBLE) bill.Now, it's not over yet, Maria, and you saw the protests were back out on the street, protesters were back out on the street again, yesterday on Sunday. Because they don't believe it's over. They don't believe she has withdrawn the bill and they want to see her go.BARTIROMO: Well, this is what I thought was a really interesting point because I actually have a very good friend in Hong Kong, right now, and he took a picture of the protest from his hotel room. We have that picture. It's actually quite extraordinary. But this is after they said that they weren't going to do that extradition bill.BAKER: Right. They have -- again, they -- because the government has said it's going to suspend the bill for a period of consultations. The chief executive apologized to the Hong Kong people. But they crucially haven't withdrawn the bill, and they haven't said they won't get rid of it.And people are -- look, China is a big, powerful country that has enormous influence in Hong Kong, and people still fear that as long as this chief executive is in place, and as long as she is there, doing China's bidding, ultimately, whether it's this bill or something else, the Hong Kong people will not the freedoms that they were promised, when Hong Kong was handed back to China, after 150 years of British rule.BARTIROMO: That's exactly right.BAKER: So, they are still protesting and (INAUDIBLE) to go on.BARTIROMO: So, as much as, you know, Xi Jinping tells us don't think you understand what the Chinese want. Don't tell me what my people want. I think now we're beginning to understand where the Chinese people feel -- how they feel.BAKER: That's a really good -- I think that's a really good point, Maria, because, yes, we saw -- look, 30 years ago, Tiananmen Square, we've just seen the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre when Chinese authorities killed hundreds of protesters and killed that protest movement for Chinese democracy.This is the last hope, in a way, in China, for people who believe that China can be different. That China doesn't have to be authoritarian and repressive, but ultimately, maybe China can enjoy the freedoms that we in the west, enjoy.So, it is really important that you've got -- there are 7 million people in Hong Kong, 1 million of them came out on the streets last week.BARTIROMO: That's unbelievable.BAKER: Imagine a 7th of the U.S. population that would be 45, 50 million people coming out onto the streets to protest something. So that does tell you exactly, you're exactly right. There is this powerful hunger for democratic freedom and for reform which won't be unnoticed by Chinese government.BARTIROMO: And this is exactly what Chinese government cannot afford, the unrest, the people rising. I'm wondering if this is ultimately going to help Donald Trump and help with the U.S.' relationship with China and the potential dealWe've got these new FOX News polls that I want to show you. They say 57 percent of Americans are optimistic about the U.S. economy, and that's a positive, but they're also feeling uneasy about the tariffs, so what do you think this unrest in Hong Kong means, for a deal between the U.S. and China?BAKER: Well, it's interesting. I spoke to -- when I was in Hong Kong, I spoke to a lot of people there, and they are cautious about the relationship between the U.S. and China. They would like to see the U.S. take a (INAUDIBLE) and by the way, I think we will see that.Vice President Mike Pence is due to give a speech next week, a major speech (INAUDIBLE) speech he gave last November, where he called for China to make big important reforms not only to its economy, to its society. And I think the Trump administration will press hard on that.It's hard at the moment -- the government -- the administration -- the Trump administration doesn't want to tie human rights indirectly to the issue of tariffs. It wants to keep the economic issue separate for understandable reasons.It seems, you know, that you don't want to complicate that and make, by the way, what demands that China will find difficult to meet. It wants to keep the demands to the economics sphere, but there's no question that this political unrest in the background is there, and it's part of the administration's case that China needs to change.BARTIROMO: It's interesting because while the President may not tie the two together and maybe the vice president either, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been talking a about human rights.BAKER: Right.BARTIROMO: And he's been talking about some of the issues like the rounding up of the Uyghurs, you know, in China. We've got a recent Wall Street Journal survey which finds most economists think that the Federal Reserve is going to cut rates, coming up.Let's switch topics and talk the Fed, for a second, nearly 40 percent of the 46 economists asked, say it will happen in July, 30 percent say in September.BAKER: Right.BARTIROMO: We've got a Fed meeting this week, Tuesday and Wednesday. We will hear what the Fed has to say in terms of the language of what it's expecting for the rest of the year. Where do you see it?BAKER: Well, now, those two things, China tariffs and the Fed are very much tied together. It's a very interesting situation. The markets are nervous about this tariff war for understandable reasons. And you quoted that FOX News poll at the beginning. A lot of Americans are concerned.They think it'll hit them hard as consumers when they have to pay additional tariffs (INAUDIBLE) all the concern that'll damage the U.S. economy.So what the markets are hoping is if that trade war does continue, that the Fed will come to the rescue, the Fed will, if the economy weakens, it looks like it might, the Fed will cut rates, now, I don't think people are expecting a rate cut this week.BARTIROMO: Right.BAKER: Very few people expect that. Our survey, the Wall Street Journal survey said, as you say, a majority now of the economist expect that there will be a rate cut soon, probably next month.We don't think in June, but probably in July, and almost certainly in September, so rates, having been rising for the last three years, look like they're going to start coming down and that will be valuable for the U.S. if it is going to slow down partly, as a result of this trade war.BARTIROMO: But Gerry, how extraordinary is this, I mean, six months ago, we're talking about raising rates and unwinding the balance sheet and it's a complete 360 on the Feds course. And if we are looking at the vibrancy that we talk about every day, why do we need a rate? I mean, you just had 3.1 percent growth in the first quarter, 3.6 percent unemployment, 50-year low.BAKER: Yes. It's a good point, Maria. Look, the concern is going -- is looking forward. As you said, the economy has been robust, the last year and a half, slightly weak growth in the -- in the first quarter, but we've done pretty -- we're stronger at the first quarter before we're going to have some weaker growth in the second quarter.The economy is in reasonable shape. But as people look forward and they see this trade war. They see weakness in Europe. They see some weakness in parts of Asia. They see geopolitical concerns. There is nervousness. But you're absolutely right, Maria, the economy has been bolstered by low interest rates for a long time. The Feds only raised interest rates even as though it's been raising for three years.Interest rates, short-term Fed interest rates have already got to 2-1/2 percent. That's a remarkably low level for them to start thinking about cutting rates.So, I think one of the worries that a lot of people have is beyond this immediate trade issue, beyond the immediate economic weakness of the economy is, how dependent is the economy on this continued stimulus, this continued injection of demand from low interest rates and from the Federal Reserve.What does that say about the underlying strength of the economy? And I think that's a cause of concern.BARTIROMO: have you been able to gage anybody here while you're here in Cannes, and the chief marketing officers that you're, no doubt, talking to, who are all present here. Saw the largest companies in the world, Unilever, Coca-Cola, you know, and we've got a number of them on the show, this week, if they're going to increase spending?BAKER: Yes.BARTIROMO: The CapEx spending, the spending by corporations, that's one of the major indicators of the economic growth.BAKER: Right. No, they are planning -- yes, they are planning to increase spending. The advertising spending will increase. The big issue is going to be on people's minds here, and you'll be talking about this all week.I'm sure things like data privacy -- that is a real concern because advertising has been thriving on the kind of data ability that company like Facebook and Google have, to direct advertising direct advertising -- directly to people, based on the kind of data that they provided.As we get much tighter protections for data privacy, advertisers are going to have a harder time finding a way directly through to the consumers, so they're worried about that. They're worried about -- and they're interested in the regulation that we're probably going see Facebook and Google, the antitrust --BARTIROMO: Good point. Yes.BAKER: But as you say (INAUDIBLE) optimistic, especially about the U.S. The U.S., they continue to spend, they continue to see reasonably strong prospects for growth in the next six months.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there, great insights as always, Gerry.BAKER: Thanks, Maria. Thank you for having me.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Gerry Baker is the Editor-at-Large of the Wall Street Journal.An admission from Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, meanwhile, Lauren Simonetti with headlines this morning in New York, Lauren, good morning to you.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Hey, Maria, good morning. Muilenburg, acknowledging his company made a "mistake" in handling the cockpit warning system in 737 Max jets before two deadly crashes. Speaking ahead of the Paris Air Show, he said Boeing's communication was not consistent and that's unacceptable.He's promising transparency as Boeing tries to get the grounded jets back in the air. The Federal Aviation Administration could start flight trials of proposed 737 Max safety enhancements as early as this week.More protests in Hong Kong, a day after an estimated 2 million people, look at that, took to the streets for a second Sunday of demonstrations, protesters calling on the city's leader to resign, despite Carrie Lam's decision to suspend a controversial extradition bill.Hong Kong activist, Joshua Wong, joining the protesters after his release from prison, he did serve half of the two-month sentence related to protest back in 2014, advocating a more democratic elections process. The protests start creating a new battle front for Beijing, as they deal with trade tensions.And this, Elon Musk, taking to Twitter, saying he has deleted his Twitter account, well, as it turns out, his Twitter account still exists, alive and well, but it does have a new user name, Daddy DotCom. Maria, we have no explanation on that one, so far, back to you. Daddy DotCom.BARTIROMO: That's hilarious.SIMONETTI: I know.BARTIROMO: Daddy DotCom, all right, so there you go. And I'm glad you used that picture. That was from my friend who took the picture from his hotel room that you just showed, from Hong Kong. That was incredible. Those -- and this is after, as Gerry Baker just told us, after they put the extradition bill on the side. And there is the shot, a million people, or close to it, in the streets of Hong Kong.We will take a short break. When we come back, we are looking at the Huawei threat. Facebook, the latest U.S. company to push back against Huawei, the Chinese technology giant, banning their ads. That's coming up next.And then outage -- outrage over outage, Target trying to recover from a tech troubled weekend, more on that right after this. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Big program this morning, live from Cannes, France here. Coming up, former Senior Advisor to President George W. Bush, FOX News Contributor, Karl Rove is with us this morning, along with the Chairman of Laffer Associates, former Reagan Economic Advisor, Art Laffer joining us this morning, along with FOX News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.The Founder and CEO of MediaLink, Michael Kassan is with us this morning, along with Verizon Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, Diego Scotti, joining us here. Plus, U.S. Soccer Hall of Famer and FOX Sports Soccer Analyst, Alexi will join us, Alexi Lalas. Don't miss a moment of it. We have a big three hours coming up right here.And we want to turn to the threat from Huawei, we've been talking about this for weeks now, and the latest company to pushback is Facebook. Facebook is blocking ads from Huawei, under rules banning foreign entities from buying political advertisements. Facebook says the ads were, "related to politics and issue issues of national importance."Meanwhile, Huawei is cutting revenue expectations for this year and next, amid the pressure from the United States. Huawei's American chip suppliers are quietly pressing the government to ease up on the ban on sales.Joining the conversation this morning to talk more about all of that, FOX Business Network's Cheryl Casone, is in New York, along with PWC Partner, Mitch Roschelle. Good morning you two.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Morning.MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC: Good morning.CASONE: Looks gorgeous, Maria, out there.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's beautiful out here. And I'll tell you, I didn't realize the big subject that Huawei telecom is having across the world, and I wonder (INAUDIBLE) and a continuation of U.S. companies taking a second look at this situation and possibly pulling out, is going to change the conversation in terms of pushing Huawei to act differently. What do you think?CASONE: Good for Facebook, Maria. I'm really glad to see them actually pushing back, I mean, this is a company that's been so absolutely punished for not monitoring its content, which I think it's a good thing that they're actually pushing back against Huawei and these advertisements, which frankly, were very political in nature, and frankly, full of lies.BARTIROMO: Well, you know, we have evidence that this company has settled trade lawsuits with a number of American companies, Mitch, you know that, you know, whether it's Motorola, T-Mobile, Cisco, Microsoft, we've seen lawsuits settled, so it's hard to say that there wasn't any, you know, trade theft.ROSCHELLE: Yes.BARTIROMO: Trade secret theft.ROSCHELLE: No question about it. It's all, to use one of my kids' terms, a little sketchy, in terms of their business operations.But the thing about Huawei that's interesting is it's hard to tell whether or not some of their struggles, right now, are falling demand, because of China's slowing economy, because that is their largest market, or if it's really the trade war with the United States over allowing chip manufacturers to supply raw materials to them. That's not really clear. And that's something that I'd love to get to the bottom of.BARTIROMO: Actually, that's a really good point. Now, there's this article from China Daily, they wrote an article based on my last interview, last week, with the chief security officer at Huawei, Andy Purdy, and this is what it's titled, Huawei once again shows good will.In it, the author says, it should be noted that although Huawei is willing to undergo a government investigation, that does not mean one is justified. Exactly as the video of Purdy's interview shows the security concerns the U.S. keeps raising about Huawei, are groundless. Here's what Purdy told me when I asked him about those security concerns last week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Let me ask you this, because you're pointing to reports of things that the U.S. has said and these companies have said about Huawei, like the Vodafone report. Have you actually seen the actual documents that the United States has shown our allies, in terms of the natural security risk? Have you seen those documents, Andy?ANDY PURDY, CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER, HUAWEI: No. Those have been provided at the highest security level, but I assure you that they have not provided evidence of significant cybersecurity wrong doing in that classified material or the allies would have backed the United States.BARTIROMO: You have not -- so, Andy Purdy, you have not -- you're the security officer, you've not seen those documents.PURDY: Those are classified documents under U.S. government classification. No, of course, I haven't seen them.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: I could come -- I could come back at that and say look, if you haven't seen the documents, how do you know that there hasn't been any theft?CASONE: You know, well, look, there's -- I found something else in the China Daily write-up on your interview with Andy Purdy, I found this very, kind of, offensive, to be honest with you, the way that they characterize it. But they said that he pushed back against all of your false accusations, Maria, that they steal data and back door in their products.I really -- when I read this over the weekend, I was actually angry, Maria. It was -- did they not watch the interview?BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, look, it's -- this is a fact that an executive at Vodafone found a back door in their infrastructure, with Huawei infrastructure, they found a back door that all of the data goes back to China, to the Chinese government, and they raised their hand and actually Huawei changed it, and they rectified it, and they closed that back door.So, this is not just made-up. These are facts. It's also factual that Huawei has settled lawsuits with the list of companies that I just mentioned, Microsoft, Cisco, Motorola, T-Mobile.CASONE: Yes. And also the fact that you mentioned this at the top of the segment, Maria, of the U.S. companies that are now quietly lobbying through the commerce through their own trade groups to try and get the U.S. to ease these sanctions. But I'm sorry, but how many times has Secretary of State Mike Pompeo come on the show and told you that they are national security threat?BARTIROMO: That's right. Yes. Yes, I mean, there are national security issues here, and that's, I think, what this President has been trying to communicate, and businesspeople are increasingly seeing it as well. We'll talk more about all of this, thanks, you guys.We'll take a short break, when we come back, we are watching the price of oil this morning, prices pulling back as the tanker attack in the Gulf, forces shipping firms to tighten security, we'll take a look at that.And then, left in the dark, tens of millions of people affected by nationwide blackouts in South America, the hunt for the cause, straight ahead, back in a moment. Live from Cannes, this morning. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, on the beach and in the boardroom, here at Cannes Lions, a closer look at the ever-changing landscape, especially with big technology, joining me right now is the founder and CEO of MediaLink, Michael Kassan, and Michael, it's great to have you, thank you so much for joining us.MICHAEL KASSAN, FOUNDER AND CEO, MEDIALINK: It's a pleasure and beyond the new Cannes.BARTIROMO: Exactly, thank you so much. We're thrilled to be here, and this is your baby. I mean, you've been doing this a long time, right?KASSAN: Well, it's 20 years, plus or minus that we've been coming, and kind of building a conference around something that was and continues to be focused on creativity, at its core. But we were believers at MediaLink early on, that creativity can manifest itself not only in the story telling, but in the media, and in the business of storytelling and the business of creative.BARTIROMO: Absolutely. And I just did a panel with a number of chief marketing officers and this is exactly what they said. It's about storytelling. And so, here we are, this year, in a backdrop that has evolved quite a bit. Now, we're talking about technology regulation, potentially. We're talking about Washington, getting more involved in the tech playing field.What's the sense on that, do you think, that the marketers here, the large companies who were using marking are expecting that we'll see heavier regulation on technology platforms?KASSAN: Yes, I do think so. And I think people will welcome it, but it's got to be managed in the right way. You know, something that I've been saying for quite some time, as we're on the precipice of regulation on a global basis, we need to make certain that the regulation doesn't overreach and overreact.You know, I think those of us who understood it would say Sarbanes-Oxley in financial services was an overcorrection to Enron. What we shouldn't have is an overcorrection in regulation, nobody wants that. What people really want is proper regulation and managing the sheer size and influence of the platforms and the media companies that they have become, so that's what we need to find.It's kind of -- it's kind of Goldilocks, you don't want it to be too hot, you don't want it to be cold or too cold, you want it to be just right, to find that niche that protects the consumer, but doesn't overregulate the platform.BARTIROMO: Well, you know what, because today, these companies are more powerful and bigger than a lot of people even expected.KASSAN: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: And so, just their size alone, and their influence has, you know, when you're big, you get the eye of government.KASSAN: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: And we saw that, years ago with Microsoft, right?KASSAN: Exactly.BARTIROMO: Let me -- let me ask you about consumers having so much choice today, the distribution is bigger and more than we've ever seen, and yet the direct consumer model, is something that's very important for the industry, whether you're advertising, marketing, or tech.KASSAN: Absolutely. And if you look at marketplace and you think of some of the upstart brands that have been created and you understand what's happening in the entertainment industry with what we call over the top, the OTT markets, and how do you market those, and how do you get the subscriptions to be acquired.It's a different sort of marketing. It's more performance and precision marketing, less about warm and fuzzy storytelling. You still need the data to infuse your decisions on storytelling, but it's a different muscle to directly market to a consumer than it is to do the traditional marketing channels.And you take a look at brands like Peloton or Casper mattresses, or people like this, they create a Warby Parker, where people are buying glasses in a different way. That's all about changing that paradigm and going direct to the consumer. And it takes different muscle memory, as I say. And number one, it takes a better understanding and utilization of data.BARTIROMO: Is that what consumers want? Consumers want to be talking to the brand and the company direct, and how do you do that? You do that through social media?KASSAN: You do it through social media, but now, you can, again, reach that consumer directly and have that conversation that you could never have before.BARTIROMO: I love it.KASSAN: You talk to the consumer package goods companies, and you know, they say that -- you look at a Procter & Gamble or Unilever.BARTIROMO: or Georgia-Pacific.KASSAN: Or Georgia-Pacific. They touch billions of consumers on a daily basis. They touch them. Now, they can actually talk to them.BARTIROMO: Yes, and they're tweaking their marketing to be able to make sure to reach those unreachable, like young people --KASSAN: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: -- women, et cetera, more to come on this subject, great to see you, Michael.KASSAN: Pleasure.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Best wishes for a great week.KASSAN: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Here in Cannes, Michael Kassan, joining us, MediaLink. Coming up, we've got more to talk about the race to 5G, what Verizon is claiming about the rollout and cybersecurity, coming up. And then box office bummer, a sluggish weekend of sequels, underwhelming audiences, the numbers when we come right back. Stay with us.ANNOUNCER: Here again is Maria Bartiromo, with the special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA, Live from France at the 2019 Cannes Lions.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, it is Monday, June 17th, live this morning from Cannes. Thank you for joining us it is 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.Future is pointing to a higher opening this morning. For stock prices, let's take a look at markets here as we take a look at the beginning of a week where the Federal Reserve will have a two-day meeting.Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading of 19 points on the Dow, of two points on the S&P, and the NASDAQ up 11-1/2. Friday, markets ended the day down slightly but they were up for the week. In Europe this morning, European indices are there's Friday's close with the Dow down 17 and the S&P down four. NASDAQ was down 40 points. European Indices this morning a mixed. As you see, the FT-100 is down 3-1/2 points but the CAC Quarante is up 12. And the DAX Index in Germany is hired by nine.In Asia overnight, markets are mostly higher with the exception of Korea. As you see here, the best performer -- well, it was real fractional moves, but the best performer actually was Hong Kong despite those protests.In Hong Kong, government offices are closed following the massive protests in the streets. Yesterday, which we share to the pictures earlier. Facebook is banning Huawei ads. Coming up, Connell McShane is live from China. Is an inside look at the Chinese telecom giant and its troubles that it is facing. That's at 8:00 a.m. Eastern, right here on mornings with Maria.Attacks on oil tankers meanwhile, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo insisting that Iran is behind last week's attacks. Security is tightening on the Gulf of Oman. What the growing tensions could mean for oil prices? Coming up.Massive power outages to report. Major blackouts hitting millions in Argentina and Uruguay. A cyberattack not being ruled out.And there is trouble at Target this morning. The retail giant hit with a nationwide register outage. What Target is blaming for that glitch?All those stories coming up this Monday morning. But first, we're looking at the 5G revolutions. Swedish telecom maker, Ericsson, out with a new report. Finding that 45 percent of the world's population will have access to 5G technology by the Year 2024.Earlier this year I sat down with the CEOs of both AT&T and Verizon. And ask them about their company's investments in 5G. What the technology means for consumers? Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HANS VESTBERG, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS: BARTIROMO: Right now, I don't think you could get an iPhone with 5G. I mean, 5G is not there yet.(CROSSTALK)RANDALL STEPHENSON, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AT&T: Correct. In fact, there already 5G -- what are called, full 5g phones available in the market. We will have some in the market this year. Samsung and some others are putting some phones into the market. We'll be selling those and you can get a full 5G experience.VESTBERG: When we're going to have the 5G ultra-wideband zones where you're going to be into. You're going to have 10x throughput in speeds.And, of course, you're going to ask me, what are only going to be the use - - new use cases? Remember when 4G came, we didn't know. I can tell you there are so many people on smartphones when they will have 5G, with those capabilities, they're going to innovate a lot of new services.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And joining me right now is Verizon executive vice president and chief marketing officer Diego Scotti. Diego, it's great to have you on the program.DIEGO SCOTTI, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, VERIZON: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. So, what are you seeing in terms of this expected roll out in 5G? How do you prepare for that?SCOTTI: Well, we are already in the middle of it. Verizon was first in the U.S., first in the world to launch 5G. First with 5G homes, so, broadband to the home. And now with mobility, by the end of this year, we will be in now 30 cities in the U.S.BARTIROMO: Wow.SCOTTI: Which has launched the first device on 5G, the Samsung 10 5G. And we've seen a very good traction in terms of customers starting to understand and wanting to have 5G.BARTIROMO: What are you expecting to happen as a result of 5G? I mean, obviously, it's going to be much faster. Well, we'll all be able to access things faster and it will be more advanced. But what other implications should we expect from 5G?SCOTTI: I would say that where you going to see a tremendous amount of change is on the B2B space. Because a lot of the applications that we're talking about that 5G will impact -- would be applications that relate to how business do business faster and more in real-time. And also, when you think about the changes that 5G will enable in society.All the way from how will change healthcare, for example. With things like remote surgeries, for example, or smart cities. You know, when everybody was talking about cities all of a sudden will become smart, all of the sudden. Well, now with 5G will be possible. When you have, for example, cars talking to cell phone, self was talking to building.BARTIROMO: That's incredible.SCOTTI: And really realizing the smart city again.BARTIROMO: Do we need a whole new realignment of regulation as a result of that? I mean, how are we going to see smart cities, every appliance talking to -- I mean, that's also AI, right? Embedded in all of that.SCOTTI: Well, yes, it's obviously part of a lot of things today. But in here, what you're going to see is really a massive change in technology that is it's going to be put for good use, you know.BARTIROMO: Yes.SCOTTI: So, we all hope that between the private sector and the public sector, it will be a lot of cohesiveness in terms of how do we take it forward.BARTIROMO: Diego, one of the issues that I've been speaking with some chief marketing officers here is about reaching those audiences that are really hard to reach. So, as the CMO of Verizon, how do you design your marketing coming up with the marketing plan to get women involved, to get the underserved involved? What are you doing differently at Verizon?SCOTTI: Yes. Well, I think what is interesting is that there's been a little talk about -- if you remember a few years ago like everything is going to be digital. And definitely, digital is an area where people are spending a little more time specifically mobile, but so television. So, what you see is that if you want to have a modern marketing plan today, you really need to talk about everything that touches the customer today. From television to digital, and everything in between including experiences for example.BARTIROMO: So, Michael was just talking about direct to consumer. Is that were you referring to?SCOTTI: Totally, because brands -- the people wants to have direct contacts with brands. And also if you think about it, I always talk about marketers sometimes getting a little bit lazy. Because in order for you to connect with consumers, first of all, you need to have a message, content that consumer is really want to engage with as opposed to a lot of right now that happens, for example, with people wanted to block advertising when you talk about digital. Or even people when they buy services like -- you know, video on the online that they say, I don't want -- I don't want the one -- I don't want to pay extra for not having advertiser. So, we need to work extra hard in order to connect.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's interesting. Some of these little tweaks that you can do in your marketing. Like for example, someone was telling me, we just changed the voice-over from a male to a female. And that actually resonated. It seems like that's a simple thing.SCOTTI: When I tell you for us, the biggest change if you look at all of the marketing that we do today, all of the advertising that we go today, the biggest change is about real people telling real stories.So, 98 percent of our messages now are real people that -- I know that I want to steal your job, but we are being more marketers are becoming more like journalists.BARTIROMO: Yes.SCOTTI: In the sense of that we need to find those stories that ultimately because they are authentic, consumers will want to engage more.BARTIROMO: Well, I was just going to say that that's about authenticity.SCOTTI: Yes.BARTIROMO: Because the customer is so smart. They will see right through you if they think you're lying.SCOTTI: Exactly. Yes, I mean, we need to do a better job engaging audiences because -- you know, consumers now can see through everything they seen it, they seen it all. So, in terms of creativity and intensive authenticity that the body is really high.BARTIROMO: And this is like a huge across the world. What are we talking about? How many people have cell phones today? I mean, you're talking about 7 billion or something.SCOTTI: Well, you're talking about 99 percent of the population are having --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Yes.SCOTTI: You know, cellphones and growing especially in areas like Latin America and Africa. So, that little machine, that little computer has so power. They said that you know, one cellphone has more computing power than the Apollo 11 that went -- that went to the moon. Is that unbelievable. So --BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. Well, you've got an encyclopedia in your pocket.SCOTTI: Exactly, exactly.BARTIROMO: Diego, it's great to talk to you.SCOTTI: Thank you so much.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much.SCOTTI: Good to talk to you, take care.BARTIROMO: Diego Scotti, from Verizon, joining us there. Quick break, and then, a massive blackout in Argentina and Uruguay, the report leaving some 45 million people in the dark. Lauren Simonetti with the details there. Lauren, good morning.SIMONETTI: Maria, good morning. The blackout began with an electrical failure in a power grid serving both countries, bringing subway trains to a stop, interrupting water service and forcing businesses to close.The outage happening as people in Argentina were preparing to go to the polls for local elections. Delaying voting in several provinces. Now, power has largely been restored and investigation to the cause of the outages is now underway. Officials saying they cannot rule out a cyberattack.Well, Target crippled by outages across the country and internal technology issue, though a routine maintenance was to blame for customers being unable to check out for nearly two hours on Saturday.Then, some stores were unable to process credit card payments for another 90 minutes yesterday. Which turned out to be an issue at the data center of Target payment center. Target confirming there were no data breaches during either outage.Well, moviegoers may be feeling well, we'll call it franchise fatigue.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Catching up for my daily meditation. Time for lunch, I think, you're hungry?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's 9:30.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE), it's Tuesday's taco day.(END VIDEO CLIP)SIMONETTI: Men in Black International, Sony's latest film in the MIB franchise, earning just more than $28 million at the box office this week, and that was enough to make it number one, but it was just shy of industry expectations of $30 million.(INAUDIBLE) also bringing in lackluster results. The Warner Brothers remake of the 1971 classic finishing in 6th place with an estimated $8 million opening. The results follow another franchise disappointment. Dark Phoenix, the latest X-Men has made only $52 million so far. Well below the cost to make it, Maria.It was nice on Saturday. And then Father's Day yesterday. Maybe people just didn't go.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: I don't -- I don't understand what's going on with rocket man. I really want to see that. And it's not -- it's not showing the big numbers. So -- it's a -- we'll see.SIMONETTI: Yes, I heard it was great though.BARTIROMO: How it is?SIMONETTI: Me too.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Lauren. Coming up. Oil is in focus. Prices are pulling back this morning as the tanker attack in the Gulf of Oman forces shipping firms to tighten security and make new plans. We're going to tell you about that.Plus, one tough kid. An 11-year-old fought off a home invader with a machete. Wait until you hear this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Tensions in the gulf once again. Oil prices are pulling back this morning. We're going to take a look at the price right now as tensions are rising between the U.S. and Iran -- following attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. Joining us right now is former President of Shell Oil, John Hofmeister. And John, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks very much for joining us.JOHN HOFMEISTER, FORMER PRESIDENT, SHELL OIL: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: What is the impact of this unrest between the U.S. and Iran? Have you felt the -- the decline in oil on the global markets? From Iran as a result?HOFMEISTER: I think that that the real reason for the decline has more to do with anticipation of slower growth in the economy and the mischief in Middle East is not significant, enough nobody was killed, no ship was sunk. And so, therefore, so it categorized as mischief rather than something more deadly. And so, the tension between the U.S. and Iran is ongoing, I don't think anybody expects that to be resolved any time soon. So, it has a bit of a palliative affect but real issue is whether the economy is growing sufficiently strong to pull on the demand side enough to keep the prices up.BARTIROMO: All right, this is a really important point that you're making. You know, sometimes I look at the price of oil and I say, oh well, oil is at this level because it's reflecting a strong economy. Other times I look at price and say: well, wait a minute, the price is this high and it's going to cut into economic growth, so it depends on how you look at things. What do you think about broad economy right now? Is it slowing down and do you think that the market is telling us something that's true, that we need to be more focused on, that things are slowing down quite a bit?HOFMEISTER: I think apart from the U.S.; the market is not robust. Anywhere around the world, particularly because of China, because of slow growth in Europe, and I don't think that the developing world is coming on with enough capital spending to make a material difference as I watch things unfold. Having said that, I think that there is also a lot of supply coming in to the market not only now because of West Texas, North Dakota and other U.S. contributions for the export market from the U.S.But also, because other parts of the world. If you read about Exxon's exploration in Guiana, it gives you a very high confidence level in lots of oil yet to be produced. Some of the Gulf of Mexico efforts are going to bring lots of oil and then you have the L&G effort where lots and lots of L&G. So, I think we're in a period where there's sufficient energy in the world to supply economic growth to the world which is a good place to be.BARTIROMO: Yes, especially since we know that the U.S. is ultimately going to be one of the leading exporters as it is, as you said, L&G, but the leading producer in the world today. So, do you think longer-term, John, is it fair to expect that oil prices go lower, not higher, because of all of that supple?HOFMEISTER: I think they're going to balance out between the 50 and 70 range for quite a while. If you look at the Permian Basin economics, $50.00 a barrel is really not enough to both pay for future capital expenditure and to pay for borrowed money to keep drilling as rapidly as you need to drill because of the steady decline rates in the Permian Basin fields. That's an issue. There's a lot of people that are still experiencing negative cash in the Permian Basin at $50.00 a barrel.So, you really need something in mid-60s to $70.00 for that to pay off. We're a long way from there right now. So, that will slow down the Permian. When you look at offshore, offshore has such tremendous capital needs that you really need something higher than $50.00 for, you know, the deep-water drilling, for example. So, I don't think prices are at a sustainable point right now, they really need to get back up into the $60.00 to $70.00 range for the supply side to keep up with growth of the world.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a really important point that you just made I didn't realize the gulf required so much more capital spending. Thank you for that. John, it's great to see you this morning thanks so much.HOFMEISTER: Thank you.BARTIROMO: John Hofmeister, joining us there from Shell. Coming up one tough kid, here, how an 11-year-old thwarted off a would-be robber. We've got that right after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Headlines across America this morning, the state writing shark attack sends 8-year-old boy to the hospital, North Carolina officials say. Now, the boy was in ocean when the shark grabbed them by leg who reportedly suffered multiple puncture wounds but he is expected to make a full recovery. This is a third reported shark attack along the North Carolina coast this year.The News and Observer this morning writes this, burglary suspect caught had machete wound inflicted by boy. This is one tough 11-year-old turning tables on a burglar. Fighting off a the 19-year-old suspect with a machete. That suspect now charged with breaking and entering, second- degree kidnapping, interfering with emergency communications, and assault on a child under the age of 12.The Sun Sentinel this morning reports 633 divers set world record cleaning ocean floor off Deerfield Beach. Divers entered the ocean waves and had to stay it the water for at least 15 minutes to be counted. It's unclear how much trash was collected but apparently, 1600 pounds of led, fishing weights alone, were recovered -- the result of decades of anglers cutting bait.Cheryl and Mitch are in New York. You know, there's a real movement to clean our oceans and I know we talk a lot about plastics but it's nice to see this kind of effort.CASONE: Well, they also found signs from the dock; think of all the hurricanes that, you know, the Carolinas and Florida -- the State of Florida goes through; they found all kinds of things from that debris. But the (INAUDIBLE) thing is interesting because you're out there fishing and Mitch knows this. And then, all of a sudden you lose your fishing line and you forget that it's got to go somewhere.ROSCHELLE: There's probably a ton of anchor down there also. You know, after watching the U.S. Open over the weekend, they had a segment that they did -- like a package about all the golf balls that are found in the water right back the beach -- there could be some golf balls in that water too. But I suspect a lot of led -- a lot of anchors and fishing weight.CASONE: All those lost fish.BARTIROMO: We got a big week this week, you guys. Let me quickly get your take on what we're looking. We got a two-day fed meeting, Tuesday and Wednesday. You've got earnings, Oracle, Adobe, and then you've got those hearings today on the China tariffs from the U.S. Trade representative?CASONE: The public comments are going to be interesting because if we're going actually hear from American businesses, Maria, that are going say this could be good or bad for our businesses. And the polls show that Americans are nervous about it.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a good point. We'll be watching that. We'll take a short break. When we come back, we're looking at technology spending. Facebook looks for a boost and a reputation reboot as well. This is Apple's Tim Cook says technology needs to take responsibility for the chaos that they create. Next hour right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA live from Cannes Lion International Festival of Creativity back in a moment.Load-Date: June 17, 2019End of Document

Happy Wednesday, and good morning, everyone, thanks for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it its Wednesday, May 12th.We have breaking news this morning, unrest on the streets of Hong Kong, police firing tear gas and rubber bullets, as thousands of people protest against the proposed extradition law. We will take you there, live, to Hong Kong coming up, right now.Then, taking action over China tariffs, Google and Nintendo are moving production, some production out of China. Foxconn says it is ready to move iPhone production if needed.Plus, Joe Biden flips his stance on China and it comes as he and President Trump trade attacks on the campaign trail. Wait until you see what he said he could do if he becomes president.Investors on edge this morning, Futures pointing to another day of losses on Wall Street, take a look, Futures indicating a decline of about 80 points, a third of a percent on the Dow, S&P down 9, and the NASDAQ down 40.This after the Dow snapped a six day winning streak yesterday, with a loss fractional, but down 14 points on the Dow, 1 point lower on the S&P and not even a point lower on the NASDAQ, two-thirds of one point.Global markets this morning, look like this, in Europe, declines across the board, FT-100 down 48, two-thirds of a percent, CAC Quarante in Paris down 35, two-thirds of a percent, DAX Index in Germany, lower by 56. And in Asia overnight, markets were lower there as well. The Hang Seng, the worst performer, amid the protests.I want to get right to the breaking news this morning, those mass protests in Hong Kong. Connell McShane is live in Hong Kong with the very latest.CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Hey there, Maria. It's been a very tense Wednesday here in Hong Kong, as we move into the evening hours, especially in the last 2 to 2-1/2 hours as the police have pulled out the rubber bullets, the tear gas, to try to break up the thousands of protests that turned out in the financial district of Hong Kong.Protesting against this highly unpopular and controversial extradition bill, where someone charged with a crime here, in Hong Kong, could be theoretically sent back and tried for that crime in Mainland China where the laws are so different.We spent a few hours with these protesters earlier in the day, today. I can tell you for the most part, they're young people, a lot of university students came out. They're worried about their future, they're concerned about the city that they love so much, changing, and not changing for the better.Concerned and worried, yes, but, at least this person told us, not afraid. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're not afraid of anything, because what they did -- what they're doing is not -- it's not right for all the Hong Kong people. It's (INAUDIBLE) our freedom and then turning us to be (INAUDIBLE) so we are not afraid of anything. But the government did everything to make us angry. So, that's why we are here. We try to stop anything we can do.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCSHANE: And they were able to get some results here today, Maria. The expectation coming into the day, today, was that this extradition bill would be fast-tracked through the legislature. It might very well be passed as soon as next week.Now, that might still happen. But for today, at least, it's been delayed. The protesters basically set up shop in the financial district, so anybody who was trying to get in could not. It was even difficult for us to get out, to get any vehicle traffic in or out.So, the legislators that were supposed to have the debate couldn't get there. They decided to put it off and delay it for some time, and now it's anybody's guess where this goes from here. Of course, the business community has been out in full force against this. We'll have to follow it over the next few days to see where it ends up.BARTIROMO: So, the business community against the protesters or against this new law?MCSHANE: No, against the extradition law. Yes, big time, absolutely. And they see this city, Hong Kong, as you know for many years the economic freedom that they enjoy here is unlike certainly anything you'd see in Mainland China. But it's like -- unlike anything you'd see maybe in many parts of this region in general. Businessmen and women have loved coming to Hong Kong for years and years.So, they see this extradition law as a threat to that freedom. So, if someone were to come here, even suspected of a crime, whether he did it or not, the fear is then that person could be sent to China and be tried for that crime, again, much different system of laws there, so that's the fear.BARTIROMO: All right, Connell, thank you. And yesterday, the State Department responded, Morgan Ortagus came out and made a comment about this, saying that the U.S. expresses grave concern about that. Connell, thank you very much. Connell McShane.Joining the conversation this morning, Dagen McDowell, along with the American Conservative Union chairman, Matt Schlapp, Bulltick Capital Markets Head of Global Research, Kathryn Rooney Vera, great to see everybody this morning.KATHRYN ROONEY VERA, HEAD OF GLOBAL RESEARCH, BULLTICK CAPITAL MARKETS: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Quite the extraordinary pictures coming out of Hong Kong this morning.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, absolutely.MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION: Yes, the experts have gotten China wrong for a long time. We were told that when China got Hong Kong, it'd all be smooth-sailing, doesn't seem to be the case.BARTIROMO: Yes. This is one thing that Xi-Jinping really can't have, the protesting, this is what -- why he wants a stable economy, six percent year-over-year. This is the issue, that the people will protest and unrest. And this is Hong Kong. We haven't really seen this in China.But, we'll be watching this, because this is the kind of thing that really change perceptions in terms of what -- where the governance is.SCHLAPP: The cameras are in Hong Kong. The cameras aren't in all these other places in China where there is unrest.BARTIROMO: So, we don't know.SCHLAPP: We don't know.BARTIROMO: Good point. All right, I want to turn to Chinese telecom giant, Huawei, meanwhile. The company delayed a rollout of its new laptop as an American pressure campaign really starts to bite, specifically restricting Huawei from buying certain U.S. products.Right here on this program yesterday, I spoke exclusively with the chief security officer at Huawei, Andy Purdy.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)ANDY PURDY, CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER, HUAWEI: We don't speak through the Chinese government. They don't speak through us. But it's also very important to remember two other things. The network operators control all the data and all the access. And third, we only have very limited access to that data and then, not from Huawei networks, then only after written permission from the network operators.And then special laptops are connected to the customer network where every key stroke is logged that provides assurance and transparency. Those are the facts.BARTIROMO: The facts also are that Huawei has settled lawsuits with a number of American companies for stealing trade secrets. The company has settled with Cisco, Motorola, T-Mobile, Microsoft, all of these lawsuits happened in the last eight years and you've been forced to settle.So, how do you say there were no cyber breaches? I mean, this is what we discussed, you and me, the last time, to completely ignore all of these lawsuits that were settled because Huawei stole trade secrets.PURDY: The fact is, the industry has quite a checkered past and quite a bit of litigation. In terms of significant cyber security wrongdoing, there's been no evidence in 170 countries and the U.S. could give no evidence of that to the U.K. or Germany or our other allies.BARTIROMO: Well, the evidence I just mentioned, that you settled these lawsuits, and they were about stealing trade secrets. That is evidence.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: And, in fact, an executive at Vodaphone, in the last four to six weeks, actually reported that he found a back door in his Huawei infrastructure that leads all the data back to Beijing. He raised his hand and then Huawei rectified the issue, so there's that. And that was the Huawei equipment in Vodaphone's infrastructure in Italy.Joining us right now is the CyberGuy, Kurt Knutsson. And Kurt, Huawei continues to deny all of these things, but we keep seeing evidence that there are these back doors where data can just go back to China since, obviously, there are Chinese Communist Party members on the board and the chairman of Huawei is a Communist Party member.KURT KNUTSSON, THE CYBERGUY: Maria, to say nothing of the fact that the Chinese government, really, when it comes to their own technology infrastructure and companies that are based in and operating inside of China, as primary concerns, China controls those tech companies.I don't care what he wants to say and, boy, great grilling on your part after going after the head of security for Huawei. They are a really good tech company. They may have great laptops that, A, we may not see here in the U.S. shores for a while.But the fact of the matter is, they could be the most spectacular tech company, making the greatest products out there, but they still tie back to an infrastructure that is suspicious, not just in the U.S. minds, but for other western governments around the world.We don't have any assurances, and you laid it right out there, that that data is protected and that as we may have this massive amount of Huawei type of architecture coming in to the U.S. for, say, 5G, we don't have any assurance that they don't have some ability to turn on or reverse vacuum cleaner.That just simply sucks the data out of the U.S. in a way that we haven't ever seen, in terms of weaponizing technology.BARTIROMO: Yes, which is what Vodaphone uncovered, and by the way, most people don't realize what Huawei is. It's a combination of companies including Nortel. They hacked Nortel years ago, and it acquired the company. You remember Nortel, it was one of the most successful technology companies. That's the Huawei underpinning.I want to ask you about Google. They're really feeling the trade heat as well, the company moving some of its hardware production out of China, trying to avoid the U.S. tariffs, according to Bloomberg, Foxconn also ready to shift Apple iPhone manufacturing away from China, Nintendo relocating some of its switch production as well, your reaction?The President said this was going to happen. This has to hurt when China sees this.KNUTSSON: It hurts China right now, 25 percent tariff on those companies' forthcoming and what they're going toward is Taiwan and Malaysia for most of that production, and it makes sense. It just simply makes financial sense for these companies.You mentioned Foxconn; iPhones largely depend upon Foxconn's chips inside of them and their manufacturing. Those facilities that Foxconn mentioned that they could move them offshore, elsewhere, Taiwan, I'm assuming, and Malaysia, I'm assuming, for Foxconn, to also do that manufacturing there where they're not going to see these imposed tariffs.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: There is more of a united pushback and it's covered in the Wall Street Journal by U.S. companies, that Chinese venture cap money is suddenly toxic in the United States, where they were making investments over and over again, and there's been a big pushback.I love this quote in here. So, since October, Democratic Senator Mark Warner and his Republican colleagues on senate intelligence have been warning U.S. venture capitalists and other business leaders about the threat of Chinese intellectual property theft. Take it more seriously. Reduce your dealings with Chinese counterparts.But the FBI has also beefed up efforts to warn companies about the threat of I.P. theft from these China companies, building up a squad of about a dozen agents and analysts in San Francisco.And here's my favorite quote in this article. Discouraging people from using -- we've talked about this, you have -- regular smartphones and laptops when you travel to China, and also warning about honey pots, saddling up to technology executives.Here's the quote, if you're not a 10 in the U.S., you're not a 10 in China. They have told technology executives, to warn about women. It sounds like the Soviet Union, it sounds like Russia, but this is what we're up against.BARTIROMO: And it took Donald Trump to really get this going, and now we're actually seeing people recognize the threat, the national security threat. You know, for a long time, I think U.S. companies were so interested in getting a piece of that 1.4 billion-population, that they just forgot to protect their own product.SCHLAPP: Yes, that's right. This I.P. thing is serious and the other thing on the -- on the Huawei piece, and you're not going to read about it, but these tech companies are rooting the President on, in terms of -- because they have to be -- play nice with Huawei, because they're in the Chinese market.But in the end, they know Huawei is stealing their I.P. and doing other things that are illegal and they're helpless to do anything.MCDOWELL: China essentially spies on every U.S. technology executive. They basically -- maybe it's not nefarious spying, but they are collecting information about where these individuals are --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: They're combing through any and everything that they say publicly, whether it's in a newspaper or on a television network.BARTIROMO: And as a result of that, they've actually gotten ahead in a number of key industries, as a result of years of these kinds of spying. Kurt --SCHLAPP: It's called cheating.BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly. It's called cheating. Kurt, good to see you, great reporting as always, we will see you soon, Kurt Knutsson is in L.A. this morning.Meanwhile, some hedge funds not on-board with the United Technologies- Raytheon merger, Cheryl Casone with that story, this morning, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That's right. Good morning, Maria. Activist investor Bill Ackman sent an e-mail to the CEO of United Technologies, arguing that the $120 billion-dollar deal makes no sense and that shares would be diluted in an all-stock acquisition of an inferior company. That was his word.Wall Street Journal is pointing to both companies' lackluster performance since that deal was announced as a possible sign the defense sector itself might be in trouble. There are both stocks, as you can see, Maria going to be speaking with the CEOs of both companies, 8:00 a.m. Eastern time this morning.Now, to the proposed merger of T-Mobile and Sprint, it is facing a new hurdle from a group of state attorneys general. Ten states led by New York and California are suing to block the $26 billion-dollar deal, claiming it will drive up cellphone service prices and reduce competition. The lawsuit comes ahead of a review of the deal by federal anti-trust officials.Connecticut is one of the states suing. Our very own Maria Bartiromo is going to speak with that state's attorney general, 7:00 a.m. Eastern time this morning, on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.Well, Renault shareholders expected to devote in support of Chairman Jean- Dominique Senard today. This is their first annual meeting since the executive was appointed to succeed Carlos Ghosn back in January.Renault's biggest shareholder, the French government, has said that Senard has its full confidence. But, the Wall Street Journal is reporting that tensions remain as Senard considered resigning hours after Fiat Chrysler withdrew its merger offer last week, because France failed to back that deal. And those are your headlines, Maria, back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thanks so much, quick break, and then coming up, war of words, President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, trading barbs on the Iowa campaign trail yesterday, more on that and Biden's flip on China, suddenly he says they are a threat.Then, Dow Futures lower this morning, but off the lows of the morning, take a look, Dow Industrials down about 90 points, what is driving these markets this morning, right here, when we come right back.BARTIROMO: We've got a big show this morning. Coming up, the CEO and chairman of United Technologies is here, Greg Hayes, along with Raytheon CEO, Tom Kennedy, to talk their big merger, and why some hedge funds are pushing back.Nebraska senator and Senate Armed Services, Agriculture and Committee Member, Deb Fischer, joining us this morning, along with Connecticut Attorney General William Tong. The Deputy Director of ICE, Matthew Albence is here, along with the founder and CEO of Posh Mark, Manish Chandra. Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big three hours right here.Markets are under pressure this morning. There are trade tensions and the future of monetary policy weighing on investors. President Trump touted the strength of the economy last night while in Iowa.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This is truly an extraordinary time for our nation. America is thriving, optimism is booming, people are prospering, and our country is winning again, winning, winning, winning again.America's economy is now the envy of the world. Since the election, we've added 6 million jobs including a half a million manufacturing jobs. Unemployment is now at the lowest rate in over 51 years. Think of that. And we'll soon be breaking that record.We've turned it all around and jobs and wealth are now pouring back into our country.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Earlier in the day, the President defended his tactics on the trade dispute with China. Kathryn, I want to talk to you about markets this morning. We're getting the CPI out later this morning, Consumer Price Index. PPI was flat, non-existent yesterday, up one-tenth of a percent. What's your take on what's driving markets right now and how do you see the year playing out?VERA: Well, the markets bond vigilantes are back, Maria, we have the bonds basically -- bond market taunting the Fed to cut rates, daring them not to. So the question in the market's mind now is, not if the Fed will cut, but by how much the Fed will cut, and I think that would actually be a mistake.The U.S. economy is growing above potential and Jerome Powell and in his, I guess, two meetings ago comments, have mentioned that the deflation or the deceleration in inflation was temporary in nature. So, I'm really looking forward to the 8:30 print today to see if, in fact, that was the case.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, would they cut just for the inflation? I mean, it just seems so odd to me that the Fed would cut in an economy that's growing so much, although, you pointed out manufacturing has weakened and we are seeing some weak spots as the slowdown is setting in.MCDOWELL: Right. The Fed, as Justin Lahart has written in his (INAUDIBLE) Street column, the Federal Reserve, when it cuts rates, it's usually because something bad is happening. And it doesn't always predict a recession, like they cut in 1998, quite dramatically, during the Russian debt crisis and the blow-up of long-term capital management.We didn't have a recession for some years after that. I think the recession technically started in 2001, but the technology bubble bursting in the year 2000. So, be careful what you wish for, to Kathryn's point.Manufacturing has pulled back this year and job growth has been weaker than last year. Job growth averaging so far this year, 164,000 jobs added, compare that to 223,000 on average last year, so there has been a slowdown, particularly, in manufacturing here, in the U.S. and around the globe.BARTIROMO: You know what, though, I've been speaking to a few Wall Street sources last couple of days, and it seems to me that they are all -- even though they are saying, yes, things are slowing down, they have this underlying confidence in Donald Trump, even if they don't agree with his politics, they think, here's a business guy, here is a guy who is always focused on the economy and the markets.He's not going to allow this to go off track. What?VERA: That's reflective in the equity markets.BARTIROMO: Yes.VERA: Absolutely. Equity markets have not dropped dramatically while the bond markets are pricing --BARTIROMO: There's an underlying confidence there on Wall Street. We'll take a break. When we come back, making a deal, President Trump showing off what he says is an agreement with Mexico, as the U.S. pushes to curb illegal immigration, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The crisis at the border now, President Trump touting a trade and immigration deal with Mexico yesterday, aimed, in part, at curbing illegal immigration. The President announced that Mexico will reveal details of the deal, "at the right time."(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: That's the agreement that everybody says they don't have. No, because I'm going to let Mexico do the announcement at the right time. For Mexico, they want to go through it. But here's the agreement, it's a very simple agreement.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What's in it?TRUMP: This is one page. This is one page of a very long and very good agreement for both Mexico and the United States. Without the tariffs, we would have had nothing.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is the Deputy Director of ICE, Matthew Albence, and Matthew, it's good to have you this morning, thanks very much for joining us. First off, characterize what you're seeing at the border right now and do you think that aid from Mexico, troops at the border, will be impactful?MATTHEW ALBENCE, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, ICE: Good morning, Maria, thanks for having me. Absolutely, if Mexico does what they need to do, and say they're going to do, that will have a monumental impact on what's going on at the border right now.Obviously, most of these migrants that are coming here, illegally, are passing through Mexico and there are certainly a myriad of things that Mexico can do to stop that transiting from and through their country.BARTIROMO: I mean, one of the issues is this -- the loopholes that we have, obviously, the Flores decision, as well as the asylum standards. We don't know if we're going to see any movement on that in terms of Congress.But the children at the border, the renting program, smugglers getting children just to come over the border, which is what I witnessed when I went down to the border, a little more than a month ago, do you see any change in that? How do you impact that? ALBENCE: Well, we've sent 400 agents from HSI, Homeland Security Investigations, to the border, to work on these cases, to try to identify these smuggling organizations, identify these cartel members and other transnational criminal organizations that are victimizing these children and utilizing them as chattel, so that unrelated parents or unrelated individuals can smuggle these individuals into the country, because they know they're going to be released.We don't have the ability to hold them, as you mentioned, under the Flores Agreement, so they know that's their free ticket into this country and that they'll be released.BARTIROMO: Yes. And what I also saw was the border patrol agents, unfortunately, are doing things like changing diapers, taking babies to hospitals, because after they -- by the time they get there, they're sick, you know, they've been walking and hitchhiking for months on end, so you don't even have the border patrol agents doing their job, they're doing other things.But let me ask you about this cyber-attack, because a federal subcontractor working for U.S. Customs and Border Protection suffered that malicious cyber-attack that compromised tens of thousands of photos of travelers' faces and their vehicle license plates.This is from a CPB -- CBB spokesman and said the agency learned late last month that the subcontractor in violation of its security policies had transferred the copies of the license plate images and traveler images that had been collected to its own network. Can you tell us anything about that?ALBENCE: Unfortunately, I can't. That's with CBB, and since I'm with ICE, I don't have insight into that I can share with you at this time.BARTIROMO: Tell me what you're seeing in terms of the flow of migrants and the apprehensions right now. Vice President Pence was with me a few weeks ago, and he said, we're talking about 1 million apprehensions this year.ALBENCE: Absolutely. I mean, look at what ICE had to do since December 21st. We've had to release 200,000 family units because we can't hold them. We don't have the authority to hold them. We don't have the ability to detain them through the pendency of the immigration process.Congress has (INAUDIBLE) act on this issue has created a cottage industry in which children are being used as bait and creating lots of wealth for people south of the border. They're smuggling these children, recycling them, for the sole purpose of individuals coming into this country, illegally, knowing full well that we can't detain them and we won't be able to remove them.BARTIROMO: Do you still feel backlash? A number of Democratic candidates over the last year, have said, you know, let's kill ICE. Let's make sure to shut this down. Do you still feel that kind of backlash or has that subsided, given the facts that it's a crisis at the border, have become so obvious?ALBENCE: I don't think anybody that's made those comments actually understands what ICE does.BARTIROMO: Right.ALBENCE: If anybody looks --BARTIROMO: Go ahead.ALBENCE: everybody looks at what we actually do, both in the immigration enforcement spectrum as well as on our criminal investigation side, we do extreme amounts of investigations into Fentanyl, into drug trafficking, into (INAUDIBLE) exploitation, and the human smuggling, human trafficking. We have a myriad of enforcement mechanism that we utilize to keep this country safe.BARTIROMO: Matthew, thanks for going through it, we appreciate you joining us this morning. Thank you. We'll be watching.ALBENCE: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Matthew Albence there, from ICE. Coming up, 2020's war of words, President Trump and Joe Biden trading barbs while in Iowa on the campaign trail yesterday. And then, Biden flipped entirely on China, wait until you hear what he said. Then, Kroger goes green, how the grocery chain is looking to capitalize on cannabis. That's next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, May 12th. We have "BREAKING NEWS" this morning. There is unrest on the streets of Hong Kong in a big way. Take a look at these pictures.Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets as thousands of people protest against the proposed extradition law in China. We're going to take you live to Hong Kong. Coming up, (INAUDIBLE) is there on the ground.Then here in America, 2020 is in focus. Joe Biden flipping his stance on China when it comes -- it comes as he and President Trump trade attacks on the campaign trail. Hear what they have to say, coming up.Markets this morning are lower. Futures pointing to a day of losses, given a weak ending yesterday that continues this morning. The Dow Futures down 69 points, S&P Futures down 8, and Nasdaq lower by 35.This on top of yesterday's reversal, Markets started pretty strong in the morning but the Dow snapped a six-day winning streak, when all was ahead and done with the Dow down 14, S&P down one, and the Nasdaq down almost one point. Fractional moves there. European indices lower as well, FT-100 down 49 points. CAC Quarante in Paris down 29, and the DAX Index in Germany lower by 45.In Asia overnight, red across the board and take look at the worst performer. Hong Kong. Hang Seng down 1-3/4 percent amidst those protesters.Kroger to sell cannabis-based products. The supermarket chain adding creams, balms, oils, containing CBD. Plus, a super expansion to Disneyland. The team park turning to Marvel superheroes for its latest edition. Say, all of that are coming up.But first, our top story this half an hour. 2020 vision. President Trump and former vice president Joe Biden trading barbs on the Iowa campaign trail yesterday. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: You see that with Biden, we would never be because people don't respect him. Even the people that he's running against. They are saying, where is he, what happened? It makes his stance in Iowa once every two weeks and then he mentions my name 74 times in one speech. I don't know. That reminds me of crooked Hillary, she did the same thing.BIDEN: I believe that the president is literally an existential threat to America. Four years of Donald Trump will be viewed as an aberration in American history. Eight years -- eight years will fundamentally change who we are as a nation and how we're viewed around the world. I think there's a genuine threat to American democracy.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, Quinnipiac University out with a new set of presidential polls. Handing some bad news to President Trump. Look at this and a national head to head with Biden. The president trails Joe Biden by 13 points. Other polls show that the president just trailing Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and Pete Buttigieg.But if you take a look back at the 2016 election, a national Quinnipiac Poll said the same thing. Taken in the summer of 2015, the same point in that election as right now. The polls show Donald Trump trailing 12 points behind Hillary Clinton.Joining me right now is Reason Magazine associate editor, the author of Panic Attack: Young Radicals in the Age of Trump, Robby Soave. Robby, good to have you. Thanks so much for joining us.ROBBY SOAVE, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, REASON MAGAZINE: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: So, you cover young people all the time. Tell us what you're hearing from young people in terms of this president.SOAVE: Well, obviously they don't like Trump. Many of them are very, very progressive and they view him as an existential threat just like Biden said. Of course, many of them don't like Biden very much, either. Because he's not nearly far left enough for them.Which is interesting, because I do think Biden is Trump's probably his most difficult matchup in the general election, but he's -- he has to right now run against everything he represented because he is suddenly so out of touch with the very, very militant progressive young people are within the Democratic Party, who are -- who run media companies, who are not running them but working for them, and you know, spreading the word on some of these candidates.And they're really trying to destroy him on things like criminal justice, MeToo stuff, and so on.BARTIROMO: Do you think they understand the policies that they are championing, like socialism, like some of the Medicare for all type policies, were coming -- that we're hearing from Bernie and others?SOAVE: Well, I think they think those things and also the cultural things that they believe that are -- that are just so out of touch with most Americans. They think they're very popular. They can't imagine anyone not liking those things.Because they don't actually interact with any people who don't like those things, you know.BARTIROMO: Yes. Funny, it's funny because they think that everybody agrees with them.SCHLAPP: Yes, that's right.SOAVE: They do.SCHLAPP: Robby, you know we see this at CPAC where the age of the kids who were seeing this kind of leftward attacks on free speech and trying to shut down conservative kids. They used to happen on the college campuses, it's not happening in high schools.SOAVE: Right.BARTIROMO: Wow.SCHLAPP: They are driving this down low are you seeing the same dynamic?SOAVE: Yes, happening more in high schools and happening more -- right, it's not just on campuses at all, it's before the campus and it's after. I mean, some of these kids are going on to find jobs in firms and media companies social media companies where they're changing the culture from within, the policies from within to make them harder places do have uncomfortable or difficult conversations because someone feels traumatized by -- you know, not being told or affirmed that they're great at everything they do.SCHLAPP: Could you please stop? You're really -- you're encroaching (INAUDIBLE)SOAVE: I'm sorry your PTSD has --MCDOWELL: You're trigger -- you're triggering that.SOAVE: Yes, yes.SCHLAPP: You don't want to see that.SOAVE: Yes, and this --VERA: The indoctrination is sad though because really, where is the diversity of thoughts? Like diversity in all thinks, except thought.BARTIROMO: That's right.SOAVE: Right. And it's not all young people at all but it just takes a couple of them.BARTIROMO: Yes.SOAVE: To really make a huge difference. And we seen that on campuses, a small number of activists have just made it impossible to have conservative speakers come to a lead institutions.MCDOWELL: We get it -- we get it on social media that if you say they come say they will take one line of -- 10 minutes of things that you might say and a half an hour period, and it goes viral, and everybody picks it up even mainstream publications online sometimes just for the clicks and the advertising revenue.SCHLAPP: Oh, yes.MCDOWELL: And they will shame you into trying to shut you down and shut you up. Again, I call it like left-wing click bait for the lemming -- the liberal lemmings out there on media. So, it's chum in the water.SOAVE: It's witch hunts. They're looking for the next thing, the next person to destroy because they're just furious about something.BARTIROMO: Yes, and they're just the loudest voices in the room.SOAVE: Yes.BARTIROMO: And they -- and they're also relentless. They won't stop attacking you until you shut up.SOAVE: Yes.MCDOWELL: But in terms of the presidential campaign and I said this early on they will you have such a left-wing agenda, and a small voting based driving these candidates further and further left during the primary season to the point that whom -- whomever becomes the nominee can't win against Trump because they're so left-wing.SOAVE: Exactly. I mean, that's a little bit the story of the last election.BARTIROMO: Yes.SOAVE: I mean people voted for Trump because they were sick of political correctness. They told me that, probably, all of you that, you know, when you ask them, well, what did you like about Trump? You can see the same thing. We're just so sick of the left telling us what we can think, what we can say, or what we can't say that you just get so angry.BARTIROMO: That's right. So, let's talk Joe Biden for a second because you say he is the most formidable against Donald Trump right now.SOAVE: Probably, I think.BARTIROMO: He's head off a China flip-flop. Here is what he said back in May and what he said yesterday. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: China is going to eat our lunch. Come on, men. They're not bad folks, folks. But guess what, they're not a competition for us.China proposes real challenges in United States and some ways a real threat to the United States(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: There is also a story which Peter Schweizer has reported that. Vice President -- then-Vice President Biden took his son, Hunter Biden on Air Force Two to travel to China. While he had a meeting -- a government meeting. The vice president had a government meeting and yet the son actually when he got home got a $1-1/2 billion investment from the Chinese. So, I wonder if that's going to be an issue for Joe Biden. Robby.SOAVE: This is the issue when you've been in politics so long, right? You've been on every side of every issue. There's always -- you can go back to some clip of you saying something on T.V. that contradicts what you think now.So, yes, I think it's going to hurt him to some degree. But I don't know how long that will be in the running, because I think people just kind of like Biden, especially in the Democratic Party. They remember him.BARTIROMO: Yes.SOAVE: They have a fondness for him. I see that when I talk to people who are Democrats. That I think is a little underrated in the media because again, because the media are younger people who hate him for not having these very progressive politics.BARTIROMO: He's not left enough, yes.SOAVE: But he -- but he -- there's something about him that a lot of people do like. And I think that's why I'm a little -- I think his chances are better.BARTIROMO: You're right. He's like Uncle Joe.SOAVE: Yes, yes. He's comforting.BARTIROMO: Yes, there's a warmth there. There is.SOAVE: It's personality based rather than politics. Yes.SCHLAPP: Sometimes he's a little too warm. But the thing is he knows those two clips you had Maria.BARTIROMO: Yes.SCHLAPP: One, he's reading. When Joe Biden is off the cuff, he goes into strange places. Unlike Trump who seems to be able to do that effectively, Biden does not. When he's off script, watch out.BARTIROMO: Yes. That's a good point, I'm going to be watching that now coming going forward. Look, we got to get to this story helping our heroes. Comedian Jon Stewart slamming Congress in their response to the reinstating the 9/11 victims fund during a House Judiciary Subcommittee hearing yesterday. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JON STEWART, FORMER HOST OF A LATE NIGHT SHOW: Sick and dying they brought themselves down here to speak. And no one shameful. There is not an empty chair on that stage that didn't tweet out never forget the heroes of 9/11.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Two of the subcommittee members did not even attend. This is the cover of the New York Post today. Shameful.MCDOWELL: And they have -- they have a list in here. It's more than just two subcommittee members of the people who should have been there --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Who didn't show up?MCDOWELL: Well, it's -- I don't want to go through it because we've got the two subcommittee members that they are talking about were Eric Swalwell and Guy Reschenthaler from -- he was a Republican from Pennsylvania. But they're more on the (INAUDIBLE) committee --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: So, they were supposed to be there and they're not. And isn't Eric Swalwell running for president?MCDOWELL: Yes he is, and here is The Post -- here is The Post cover on shameful. But we should point out that the survivor's fund the claims -- the pending claims will be cut by 50 percent this year. Future claims could be cut by 70 percent. The current fund expires December --(CROSSTALK)SCHLAPP: Nothing is getting cut, Dagen.MCDOWELL: December of 2020. Well, they have moved it yet though. OK, so they're planning to vote on it that's the expectation. But I also want to point out why do you make these sick individuals keep going back to Washington to beg for money, and then you don't show up? The whole committee should have been there.BARTIROMO: Absolutely.MCDOWELL: More than the host committee should have been there. The death toll from 9/11 related illnesses will soon surpass those resulting from the attacks themselves. More than 2,700 people were killed in New York City alone.BARTIROMO: Disgusting.MCDOWELL: This disgusting, disgusting government.BARTIROMO: It really is. I agree with you.MCDOWELL: It's politics and it's work.BARTIROMO: Final word.SOAVE: I will say though, as I testified actually before this subcommittee a couple weeks ago on hate crimes, it's purportedly rising, I actually don't think they are. But most of the chairs were empty most of the time. This is just -- you know, these committee hearings are unfortunately just theater. I think their opportunity --(CROSSTALK)SCHLAPP: It's the phony as the Congress.SOAVE: Yes. If they're not --(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: It's not theater when you have our heroes who are dying for cancer.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: And these jacklegs can't show up.BARTIROMO: Absolutely.MCDOWELL: It is not theater, it's disgraceful, and it's not America.BARTIROMO: We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Well, a second person arrested overnight in connection with the shooting of Red Sox Legend, David Ortiz. Cheryl Casone with details now, Cheryl.CASONE: That's right, Maria. Dominican police announcing the second arrest but providing few details: it is still unclear if this suspect is the gunman. Police arrested Eddie Garcia earlier, accusing him of driving the gunman on a motorcycle to the scene of that shooting. Garcia was beaten by an angry mob. While the former Red Sox star is recovering from his injuries in Boston. According to his family, Ortiz is walking and resting comfortably in intensive care after a second surgery.Well, Boeing is delivering new planes falling far behind last year's pace. The company delivered just 30 commercial airliners last month, that's a 56 percent dip from a year ago. The 737 Max Jet still grounded. As you can see, the stock is under pressure this morning. It's down almost one percent in the premarket.And now to Kroger. They're going green. CBD products like oils and creams are going to go on sale at the retailer's nearly 1,000 stores all over the country. Kroger joining national retailers like Walgreens, CVS Health and GNC responding to the growing consumer demand for, yep, CBD. Kroger shares down 10 percent so far this year. Everybody getting on that bandwagon, Maria.BARTIROMO: All right, thank you, Cheryl.CASONE: You bet.BARTIROMO: Coming up, the personal side of President Trump, a new book sheds light on one employee's decade with the Trump organization. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Trump organization employees fearing for their lives, that's just one of the stories revealed in a new book titled: "The Real Deal: My Decade Fighting Battles and Winning Wars with Trump." Joining us right now is the former Trump Organization Executive Vice President and Co-Author of the new book, "Real Deal", George Sorial. George, great to see you. Thanks very much for joining us.GEORGE SORIAL, FORMER EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, TRUMP ORGANIZATION: Thank you for having me.BARTIROMO: You write that you no longer leave home without a gun. Tell us about your experiences.SORIEL: Well, that's my personal choice. It's not a company policy. I'm sure there's some people in the organization that disagree with me. But I've seen enough, the level of hatred, the level of ridiculousness out there, you know, in my 50 years on this earth I've never seen anything like it and I'm grateful that I live in a country that allows me to carry a firearm. I'm a very fervent believer in the Second Amendment. I think people often; don't appreciate the freedoms they have -- so that's my choice. I have a family and I have a right to protect them.BARTIROMO: Tell us about your experiences, writing this book and your experiences the with president, Donald Trump.SORIAL: It's been a tremendous -- I've been working with the president in one way or another, I actually first met him in 2002, when I was on the other side of a transaction. But it's been an incredible experience. He's been very good to me and I think the way I always put it when I describe to people, aside from my own parents, nobody has done more for me than President Trump. And that continues to this day. He's always supported me, despite the enormity of his position and multitude of issues that he deals with. He was very supportive of the book. He gave me whatever time was necessary to conduct the interviews. And although I officially resigned from the company last Friday, I will always remain close to him and the family and if I can help them in any way, I will.BARTIROMO: Your experiences, is really exactly what we were just talking about during the break. And that is, for some reason, certain people who hate Donald Trump for whatever reason have thrown out their values and all of the things that we deem so important in America and that is due process and the ability to live, for example, and not get wiretapped for no reason. I mean, it just doesn't matter to certain people who hate him because they say, well, it's OK, it's just Donald Trump.SORIAL: That's true. And I think, look, I've been fortunate. I'm an immigrant. I have half my family living in the Middle East, we're Orthodox Christians, the other half lives in Europe. I've been fortunate to travel. And I've seen lots of parts of the world. And I think Americans often don't appreciate their freedoms. They just don't realize how good things are. But I agree with you, the lack of common decency that we've seen over the past few years is remarkable.SCHLAPP: When you worked for pre-President Trump, Donald Trump as a citizen, how did you handle conflict with him? When there's a disagreement, there's this whole perception that like, he talks everyone down and won't listen to contrary opinions. What was your experience?SORIAL: I would disagree with that. Look, he has a temper. Everybody knows that. I have a temper. I think if you're passionate and you enjoy what you're doing, tempers are going to come out. But no, I thought he was always open to criticism. In all the years that I worked with him, I never felt stifled. I was always able to have a conversation with him. Look, often he didn't agree, but I never felt that he was trampling my ability to make a point. So, I feel just opposite. I think he listens to people. He talks to everyone. And I'm just reminded of a time where I was walking on a construction plan with him and he said, you know, George, people always ask me, how did I succeed? How did I get to where I am? And he said, you know, I listen to people and I give them what they want. And I think he's done that with the presidency.BARTIROMO: George, great to have you this morning.SORIAL: Thank you very much. I appreciate it.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. And we'll be watching the book. George Sorial joining us there. It's the "Real Deal" on Donald Trump. Still ahead, merger red flags, the United Technologies-Raytheon deal facing some pushback from certain investors, next hour, right here on "MORNINGS WITH MARIA." Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo --Load-Date: June 12, 2019End of Document

CHINESE WORKER KILLED AT POWER PLANT BRAWL IN BANGLADESHStates News ServiceJune 19, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 718 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Hundreds of police have been called in to keep the peace after a fight between Chinese and Bangladeshi workers at a power plant in south-central Bangladesh left a Chinese worker dead and at least seven others injured, officials said Wednesday.The violence erupted late Tuesday after a Bangladeshi worker fell from a terrace at the plant, and amid rumors that a Chinese national had pushed him and later tried to cover up the death, a local police official told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service."The Chinese worker injured in the clash died Wednesday morning at hospital," said police superintendent Moinul Hasan, adding that the man, identified as electrician Jhan Yang Fang, 26, suffered head wounds and died of "excessive bleeding."The incident was the first time a foreign worker had been killed at a work place in Bangladesh, a labor leader said.It also exposed apparent tensions among 7,000 Bangladeshi workers and 2,700 Chinese workers at the power plant being built with Chinese funds in Patuakhali, a district some 329 km (206 miles) south of Dhaka, where the Bangladesh government and Chinese investors are also constructing homes, roads and a deep sea port."A Bangladeshi worker Tuesday night died falling from a height in a power plant in the Payra port premises," Hasan said."The angry Bangladeshi workers attacked the Chinese workers with sticks. The Chinese also carried sticks and attacked the Bangladeshi workers, too," he said, confirming that the situation was now under control with "hundreds" of police on hand.Dozens of Bangladeshi and Chinese workers were injured in the clash. Six Chinese and two Bangladeshis were treated at nearby Sher-e-Bangla Medical College Hospital (SBMC), doctor Md Mahbubur Rahman told reporters.'We are shocked at this incident'Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal on Wednesday night told BenarNews that the police had been instructed to ensure safety of all Chinese workers and avert further clashes."Certainly, the police will file a case for death of the Chinese national. The police have been investigating why the Chinese worker died," Asaduzzaman said."We have asked the police to contact the Chinese embassy to ascertain whether they want to conduct an autopsy of the Chinese national. If the Chinese embassy agrees, we will conduct an autopsy; otherwise not," he said.Chinese officials at Beijing's embassy in Dhaka did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Beijing is now Bangladesh's biggest foreign investor, official figures show, with most of the Chinese money invested in the power sector.China's overall investment of U.S. $1.03 billion in 2018 represented a 16-fold increase compared with its 2016 investment of just over $61 million.The 1,320 megawatt-capacity Payra power plant is being built by a Chinese-Bangladesh consortium at a total cost close to U.S. $2 billion, according to Khaled Mahmood, chairman of the Bangladesh Power Development Board (PDB)."The Chinese government has been providing 85 percent of funds of the total cost as a loan," he told BenarNews.The plant, fueled by imported coal, will begin generating power in December 2019 and be fully functional by late 2022, according to North-West Power Generation Company Ltd, a consortium partner.Chinese leader Xi Jinping unveiled the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) plan in 2013, saying that the massive infrastructure initiative of ports, pipelines and roads would accelerate development in many of the world's poorest countries. Skeptics say the plan is aimed at regional dominance and control of trade.Bangladesh's government announced earlier this week that for the first time in its history, the country has a power surplus, after building 100 new power plants during the past 10 years.The influx of Chinese investment has brought thousands of Chinese workers to Bangladesh.Senior trade union leader Wazedul Islam Khan said authorities should have taken measures to prevent incidents such as the violence at Payra."There is no precedence in Bangladesh that a foreign worker is killed in a clash. We are shocked at this incident," he told BenarNews."This will certainly tarnish the image of Bangladesh as a tolerant country," Khan said.Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Load-Date: June 19, 2019End of Document

Twitter apologizes for suspending accounts critical of ChinaCNN WireJune 2, 2019 Sunday 1:41 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 291 wordsByline: By Victoria Cavaliere, CNN BusinessDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  Twitter has apologized for suspending accounts that were critical of the Chinese government's response to the Tiananmen Square protests of June 4, 1989. Twitter wrote on its public policy feed Saturday that the suspended accounts were swept up in a weekly effort to crack down on "spam and other inauthentic behaviors.""Sometimes our routine actions catch false positives or we make errors. We apologize," Twitter said. It added that the suspended accounts had not been reported by the Chinese government.The suspension of the accounts, both inside and outside China, elicited criticism from US Senator Marco Rubio, who tweeted the company was silencing voices on behalf of the Chinese government."Twitter has apparently suspended a large number accounts that are critical of #China including accounts of people outside of China. Twitter has become a Chinese govt censor," he said.Activists critical of the Chinese government had been speaking out on the platform in the days leading up to June 4, which will mark the 30th anniversary of the massacre of unarmed citizens by soldiers in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Chinese troops ended several weeks of protests by firing at civilians, killing hundreds, if not thousands, of people.The Twitter accounts had taken aim at the policies of China's Communist government and its handling of the crackdown in Tiananmen Square. The Chinese government rarely mentions the incident and has worked for years to censor all mention of it within the country.On the anniversary, there no public memorials or protests around the issue are expected in mainland China, because of tight government suppression.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

US plans to hike tariffs Friday, says China broke promisesAssociated Press InternationalMay 6, 2019 Monday 10:51 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 1114 wordsByline: By PAUL WISEMAN and JOE McDONALD, AP Business WritersDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - Accusing Beijing of "reneging" on commitments it made in earlier talks, the nation's top trade negotiator said Monday that the Trump administration will increase tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods Friday, a sharp escalation in a yearlong trade dispute.At the same time, a Chinese trade delegation is expected to arrive in Washington to resume negotiations on Thursday, a day later than originally planned.At a briefing with reporters, neither U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer nor Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin offered details of China's alleged backsliding, and there was no immediate response from Beijing.Mnuchin said Trump officials learned over the weekend that Chinese officials "were trying to go back on some of the language" that had been negotiated in 10 earlier rounds of talks.The U.S. officials said that at 12:01 a.m. Eastern time Friday, the administration will raise the tariffs from 10% to 25%. President Donald Trump had announced those plans via Twitter on Sunday, expressing frustration with the pace of negotiations. The hit list includes such varied products as baseball gloves, vacuum cleaners and burglar alarms.The reiteration Monday of the president's threat from high-level Trump officials reinforced the administration's determination to put Beijing on the defensive.By threatening to raise taxes on Chinese imports, Trump is throwing down a challenge to Beijing: Agree to sweeping changes in China's government-dominated economic model - or suffer the consequences.The unexpected ultimatum shook up financial markets, which had expected the world's two biggest economies to resolve a yearlong standoff over trade, perhaps by the end of the week."It's a significant change in the president's tone," said Timothy Keeler, a partner at the law firm Mayer Brown and former chief of staff for the U.S. Trade Representative office. "It certainly increases the possibility that you'll have no deal."For weeks, Trump administration officials had been suggesting that the U.S. and Chinese negotiators were making steady progress.Suddenly on Sunday, Trump said he had lost patience: "The Trade Deal with China continues, but too slowly, as they attempt to renegotiate. No!" he tweeted.Trump also said he planned "shortly" to slap 25% tariffs on another $325 billion in Chinese products, covering everything China ships to the United States.The two countries are engaged in high-stakes commercial combat over China's aggressive push to establish Chinese companies as world leaders in cutting-edge fields such as robotics and electric vehicles.The United States accuses Beijing of predatory practices, including hacking into U.S. companies' computers to steal trade secrets, forcing foreign firms to hand over technology in exchange for access to the Chinese market and unfairly subsidizing Chinese firms at the expense of foreign competitors.The Trump administration has imposed 10% tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on another $50 billion. The Chinese have retaliated by targeting $110 billion in U.S. imports.Global stock markets sank Monday on Trump's tweetstorm. But shares in the United States regained some of the lost ground on news that Chinese officials were planning to go ahead with this week's meetings in Washington. Still, the Chinese government did not provide details on exactly when talks would resume and who would be on China's negotiating team.U.S. officials said they expected that China's delegation would be led again by Vice Premier Liu He, a confidante of Chinese President Xi Jinping.Beijing is wrestling with an internal conflict: It is eager to end a trade fight that has battered Chinese exporters, but it doesn't want to look like it's bowing to the Trump administration's demands for far-reaching concessions.Trump's threat makes going ahead with talks "very difficult politically" for Xi's government, said Jake Parker, vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council. He said the Chinese public might "view this as a capitulation" if Beijing reached an agreement before Trump's Friday deadline.The conflict is testing how far Beijing is willing to go in changing a state-led economic model it sees as the path to prosperity and global influence - and how much power Washington will have to enforce any agreement.Beijing is willing to change industrial plans that provoke foreign opposition but wants to preserve the ruling Communist Party's dominant role in directing economic development, said Willy Lam, a politics specialist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.Chinese officials have said they are willing to let foreign companies participate in plans that call for government-led creation of global competitors in robotics and other technologies. But they have yet to release details, and it is unclear whether the concessions will satisfy Trump.Xi is "adamant about party-state control over major sectors of the economy," Lam said. "If they give this up, then China in effect ceases to be a socialist country."Beijing agreed early on to narrow its trade surplus with the United States - a staggering $379 billion last year - by purchasing more American soybeans, natural gas and other exports.At the same time, Xi's government has announced a steady drumbeat of promises to open markets - in businesses that include auto manufacturing and banking. But none of the moves directly addresses American complaints.The negotiators are also looking for a way to hold Beijing to any commitments it makes. The Trump administration wants to keep tariffs on Chinese imports to maintain leverage over Beijing."Trump wants a certain amount of tariffs to remain in place just in case the Chinese don't honor their promises," Lam said. "The Chinese refuse to give the Americans the right to penalize them."The Chinese are also skittish about allowing Washington to dictate changes to industrial policy and subsidies, said Raoul Leering, a trade specialist for Dutch bank ING. They see that as "having another country decide your economic policy."Trump also seems to be calculating that Xi needs a deal more than he does. The Chinese economy is decelerating. "Trump believes he can bully the Chinese," Lam said. "Trump realizes the Chinese economy is facing a rough patch, and Xi Jinping is under pressure from his own people."But Trump also has an incentive to reach a deal. The trade war is creating uncertainty for businesses trying to decide where to buy supplies, locate factories and make investments. And it's been weighing on a strong U.S. stock market, which the president likes to tout as evidence that his economic policies are working.___McDonald reported from Beijing.Load-Date: May 7, 2019End of Document

Carrier interconnection poses another problem for HuaweiFierceWirelessJune 4, 2019Copyright 2019 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 789 wordsByline: Matt Hamblen Highlight: A Huawei spokesman told several U.S.–based reporters meeting in Shenzen that “I don't know” what happens with data running on the gear of Chinese carriers who are providing data interconnection capabilities with carriers outside of China.BodySHENZEN —Huawei this week again defended itself against U.S. government claims that data running over its telecommunications gear around the globe is spied upon by Chinese government officials.However, there's a catch. A spokesman for Huawei told several U.S.–based reporters meeting in Shenzen that “I don't know” what happens with data running on the gear of Chinese carriers who are providing data interconnection capabilities with carriers outside of China. Such interconnections allow data and voice to flow from one carrier serving a region to another in a different region.Huawei and other companies based in China are required under a 2017 cybersecurity law to make data running on their servers available to Chineseofficials. Since China state security can access such data, U.S. officials and analysts have argued that data running on Huawei branded servers, routers and other gear running anywhere is vulnerable to surveillance and attack.Joe Kelly, vice president of international media affairs for Huawei, objected to the U.S. raising such concerns because the Chinese security law only applies to companies based in China.Interconnection agreements with Chinese carriers are not covered by the law, and Kelly said, “I don't know” when asked if that omission has created any vulnerability. Generally, he defended Huawei as a private company separate from Chinese government influence, adding it would not be in Huawei's interest to hurt its customers by making them vulnerable.“We've never been asked by our government to do anything” to jeopardize customer data, Kelly said. “We've never received” a Chinese government data intercept request.RELATED:Huawei takes its crisis PR roadshow to the Big 5G EventMore broadly, he mirrored comments by other Huawei officials in recent weeks that Huawei is being confronted by U.S. allegations of wrongdoing without proof.“There's never any evidence we've done anything wrong,” Kelly said. “If we were doing bad stuff, you'd know about it.” He added thatbecause so many people and companies use various forms of Huawei gear for wireless and wireline communicationsthey would come forward to complain. The Chinese government has no role in how Huawei operates, he stressed.Huawei's denials of wrongdoing have been contradicted by U.S. officials and some security analysts. They point to numerous lawsuits brought by Huawei's competitors over allegations of theft of intellectual property, among other concerns, as providing a smoking gun about Huawei's future actions.Analysts doubt ChinaRoger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics and former U.S. government security specialist, said in an interview with FierceWireless that there is sufficient concern about cybersecurity with the Chinese to distrust Huawei. “I don't trust Chinese state security,” he said.Entner said U.S. intelligence and cybersecurity experts haven't divulged all they know about the ways Chinese state security can infiltrate Huawei and other systems because the U.S. “doesn't want to give the Chinese remedial lessons on how the Chinese can do their jobs better.”Entner contended that because of the 2017 cybersecurity law in China, “everything in the world is accessible to Chinese state security. China doesn't need back doors to get this data. They can go in the front door, and then they can tap into servers and base stations and listen in live. China doesn't need brute force. They have the key to log in.”Other analysts said a Signaling System 7 (SS7) hack attack can create a vulnerability for Chinese officials to infiltrate smartphones and other devices, including those of Huawei. The SS7protocol is used to exchange data between network devices in a global network infrastructure used by hundreds of carriers. Even end-to-end encrypted applications are vulnerable to an attack because account verification over a network can be done via SMS or a mobile call, outside of the encryption.Entner said Huawei faces “deep trouble” with recent U.S. Commerce Department and White House actions that ban U.S. companies from providing components and software to Huawei. But he also conceded that President Trump and the U.S. Congress face a dilemma because there are no homegrown U.S. manufacturers of 5G base stations.RELATED:Commerce Department offers temporary exemptions to Huawei blacklistingAmerican companies have failed at providing vital 5G networking gear because of marketplace realities in a capitalist culture where 5G competitors from abroad have dominated, he added. “American companies don't cut it, I'm sorry,” Entner added. “We don't have these companies because we don't socialize company losses. Can you imagine the outrage of Congress if it had to fully fund a 5G base station supplier?”Load-Date: June 10, 2019End of Document

China Wine Import Report, 2013-2018 & 2019-2023GlobeNewswireApril 1, 2019 Monday 9:26 AM PTCopyright 2019 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: RESEARCH ANALYSIS AND REPORTSLength: 949 wordsBodyDublin, April  01, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The     "Research Report on Wine Import in China, 2019-2023"   report has been added to     ResearchAndMarkets.com's  offering.        With the improvement of living standards and the change of lifestyle, the demand for wine in China keeps increasing. China is the fifth largest wine consumer in the world. The fixed wine consumer groups in China are no longer limited to the middle class and the well-heeled. An increasing number of young people are starting to drink wine, and some middle-aged and elderly people are becoming wine drinkers for health reasons. At official banquets and business dinners, the consumption of Chinese spirits far exceeds that of wine but the gap in market share is narrowing.The development of e-commerce boosts wine sales in China. And consumer groups vary greatly in preference and purchasing power. The output volume and quality of domestic wine can hardly be improved, and wine making costs more in China than in other countries, which pushes up the import volume of wine in China. Many Chinese wine producers repackage imported bulk wine to produce a wine of their own brands. As the Chinese government has no special restrictions on wine import, the number of wine importers in China stays above 5,000 in recent years.According to this analysis, the import volume of wine in China reached 729.68 million liters in 2018. It decreased as compared to 2017 but increased by about 80% as compared to 2013. About 20% of China's wine imports are bulk wine in containers holding more than 10L, and the rest are bottled wine in containers holding 10L or less. In 2018, the import value of wine in China reached USD 3.91 billion, increasing by about 6.50% as compared to 2017. France was the largest source of China's wine imports. The value of China's wine imports from France was about USD 1 billion in 2018, decreasing by nearly 9% YOY. Australia was the second largest source of China's wine imports. The value of China's wine imports from Australia was about USD 700 million in 2018, decreasing by 3.50% YOY. Chile was the third largest source of China's wine imports. The value of China's wine imports from Chile was about USD 340 million, increasing by 4.50% YOY. In 2018, the average import price of wine in China was lower than 6 USD/liter, which shows that China's wine imports are mostly medium-to-low end products.According to this market survey, there is neither well-developed wine culture nor well-known wine brands on the Chinese market. Most Chinese consumers find it difficult to identify the types and grades of wines. Therefore, low-end imported wines prevail in China. Some inferior wines are even sold at high prices by the advantage of marketing techniques. China's wine market will become standardized as consumers grow more mature and the market is better regulated. But it may take 5 to 10 years or longer. It is important for wine importers to select brands and products suitable for the Chinese market and spread consumption concept in a way acceptable to Chinese consumers.

Trump threatens to hike tariffs on $200B of Chinese importsAssociated Press InternationalMay 6, 2019 Monday 6:07 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 1046 wordsByline: By PAUL WISEMAN and JOSEPH PISANI, AP Business WritersDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump raised pressure on China with a threat to hike tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods in a tweet that sent global financial markets swooning on Monday.Trump's comments on Twitter came as a Chinese delegation was scheduled to resume talks in Washington on Wednesday aimed at resolving a trade war that has shaken investors and cast gloom over the world economy.Chinese government officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Trump turned up the heat Sunday by saying he would raise import taxes on $200 billion in Chinese products to 25% from 10% as of Friday.The Wall Street Journal, citing unidentified sources, said China's government was considering canceling this week's talks. Beijing has responded to previous U.S. threats by saying it wouldn't negotiate under pressure.Stock markets fell on the news. The future for the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.8% and that for the S&P 500 sank 1.6%. The Shanghai Composite index plunged nearly 6% while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong sank 3.1%. Japan's markets were closed for a holiday.Trump had twice pushed back deadlines - in January and March - to raise the tariffs in a bid to buy more time for a negotiated settlement. But on Sunday, Trump, who has called himself a "tariff man," said he's losing patience. "The Trade Deal with China continues, but too slowly, as they attempt to renegotiate. No!" Trump tweeted.In his tweets, Trump also threatened to slap tariffs on another $325 billion in Chinese imports, covering everything China ships annually to the United States.The two countries are locked in a high-stakes dispute over China's push to establish itself as a technological superpower.The U.S. charges that China is resorting to predatory tactics - including cybertheft and forcing foreign companies to hand over technology - in a drive to establish Chinese companies as world leaders in advanced industries such as robotics and electric vehicles.Trump's threat makes going ahead with talks "very difficult politically" for President Xi Jinping's government, said Jake Parker, vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council. He said the Chinese public might "view this as a capitulation" if Beijing reached an agreement before Trump's Friday deadline.And if Trump goes ahead, American companies in China "would be very concerned" about official retaliation, said Parker.A month ago, Trump predicted "something monumental" would be achieved in the next few weeks.But last week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin seemed to temper expectations, suggesting that Washington was willing to "move on" if it can't get the deal it wants.A substantive deal would require China to rethink the way it pursues its economic ambitions, abandoning or scaling back subsidies to its companies, easing up on the pressure for foreign companies to share trade secrets and giving them more access to the Chinese market.Philip Levy, senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and a White House economist under President George W. Bush, said the talks are too complicated for Trump's high-pressure tactics to work. "The president treats this like we're haggling over the price of a used car," Levy said.Trump has made a priority of shaking up American trade policy.As a candidate for the presidency, Trump raged repeatedly about alleged Chinese perfidy - so much so that a video mashup of him spitting out the word "China" went viral and collected more than 15 million views on Youtube.com.Trump charged that previous administrations, gullible and weak, had let China get away with abusive trade practices, accepting empty promises from Beijing and allowing the U.S.-China economic relationship to grow ever more lopsided. As evidence, he pointed to America's vast U.S. trade deficit with China - $379 billion last year, by far the biggest with any country in the world.Once he took office, Trump's relationship with Xi seemed to get off to a good start. The two men shared chocolate cake and amiable conversation at Trump's resort in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, in April 2017. A few weeks later, China agreed to open its market U.S. beef, cooked chicken, and natural gas in what Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross called a "herculean accomplishment."The romance faded. In March 2018, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative issued a report accusing China of using predatory tactics to strengthen its tech companies.Last July, the Trump administration gradually began slapping import taxes on Chinese goods to pressure Beijing into changing its policies. It now has imposed 10% tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on another $50 billion. The Chinese have retaliated by targeting $110 billion in U.S. imports.The fight between the world's two biggest economies is raising worries about global economic growth. The International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and others have downgraded their forecasts for the world economy, saying the U.S.-China standoff is reducing world trade and creating uncertainty for companies trying to decide where to buy supplies, build factories, and make investments.Trump has portrayed his tariffs as a moneymaker for the United States and a benefit to the U.S. economy.But a March study by economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Columbia University, and Princeton University found that the burden of Trump's tariffs - including taxes on steel, aluminum, solar panels, and Chinese imports - falls entirely on U.S. consumers and businesses who buy imported products. By the end of last year, the study found, they were paying $3 billion a month in higher taxes and absorbing $1.4 billion a month in lost efficiency.Nonetheless, the overall U.S. economy has remained healthy. On Friday, the government reported that the U.S. unemployment rate had fallen to the lowest level in half a century.Markets rallied.But on Monday those gains were reversed as investors reversed course."This is a big surprise given the increasingly positive messages from the various US officials involved in the trade talks in recent weeks," said Tao Wang and Ning Zhang of UBS said in a commentary."Certainly the risk of an all-out US-China trade war has increased significantly."___Joseph Pisani reported from New York.Load-Date: May 7, 2019End of Document

The Migrant Workers Behind China's Economic Miracle Are MiserableAtlantic OnlineMay 31, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1653 wordsByline: Amy Hawkins and James ThorpeBodyWhen Liu Yanchang quit his factory job in Hebei province and took the four-hour bus ride to Beijing to become a courier, it was the farthest the 18-year-old had ever been from home. The new job, part of the booming e-commerce industry, offered him more money than he had ever made before, and he hoped to learn English and one day travel overseas. All in all, he was happy.Just a few months on, though, his optimism has been deflated. "I don't belong in Beijing," he complains. "I just work here."Grueling 10-hour workdays spent ferrying packages bought online across China's capital affected his performance, and several lost packages resulted in a disciplinary fine and an angry boss. He still finds the giant city hard to navigate, and has had less opportunity to explore than he expected. Isolated in the small room he rents, Liu says his initial enthusiasm for the adventure seems like a distant memory.China has freed more than 850 million people from absolute poverty in recent decades, a period in which the ruling Communist Party made a simple pledge to its population: Avoid interfering with the political order, and prosperity will be yours. This contract worked for China's middle class, which grew from            29 million in the 1990s to some 531 million in 2013. In 2019, however, Beijing's mission has become more complicated, and Liu's story is typical of the            228 million migrants who work in China's cities today. These workers, known as nongmingong, have seen their wealth increase, but their place in Chinese society is largely unclear. China's cities are becoming more and more hostile to the people on whose backs they were built, and the nongmingong are not feeling the gains of the government's promise.[           Read: China's great leap backward]China's government values the stability its economic miracle has delivered, but this is only one part of an evolving story. The party is aware that life satisfaction must become part of the equation, especially for migrants such as Liu who have yet to meaningfully feel the trickle-down of China's economic success. President Xi Jinping has            argued that the nation and its leaders must be concerned about more than economic growth. The basic needs of hundreds of millions of people have been met, but China's leaders must now turn their attention to the unhappiness felt by Liu and others. Where do people such as Liu, who abandoned their rural origins to support China's economic transformation, feature in the government's plan for the future?The UN World Happiness Report found that migrants in Chinese cities were            less happy than people who stayed in the countryside, but the idea that moving brings success is still powerful. The city inspires hope, whereas rural China is seen as a relic of the past: When Google first launched in China in 2006, it did so with the transliteration Gu Ge, which means "valley song." Executives thought it was a charming and innocuous reference to the country's beautiful landscapes, but internet users balked at the bucolic allusions at a time when many people were trying to leave behind the pastures, characterized by poverty, famine, and want.In reality, migrants' problems in China's cities are manifold, but fall into three main categories: urban, social, and economic.Migrants often find themselves particularly vulnerable to urban development, and one suffocating phenomenon is inescapable-the smog. Beijing has a bad reputation for this, but the worst offenders are lesser-known cities in the adjacent industrial heartlands. Baoding, a city in Liu's native Hebei, has average pollution levels            7.5 times as high as the limit            recommended by the World Health Organization. A            recent study of Chinese cities found that pollution has a negative effect on happiness; for migrants who are more likely to work outdoors in industries such as construction and logistics, there is no relief from the toxic air.For white-collar workers in Beijing and elsewhere in China, the solution is to buy air purifiers for their home and office. But the appliance can cost upwards of $100, or about a fifth of the average monthly migrant            salary. Along with paying for food and sending money home, migrants must contend with a housing market in which tenants have few rights to complain about landlords who increase rents. In fact, migrants, including Liu,            often rent with nothing more than a verbal agreement. In major cities on China's east coast, migrant workers spend,            on average, about $150 a month on rent for less than 16 square meters (about 170 square feet) of space, plus a shared bathroom and kitchen.Crammed into these tiny spaces, migrants are isolated from familial support networks, leaving children and the elderly in their home villages. "How can you talk about happiness?" asks Zhu Shengwei, a nongmingong who left his home in the poor northern province of Henan in 2003 to move to Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi province, a decision that he says helped him avert economic hardship but came at great personal cost.For some migrants, it is Chinese government policy that has forced them into this precariousness. In 2017, the Beijing government            began destroying shantytowns that housed thousands of migrants. Many were evicted on three days' notice, with any protests swiftly shut down by police and blocked from domestic news reports. The government says demolitions serve a public interest by removing health and sanitation risks faced by a vulnerable population, pointing in particular to a fire in one such neighborhood that            left 19 people dead. Critics, however, suspect the demolitions were part of Beijing's ongoing beautification campaign. (Few remnants of life in these areas remain, though one nongmingong, Sun Heng, runs a museum dedicated to the stories of migrant workers like himself on Beijing's outskirts. While the museum has so far escaped scrutiny, the surrounding area has been cleared of migrant settlements.)[           Read: How Beijing's new residency system favors the elite]Migrants also face a formidable set of institutional barriers in their attempts at success in the city. Chinese society is organized in a system of household registration known as hukou. If you are born in a rural area, it is usually impossible to change to an urban hukou regardless of how long you work in the city, a system that bars migrants from certain jobs and prevents access to health care and education for their children. It dates from pre-Communist China, but in the second half of the 20th century, it became so decisive in determining life opportunities that it has been compared to the caste system. A 2018            study in Baoding found that migrant workers who, in some cases, had lived in the city for decades had little emotional attachment to it, and their lack of security and happiness was central to this feeling. Researchers found that limitations on their hukou rights had determined much of their outlook on their lives.As China's first wave of urban migrants approach retirement age, many find themselves locked out of urban pensions. Their hukou remains in their hometown, which means their only option might be to return to meager countryside pensions in a place where they have not lived for years. If they do return, they are likely to find that their villages are nothing like how they left them, and not in a good way. From 2000 to 2015, nearly three-quarters of all rural primary schools-more than 300,000 in all-were permanently            closed. Many of those who stayed behind lost their jobs as agriculture became more and more automated.Of course, not all migrants feel dispirited about their urban lives. For some, the move to the city proved to be as transformative as they had hoped. In 1995, 16-year-old Zhu Liujun followed China's gold rush to the coast and left his home in Henan for a new life in Huizhou, a city less than a two-hour drive from Hong Kong. His first job was in a tile factory, on a salary of about $100 a month, work that made him "eat bitter," he says, using a Chinese phrase for hardship and toil. He now works as a courier and earns about 60 cents for each delivery, making him significantly better off than he was when he was on his fixed factory salary. Zhu sometimes works up to 14 hours a day, but enjoys the flexibility of generally being able to choose his own hours. Life in Huizhou is better than in Henan, he says, adding, "It's familiar here now." He hasn't been home in 10 years and plans to stay in Huizhou as long as possible. "China is a very strong country," he says, insisting that opportunities are still abundant.[           Read: The blurring boundaries between Hong Kong and mainland China]China staked its economic fortunes on its east-coast cities, and mass migration fueled their staggering success. Migrants helped build the            Bird's Nest stadium, the jewel in China's Olympic crown (and at least 10 of them            died in the process). They moved to Shanghai for work on skyscrapers that now house international banks. On the border with Hong Kong, they worked on construction sites that transformed Shenzhen from a swamp to a city that sees itself as China's Silicon Valley.The Chinese dream was once clear: It lay in the cities. For some, this still rings true, but the migrant problem undermines the central promise of the Communist Party-to raise living standards and enable social mobility. It affects hundreds of millions of people whose myriad challenges may undermine their ability to contribute to China's continued economic ambitions, which rely on a productive, aspirational workforce.Cementing China as a unified nation is an ongoing project. By squeezing out migrants from their adopted homes, the party risks fracturing the unity and stability on which its vision rests.Load-Date: June 4, 2019End of Document

Holstein Wednesday, June 5, Club Quarters, 40 West 45th Street, New York, New YorkBeverly Hills, CA, June  03, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE -- Brick Tower Press, an imprint of J. Boylston & Co. Publishers, has announced publication of WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN'S EIGHTH BOOK,THE NEW ART OF WAR: CHINA'S DEEP STRATEGY INSIDE THE UNITED STATES, sold by Mr. Holstein's agent Alan Morell of Creative Management Partners, based in Beverly Hills, Ca. The Overseas Press Club will host a Book Night with Holstein on Wednesday, June 5, beginning at 6 p.m., at Club Quarters, 40 West 45th Street, New York, New York.TESTIMONIALS FOR THE BOOK:"Over the decades, I have learned to trust Bill Holstein's instincts and judgment about the interaction of business, technology, politics, and strategy in American dealings with rising Asian economies. The New Art of War is full of his trademark insights -- raising alarms without being alarmist, and setting out practical next steps for companies, universities, the U.S. government, and voters and citizens." - James Fallows, The Atlantic"The president should read this book. Bill Holstein's gripping reporting on the extent of China's incursion into American commerce, culture, education and politics is so alarming that if you put this book under your pillow, it would keep you up all night. A must read for everyone to understand the just below-the-surface asymmetric war China is relentlessly waging against the largely unsuspecting United States." - Allan Dodds Frank, Emmy award winner"Holstein is right on target about Americans' need to take responsibility for our vulnerability and do something about it--fast." - Russ Mitchell, Los Angeles TimesSaid, John T. Colby Jr., Publisher, J. Boylston & Company, Brick Tower Press: "The book establishes the justification and steps required to protect the military and economic interests of the United States. It will be regarded as a seminal work in understanding the differences between U.S. and Chinese economic relations."                                                                                                                                             Said Agent Alan Morell: "The depth of the Chinese challenge is just beginning to dawn on American leaders and Bill has captured the heart of it. The book is incredibly timely and clearly informative.

Holstein: "It's often said that it is better to be lucky than smart. The Trump Administration is hitting a stone wall in its negotiations with the Chinese government at the same time it is recognizing that China has leapfrogged the U.S. in some technologies as seen in the case of Huawei and its 5G wireless communications. The depth of the Chinese government's penetration of U.S. targets also has been revealed by the arrest of an official of China's Ministry of State Security and a vast hacking scheme of America's cloud computing system."About Author William J. Holstein:  Bill Holstein, a past president and long-time governor of the Overseas Press Club, writes in his latest book that the scale of China's challenge is much greater than even some experts have recognized. Join Holstein for a Book Night at Club Quarters to examine how China's government is orchestrating a massive campaign to steal American technology inside the United States through cyber hacking as well as recruitment of Chinese and Chinese-Americans working inside U.S. companies and institutions. His book outlines how different arms of the Chinese government have stolen hundreds of millions of pieces of data about Americans. In short, the struggle to maintain American leadership in the world thus must begin at home.Holstein started covering China's modernization efforts 40 years ago after United Press International transferred him to Hong Kong in 1979. He won an OPC award for best foreign economic reporting for that coverage and was promoted to Beijing bureau chief. He has remained involved in coverage over the years for BusinessWeek, U.S. News & World Report and Chief Executive magazine.

How Trump Thinks Tariffs Work (And How They Actually Work)Atlantic OnlineMay 14, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 962 wordsByline: Annie LowreyBodyLast week, President Donald Trump increased tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods imported from China, the latest salvo in the administration's months-long trade war with Beijing. On Monday, China said it would retaliate with tariffs on $60 billion worth of American products, warning that it would "never succumb to foreign pressure."Trump argued that additional tariffs were necessary to force concessions from the Chinese and would redound to the benefit of American manufacturers and the American economy. "Tariffs will bring in FAR MORE wealth to our Country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind. Also, much easier &amp; quicker to do," he said in one of his numerous tweets on the subject. He added: "Tariffs will make our Country MUCH STRONGER, not weaker. Just sit back and watch!"Oh, really? To make the case for his trade war, and to measure his administration's success in it, Trump is relying on blatant falsehoods and misconceptions. Taking those falsehoods as truths and those misconceptions as correct-accepting Trump's theory of trade, that is-the United States might be stronger, the deals might be phenomenal, and the trade war might be good and easy to win. But the Chinese have not yet backed down, and show no signs of doing so. In the meantime, the businesses and consumers sitting back and watching the trade war are bearing modest, but measurable costs.  [           Read: The U.S.-China trade talks have already changed the world]In Trump's mind, tariffs are a potent, unilateral weapon, and protectionism is a potent, necessary economic philosophy. He argues that his tariffs are a direct tax on Beijing-a way of sapping Chinese manufacturers, raising American revenue, aiding domestic businesses, and giving Washington leverage in trade negotiations. "Tariffs are NOW being paid to the United States by China of 25% on 250 Billion Dollars worth of goods &amp; products," he said on Twitter. "These massive payments go directly to the Treasury of the U.S."This is not at all how it works; the Chinese government is no more apt to fork over billions of yuan for Trump's tariffs than Mexico's government is to pay for a border wall. Rather, tariffs fall on the American importers of Chinese goods, who often pass those cost increases onto American consumers. That means every time Trump raises tariffs, he risks raising costs on families and businesses.Earlier this month, Trump argued that this dynamic did not exist. "The Tariffs paid to the USA have had little impact on product cost, mostly borne by China," he wrote, intimating that Chinese companies have lowered their prices to remain competitive. That has not, in fact, happened. In a            new paper, economists based at Princeton, Columbia, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York write: "Although in principle the effect of higher tariffs on domestic prices could be offset by foreign exporters lowering the pre-tariff prices that they charge for these goods, we find little evidence of such an improvement in the terms of trade up to now." The authors estimate that Trump's tariffs were costing consumers about $1.4 billion in real income a month by the end of 2018.[           Peter Beinart: China isn't cheating on trade]Trump has promised to use the revenue that the government raises from China (remember, the government is not actually raising money from China) to help businesses harmed by the trade war. Washington will demand payments from Beijing, use the money to buy food, and pass the food on "to starving people in nations around the world!" he said. It is true that the government is planning more aid for agricultural firms hit by the trade war, and that Trump wants the U.S. Department of Agriculture to figure out some            work-around. But at best, such a plan would involve taking American taxpayer dollars and using them to buy American agricultural goods to ship abroad or to bail out American farms.Trump's misconceptions on trade are not limited to tariffs. He continues to argue that the United States' trade deficit with China is a sign it is getting            ripped off, and that it is bleeding itself dry by engaging in commerce with the Chinese: "The United States has been losing, for many years, 600 to 800 Billion Dollars a year on Trade. With China we lose 500 Billion Dollars. Sorry, we're not going to be doing that anymore!" There are many issues with the two countries' economic relationship, and many ways that China does not play fair. But trade imbalances are not in and of themselves a bad thing. The United States has a trade deficit with China in large part because goods are cheaper to produce there, and Americans choose to consume huge amounts of them; the deficit is not a way of measuring capital losses in the United States.As for tariffs bringing "FAR MORE wealth to our Country": The trade war thus far has not caused tremendous macroeconomic damage. But it has hit certain industries and businesses very hard-           dairy farms in Wisconsin, for instance-while increasing consumer prices a smidge. Economists have estimated that Trump's trade war cost the country a sliver of GDP last year, in part by forcing businesses to rejigger their supply chains. (The pain is worst in heavily Republican counties, one            analysis found.) Given Trump's new tariffs and China's retaliatory measures, the cost might be yet greater this year.Not that Trump himself would admit it. In his mercantilist, protectionist understanding of the world, trade wars are good, tariffs are a way of hitting the bad guy, and whatever the United States is doing on trade, it is winning. Alas, here in the real world, Trump's trade war means that consumer goods are about to get more expensive and certain exporting businesses are about to face a much tougher climate, all thanks to the White House.Load-Date: May 15, 2019End of Document

How Should Associations Approach Mainland China?MeetingsNetApril 2, 2019Copyright 2019 Penton Business Media, Inc All Rights ReservedLength: 1100 wordsByline: Rob CareyBodyIt’s safe to say that any international association with a plan for long-term growth has its eye on mainland China, home to 1.4 billion people—that's 18 percent of the world's population, and doesn't even include those living in Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan. An association's effort on the mainland could focus on enlisting new members, or on building partnerships with Chinese associations to expand educational opportunities and revenue, like the European Society of Hematology has done in the past few years with good results. The potential for associations in mainland China is such that MCI Group, a major international association-management and event-coordination firm, recently opened an office in the city of Hangzhou. After Beijing and Shanghai, Hangzhou is the largest mainland Chinese city for international events. Home to e-commerce giant Alibaba, Hangzhou made the International Congress and Convention Association's Top 100 destination list in 2015 and hosted the G20 Summit in 2016. Florence Chua, managing director for MCI Hangzhou, notes her new office is tasked with "attracting, developing, and delivering high-quality experiences for international meetings, as well as supporting the international activation of Chinese brands and companies."Given the strong presence of government in mainland China's business sector, that second goal—leveraging Chinese organizations—is critical to any effort an association makes to develop its presence there. Here's why: "The implementation in 2017 of the Foreign Nongovernmental Organizations (FNGO) law has made it challenging for international associations to recruit members," Chua says. "Local recruitment activities are not allowed, which means there is a lack of visibility and local relevance for prospects."What's more, the law imposes a large administrative burden and numerous restrictions on foreign nongovernmental organizations seeking to conduct any on-the-ground activity. To name a few: An organization must gain sponsorship from a high-level government agency; it must gain approval for all activities plus provide post-activity reports; no more than four foreign staffers may work steadily inside the country; and all other hires, including volunteer personnel, must be acquired through approved human resources companies or a Chinese partner organization. Lastly, the law limits foreign NGOs to work in certain approved topic areas, which could pose another challenge for those creating content for association congresses and conventions. As a result, "associations are more concerned about how to navigate the legal requirements for getting approval to organize an international event in mainland China," says Chua.Finding the Right ApproachOn the other hand, Chua points out that "Chinese citizens are not forbidden from joining international associations virtually." This provides associations with an opportunity to use the most popular social-media application in China—and the world. It's called WeChat, and it has more than one billion Chinese accounts as well as more than 100 million non-Chinese accounts. WeChat provides messaging, social media, and electronic-payment services, and also lets users make video calls, play games, order food, and more.Because there are restrictions on how non-Chinese organizations can use WeChat, this is where a Chinese-based organization—such as a local association or a company connected to the industry an international association serves—might be of help. "WeChat is a highly popular and effective social media engagement platform within China, and if an international association is registered in China with a representative office, it can register its own account" and conduct communications, says Chua. "But WeChat has recently tightened the registration requirements for new accounts, so a local partner might or might not be able to help the association to register a new account." Alternatively, if an association wishes to occasionally secure a mention on the existing WeChat account of a related Chinese association or company, Chua notes that "there is liability to be managed for the account registrant around advertising law" and other regulations. From the big-picture perspective, then, "an association should hold a mid- to long-term view for getting onto the WeChat platform," Chua says. "It’s unlikely to be very effective for driving attendance for a one-off event due to the amount of content and frequency required to build engagement." Short of registering with the Chinese government and having an office there, international associations could seek strategic mentions of an event it will hold in the Asia-Pacific region on the account of a local association or company, in order to drive attendee interest from Chinese professionals. Singapore, Sydney, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, and Hong Kong are the top-five event destinations in the region, and "travel and the visa application process is relatively straightforward for Chinese citizens," Chua says. "However, the event organizer should always be aware of political relationships between China and the country hosting the event, as attendance is likely to be affected during sensitive periods. Chinese companies are generally supportive of business travel as long as there is business relevance and value. But if organizers want to attract government or government-affiliated attendees, they should be aware of travel protocols and approval processes."If there is enough potential benefit for an international association to establish an office in mainland China, then the possibility goes up considerably to host events there that generate strong attendance while coming in at reasonable cost. For international associations without an office that still want to host events in China, MCI Group's Chua suggests they consider the following:• Does the association have local partners or contacts who can support the FNGO law requirements?"This is obviously important for getting the necessary approval for organizing an event."• What is the expected ratio of Chinese attendees to international attendees? "This will help determine which cities to consider using," Chua says. "If the percentage of Chinese attendees is high, then using second-tier cities such as Hangzhou, Chengdu, and Suzhou becomes very attractive in terms of cost and unique cultural offerings."• Is the association’s industry central to the corporate base or the strategic development of the potential host city? "An alignment here could provide opportunities for additional support by the local government and other local stakeholders."Load-Date: April 2, 2019End of Document

Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, May 29th.Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast right now.U.S.-China trade turmoil still worrying markets around the world. We are looking at a selloff this morning on trade fears. China is now threatening to cut off rare-earth minerals that are needed for chemicals in the U.S. Huawei has filed a new legal action to block the U.S. ban.I sat down yesterday for an exclusive one-on-one interview with the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and asked him about the threat posed by the Chinese technology giant Huawei.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Huawei is an instrument of the Chinese government. They are deeply connected. It's something that's hard for Americans to understand. We would -- companies cooperate with the United States government, that is, they comply with our laws. But no president directs an American private company.That is very different in China. They just simply operate under a different set of rules.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: So what does that mean? Don't miss my full interview with the Secretary coming up in just moments right now.The morning -- this morning is not a good one for markets. Take a look at futures indicating a selloff at the start of trading. The Dow futures are down 130 points a half of a percent. The S&P futures down 13 and the Nasdaq futures down 50 points right now on top of the yesterday's losses where the market closed at session lows.The market had been up early in the day but reversed course entirely and then some, finishing down 238 points on the Dow. Down 23 points on the S&P. And the Nasdaq was down 29 points.In Europe this morning, similar tone. We've got arrows down across the board. The FT 100 is down 96 points, one and a third percent. The CAC 40 in Paris is down 85. And the DAX index in Germany lower by 139 points, better than 1 percent.In Asia overnight it was Japan and Korea which really took the hardest hit down 1.25 percent each following the sell off on Wall Street.Joining me this morning to talk all about that is Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; former Home Depot CEO and former Chrysler CEO Bob Nardelli; and RealClearPolitics co-founder and president Tom Bevan. Great panel today -- good to see you.TOM BEVAN, PRESIDENT, REALCLEAR POLITICS: Good to be here.BOB NARDELLI, FORMER HOME DEPOT AND CHRYSLER CEO: Good to be here. Very busy.(CROSSTALKING)BARTIROMO: We're going to talk about -- yes. We're busy because we've got a story that is escalating and that is the tensions between the U.S. and China. President Trump is holding firm in trade negotiations with China with the military risks just as important as the economic ones.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo laid it all out at what is at stake in an exclusive interview with me yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: We talked a lot about the economic issues between China and the U.S. I want to really focus on the military and on the risks that have to do with national security. Can you talk us through the massive risks that exist today in terms of China and the U.S.' national security?POMPEO: When you think about risk from a military perspective, it is all about capacity and intent. It is whether they have the ability to do and what is it they seek to do.And we're concerned on both fronts. We've watched President Xi make a commitment that said he wouldn't go to the South China Sea and build that militarily and yet he's done so.We've watched them engage in a very significant arms buildup not only in the quantity of arms, but in their lethality, in their ability and their capacity. And so on both fronts, it's something that America needs to make sure that we do all we can to ensure that we stay in a posture where we can deter this thread so that we don't ever have to send our soldiers, sailors, and marines to a war.I can't imagine that happening again amongst these two superpowers. It is our job at the State Department to make sure we never put America in that position.BARTIROMO: So let me stay on that theme for a moment because there is speculation that the Chinese have not only stolen intellectual property from our companies costing them tens of billions of dollars every year but also from Department of Defense.There's speculation that there is for example a buildup in terms of stealth technology which they stole from the United States. Submarine secrets that they have stolen. Can you characterize that? Is that a fact?POMPEO: I can't say a whole lot other than a case that we worry about it every day. The threat of theft, not only of commercial intellectual property but of military technology is real. And we are doing our best to prevent that from happening. I am confident that it is imperfect and that other countries have obtained some of it. You can look at some of these systems and you see similarities that suggest that they may well have not created these from scratch.BARTIROMO: The Japanese apparently had to alert and scramble their own fighters -- 628 days last year. That would be twice a day to react to coercion in the waters. China's rise is impacting the Indo-Pacific.So give us your sense of that -- about this gray zone operation if you will. Intimidating and coercion of other ships from other countries coming in the South China Sea.POMPEO: So President Trump laid down a strategy to expressly push back against that. It's what we call our Indo-Pacific strategy. It has many components. There is a commercial component. There is a diplomatic component to it but there's also a military component. To make sure that we guarantee for America that these sea lanes remain open.So your point about Chinese ships sailing in places that they haven't sailed before, Chinese aircraft flying with more frequently pushing boundaries up against places where they would normally fly is a very real risk and it's something that the United States Department of defense has pushed back against, too.You see an increase frequency of our activities in those very same places to ensure that U.S. commercial traffic can continue to have access to those sea lanes. They're very important for our economy and for America's economic growth.BARTIROMO: So this is basically operating below the level of conflict --POMPEO: That's right.BARTIROMO: -- and yet gaining dominance in the region. Do you believe that the U.S. has a comprehensive whole of government strategy to fight this?POMPEO: Yes I do. When they need to go execute it, we need to execute it with great vigor. The great news is here this isn't a partisan issue. I have spoken to nearly every member of the United States Senate about these issues. Democrats and Republicans alike understand these concerns, express their willingness to support America's efforts to push back against it. And I am convinced we will be successful in doing so.BARTIROMO: I was reading a good piece earlier. It's called "America begins to see the consequences of the past policy errors".POMPEO: Yes. Maria -- this is a really good point. We are late to the game. We just -- we watched this happening in like when you put the frog in the pot and turn the heat on, you didn't see the temperature rising as quickly as we should have.Frankly that is true for the whole world. I think the whole world is waking up to these concerns. And so we spend a great deal of time making sure that we have the right strategy. That we have resourced it properly but also sharing with our allies in the region -- Singapore, Vietnam, all of these country in East Asia and Southeast Asia, ensuring that they too understand these risks so that they can be part of the alliance that pushes back against the Chinese threat.BARTIROMO: So should we be breaking formally against past administrations in terms of maintaining this neutrality when it comes to China?POMPEO: It is complicated. We have big commercial relationships with China. Important components of our economic well being are tethered to China today. But it is the case. And the President quite rightly, whether it was making sure that we have fair reciprocal free trade with China, his decision on Chinese technology. These are things that previous administrations refused to do.Put America as you said behind where we should have been. We were too late to the game. But President Trump and the team recognizes these challenge and we are now determined to put in place all of the resources needed to push back against it.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about these comments that were made recently. Admiral Davidson, who took over the Indo Pacific combatant commander said in front -- as well as Chairman Dunford testified in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee that we would not win in a war against China?POMPEO: Yes, I didn't hear him say that exactly. I would always be long America. I hope it never comes to that. I can't imagine that it will. But --BARTIROMO: But they have the largest military in the world.POMPEO: America is very capable. I don't want to spend a lot of time getting into details. But I'm very confident. I was a former soldier. I know the greatness of America's fighting men and women. I'm convinced that there is no power in the world that America couldn't if required handle in a way that would protect America's interest all throughout the world.BARTIROMO: What are the implications of no trade deal with China? Do the two largest economies have to have a partnership?POMPEO: You know, we may or may not get a deal. I couldn't tell you the answer to that. Much will turn on whether China is prepared to do what President Trump has asked him to do. It is pretty simple. I mean fair, reciprocal, a set of trading rules that apply to both countries.President Trump is perfectly prepared to allow American companies to compete against Chinese companies but he's not prepared to allow them to continue to steal our intellectual property, force American businesses to transfer their technology. He's not prepared to allow them to put tariffs on American goods when there aren't any tariffs on their goods coming into our country.I hope that there is a deal. I hope there is an arrangement that will work to the benefit of each of our two countries but if there is not I'm very convinced the American economy will continue to grow.BARTIROMO: Should we be worried about them lashing out at the United States? I mean now we know that China is considering U.S. rare earth export curbs. These rare earth -- 17 chemical element used in high-tech consumer equipment.There was a story recently the Chinese have taken all their panda bears. I mean this is sort of, you know, opening up into consumerism and where people can understand what this means, that China may stop the exporting of important chemicals that the U.S. needs.POMPEO: Always when I hear these concerns, these worries, I'm always reminded that the American people have lost and suffered for decades under the current rules. So there's this somehow this idea that President Trump's decision to push back against China caused problems for the American economy when in fact the challenges have been the fact that Chinese were in trade war with us long time ago. We are simply trying to get back to fair, to reasonable, to reciprocal, to transparent. That is the President's mission.I can't predict what the Chinese will ultimately do. How they will make their decisions. Will they attempt to respond? They did and they put some counter tariffs on when President Trump initially put his tariffs on.I'm sure they'll take actions in response. But American people should know China has had an unfair trade relationship with the United States for an awfully long time and President Trump's singular focus is to push back against it.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: Coming up, part two of my exclusive interview with the Secretary of State. He weighs in on Chinese technology giant Huawei and intellectual property theft right after this break.Then markets are selling off this morning. Investors are watching potential recession risks as bond yields go lower. Technology stocks taking a hard-hit this morning. We're going to show you a list of them when we come back as futures indicate a decline of 140 at the start of trading.Back in a moment right here.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Chinese telecom giant Huawei part of U.S.-China trade tensions, intellectual property theft and espionage causing concern. Part two now of my exclusive interview with the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BOLTON: What do the American people need to understand about Huawei? This fight with Huawei is getting worse. The chairman of Huawei over the weekend gave an interview basically saying I am not going to take the President's call if he calls me. We don't need the United States. There is real espionage that's going on, isn't there?POMPEO: Huawei is an instrument of the Chinese government. They're deeply connected. It's something that's hard for Americans to understand. We would -- our companies cooperate with the United States government. That is they comply with our laws. But no president directs an American private company.That is very different in China. They just simply operate under a different set of rules. That's the most fundamental thing I think people need to try to get their head around.If it is the case that the Chinese Communist Party wanted to get information from technology that was in the possession of Huawei it is almost certainly the case that Huawei would provide that to them. That deep connectivity exists inside the way their political economy operates.That's very different from the United States. That is the threat that President Trump sees from Huawei.BARTIROMO: What about the limits on Huawei actually limiting the growth of 5G in the United States. There was speculation today, an article basically saying that the administration's offensives aimed at stopping Huawei may in fact limit the growth of 5G in the United States.POMPEO: I don't know if that's true or not. I couldn't tell you. I've always found our economy is incredibly robust, incredibly dynamic when obstacles pop up or particular business falls away someone steps in to fill those shoes to make up for it. It's the dynamism, it's the competitive nature of the United States economy.I suppose there's a possibility it will might slow down for a little while but I'm convinced that American ingenuity -- American -- frankly Western, not even just American. European and Western democracies will move to fill whatever gap there is so that these technologies will continue to advance to provide world-class services at affordable prices to American consumers.BARTIROMO: What do we need to know about artificial intelligence? Is the Chinese ahead of us on AI? And are they using it -- well, they're certainly using it to track your citizens but should we be worried if the Chinese are ahead of us on AI?POMPEO: And we should always seek to be the technology leaders all across the world the world. It's the hallmark of the American economy. We need to do everything we can to make sure that our educational institutions, our research facilities, our companies have incentives to continue to build out those systems so that we are the world's leader in technology. It's what created the foundation for the American economy for an awfully long time.China's clearly made progress. There are almost certainly places where they are ahead of us.But I remain very confident. The democratic system that we have. The competitive spirit. The animal spirits in the United States of America almost always drive out state run institutions from the competitive landscape. I have no doubt that they will do so here.BARTIROMO: What are you hearing from our friends in Europe in terms of dismantling their Huawei infrastructure. Have you tried to make the case? Communicate the risks a couple of months ago when you were with various leaders in Europe. Have they changed their mind, are they still pushing back?POMPEO: Maria -- they are becoming educated as well. They're learning. It is not a critique. We were slow to see it as well. It's important that we continue to share information. There will be places where they have better information than we do.We ought to share the information about those risks. We are interdependent in terms of our communication systems with them. We have western-based rules ordered, privacy focused systems that we jointly engage in. That is what technology needs to look like in the next 10, 20, 30 years as well. We they need western values embedded in the system.BARTIROMO: And final question here -- is the President planning to do a similar TPP type arrangement with others in Asia to combat China? Because there is speculation that maybe we should have stayed in TPP. Now seeing that it's much more difficult than people expected with China.POMPEO: You saw the President's effort this weekend right. He's talking about free trade agreement with Japan this past weekend. I'm very confident we will continue to build out our trade relationship through all part of Asia. Whether that'll be part of a multilateral agreement, or a series of bilateral agreements -- I don't know the answer to that. The President will ultimately make that decision.BARTIROMO: Mr. Secretary would you like to add anything else that I may have missed that is important to understand about the Chinese threat?POMPEO: Only this. There is also enormous -- it is not economic in a purse sense but humanitarian concerns as well. We've seen as they continue to collect information and use it in ways that are antithetical to what you and I understand about how human beings are to be treated. We focused on these million Uighurs that are in these terrible situations in these camps in one of the provinces.But it's is broader and bigger than that. The complete absence of political freedom, inside of this country is something that the American people need to continue to watch and see because it has an impact on our economic relations with them as well -- our economic relationship with them as well.BARTIROMO: To explain Uighurs -- basically the Chinese have rounded up Muslims, Tibetans, put them in these re-education camps and they're being guarded by machine guns.POMPEO: That is right.They are not allowing these people to move freely. They are indoctrinating them with Chinese thought -- Chinese thinking in ways that the West just wouldn't do. It is different, it's historic and it's important.BARTIROMO: Mr. Secretary -- thank you.POMPEO: Thank you very much.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: Our thanks to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Be sure to tune in right here on Friday when I sit down for an exclusive interview with the Vice President Mike Pence. We'll talk about China but and also USMCA. He has important meetings with Canada, so we will talk about that.Coming up rising tensions with China take a toll on corporate America. How are companies is planning for the future with the uncertainty right now.Then Facebook is under fire once again. CEO Mark Zuckerberg could be held in contempt of Canadian parliament after snubbing the country. We'll tell you how he did that.Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Futures are indicating a selloff at the start of trading this morning. The Dow futures down 163 points right now. The S&P futures down 16.5. Nasdaq futures down 57.We are waiting on a couple of earnings -- Dick's Sporting Goods, and Abercrombie and Fitch will report their quarterly numbers momentarily. We'll get you those numbers and show you how the stocks are impacted as well.But it really is U.S.-China trade that is impacting everything. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo telling me exclusively that the U,S. may or may not get a deal done with China. Pessimism is said to be growing among economists and corporate America.Joining us right now EY Global Divestiture Advisory Services and Transactions Support leader, Paul Hammes. Great to see you -- Paul Thank you so much for joining us.PAUL HAMMES, EY GLOBAL DIVESTITURE ADVISORY SERVICES AND TRANSACTIONS SUPPORT LEADER: Thank you -- Maria. Nice to see you.BARTIROMO: What has been the reaction in terms of corporate America due to this uncertainty about China?HAMMES: You know, honestly Maria -- there really hasn't been that much of a reaction at all. I think most companies really see a lot of the tariffs and a lot of the activity right now as very temporary, right. And they are moving forward with their plans, right.A very rigorous portfolio review process that's already in place in a very resilient and competitive market has not changed the dynamics at all of companies that are looking to divest in the field.BARTIROMO: Some people think that the markets are underestimating the threat here. does the markets too, yes, we have seen your -- a really big have seen -- pretty good selloff and you mentioned the other day Apple is down what -- like 11 percent in a month.We have seen some specific situations but for the most part, the markets are expecting at some point something will get done and this is all noise and negotiating.HAMMES: Right. That's exactly right -- no, it's exactly right. I think most people -- as I said see this as very temporary.BARTIROMO: Yes.HAMMES: And something will happen and I think people realize that China and the U.S. they've got to be stable and predictable trading partners and they believe those two largest economies in the world will work that out.NARDELLI: You know Paul -- last year we saw divestitures on a dollar basis at an all-time high. I think your surveys are suggesting that will continue this year, next year and beyond.So a couple of things. Your opinion -- is that the result of activists going after these companies to divest, to get cash? I would love to see it go into technology and R&D versus stock buyback, right. And/or is it because private equity has so much money, the multiples are so high, that corporations say now is the time to divest. They're getting 10, 12, 14 percent multiples.What are you hearing.HAMMES: Well, those are all great points Bob. And they're all true. First of all I mean we have companies that we know from our survey now, two thirds review their portfolio twice a year, right. That a significant. Portfolio reviews are no longer an event, they're strategic allocation of capital within an organization. WE also know to your point that activists are out there, activists are certainly driving some of this activity. That's not expected to go away.We also know that private equity is sitting on a record right - a record of dry powder (ph). Over $800 billion of dry powder, right. They have got the capital to put to work. And we know from our survey as well that companies turnaround, over 60 percent of them turn around and invest to your point in technology when they have proceeds from a divestment.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: In the most basic layman's terms though are CEOs under pressure to look like they are doing something? If they can't grow the business organically, again I can think of some companies with new CEOs and they go in and they start just making moves, divestitures being one, just to look like they know what they are doing when they don't?HAMMES: Well, there's always some of that, right. I mean everything is case-by-case, right. You have to look at each specific organization and what somebody may be looking to do.MCDOWELL: I'm not asking you to name names.HAMMES: No, no. And I wouldn't. But you have to look at that. At the same time, right I mean portfolio reviews as I said are no longer an event.There is something that companies see helps them allocate their capital strategically and freeing up that capital through divestitures is a way to do that when you have businesses that are no longer core.BEVAN: Yes. I think Dagen is right. I mean your seeing CEOs some of them are buying earnings-per-share by divestitures and some to your point 6 percent investing in technology are trying to get it through core growth, product innovation. And so I think that is an important thing to monitor probably as we go forward.(CROSSTALKING)HAMMES: I absolutely agree -- Bob. And I think the other thing -- I mean a lot of companies are struggling with -- look I have to adapt to change in consumer taste. How do I do that? How do I continually evolve my business model? How do I invest in technology? There's a buy versus build, right. And a lot of companies are choosing to free up that capital and buy versus build that technology that they need.BEVAN: Paul -- Is the spike in divestiture -- is this a short-term thing? A phase? Or do you see this as a trend that's going to continue for the longer term?HAMMES: You know, it's a good question. We see it as a trend that's going to continue. You know, our survey goes all through 2021 to Bob's earlier point. But if I look at our pipeline, how to put our conversations that we have with clients and I look at all the market dynamics have changed over the course of the last 10 years everything points to this phenomenon continuing.MCDOWELL: You mentioned buying technology. I think Walmart buying jet.com will even now we'd look back and say and remark upon how that was such a strategically important move for Walmart.HAMMES: Yes. Absolutely. Well, it revolutionized their business model.MCDOWELL: It really did.HAMMES: And allowed them to compete with Amazon.NARDELLI: Do you think the other trend is in the past conglomerates were in favor. Because you had, you know the optionality of (INAUDIBLE) in various businesses. I know the company we were from -- General Electric -- was you know, premier at being able to take advantage of the different industries that they participate in.Today Conglomerates are falling out of favor. I think the activists are really forcing them to get more focused and less diverse. Is that another trend that's happening out there? Just overall.HAMMES: No, absolutely, Bob, it's a great point and we've seen that. I mean, we've seen the star bursting phenomenon some could argue going all the way back to 2011, right, and it continues today. And there's a lot of reasons for that and I think the primary reason is there are a lot of studies that will show that conglomerates traded the discount of five to 15 percent. I mean, that's significant. So, the sum of the pieces is often worth more than the whole.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: And it's the danger of one brilliant person putting this conglomerate together and that individual is the only person who knows how to run it potentially. And again, it's the Otto -- of the Otto von Bismarck of cohort CEO is where Bismarck created a Germany with a political structure and relationships around the world that only he could manage.NARDELLI: It takes a special person to be able to run a conglomerate like we have with Jack Welch.MCDOWELL: That's who I was talking about.HAMMES: Naming names.MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Paul, it's great to have you. Thank you so much for you insights.HAMMES: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: We appreciate it. Paul Hammes from E.Y.We have breaking news, the retailers earnings are out, Dick's Sporting Good and Abercrombie and Fitch have reported just a moments ago, Ashley Webster now with the numbers. Ashley, Good morning.ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. Let's begin with those top numbers. EPS, Earnings-per-share coming on at $0.62, the estimate was 58. So a beat by $0.04 on earnings for Dick's Sporting Goods. The revenue coming in at $1.92 billion, the estimate was $1.9 billion. So just a hair of a bit on the revenue. Just looking you'll see numbers come down, they are actually raising their full year, 2019 earnings-per-share guidance, to 320-340, so that's good. You can look at this stock in premarket up six percent, says consolidated same-store sales for the first quarter were flat. And we were warned about that in the last quarter by Dick's Sporting Good saying that they were expecting no growth until the second quarter and indeed, same-store sales were flat but that guidance being raised and the beat from the top and bottom line, we're seeing their stock move higher in the premarket by more than six percent.BARTIROMO: Stock is on fire, Ashley, really great point. Thank you so much.WEBSTER: Yes, sure.BARTIROMO: Ashley Webster, we'll keep watching those stocks on the heels of those better-than-expected numbers.Quick break and then Facebook under fire. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg could be held in contempt after ignoring a subpoena from Canada. The fallout coming out.Then, can't escape Alexa. The Amazon device soon to have an ear on all of your conversations. The alarming details as Alexa is always listening. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning everybody. Thank you so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, May 29th. Your top stories right now, 7:35 a.m. on the East Coast.Breaking news on earnings, Dick's Sporting Goods just reported earnings and raised its guidance. Abercrombie and Fitch out with a double beat. The company says it plans to close three additional flagship locations. Abercrombie and Fitch still losing money although it was less than the market expected, the stock nonetheless down 10 percent on Abercrombie and Dick's Sporting Goods up 6-1/4 percent right now.U.S.-China trade turmoil working its way through the rest of the market, however markets are selling off across the world on trade fears. China is now threatening to cutoff rare-earth minerals exported to the United States.And Huawei is filing a new legal action to block the U.S. ban against that company. I sat down yesterday late in the day for an exclusive one-on-one interview with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. He called Huawei an instrument of the Chinese government. I also asked him about I.P. theft, watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: The threat of theft not only of commercial intellectual property but military technology is real and we're doing our best to prevent that from happening.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Secretary Pompeo telling me he still sees hope for China deal but we may or may not get one he said.China trade fears are hitting markets, take a look, Futures indicating a decline at the start of trading of 165 points, S&P Futures are down 16 and the NASDAQ Futures right now lower by 57.This on top of the losses yesterday, in fact the market was up early in the day but reversed course entirely and then some by the close. The Dow Industrials are down 238 points at 04:00 on Wall Street, that was one percent lower. S&P gave up 23 points and the NASDAQ was down 30 points at the close.In Europe, the selling continues. Take a look at European Indices lower across the board. FT-100 down 98 points, 1-1/3 percent. CAC Quarante in Paris down 93 points, 1-1/3 percent. And the DAX Index in Germany down 161 points, that's 1-1/3 percent.In Asia overnight, it was Japan and Korea the hardest hit. Following the selloff on Wall Street as you can see.Plus, there was a new swine fever outbreak in China.Legal trouble for Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg could be found in contempt after snubbing Canada.And Amazon is always listening remember. How you can lose more privacy with Alexa listening to everything you say in the near future. Amazon shares also lower with the rest of the market.All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning but first our top story this half an hour is, Facebook under fire. CEO Mark Zuckerberg could be held in contempt of Canadian parliament for ignoring requests to testify before Canadian lawmakers. Canada is issuing a summons for both Zuckerberg and Facebook CFO Sheryl Sandberg.Joining us right now is Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano. Judge, good to see you.JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Good morning.BARTIROMO: Impact.NAPOLITANO: So, while this is -- I don't -- I mean, you guys would know better than I the impact, the financial impact that the legal impact is really nil. I mean, this is not the kind of summons for which he'd be extradited even though of course we have an extradition treaty with Canada. The linchpin of extradition is an allegation of criminal behavior, not a failure to show up at a legislative hearing.I think he -- I mean, I don't know what's in his head. My advice to him would be to dispatch his lawyers to negotiate with parliament's lawyers to come to some common ground, otherwise this is just going to escalate.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, are they going to have to go at some point?NAPOLITANO: I don't think that the Canadian parliament would interfere with Facebook's activities in Canada. I don't think it can lawfully do so as an instrument to induce these two executives to come. I think there are protections against that in the -- in the Canadian constitution just as there are in ours.But the long answer is, at some point, he's going to have to go. So he should in my view negotiate the terms, the time, the duration, the subject matter and get it over with.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, it's interesting when you look at the different approaches that various countries have taken. I mean, for example Europe, European countries have been really hard on these -- on these social media companies because of the breach and privacy, because of the power that they have commanded, not as much in the United States.NAPOLITANO: The E.U. has far more control.BARTIROMO: Right.NAPOLITANO: Not under the each individual country but the E.U. itself in Brussels has far more control over what Facebook does in the European Union than the federal government does here and the Canadian government does up north.How this happens, I don't know. But what do they want to ask and is there another means to get this information out? Do they just want to listen to somebody whose truthfulness they're going to question because they want to bloody his nose in public? Is there a better way to get this information? Now, these are the types of things that would be the subject of the negotiations.BARTIROMO: Well, we'll see.NARDELLI: And the basis -- the basis to be call in front of parliament is what, judge? I mean --NAPOLITANO: Well, the same issue is being debated here in the United States about whether the House of Representatives can summon the president's tax advisers. The theory is whatever parliament can legislate, it can investigate.So, can parliament legislate the terms under which Facebook provide services to its customers and acquires information from them, it surely can. Therefore parliament can interrogate its chief executive officers about the same subject.NARDELLI: Right.TOM BEVAN, CO-FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, REALCLEARPOLITICS: This seems to me to be more of a P.R. issue than a legal issue. Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg in particular, they're displaying this -- continue to display this arrogance and it feeds into this idea that he has too much power, that they have too much power.Judge, what about the idea that the legal and political ramifications of the movement to break up Facebook, right? How would that -- is that a possibility and how would that look?NAPOLITANO: It is a possibility. There's strong movement to break up Facebook. It exists here at least amongst many of the people are seeking the Democratic nomination for president. It certainly exists with the regulators. I think it's got a lot more to fear from regulators in the E.U. who I just said have a lot more power and are willing to exercise it than the congress does.But you're right, it is -- it is a P.R. thing right now. So does Mark Zuckerberg come off better saying, I'm going to protect my customers and I'm not going to answer the government's questions about my customers or is it come what better saying, yes sure, we do business in Canada, we're happy to chat with you? I happen to think the latter is better P.R. for him but I'm not -- I'm not his advisor.BARTIROMO: Well, we haven't seen him around. And by the way, Sheryl Sandberg is COO, not CFO. I just want to correct that. But we haven't seen her or Zuckerberg out discussing all of this --NAPOLITANO: We really haven't seen them since that very unhappy confrontation in congress.BARTIROMO: Let me turn to the opioid crisis, Johnson & Johnson on trial in Oklahoma charged with helping to fuel this epidemic. Can you make that statement that J&J is helping to fuel this epidemic, judge?NAPOLITANO: I mean, that this is a shakedown in my opinion.BARTIROMO: It seems that way.NAPOLITANO: I have respect for the state government and I have respect for its duty to protect the health, safety, welfare and morality of the people that live there but they shook down $270 million from Purdue Pharma, what they do with that money?BARTIROMO: Wow.NAPOLITANO: Did they distribute it to sick people? No, they built three buildings on the campus of the University of Oklahoma. That's what these state governments do. They just got $85 million over the weekend from Teva, they haven't even announced what they're going to do with that.J&J's defense is we can't put anything in the marketplace without the approval of the FDA. We can't put anything in our advertising without the approval of the FDA. We can't put anything in our instructions to the ultimate user or the learned intermediary, otherwise called, the physician who prescribes this, without approval by the FDA. We followed the FDA to a t. This should not be in the court.BARTIROMO: I mean, to say the maker of an opioid is encouraging the epidemic. Should they have not made opioid drugs?NAPOLITANO: I don't know what the answer to that question.BARTIROMO: If doctors are prescribing the drug?MCDOWELL: What's lost in all of this is personal responsibility which nobody discusses and to the damage all this is doing to people who need these drugs to alleviate cancer pain.BARTIROMO: Well, yes, that's what I'm saying. You're right.NAPOLITANO: You know, I told the -- I told the story yesterday on air, the chief justice of the United States, William Rehnquist, it was 20 years ago, is driving to his home in Virginia, get stopped for DWI leaving the court.NARDELLI: He wasn't drunk.NAPOLITANO: He had back surgery and he had overtaken an opioid-based painkiller. And the police thought he was drunk. He wasn't. The charges against him were dismissed.So, the point that Dagen makes, one of personal responsibility, there's no way a manufacturer can be held liable for the lack of personal responsibly on the part of a chief justice or anybody else.BARTIROMO: Really good point. All right, we will watch that. Judge, good to see you.NAPOLITANO: Pleasure guys.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Judge Andrew Napolitano.President Trump just tweeted on Alabama. Republicans cannot allow themselves to again lose the Senate seat in the great state of Alabama. This time it will be for six years, not just two. I have nothing against Roy Moore and unlike many other Republican leaders wanted him to win but he didn't and probably won't. If Alabama does not elect a Republican to the Senate in 2020, many of the incredible gains that we have made during my presidency may be lost including our pro-life victories. Roy Moore cannot win and the consequences will be devastating, judges and Supreme Court justices, writes the president.NAPOLITANO: Here we go again.MCDOWELL: Yes, any man who has to pull out his gun and show you his gun to prove how strong --BARTIROMO: Welcome back, Tesla planning a major announcement in China. Cheryl Casone with the details now in headlines, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, Maria. That surprise announcement expected on Friday. According to the Chinese media reports, Tesla is currently building a factory in China to produce its Model 3. Speculation is the announcement's tied to that vehicle. Some analyst said the Chinese version of the Model 3 could cost nearly $10,000 less than imported versions. Shares of Tesla down more than 40 percent so far this year.Well, the NFL players union is warning members to start saving their money. Executive director Maurice Smith sent a letter to NFL agents to advise their clients to prepare for late fee job action. Smith said the players strike are owners' lockout could last at least a year.Now, the current collective bargaining agreement expires after the 2020 season but discussions are already are underway for a new deal. Looks like it's going so well.And a new way to catch a thrill in Paris, a zip line from the second story of the Eiffel Tower. The 60 second attraction raises you 2600 feet, your speeds up to 55 miles an hour. Paris sponsoring the ride to celebrate the French Open and the 130th anniversary of the Eiffel. Riders are going to be chosen through an online lottery through June 11th. So yes guys, the ride is not permanent. I really wish it was because it looks really fun and I would do it more than once. Back to you. They want to make it temporary. It looks so fun.BARTIROMO: Yes, OK, I would not do it, but I commend you. Thanks Cheryl.MCDOWELL: What's the point over anything?(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Coming up, Alexa is listening, the Amazon device soon could have any ear on every conversation you are having. The startling details you need to know when we come right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Amazon's Alexa is listening in. A new patent revealing the wake word could mean the Amazon device is always on whether users want it on or not.Joining us right now is the Cyber Guy, Kurt Knutsson joining us from Los Angeles. Good to see you, Kurt.KURT KNUTSSON, THE CYBER GUY: Maria, always good to see you this morning.BARTIROMO: So, I don't know, I don't think -- I'm not very surprised that Alexa is always listening. It's like your iPhone X phone, the camera is always on, right?KNUTSSON: That's what I always believed and in this is yet again proof that Amazon is at least thinking about going in this direction. Now, patents reveal so much about what a company might do with their products and in this case, this one is very revealing. It's telling you that they're going to record all the things around it regardless if you're using the wake word. And then after 30 seconds, if you didn't say it, they'll do this thing called backtracking and they'll delete those little snippets. Oh, really?They have proven to us already that they don't delete everything that they say they're deleting. And as you know, we've done stories here where Amazon employees himself have sent around interesting recordings of their customers to one another to entertain themselves but also to learn from how we say things on Alexa to better understand us.BARTIROMO: That's incredible. There's a report in the Washington Post that looks in to what your phone is doing without your input and the report reveals over 5,000 hidden app trackers are using data in a single week. So, you've got all of these apps that are also listening in on you.KNUTSSON: Yes, very good experiment by the Washington Post and its 5,400 trackers that in a period of one month, we're able to send out personal data from the phone and they tracked it with a software application that sniffs out what's coming and going from your phone. And that's an alarming amount of data.And not only that but it also for the average plan for example on AT&T, that's about half of your data plan that is being used for this. Now, a lot of this sounds like, oh my gosh, this is terrible. Well, the fact is a lot of the data that's going out is useful data. It's the kind of stuff that's like sort of Uber or Lyft can find out where you are, so it's start pinging your location.And app developers use this kind of technology to better understand where your phone is when they're apps behaving in a certain ways. They can make it better for us but there is some concern about it, the concern is really you and I don't know who's doing this, when and how often in this report really outlines the fact that we have zero control over our privacy and we really again should wake up to this idea that we should be in control of the faucet of who comes and goes from our own data.BARTIROMO: Yes, there's another story this morning on the Daily Mail that says that your iPhone harvests your personal data while you sleep. I mean, this is pretty incredible. Popular apps are using hidden trackers to collect e-mails, I.P. addresses and other sensitive information without consent while you sleep.NARDELLI: So Kurt, how do you get rid of --KNUTSSON: So there was --NARDELLI: -- how do you get rid of trackers? Go ahead. What should we do?KNUTSSON: You don't necessarily want to get rid of trackers but what you want to do is know which trackers are doing what. There is an app that's free to use. There's a free version of it so don't pay for it but it's called Protect app. You can go to Cyber Guy and I will lead you to it. It will show you what your phone is up to that you -- you know, in its own private life.BARTIROMO: I like that. Kurt, good to see you. Thank you.KNUTSSON: Great to see you.BARTIROMO: Kurt Knutsson, joining us there. Futures are pointing to the selloff. We'll be right back with more.Load-Date: May 30, 2019End of Document

Freshman senator and big-tech hawk Josh Hawley is questioning Google about its relationship with China after a weird translation 'mistake' (GOOG, GOOGL)Business Insider USJune 18, 2019 Tuesday 06:09 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc.

His questions, bills, and commentary on tech are seen as "sophisticated" - proof that not everyone in Washington is as clueless about Silicon Valley as            they           sometimes            appear to be.He's written an Op-Ed that blasted social media, and he's submitted bills to limit tech's bad behavior including a "do not track" bill as well as a bill that stops apps from using            in-app purchases, aka lootboxes, in children's games.And he's said in media interviews that he's disturbed by what he sees as the big tech companies giving Washington the run-around while at the same time lobbying heavily, he told Fast Company, last week.Read: Cisco CEO says he's forbidden his salespeople from using Huawei's problems to win businessOn Tuesday Hawley lobbed another volley at Google by penning an open letter to            Google CEO Sundar Pichai.Hawley was questioning a peculiar mistake in Google's Chinese-to- English translation service made during Hong Kong's massive protests last week.During the protests, Google mistranslated the phrase, "I am sad to see Hong Kong become part of China," to, "I am happy to see Hong Kong become part of China," Agence France-Presse reported. A Google spokesperson said that the automatic translation service merely made a mistake, that it sometimes translates a negative to a positive. The mistake went viral on Facebook, Agence France reported, and shortly after that the translation was corrected.  Read: Oracle revoked job offers for some people in the UK, blaming a hiring freeze. It says it's both hiring and still restructuring.But in his letter, Hawley wonders if Google's error was really an indication of just how close Google has become to "that authoritarian government" in China."The resulting mis-translation aligned with the narrative advanced by the Government of the People's Republic of China concerning the protests," Hawley points out in his letter.Google stopped offering its Chinese-language search engine in mainland China in 2010, citing the Chinese government's increasingly onerous censorship requirements. Last year, reports emerged that Google was developing a censored search app that would allow it to re-enter the Chinese market. Google has since said it has no current plans to offer censored search in China.Hawley's letter appears to be less about this translation error and more about letting Google know just how closely he's watching the tech giant.Here's Hawley's full letter:June 18, 2019Mr. Sundar PichaiChief Executive OfficerGoogle, LLC1600 Amphitheatre ParkwayMountain View, CA 94043Dear Mr. Pichai,I write to express concern regarding Google's role in the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. On June 14, 2019, the Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Google Translate mistranslated the phrase, "I am sad to see Hong Kong become part of China," to, "I am happy to see Hong Kong become part of China [italics added]," for a period of approximately one hour during the protests. The resulting mistranslation aligned with the narrative advanced by the Government of the People's Republic of China concerning the protests.Responding to the AFP report, a Google spokesman said, "Google Translate is an automatic translator, using patterns from millions of existing translations to help decide on the best translation for you. . . These automatic systems can sometimes make unintentional mistakes like translating a negative to a positive." Yet, given Google's close relationship with Beijing and financial incentive to remain close to that authoritarian government, I remain concerned that Google may have been negligent in performing the due diligence that could have averted this mistranslation at a juncture where precision of message is so critical.That due diligence is particularly necessary in the case of Hong Kong, as the Government of the People's Republic of China is intent on reasserting control over the city and has long used information operations to advance its political agenda. Inasmuch as Google provides a space for the people of Hong Kong to share information, that space will be targeted for manipulation by Beijing. It thus falls upon Google to place principle over profit and protect its products against such interference -- even if doing so might cause discomfort in the company's dealings with Beijing.The people of Hong Kong are fighting now to preserve the democratic character of their city. Millions of those people are relying on Google's products to advance this noble cause. As a company whose success stems in part from the liberties inherent to American society, Google ought to take this cause as seriously as those using its platforms to fight for their freedom.Sincerely,Josh HawleyAnd here's Google's full statement from a spokesperson. "Google Translate is an automatic translator, using patterns from millions of existing translations to help decide on the best translation for you. These automatic systems can sometimes make unintentional mistakes like translating a negative to a positive. We are committed to continue improving our technology."NOW WATCH: Watch Apple's 2019 WWDC event in 11 minutesSee Also:• Google CEO Sundar Pichai says he was taken aback by the timing of a potentially seismic antitrust investigation• Google's Pixel 4 is expected to be a major change from past Pixel phones.

China dangles a potentially harmful new threat in trade warAssociated Press InternationalMay 30, 2019 Thursday 3:14 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 894 wordsByline: By PAUL WISEMAN, FRANK BAJAK and YANAN WANG, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - Facing new trade sanctions and a U.S. clampdown on its top telecommunications company, China issued a pointed reminder Wednesday that it has yet to unleash all its weapons in its trade war with the Trump administration.Chinese state media warned that Beijing could cut America off from exotic minerals that are widely used in electric cars and mobile phones. The threat to use China's rich supply of so-called rare earths as leverage in the conflict has contributed to sharp losses in U.S. stocks and sliding long-term bond yields.For months, the world's two biggest economies have been locked in a standoff over allegations that China deploys predatory tactics - including stealing trade secrets and forcing foreign companies to hand over technology - in a drive to supplant U.S. technological dominance.The Trump administration has imposed 25% tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports and is planning to tax the $300 billion in imports that have so far been spared. And it escalated the stakes this month by putting the Chinese telecom giant Huawei on a blacklist that effectively bars U.S. companies from supplying it with computer chips, software and other components without government approval.The U.S. claims Huawei is legally beholden to China's ruling Communist Party, which could order it to spy on their behalf. Washington has offered no evidence that the Huawei has done that, however.Huawei is trying to beat back one punitive U.S. measure in federal court. In a motion filed late Tuesday in eastern Texas, the company argued that a 2018 law that bars it from selling telecom gear to U.S. government agencies and contractors should be struck down as unconstitutional. The move for summary judgment in a case filed against the U.S. government in March says the law violates a constitutional prohibition against "trial by legislature" of individual entities. Congress thus acted unconstitutionally when it "adjudicated Huawei's guilt and blacklisted it," the motion argues.An attorney representing Huawei in the U.S. case, Glen Nager of Jones Day, asserts that Congress alone cannot constitutionally impose punishment on an individual company - which the punitive law does in singling out Huawei by name.The law "is intended to drive Huawei out of the U.S. - i.e., to banish it," Nager argued. It "stigmatizes Huawei as a tool of the Chinese government" with no right to a fair hearing, he added.Steven Schwinn, a professor at John Marshall Law School in Chicago, suggested that Huawei's arguments fall short constitutionally, and "given that this relates to national security, we can expect the courts to be fairly deferential to the government."The nationalistic Chinese newspaper Global Times warned that China has plenty of ways to retaliate against the United States, including the threat of cutting off supplies of rare earths. China last year produced 78% of the world's rare earths, according to researchers at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.If the U.S. fails to exercise restraint, it will see that "China is far from running out of cards, and we have the will and determination to fight the U.S. to the end," the paper's editorial said. An official of China's top economic planning agency did not rule out using rare earths as a countermeasure against "the U.S.'s unwarranted suppression."President Xi Jinping visited rare earth-related businesses in southeastern Jiangxi province earlier this month. He called rare earths "an important strategic resource" while stressing the importance of owning independent core technologies, the state-run China Daily reported.China has used rare earths as a cudgel before. Five years ago, the World Trade Organization slapped down China's attempt to restrict the export of rare earths, rejecting its claim that it just wanted to protect the environment and conserve supplies. Instead, the move appeared to be aimed at hurting Japan with which Beijing was having a diplomatic tiff.Scott Kennedy, director of the project on the Chinese economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the Chinese might benefit even less if they try to weaponize rare earths again."It's not the threat that it was ... when the Chinese threatened to cut off the Japanese," he said.First, users of rare earths have stockpiled the minerals for a "rainy day." Second, they also have figured out how to "use less rare earth to achieve the same results" in such products as lasers and magnets. And third, different minerals and chemicals are increasingly being used as rare earth substitutes.Kennedy predicts that once investors have "realized the threat wasn't as dire, markets would bounce back."Still, he isn't optimistic about the U.S.-China trade negotiations, which broke off May 10 after an 11th round of talks failed to produce an agreement. U.S. officials accused the Chinese of reneging on agreements they'd made in earlier rounds."The Chinese first are going to have to signal they will talk," he said. Then they will have to go back to where they stood before they backpedaled on earlier concessions. "I don't see any body language from the Chinese that they're about to do that," Kennedy said.___Wang reported from Beijing, and Bajak from Boston.

HUAWEI WILL DAMAGE AMERICAN SECURITY AND PROSPERITYStates News ServiceApril 4, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1223 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for the National Interest (former the Nixon Center):Chinese companies have a long history of doing Beijing's bidding.by Daniel WagnerThe Huawei saga has served to illustrate that, just as Beijing and Washington are crafting two stark political alternatives for the world to consider, they are doing the same in the technology and communications arena. China and the United States are in the middle of trade and national security battles, but they are also jostling to determine who will control the future of technology and communications. The Huawei dispute is as much about who has access to andthus controlsthe data of the future, as it is about superpower politics and the rule of law.Huawei is the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones. Unlike other big Chinese technology firms, it does much of its business overseas and is a market leader in many countries across Europe, Asia and Africa.5G is the next generation of wireless networks that promises to be 100 times faster and more reliable than current technology. It is a market that will be worth hundreds of billions of dollars, as 5G will require compatible new phones and communications equipment. Huawei has already built up such a strong lead in 5G technology that it is already practically irreplaceable for many wireless carriers.This presents a challenge for the United States and many other countries around the world.To put America's national security concerns vis- -vis Chinese technology into context, consider that in 1999 two colonels in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) published the book Unrestricted Warfare, which has been influential. The first rule of unrestricted warfare is that there are no rules and nothing is forbidden. The book advocates tactics known as shashou-jian (Assassin's Mace), the concept of taking advantage of an adversary's seemingly superior conventional capabilities by "fighting the fight that fits one's own weapons" and "making the weapons to fit the fight." It proposed ignoring traditional rules of conflict and advocates such tactics as manipulating foreign media, controlling the markets for natural resources, and engaging in cyber warfare.Although Huawei describes itself as privately held and employee-owned, the truth about its ownership structure is generally unknown outside of government circles. Many believe the company is Chinese state-owned and has deep connections to Beijing's intelligence services. Its founder was an engineer with the PLA. It is also worth pointing out that no Chinese company is fully independent of the government.China's 2015 National Security law requires any domestic firm to assist the government for national security purposes. Under it, every company operating in China is required to give Chinese authorities their source code, encryption keys, and backdoor access to their computer networks in China. In other words, businesses must now hand Chinese agents the lifeblood of their companies and products, while also giving the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) a free pass to spy on their networks. In 2017, China's Cybersecurity Law went even further, giving the government unrestricted access to almost all data held by Chinese companies. The companies that hold data routinely obey government demands to access data. So, doing the math, whatever data Huawei has access to belongs to the CCP.The Chinese government's take no prisoners approach to the acquisition of data is hardly new. In the 1980s, China threatened to ban government procurement of Microsoft software, hardware, and technology unless Bill Gates agreed to provide China with a copy of its proprietary operating code, which, at the time, Gates had refused to reveal to Microsoft's largest U.S. commercial clients.After Gates agreed to provide it, China then copied the Cisco network router found on almost all U.S. networks and most Internet service providers. China then sold counterfeit routers at cut-rate discounts around the world. The buyers apparently included the Pentagon and a host of other U.S. federal agencies. A subsequent report by the Federal Bureau of Investigation concluded that the routers could be used by foreign intelligence agencies to take down networks and weaken cryptographic systems.Armed with intimate knowledge of the flaws in Microsoft's and Cisco's software and hardware, China's hackers may have the ability to stop most of the world's networks from operating. Chinese networks would also have been vulnerable but, as part of its deal with Microsoft, the Chinese government modified the version of Microsoft software sold in China includes a unique security component using their own encryption. They also developed their own operating system (Kylin) and secure microprocessors for use on servers and Huawei routers.Back in 2012, the U.S. House Intelligence Committee designated Huawei a state-controlled enterprise and wary of Chinese government tampering with the U.S. telecommunications supply chain. It was then that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States decided to block acquisitions, takeovers, or mergers involving Huawei and ZTE, given the perceived threat to U.S. national security interests. The U.S. government then decided that sensitive U.S. government systems should not include Huawei or ZTE equipment, including component parts. Government contractorsparticularly those working on contracts for sensitive U.S. programswere also ordered to exclude ZTE or Huawei equipment in their systems.In 2017, ZTE pleaded guilty to conspiring to evade embargoes by selling U.S. equipment to Iran. The U.S. Commerce Department said ZTE subsequently violated the settlement and barred it from buying any U.S. componentswhich severely restricted many ZTE operations. The ban was then lifted at the behest of President Donald Trump in a concession to Chinese President Xi Jinping, which surprised and angered many in the U.S. government. However, the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act now bans U.S. federal agencies from buying Huawei products.Given Washington's concerns about potential national security implications of utilizing Huawei products, America has pushed for a ban on Huawei technology with its allies including the United Kingdom, Australia, Poland, the European Union, the Philippines and a number of other countries. Already security concerns have led Australia to completely ban the company's technology and New Zealand has moved to partially restrict it. London said it could work around the issue and Berlin has refused to take the U.S. position on the subject.But given what is known about Huawei, and how the Chinese government acquires data from Chinese companies, it is truly surprising that any Western government would willingly agree to utilize Huawei and other Chinese telecommunications products. What are they thinking?This is not a game. The stakes are extremely high. This is about who controls the future. Washington wants a superior competitive position just as Beijing does only one country can reign supreme. China and Huawei have made it clear this is a race they intend to win. Will the rest of the world allow that to happen?Daniel Wagner is CEO of Country Risk Solutions and author of the new book China Vision.Load-Date: April 5, 2019End of Document

Huawei ban results in collateral damage for US-China trade negotiationsThe Highlander: University of California - RiversideJune 4, 2019 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINIONS; Pg. 1Length: 609 wordsBodyOn Wednesday, May 29, President Trump signed an executive order barring transactions with foreign firms deemed threats to national security. Most notably, Huawei, the world's largest telecom equipment company, was blacklisted, requiring U.S. government approval for any future transactions involving American technology. This wasn't the first time Huawei has been targeted by the U.S. government. Huawei leads a long line of supposed infractions dating to the early 2000s, with Cisco going so far as to accuse Huawei of stealing their source code.Last November, Canadian authorities arrested Meng Wanzhou, Huawei executive and daughter of founder Ren Zhengfei, at the request of U.S. authorities on suspicion of violating the Iran trade sanctions. While the U.S. rolled out two dozen charges against Huawei in January, Poland arrested a Huawei employee on allegations of espionage, further strengthening pre-existing suspicions of ties to the Chinese Communist Party.China's reputation as a fair player isn't stellar; time and time again both Chinese firms and the Chinese state have been accused of IP theft and cybersecurity attacks against Western institutions. To make matters worse, in 2017, a broad Chinese intelligence law was passed, possibly beholding entities such as Huawei to comply with any investigation perceived as a threat to Chinese national security.However, as of yet, there is no concrete evidence that Huawei has been building "back-doors" to its products for the Chinese government. Nor is there evidence that Huawei executives are that asinine. We can think back to when Apple fiercely defended its brand, defying the FBI's request to unlock an iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino terrorists. As a Huawei executive put it, the existence of such a feature would effectively be "commercial suicide."Further, in light of President Trump's willingness to invoke protectionist policies in the name of national security, Huawei's status as a threat is questionable at worst. Justifying combating China's rising technological dominance and capabilities as a centerpiece of U.S. foreign policy is debatable. However, in economic terms, banning Huawei is sure to bring damaging collateral effects. Because Huawei buys more than $11 billion worth of goods from the U.S. each year, an outright ban could lead to tens of thousands of jobs lost.The U.S. government has been trying, albeit unsuccessfully, to convince their European counterparts to give up business with Huawei. Unfortunately for them, Huawei's superior technology and price prove too attractive; in many cases, Huawei undercuts its competitor's prices by tens of percentage points or more, fostering accusations of dumping. Because of such a significant price disparity, ditching Huawei would produce chain effects on price, hurting economic activity and slowing the transition to 5G.If the United States and the rest of the world believe that the threat of potential widespread Chinese intrusion is credible, it needs to work on diversifying global supply chains away from China. Banning one company produces no security benefit.Looking at the bigger picture, it is possible that Huawei could be used as a centerpiece on U.S.-China trade negotiations. This week, Chinese state media suggested that China may be looking to curb exports of rare earth metals, adding fuel to the trade war fire. As the trade war continues to heat up, with retaliatory tariffs enacted by both sides, the U.S. and China have ensured that the world is staring down an economic slowdown. For our sake, the U.S. must tread carefully to prevent any potential far-reaching economic consequences.Load-Date: June 4, 2019End of Document

We will bring that conference to you, live, stay with us.Breaking news, also, crisis at the border, shots fired overnight, at a California port of entry. Plus, a court ruling rejecting House Democrats bid to block border wall funding.And the tech rec on Wall Street, new regulatory concerns putting pressure on major names in the tech sector, we are naming those names, plus, the NASDAQ, sliding into correction territory this morning, then another major outage, this time, for Instagram. MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.BARTIROMO: And breaking news this morning, President Trump and outgoing British Prime Minister Theresa May, attending a business roundtable this morning, at St. James' Palace, where trade, of course, the top issue.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: There's an opportunity, I think, a great opportunity to greatly enlarge that especially now, in light of what's happening to tremendously enlarge, and make it a bigger trading relationship. So, we're going to be working on that today and a little bit tomorrow, and probably into the next couple of weeks, but I think we'll have a very, very substantial trade deal.It'll be a very fair deal, and I think that this is something that your folks want to do and my folks want to do and we want to do it.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Momentarily, President Trump will be leaving 10 Downing Street for a separate meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May. Benjamin Hall is in London this morning. He's got the very latest, Benjamin, good morning to you.BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. And, you know, if yesterday was really about the pomp and the pageantry, well today, there's so much about the politics and the protests.We are in Trafalgar Square right now, and the people who've arranged this protests hoped to see 250,000 people descend on London, move down towards Downing Street where British Prime Minister will meet with President Trump, hoping to disrupt that.But it's not only the people who are protesting, it's also the politicians. And we saw Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn yesterday, protesting, boycotting the bank that President Trump attended. And then we are planning -- we hope to see him here. If you can imagine, he will come towards 10 Downing Street and speak out against Trump's visit while he is in that meeting with Theresa May.And, in fact, the Labour leader yesterday, tweeted this. He said that tomorrow's protest, today, against the state visit. This is an opportunity to stand in solidarity with those that the President has attacked in America, around the world, and in our own country.But after what was a perfectly executed day yesterday, in which there were hardly any protests, well there's been widespread praise of the President and the visit from within the British government, and frankly, disdain from some of the politicians who boycotted the banquet.The foreign secretary saying, he thought the people had to put this aside, that on a special occasion, to celebrate the 75th Anniversary of D-Day, and now is the time to think about the special relationship and the bigger things, and so that's what we are hearing from the government, the oppositions (INAUDIBLE) very different.And here in Trafalgar Square, we're seeing the crowds really start to grow. A number of different people out, campaigning for different causes. We've seen climate change, we've seen the LGBTQ community, a lot of socialist worker parties, and these protesters being (INAUDIBLE) across London.But President Trump is sticking to the plan. He is here for the bilateral today and talking, just as you heard, about big trade deals in the future. Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Benjamin, thank you, Benjamin Hall in London, this morning. Tune in today at 8:45 Eastern this morning. FOX Business is taking you to the President's joint press conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May. We will take you there live, this morning. Don't miss a moment of it. We've got it right here.Meanwhile, we want to take a look at Silicon Valley this morning, under the microscope, once again. The biggest names in technology slammed on Wall Street yesterday, amid a new regulatory threat, Congress, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, all set in their sights on the industry's largest companies.Joining me right now is Antitrust Attorney, Andrei Barlow, along with Brett Larson, morning anchor on "FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7". Great to see you both, thank you so much for joining us. And Andre, I want to kick it off with you, your thoughts on what's taking place right now? We see the Department of Justice readying an antitrust suit against Google.ANDRE BARLOW, ANTITRUST ATTORNEY: Well, you know, I think it's premature to talk about lawsuits, you know, what we are really dealing with is we have some leaks here of potential investigations, right? The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission are the two agencies that work on antitrust investigations and they split the work between them.And they've come up with an agreement that the Department of Justice will investigate Google and Apple, and the FTC will investigate Amazon and Facebook, going forward. Now, these are just preliminary talks in terms of splitting up the work here.And what we're really talking about is potential investigations. These investigations take a really long time, so nothing is going to happen immediately and it's too early to talk about lawsuits when what we are dealing with is a lot of speculation. We don't know exactly what the Department of Justice is going to examine with respect to Google, and or the FTC with Facebook or Amazon.BARTIROMO: Right.BARLOW: So, these are just preliminary, you know, decisions to divvy up the work.BARTIROMO: Well, at this point, the Department of Justice is preparing on antitrust suit against Google. The Wall Street Journal has been reporting that, Brett, and we know that, right now, Google is basically the dominant player within its business. It also --BRETT LARSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: All search goes through Google, 95 percent of search requests go through Google. I mean, obviously, there's a dominant --LARSON: You've got a clear face there, yes.BARTIROMO: -- antitrust suit may very well target.LARSON: And it's not just the search that goes through Google. It's also a lot of ad revenue that goes through Google, so they are a dominant player, in terms of reaching eyeballs. And, you know, I've read -- a lot of what we've read, you know, everybody talks about Ma Bell, we all remember the Bell System and how the government stepped in to break that up.It's similar but it's very different in terms of communication. We're also -- when you talk about Facebook and you look at the social media giant, I mean, this is the way that people are communicating with each other. Facebook isn't responsible for multi -- several billion eyeballs, every day, in terms of just sharing everything from photos to messages, to advertising, to videos, so everything.It's all happening in this one place. And we've seen where with their dominance, they're able to affect the conversation. If you imagine, 90 percent of search goes through Google, it's not -- it's not -- or more than 90 percent, it's not out of the realm to say well, Google could put their finger on the scale and say, we want to conversation to go this way. We want the conversation to go that way.BARTIROMO: So, is it -- is it more about the dominant position these companies are in, or is it more about the privacy breaches that we've seen? I mean, the FTC has already spent more than a year, investigating Facebook around issues related to how it handles users' data.LARSON: Right. And Facebook is not doing themselves any favors. Facebook seems to, you know, move fast and break things and then come back and apologize for it. So they haven't really set the standard of, well, we're going to play within the boundaries of the law, to make sure that we are doing everything correctly.And it seems as though they're almost daring the government to step in and say, OK, we have to come in here and figure out what's going on, put a set of rules in place, and you have to abide by these sets of rules. Same could be said for Google, there's really no -- there's no regulation, there's no law, there's no rule that oversees their business practices.And in many instances, because we don't really understand what it is they do. Those algorithms are like the secret sauce for Coca-Cola or KFC.BARTIROMO: Well, that's right. They don't want to call themselves media companies for just that reason.LARSON: Exactly.BARTIROMO: Because they would be regulated differently, Andre. Can these companies defend themselves or are we going to see actual break-ups here, because this is one thing that many people on both sides of the aisle agree with. That these companies have become too powerful.BARLOW: Correct. There is bipartisan support to investigate. Look, the government's job is to investigate, to bring enforcement actions, and to remedy anti-competitive behavior. So, the question would be, well, what would the remedy be here?You know, these companies also, you know -- consumers drive a lot of benefit from all of these companies. You know, we are talking about these double-sided digital platforms where, you know, consumers are receiving, you know, free apps.You know, there's the innovation and the launch of new products that all consumers are benefiting from, and at the same time, what the government has to balance is what type of exclusionary conduct is going on that harms other rivals from competing.LARSON: Right.BARLOW: And that's the question. If there is that type of conduct going on, then there needs to be a remedy for that. But those remedies are usually handled what we would call behavioral-type remedies.You know, prohibitions or restrictions on their conduct, going forward, instead of a full break-up. It's very difficult for the government or a court to implement a break-up when you don't quite understand the industry to begin with.BARTIROMO: Yes.BARLOW: What they can figure out is what type of activity they are engaging in, and is that activity really harming consumers, right? Although they provide a lot of benefit consumers, is that -- is that harm to consumers through some of this exclusionary conduct. But, remember, we don't know if there really is exclusionary conduct, we know that there are some complaints from rivals.LARSON: Yes, I mean --BARTIROMO: Final word.LARSON: You bring up a good point. It's hard to regulate a company that gives away their products for free, and in so doing, are they keeping other people out of the business. No one is going to step in and say we're going to be the next best search engine because --BARTIROMO: A number of people in Congress will also say to you that they have been censoring conservative conversation.LARSON: Yes.BARTIROMO: And that's another thing that certainly, folks like Kevin McCarthy, the GOP leader, are looking at. Thank you, Andre Barlow and Brett Larson. Good to see you both, gentlemen, thank you. You can catch Brett on "FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7" on SiriusXM Radio 115.Apple, unveiling new privacy features, meanwhile, at its annual Developers Conference, Cheryl Casone on that angle right now, in headlines, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria.

FOX Business is taking you there, live, stay with us for that.And then the crisis at the border, agents respond to an officer, involved shooting, as a judge hands the Trump administration, a victory, over wall funding, all that, right after this, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Breaking news right now, President Trump arriving at 10 Downing Street, he is set to meet with British Prime Minister Theresa May. As you see, they are there now, posing for pictures, just arriving.We will have a press conference coming up live, in the 8:00 a.m. hour, and we will take you there live, when the President and the Prime Minister address reporters. We will bring you back there.We've got a big show this morning, as we continue to follow the live happenings in London, my exclusive interview coming up, with the CEO of Wal-Mart, Doug McMillon is here this morning, in the studio.Wisconsin Congressman and House Financial Services Committee Member, Sean Duffy, joining us this morning, along with California Congressman and House Armed Services Committee Member, John Garamendi.Hold Texas, Hold the Nation Author and Retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel, Allen West, is here, along with my exclusive interview with Duff & Phelps CEO, Noah Gottdiener, joining us, as well, big three hours ahead.

Good morning to you. Jon, let's kick it off with your front-page story in the Journal this morning. Economy hits milestone as threats take shape,JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Right.BARTIROMO: And, of course, those threats, having a lot to do with trade.HILSENRATH: Right. So, this month, June 2019, the economy hits the 10- year mark of its expansion. We've never had an economic expansion go beyond 10 years. And one of the things that really stood out to me in reporting the story was, I looked at what happened in other countries and long expansions that go beyond 10 years, even though the United States has never had one, are actually pretty common.Australia, right now, is in its 28th year of expansion.BARTIROMO: Wow, 28 years.HILSENRATH: The U.K., Canada, many other countries, went from 15 years or more, in the 1990s and 2008, so it's possible to keep this thing going. It doesn't have to end just because we reach the 10-year mark. Trade is the obvious big concern on everybody's minds. Are we going to drive ourselves into recession in the trade war?BARTIROMO: Yes.PEEK: Trade and possible regulation. I mean, who would have thought that this administration would go after all these tech companies on antitrust grounds or other regulatory issues, that has been the leading group in the market and I think just sentiment wise, that's kind of got people rattled, you know.HILSENRATH: And who ever thought that President Trump would be on the same side with as Jerry Nadler on, you know, oversight of the big tech companies.PEEK: And Elizabeth Warren.HILSENRATH: Exactly.PEEK: -- break them up.BARTIROMO: Elizabeth Warren and Ted Cruz want to break them up.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, but people didn't listen to President Trump on the campaign trail, than when he was running for the presidency, again, his stance on trade.The Wall Street Journal editorial page writing over the weekend, about his protectionist leanings and how (INAUDIBLE) been, kind of, saved from that, somewhat, in the trade fights with the tariffs on the Mexican imports, basically, as a target on immigration, is that protection -- kind of protectionist move by the President, they're concerned about that.But, again, he is a populist, he is not really a conservative, and he was very much that way when he was running for the presidency.HILSENRATH: No, I think that we have seen two sides of Trump's economic views during his presidency, the first couple of years were all about tax cuts and deregulation, the markets loved that. They took off and the economy did really well. The other side of it now is this protectionist mindset.He has goals in mind and a lot of people agree with him that the Chinese have to be challenged about their trade practices, but it's not -- it's not easy going as it is with tax cuts and deregulation, there's a price to pay for that, in the U.S.BARTIROMO: Well, it's anybody's guess, though, if the tariffs actually stick for Mexico. I mean, Mexico, there's a little window of opportunity here before the 10th, Mexico reportedly exploring possible retaliation to the U.S. tariff threat, but is still hoping for a solution.President Trump has proposed a five percent tariff starting next week over immigration, but even Kevin McCarthy, GOP leader, on Sunday, said to me, let's see what happens this upcoming week when Secretary Pompeo meets with his counterpart, in Washington.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: You're creating a level of economic uncertainty with business. That is when business spending is slowing, when profits are in a recession, according to the GDP data, fourth quarter and the first quarter. You have factory activity slowing to the lowest levels since 2016, even before the election.HILSENRATH: Yes.MCDOWELL: You create a level of I don't know what this President is going to do, in terms of trade, so much cross border. A supply chain work between the U.S. and Mexico, you have businesses that will sit back and say, I'm going to wait to invest and hire until after the election.(CROSSTALK)PEEK: -- created this uncertainty, so there wasn't any business investment.BARTIROMO: He uses tariffs as leverage, now he's using the tariffs as leverage over the border wall. We've got more to say on this. Coming up, the President Trump arrived at 10 Downing Street for a bilateral meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May, more on that when we come back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Day two of President Trump's visit to U.K. this morning, the President and the First Lady now inside the British Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street. President Trump and Theresa May will hold a bilateral meeting and then they'll hold a press conference later this morning, which we are taking you there, live.Joining me right now is the White House Reporter for the Washington Examiner, Rob Crilly, Rob, good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.ROB CRILLY, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Good morning.BARTIROMO: The President talked a bit about the potential for a trade deal with the U.K., what's your take away, so far, from the President's meeting in the U.K.?CRILLY: Well, I think the take away, so far, is how much he's enjoying it. We saw all the pomp and ceremony of a full state visit yesterday, the state banquet, and Mr. Trump looked relaxed, like he was really in his element. We saw a different side of his character.It was a really nicely written up by the London Times, saying he'd turned from a swaggering president into a school boy. He looked like he was on best behavior, minding his manners. Now, everything switches today.We're pivoting from the politics -- sorry, from the pomp, to the politics. So now, we're going to get into the nitty-gritty. We're going to start hearing about a trade deal. We'll probably be hearing a little bit about Huawei, the Chinese Telecommunications company, so now, we really get down to business.BARTIROMO: Everybody's take, Liz?PEEK: Yes, I think -- look, I think there's a lot of work to be accomplished today. It could be a very good day for Theresa May and for Donald Trump, I mean, the British Brexit situation is a compete mess, if they go barreling out of the E.U., which seemed more increasingly likely.They need the United States to step in and say, yes, we want to do a deal, so let's see what happens, but I think it could be very positive.BARTIROMO: How has the reception to the President been, in London, Rob, because the last time he went there, it was pretty chilly, but today, it looks different?CRILLY: I think it's very different, I mean, first of all, the main protests are expected to be getting underway in about the next half an hour to an hour, so things could change. But, I think the overall feeling, is if London is just getting on with their business.There is a sense here that Donald Trump is not popular, but as we were just talking about, both sides need each other right now. Britain's in a terrible mess over Brexit. It needs to start striking some deals and it needs friends in the world.And, I think, although, Donald Trump's personal popularity ratings are fairly modest, shall we say, in London, people here are actually in favor of this state visit, because they know we need to get some of these trade deals done.MCDOWELL: But the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, wrote that really quite frankly, mean, editorial about President Trump, the equivalent of a 3-year- old child at barbecue, eating rocks for attention, and he certainly got it.And then the mayor of New York City had to pile on, and that's more embarrassing than anything for both the mayor of London and the United States, but to that point, can the people who don't like President Trump, whether it's a protest or the mayor of London, remember, this visit is about the 75th Anniversary of the D-Day invasion which is on Thursday.And it's about, basically, the combined -- the unity and the combined strength and the long-standing relationship between the United States and Britain that basically saved the world from Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler.I don't -- and all the people who sacrificed their lives, storming the beaches of France, that day, 75 years ago, I don't know why that people keep losing sight of that, certainly, the Queen didn't.CRILLY: I think, I mean, actually, there was something interesting happened in the state banquet last night and there were two toasts. Both the Queen and President Trump spoke about D-Day and the Second World War. It's interesting they highlighted different facts.President Trump spoke very much about Britain standing alone through the wall, through the blitz, standing up to Nazism by itself. The Queen, in contrast, talked about how nations have come together to fight off the Nazis and how that had laid the framework for the post war common wealth of nations coming together, if you like.So, they both emphasize different lessons to take away. But yes, this is very clever scheduling. This is all about the pomp of the state visit, the commemorations of the 75th Anniversary of D-Day, which I think has taken some of the -- apart from what we talked about with the mayor of London, I think it's taken a little bit of the heat out of the situation, very cleverly done.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: And remember, Americans know, and I made a joke about it yesterday, but we watched the Crown on Netflix, and it might seem silly, but it is a stark reminder of who the Queen is, and what she has lived through, and living through the blitz, staying with her family, in London, during the bombings and her dedication to service and duty and I think that's on display.PEEK: It's also interesting that they are talking about the special relationship, those words apparently never came out of Obama's mouth. He never actually had a great affection for the U.K., so according to some people who were in that administration, in the U.K., this is a very welcome change in tone.And so, yes, President Trump may not be personally terribly popular, I think America's, sort of, renewal of that special relationship is extremely popular.HILSENRATH: Speaking of symbolism, he sent back that statute of Churchill.PEEK: At least that was -- yes, that was something that was debated on and off, but yes, that was not taken well by the Brits, for sure.BARTIROMO: For sure. All right, Rob, thank you, great insights from you, Rob Crilly joining us there. Tune in today at 8:45 a.m. Eastern, FOX is going to take you live to the President's joint press conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May, that would be live at 8:45 this morning, right here, so join us for that.First, the regulation, threat, to technology.

Joining us right now is Tengler Wealth Management Chief Investment Strategist Nancy Tengler. Nancy, good to see you.NANCY TENGLER, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, TENGLER WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: How do you approach these names knowing that this is where the growth has been in terms of sectors?TENGLER: Yes, with trepidation -- I mean, those of us who lived through Microsoft, and the antitrust situation are cautious. We had written in the fourth quarter of 28 -- 2017, sorry that we thought the group was going to come under pressure. That they were to this administration like oil was to the Obama administration.So, we trimmed back, but being a portfolio manager is like being a perpetual state of dissatisfaction, we didn't term enough. So, we're watching and if we think that this is going to be more bluster than substance, then we might actually step back in and round out our position.BARTIROMO: Does it surprise you guys that the Republicans are actually looking at the tech sector and suggesting we could see further regulation?TENGLER: Except, Nancy put her finger on it, which is that this administration is no great fan of the tech sector, which, by the way, help Obama get elected in 2008 and 2012. He had a very close relationship, so, even as issues arose with the tech sector, that administration was not likely to do much about it. I mean, you know --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: But here is the very different story, yes.TENGLER: Yes, absolutely.HILSENRATH: I think there's also a perception among Republicans that they aren't treated fairly on platforms like Twitter, Google, and Facebook.BARTIROMO: Yes.HILSENRATH: So, I think that kind of adds the incentive on their front to crack down on some of these -- some of this.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: They said --HILSENRATH: It is not surprising that Google and Facebook right now are the two that seem to be getting the most attention.BARTIROMO: And they say that they're censoring conservative speech.HILSENRATH: Right.TENGLER: Yes. And I think to the governance bothers me more than the regulatory issues. I mean, I think the fact that you have these super- voting shares with the CEO. There is no accountability to shareholders.So, as a shareholder, that's really what drives our decision to not be overweight those two stocks in particular. Because we have no we have no say.HILSENRATH: Nancy, what's going to lead the market now if tech is under the scrutiny of Washington, and there isn't any momentum. What sector leads the market if it's going to keep going up, or --(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: I just made a face when you asked that. I was just current like that when you were asking that so -- that's why. Just because again because -- Again, because, so many sectors are very trade sensitive and with a lot of the trade negotiators not wrapping up still up in the air --HILSENRATH: I didn't mean it in a leaning way, but it might be the case that there isn't a sector to lead.TENGLER: Well, I mean, look, if I told you I knew, I would be lying, but I do think from a valuation standpoint, health care which had been in the crosshairs is now looking attractive again. And so, we moved to an overweight in that group.A little bit bold, but I do think that the drug pricing threats are probably not going to be as onerous as expected, and will not hurt the big cap pharma and biotech companies, is not.HILSENRATH: Is it possible financials take a leave?TENGLER: Maybe.HILSENRATH: You know, we were talking beforehand that you know, maybe the Fed is going to be cutting interest rates over the next few months. If not if they're June meeting, then, maybe the September meeting is the financial sector. And, you know, and they've got deregulation at their -- at their back now.TENGLER: Yes, when did they're back. Agreed. Although we've -- that's been the longest wrong call on Wall Street. You know, people have been talking about that group outperforming for three years. So, we've added to consumer discretionary. Some taking the closer look at energy because it's been so beat up. But it's a difficult game right now.BARTIROMO: Because of the broader issues of trade and tariffs.TENGLER: Right.BARTIROMO: So, there's really very few places to hide in environment. The president could face backlash from GOP members of Congress now who oppose, threatened tariffs on Mexico. Mexico is warning of retaliation, and then, breaking this morning, the Chinese government is charging Chinese citizens in the United States have been subject to interrogation and harassment by law enforcement. This is what the Chinese government is saying that fight is getting worse.Now, we do have a little window of opportunity here for Mexico. Maybe they come up with something where Mexico does something substantial at the border to hold off the dogs in terms of the president putting this tariffs in place. But the Chinese fight is only getting worse.TENGLER: Well, and yes, exactly. And all of us got it wrong. I was in Washington right before trade talks broke down. Meeting with all policymakers and they were all universal and saying, "We're going to get this deal done.But also, going after India at this particular time and taking away their developing nation's benefit, I just think there's too many fronts where people are starting to think, OK, wait a minute, this -- yes.BARTIROMO: So, do you want to get out of the way not put any money to work and stocks right here while this is all settling out or do you want to own equities?TENGLER: For the law, I invest my client's portfolios for next three to five years. So, this is an opportunity, I think to pick away at some of the stocks that we wouldn't have access to because they were too expensive.So, it's always a turning point to want to run in the other direction. But the right thing to do is to really just dig in and look at quality and dividends. Because with lower rates, dividend stocks are much more attractive.BARTIROMO: And John, you wrote this morning in the Wall Street Journal cover's page story about the risks to the economy right now.HILSENRATH: Right.BARTIROMO: You mentioned trade. You also mentioned interest rates and a mistake from the Fed.HILSENRATH: Right, and the market is signaling right now that the fed might have made a mistake. You know, I wanted to ask leniency about the treasury market, investors are piling at the 10-year treasury notes right now, in part, because they're not seeing opportunities and stocks. And what the market is signaling in the process is with long-term interest rates lower than the Fed's target interest rate that the fed might have interest rates too high. They might have to cut rates to make sure that this expansion doesn't run into a wall.MCDOWELL: Right. That inversion keeps widening and wind again yesterday.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: So, why is this been since April of 2007? So, again, that's been lasting, at least, for a week now.TENGLER: Yes, I mean, certainly, those of us that look at the underlying economic numbers would say the rest of the world is contracting, the U.S. is still somewhat expansionary in metrics.But, I am worried about the inversion, and I'm worried about the fact that there is -- there doesn't seem to be leadership coming out of the fed. We will see today. We will see what they say if they are listening event.But I'm -- I find it ironic, by the way, that we're here when three months ago, you know, the president and Steve Moore, for example, were getting castigated for calling for a lower rate. So --BARTIROMO: Yes, and now it's sort of beginning to get the bait in. That we're going to see well.TENGLER: Yes.BARTIROMO: Look at the inversion whether or not that leads to recession is anybody's guess. But still, we are looking at the possibility that the fed lowers rate this year.TENGLER: Yes, right.MCDOWELL: And then -- and then Steve Moore.(CROSSTALK)HILSENRATH: And markets are expecting that now.MCDOWELL: And then, Steve Moore, said Friday, he had no idea why the president would use tariffs on Mexico to deal immigration when it has nothing to do with trade.TENGLER: Right. Yes.PEEK: I think he's just frustrated, you know because Congress won't act, and this is what he can do. But if we (INAUDIBLE) the space next year, I totally agree.(CROSSTALK)HILSENRATH: I was going to say, he needs to look out because we know, we're getting into election season.PEEK: No question.HILSENRATH: And a lot of the fiscal stimulus that really help the economy could be weighing in.(CROSSTALK)PEEK: Yes, they know, no question.HILSENRATH: Economists are saying we might have growth of less than two percent in the second quarter. Of course, they said that in the first quarter and they were wrong, but -- you know, if this economy slows down and the market loses its momentum --(CROSSTALK)PEEK: And it is slowing down.BARTIROMO: I wonder if this move is partly to shake-up Washington a bit. I mean, USMCA is sitting there. Nancy Pelosi is refusing to bring it to the floor for a vote. A lot of people say that if she were to bring it to the floor to a vote, it would pass.MCDOWELL: Yes.BARTIROMO: She's sitting on it. Is this President Trump's way to shake it up so much that all of the sudden, the Democrats say, "Wait, don't tariff Mexico. Let's get USMCA across."(CROSSTALK)HILSENRATH: I think his -- His whole presidency is about shaking of Washington. That's like -- clearly, clearly the case --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: And no, but it also shakes up Mexico, and Mexico still has to ratify the dog on the thing. And it violates the world trade organization as well. So, what are you doing?BARTIROMO: Well, they are in Washington this week. We will see what happens with those meetings. Secretary Pompeo and his counterpart from Mexico. Nancy, it's good to see you.TENGLER: You, too.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. Nancy Tengler there. Plus, rap's first billionaire. Jay-Z's new milestone.

So, he is well-rounded, very much using his skill set not just in music but in other things too to amass this fortune. I was looking at some of his art -- he's big in art world. He is has about $70 million art collection. So, it's pretty unbelievable.I also want to show you Serena Williams. You're going to like this, Maria. She's the first athlete to make the list of the richest self-made woman, and it's $225 million for her, but she invests in 34 start-ups that are focused on women and focused on minorities, it's called Serena Ventures, that's her company.

She does a lot of personal care products, so she's all about using herself as the message as she preaches these companies as part of her brand. So, congratulations to both of them.HILSENRATH: I thought I saw coin base on that list. A digital currency, that's an interesting addition to her list.PEEK: -- advising her on all those investments.SIMONETTI: She has a seat on the boards of many companies and she talks to, you know, Sheryl Sandberg and others as well.PEEK: Interesting.MCDOWELL: I'm looking at the wedding dresses.

High-level exchanges were frozen in 2012 after Japan nationalized the small group of remote islands claimed by Beijing. The act set off violent protests in China and sent Japanese investment and tourism into a nose dive.Trade and investment have since rebounded, and companies from the two nations are considering joint projects in third countries such as Thailand.While "the current economic situation is complicated and profoundly changing," Wang said, "Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is constantly advancing at a solid pace."China and the U.S. said a week earlier that they achieved new progress in talks aimed at ending a tariff standoff over Beijing's industrial and technology policies. A conclusion to the dispute, which has shaken financial markets, remains uncertain.Two issues at the center of China-U.S. trade frictions - forced technology transfer and intellectual property - were raised by the Japanese delegation Sunday, said Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Takeshi Osuga.Osuga told reporters at an evening news briefing that the Chinese side noted that Chinese tech giant Huawei's activities in Japan have been affected by certain policies. To this, Kono responded that Japan has never taken any measure with the objective of excluding any company or product, Osuga said.Several countries have expressed concerns over Huawei, which the U.S. has accused of being controlled by China's ruling Communist Party and thus obliged to spy on its behalf. Huawei maintains that it would say no to requests from the Chinese government for confidential information about foreign users of its technology. Japan's cybersecurity agency says suppliers deemed high-risk, including Huawei, will be excluded from government purchases.Meanwhile, Japan's exports have suffered as a result of slowing Chinese growth. China is Japan's largest trading partner, and Japanese companies - from carmakers to department stores - play a major role in the Chinese economy.President Donald Trump has also imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum from Japan, and threatened automobile tariffs that would leave Japan among the hardest-hit.Kono said Sunday that Chinese President Xi Jinping will likely visit Japan this year.

Why Tiananmen Square Censorship Matters to International InvestorsRealMoneyJune 5, 2019 Wednesday 12:00 PM EDTCopyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1360 wordsByline: Alex Frew McMillanHighlight: Reuters found itself in the strange position of writing a news story to explain why its news stories about the Tiananmen Square massacre weren't appearing on an investment-data platform it created.BodyTuesday was the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, when China on June 4, 1989, sent troops and tanks in to disperse pro-democracy student demonstrations. The troops killed hundreds, probably thousands, of young kids to reclaim Beijing's central square. But you wouldn't know that in China.Mentions of Tiananmen Square, June 4, and even the numbers "46" and "64" -- short for "4-6" and "6-4," or references to June 4 -- are studiously censored on the mainland. Companies that want to do business in China also have mounting pressure on them to do the Communist Party's bidding in suppressing controversial content, making them active participants in this egregious editing of history.One of the most bizarre examples of this behavior came at this anniversary. Reuters news articles on the 30th anniversary were censored on what's basically a Reuters terminal, the equivalent of a Bloomberg machine used by investors to track stock data, regulatory filings and what's going on in the world.The Eikon service -- Bloomberg's main rival in financial data -- refused to carry Reuters stories about Tiananmen Square starting last week, even though Reuters created Eikon and still gets the lion's share of its news revenue from selling its stories into Eikon. But after a botched rollout of the service (Eikon and Bloomberg are now online, not in physical terminals), Reuters last year spun out a 55% stake in its Financial & Risk unit that owns Eikon to a group led by the Blackstone Group  , the world's largest private-equity company.Reuters News has a 30-year contract to provide news to Eikon and Refinitiv, which in turn pays Reuters at least $325 million per year. That makes Refinitiv the largest customer for Reuters News, a subsidiary of Thomson Reuters  . But Reuters, with a Web site already blocked in China since 2015, found its own stories censored out of its own platform, and then found itself  . About itself.What does this mean for investors? Obviously, it means that if you happen to find yourself in China, you can't trust the news. Even the investment news.But it increasingly means you can't trust the news about China that appears outside of China either. Refinitiv said it initially intended only to censor the Tiananmen stories within China, but many users outside of China couldn't see the stories, either. Refinitiv provided no notice about this censorship on the Eikon terminal, so you wouldn't know the stories were missing unless you were looking for them.There are people looking for them on this important anniversary. Organizers say 180,000 people turned out for a memorial service in Hong Kong's Victoria Park, covering six football fields. But for run-of-the-mill stories including corporate news as well as material the Communist Party might prefer you did not know, no one would know the news stories were missing.They're Only Following OrdersRefinitiv trotted out the excuse that it was merely playing by the rules."Refinitiv is a financial-markets news and data provider in China. We are proud of the role we play in the world to facilitate transparent and efficient financial markets," it told Reuters in an e-mail statement. "As a global business, we comply with all our local regulatory obligations, including the requirements of our license to operate in China."In November, the Cyberspace Administration of China that controls online speech put out harsher rules to squash material that the government does not like. It said that both platforms and individual people can be punished for "falsifying the history of the Communist Party."With Tuesday's Tiananmen massacre anniversary, the Cyberspace Administration threatened to suspend Eikon service in China if Refinitiv did not censor the articles, Reuters said, quoting inside sources.China, under President Xi Jinping, is getting tougher and tougher on dissenting speech and increasingly is imposing its controls over companies. At one point, Xi himself called Alibaba Group Holdings  co-founder Jack Ma and Tencent Holdings  co-founder Pony Ma (who are not related) to a little get-together. Xi reminded them that their companies, while very powerful, operate at the permission of the Communist Party, so they better not get too many ideas about who's really in charge.So there is something to the ongoing feud between the United States and Huawei Technologies. It handily illustrates the dilemma posed by doing business with Chinese companies, or investing in them.Huawei is a bona fide private business, not a state-owned enterprise. But as a telecom equipment supplier, it operates under multiple Chinese government licenses and has multiple contracts with the Chinese government. I have no doubts that it would provide whatever data the Communist Party demanded to said party if requested. It would trot out similar excuses as Refinitiv, that it is just complying with the rules.The State's Nose in the Corporate TentThe line is even blurrier with companies that are actually owned by the Chinese state. What's more, the Communist Party in 2017 started writing itself into the articles of association of many of China's biggest companies, describing the party as being at the core of the company. The huge oil company China Petroleum & Chemical Corp.  , known as Sinopec, as well as the world's largest bank by assets, Industrial and Commerce Bank of China  , changed their company "constitutions" in this way.Such large companies have a Communist Party unit within the company, "advising" on operations. China Railway Group  , which despite its name is actually one of China's biggest construction companies, wrote into its articles of association that "when the board of directors decides on material issues, it shall first listen to the opinions of the party committee of the company."China Railway Group is one of the main beneficiaries of China's One Belt, One Road project of overseas infrastructure projects. Part of the scheme involves building new rail connections from China and from Southeast Asia through Central Asia and Central Europe to the West.Hong Kong is a bastion of free speech, where brokerages and analysts are able to run critical commentary of such state-owned companies. It is a good question what Refinitiv will do on Eikon if the Chinese state starts insisting that the data company not carry articles critical of corporate strategy, or the blurred lines between the Chinese state, China Railway Group and the Belt and Road projects.Hong Kong may not retain that free-speech position for long. As  , there's a new law in the works to allow extradition from Hong Kong into China, so alleged criminals can be prosecuted under Chinese law. The crimes have to be crimes in both places, but that's easy enough to concoct.I can tell you already that there is plenty of self-censorship within the news in Hong Kong. I write what I feel investors need to know in this column, but in my other dealings with news outlets in Hong Kong, I sometimes hear that an article idea is too "controversial" or "touchy" because the Chinese government wouldn't like it.David Webb, Hong Kong's best-known shareholder activist, has called the Extradition Bill "the gravest threat to Hong Kong's autonomy" since an attempt at passing an anti-subversion law in 2003.He recommends that investors take to the streets in protests at a mass march against the Extradition Bill this Sunday. Organizers estimate 300,000 attended an earlier march last month. There will likely be many more people protesting on Sunday.Reuters, I'm sure, will report on the protest. But comically, Chinese news reports about the Umbrella Revolution protests in 2014 in Hong Kong occasionally described the protests (when they mentioned them at all), as disruptions to traffic and bus service.So, you won't read about Tiananmen Square on the Reuters service in China, and you probably won't read about Sunday's demonstration on Eikon inside of China, either. And increasingly, you won't read such unfiltered news about China outside of China on any investment-data service that does business there if they want to continue to provide that service.(This column has been updated.)Load-Date: June 7, 2019End of Document

CASSIDY WARNS OF CHINESE THREAT TO AMERICAN PERSONAL DATA PRIVACYStates News ServiceJune 3, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 703 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy:U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA), raised concerns with Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin, and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer over China using wearable technology products to catalog American's personal data. This information can include sensitive health data, facial and voice recognition, audio from microphones, geolocation, electronic payment, access control for mass transit systems and smart locks, social media usage, and other sensitive data."Chinese smart watches and other devices can stockpile data about a user's health, finances, location and more." said Dr. Cassidy "American's private data is not safe in the hands of Chinese companies. We must address this security threat."This comes as Chinese companies like Huawei have significantly increased production and shipments of wearables. Senator Cassidy has consistently expressed the need to hold China accountable in order to protect American national and economic security.The full text of the letter is below:Dear Secretaries Ross and Mnuchin and Trade Representative Lighthizer:I am writing to call your attention to an emerging concern to U.S. consumer privacy the proliferation of wearables (e.g., smartwatches and fitness trackers) sold by Chinese companies to U.S. consumers.China's industrial policy plans recognize that wearable devices sold by Chinese companies may continuously collect a user's information, including sensitive health data, facial and voice recognition, always-on microphones, geolocation, electronic payment, access control for mass transit systems and smart locks, social media usage, and other sensitive data. [1] The data of U.S. consumers who use these devices may end up on Chinese servers where it may be shared with, or accessed by, authorities pursuing Chinese industrial policy and political objectives.China's major wearables brands, especially Huawei and Xiaomi, undercut U.S. companies in the market by selling low cost devices on razor thin margins with a strategy of rapidly expanding their user base in order to amass and monetize user data. Huawei shipments in particular have increased by 147 percent year-over-year, resulting in a 5.2 percent increase in global market share from the first quarter of 2017 through the first quarter of 2018. [2] As with similarly structured industrial policies in other sectors (i.e., 5G telecommunications equipment), China intends to develop several large, national enterprises on a global scale, which it will then utilize to accomplish its national objectives. In the hands of companies closely linked to China's government, this information could even have serious implications for U.S. national security and the privacy of U.S. citizens.We know that one of the Chinese government's most important, long-term objectives under Made in China 2025 and related industrial policies is collecting and utilizing big data. [3] In this context, wearables are important to Chinese industrial policy less as "things" to be sold, and more as a means of achieving an array of other economic and strategic objectives that have broader implications for U.S. consumer privacy and national security. For example, U.S. consumers' data derived from their use of Chinese wearables that include always-on microphones, voice recognition and geolocation could be used to broaden the reach of China's "Sky Net" surveillance system (currently based on facial recognition data), which, according to Chinese media, "can scan China's population in a second" with 99.8 percent accuracy. [4]I strongly believe we need to think of the access we allow companies who we highly suspect are controlled by foreign governments to American consumers and their personal data with a similar caution as with Huawei providing telecommunications infrastructure here in the U.S. At a minimum, we have a duty to make U.S. consumers aware of the privacy risks of buying a wearable from a Chinese company. I encourage you to take steps to ensure the safety of Americans as the Administration continues negotiate with China on behalf of U.S. consumers and our domestic industries.Sincerely,Load-Date: June 4, 2019End of Document

China might blacklist FedEx for not delivering Huawei phones. To save as much as $1.3 billion in Chinese deals, the package giant is now suing the Trump administration. (FDX)Business Insider USJune 25, 2019 Tuesday 05:21 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1403 wordsByline: rpremack@businessinsider.com,  (Rachel Premack)Highlight: Huawei says FedEx has a "vendetta" against the Chinese phone maker. And that could lead to serious revenue loss at the global delivery behemoth.BodyMark Humphrey/AP• FedExand            Huawei have been embroiled in a transpacific spat after FedEx failed to deliver several Huawei packages            in May and June.• FedEx CEO Fred Smith said this wasn't because of any "nefarious activity," but China is reportedly considering blacklisting FedEx from doing business in the country.• On Monday, FedEx said it was suing the US Department of Commerce over trade rules that say the global shipping company must investigate all 15 million packages it moves daily - a task it calls "virtually impossible."• The threat and federal lawsuit are happening as FedEx grapples with internal financial problems.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.A weekslong transpacific spat between FedEx and Huawei, fueled by the US-China trade war, is becoming increasingly fraught.In May, FedEx failed to deliver several Huawei parcels through Asia. That prompted the Chinese government to            start an investigation into the global package giant, which moves some 15 million parcels per day in more than 220 countries and territories. FedEx's stock            quickly sank to a three-year low.FedEx CEO Fred Smith denied that was a purposeful jab against China or Huawei, but the issue reemerged a few weeks later. On June 21, a PC Mag reporter tweeted that a coworker attempted to FedEx a Huawei phone from the UK to the US.It was never delivered.Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1142050970731524096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw This is totally ridiculous. Our UK writer tried to send us his @HuaweiMobile P30 unit so I could check something - not a new phone, our existing phone, already held by our company, just being sent between offices - and THIS happened            @FedEx           pic.twitter.com/sOaebiqfN6"The package in question was mistakenly returned to the shipper, and we apologize for this operational error," FedEx said in a statement concerning the returned shipment.Huawei was not convinced. In a tweet on Sunday, the Chinese electronics giant said FedEx has a "vendetta" against Huawei.Amid all of this, authorities in China are close to completing the preparations needed to place FedEx on a list that would restrict it from operating in the country, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. Senior leaders would need to approve the ousting."FedEx is a global commerce icon, if you will, so they sometimes get used by our government as well as other governments as a platform to publicize an issue or promote a cause," Donald Broughton, the founder and manager partner of Broughton Capital, told Business Insider.ETIENNE LAURENT/AFP/Getty ImagesNow, as investors worry about the company's slumping stock, FedEx is taking matters into its own hands.On Monday, the shipping company filed a lawsuit against the US Department of Commerce over trade rules that require FedEx to inspect each parcel to ensure no goods violate the            Trump administration's blacklisting of Chinese firms, among other trade bans. FedEx            said in the lawsuit such an inspection would be "virtually impossible" to execute."FedEx values our business in China," the company said in a statement sent to Business Insider. "Our relationship with Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. and our relationships with all of our customers in China are important to us. FedEx holds itself to a very high standard of service. FedEx will fully cooperate with any regulatory investigation into how we serve our customers."The Chinese government's blacklist would be a 'game changer' for FedEx's investorsTrip Miller, the founder and managing partner of Gullane Capital, said FedEx being placed on the Chinese blacklist, while not certain, would be problematic for the Memphis-based package giant. FedEx is already showing signs of financial distress, including            reported moves to cut FedEx Express air-cargo rates, a buyout plan estimated to            save up to $275 million, and            a dividend freeze."That would be game changer for all of us as investors in the company," Miller told Business Insider. "This list that the Chinese are putting together, certainly that would be very damaging if FedEx were to be placed on that."Read more: FedEx no longer will fly your Amazon packages - and now pressure is mounting on the company as it gears up its in-house air-freight networkFedEx told analysts that business in China comprises some 2% of its $65 billion revenue, or $1.3 billion total. Broughton said Asia-Pacific as a whole is a high-margin market. (FedEx does not publicly break out its business by country, but its 2018 annual report showed that 54% of its package revenue comes from outside the US.)High margins are becoming crucial at FedEx Express, where package volumes are ever-increasing, but margins aren't. The Memphis, Tennessee-based logistics giant said in its most recent quarterly report that the number of total average daily packages have increased by 5% year over year, but revenue per package dropped by 3%."At FedEx Express, macroeconomic weakness and trade uncertainty, continued mix shift to lower-yielding services and a strategic decision to not renew a customer contract will negatively impact operating income," the quarterly report            said.Huawei did not respond to Business Insider's request for a comment.It's not FedEx's 'first rodeo' when it comes to negotiating the public-policy sphereSmith, the founder and longtime CEO of FedEx, is highly experienced when it comes to influencing public policy. From accelerating FedEx's growth in the 1970s by pushing for airline deregulation to blocking organized-labor reforms            in 2009, "Fred Smith is anything but a naive newbie to the political process," Broughton said. "This isn't his first rodeo."And now, Smith is grappling with the latest government leadership in his 48 years at the helm of FedEx.FedEx's lawsuit against the Department of Commerce points to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) that prohibit parties from shipping items subject to export restrictions. This has landed FedEx in the middle of the debacle between the US government and Huawei, but the laws have been a challenge for FedEx for years.According to the lawsuit, FedEx had to pay $500,000 in civil penalties for exporting unnamed goods worth $58,091 to France, Pakistan, and elsewhere in violation of EAR. Violating EAR can be punishable by up to $1 million in criminal penalties."The credible threat of civil and criminal liability places FedEx between a rock and a hard place - absent the availability of review, FedEx must either forgo lawful activity because of its well-founded fear of prosecution, or willfully violate the Export Controls, thereby subjecting itself to criminal prosecution and punishment," FedEx wrote in the case filed in the US District Court for the District of Columbia.FedEx concluded in a statement that it is a transportation company, not a police force.Steve Helber/AP"FedEx is trying to make a point here that it's not reasonable to expect them - to require them - to know what's in every single package," Broughton said. "They are not responsible for becoming the US export-import police; they're not responsible for taking over large amounts of the federal government's responsibility and not responsible for taking on those costs. It's an unreasonable burden for them."But how long these measures will drag on is still up for debate."The funny thing about this to me is that this whole trade war and all these skirmishes, it could be over in a week, it could be over in a year, might be over before the courts even decide what they're going to do with this," Miller said."That's kind of the wild card here," he said while looking ahead to the June 28 G20 summit in Osaka, Japan."This is obviously an incredibly fluid situation, and with Presidents Trump and Xi meeting this weekend, anything could happen," he added.NOW WATCH: A professional drifter explains the physics behind driftingSee Also:• Amazon Air is quietly expanding toward Asia's doorstep in its latest warning shot to FedEx and UPS• Industry leaders are 'freaking out' about tariffs and clamoring for warehouses in this loophole-friendly Mexican border town• Carnival and Royal Caribbean paid their median employee less than $20,000 in 2018SEE ALSO: Industry leaders are 'freaking out' about tariffs and clamoring for warehouses in this loophole-friendly Mexican border townLoad-Date: June 25, 2019End of Document

Sen. Cassidy Warns of Chinese Threat to American Personal Data PrivacyTargeted News ServiceJune 3, 2019 Monday 7:51 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 711 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, issued the following news release:U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA), raised concerns with Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin, and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer over China using wearable technology products to catalog American's personal data. This information can include sensitive health data, facial and voice recognition, audio from microphones, geolocation, electronic payment, access control for mass transit systems and smart locks, social media usage, and other sensitive data."Chinese smart watches and other devices can stockpile data about a user's health, finances, location and more." said Dr. Cassidy "American's private data is not safe in the hands of Chinese companies. We must address this security threat."This comes as Chinese companies like Huawei have significantly increased production and shipments of wearables. Senator Cassidy has consistently expressed the need to hold China accountable in order to protect American national and economic security.The full text of the letter is below:Dear Secretaries Ross and Mnuchin and Trade Representative Lighthizer:I am writing to call your attention to an emerging concern to U.S. consumer privacy- the proliferation of wearables (e.g., smartwatches and fitness trackers) sold by Chinese companies to U.S. consumers.China's industrial policy plans recognize that wearable devices sold by Chinese companies may continuously collect a user's information, including sensitive health data, facial and voice recognition, always-on microphones, geolocation, electronic payment, access control for mass transit systems and smart locks, social media usage, and other sensitive data.[1] The data of U.S. consumers who use these devices may end up on Chinese servers where it may be shared with, or accessed by, authorities pursuing Chinese industrial policy and political objectives.China's major wearables brands, especially Huawei and Xiaomi, undercut U.S. companies in the market by selling low cost devices on razor thin margins with a strategy of rapidly expanding their user base in order to amass and monetize user data. Huawei shipments in particular have increased by 147 percent year-over-year, resulting in a 5.2 percent increase in global market share from the first quarter of 2017 through the first quarter of 2018.[2] As with similarly structured industrial policies in other sectors (i.e., 5G telecommunications equipment), China intends to develop several large, national enterprises on a global scale, which it will then utilize to accomplish its national objectives. In the hands of companies closely linked to China's government, this information could even have serious implications for U.S. national security and the privacy of U.S. citizens.We know that one of the Chinese government's most important, long-term objectives under Made in China 2025 and related industrial policies is collecting and utilizing big data.[3] In this context, wearables are important to Chinese industrial policy less as "things" to be sold, and more as a means of achieving an array of other economic and strategic objectives that have broader implications for U.S. consumer privacy and national security. For example, U.S. consumers' data derived from their use of Chinese wearables that include always-on microphones, voice recognition and geolocation could be used to broaden the reach of China's "Sky Net" surveillance system (currently based on facial recognition data), which, according to Chinese media, "can scan China's population in a second" with 99.8 percent accuracy.[4]I strongly believe we need to think of the access we allow companies who we highly suspect are controlled by foreign governments to American consumers and their personal data with a similar caution as with Huawei providing telecommunications infrastructure here in the U.S. At a minimum, we have a duty to make U.S. consumers aware of the privacy risks of buying a wearable from a Chinese company. I encourage you to take steps to ensure the safety of Americans as the Administration continues negotiate with China on behalf of U.S. consumers and our domestic industries.Sincerely,Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6747227 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: June 4, 2019End of Document

China blames US for worsening trade warCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 3, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 520 wordsBody China blamed the United States on Monday for worsening trade disputes between the two countries, but declined to indicate how it would retaliate against the latest measures by Donald Trump's administration.  The report issued by the Chinese government stated that "the more it is granted to the US Government, the more it requires" and ensured that China will not retreat into "issues of principle".  The document has ensured that Beijing has kept its word during the eleven rounds of negotiations and will honor its commitments if an agreement is reached. And he accused the US of pulling back three times through the talks, introducing additional customs duties on Chinese goods.  US negotiators "resorted to intimidation and coercion," the document reads.  "The sovereignty and dignity of a country must be respected, and any agreement reached by both sides must be based on equality and mutual benefit," he added.  Governments of the world's two largest economies have already imposed customs duties on hundreds of billions of dollars on imported goods.  These include Beijing's plans for the technology sector to transform China's state-owned firms into key global players in high-value-added industries such as artificial intelligence, renewable energy, robotics and electric cars.  The US considers that the plan, driven by the Chinese state, violates China's commitments to open up its market, in particular by forcing foreign companies to transfer technology and subsidizing domestic companies, while protecting them from foreign competition.  Washington has already imposed 25 per cent customs duties on $ 250 billion worth of goods imported from China and threatens to tax another $ 300 billion.  The US president has also placed Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei on a blacklist, which restricts US companies from providing chips, semiconductors, software and other components without government approval.  Beijing retaliated with additional $ 60 billion in US-produced goods that went into effect this weekend.  The country also announced last Friday that it would establish its own list of "unreliable entities" that would integrate foreign companies and individuals.  Wang Shouwen, Chinese deputy minister of Commerce, said China would soon release more detailed information on the list of untrustworthy entities, but said it aimed at companies that "violated market principles" by reducing the supply of components to companies commercial reasons.  Wang also repeated suggestions that China could restrict the export of minerals known as rare earths, which are widely used in electric cars and mobile phones, including lithium, the main component of modern batteries.  "If some countries use China's rare metals to produce products that contain China's development, this is unacceptable," Wang said.  He said China was forced to "take strong action in response" to US actions and denied that the country has backed away from its previous commitments.  The United States made unacceptable demands that would violate Chinese sovereignty, he said.  "If you give them a finger, they want the arm," he said. Load-Date: June 3, 2019End of Document

AP Explains: US sanctions on Huawei bite, but who gets hurt?Associated Press InternationalMay 21, 2019 Tuesday 6:57 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: DOMESTIC NEWSLength: 1092 wordsByline: By FRANK BAJAK and MICHAEL LIEDTKE, Associated PressBodyTrump administration sanctions against Huawei have begun to bite even though their dimensions remain unclear. U.S. companies that supply the Chinese tech powerhouse with computer chips face a drop in sales, and Huawei's smartphone sales could get decimated with the anticipated loss of Google's popular software and services.The U.S. move escalates trade-war tensions with Beijing, but also risks making China more self-sufficient over time.Here's a look at what's behind the dispute and what it means.___WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?Last week, the U.S. Commerce Department placed Huawei on its so-called Entity List , effectively barring U.S. firms from selling it technology without government approval.Google said it would continue to support existing Huawei smartphones but future devices won't have its flagship apps and services, including maps, Gmail and search. Only basic services would be available, making Huawei phones less desirable. Separately, Huawei is the world's leading provider of networking equipment, but it relies on U.S. components including computer chips. About a third of Huawei's suppliers are American.___WHY PUNISH HUAWEI?The U.S. defense and intelligence communities have long accused Huawei of being an untrustworthy agent of Beijing's repressive rulers - though without providing evidence. The U.S. government's sanctions are widely seen as a means of pressuring reluctant allies in Europe to exclude Huawei equipment from their next-generation wireless networks. Washington says it's a question of national security and punishment of Huawei for skirting sanctions against Iran, but the backdrop is a struggle for economic and technological dominance.The politics of President Donald Trump's escalating tit-for-tat trade war have co-opted a longstanding policy goal of stemming state-backed Chinese cyber theft of trade and military secrets. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said last week that the sanctions on Huawei have nothing to do with the trade war and could be revoked if Huawei's behavior were to change.___THE SANCTIONS' BITEAnalysts predict consumers will abandon Huawei for other smartphone makers if Huawei can only use a stripped-down version of Android. Huawei, now the No. 2 smartphone supplier, could fall behind Apple to third place. Google could seek exemptions, but would not comment on whether it planned to do so.___WHO USES HUAWEI ANYWAY?While most consumers in the U.S. don't even know how to pronounce Huawei (it's "HWA-way"), its brand is well known in most of the rest of the world, where people have been buying its smartphones in droves.Huawei stealthily became an industry star by plowing into new markets, developing a lineup of phones that offer affordable options for low-income households and luxury models that are siphoning upper-crust sales from Apple and Samsung in China and Europe. About 13% of its phones are now sold in Europe, Gartner analyst Annette Zimmermann estimates.That formula helped Huawei establish itself as the world's second-largest seller of smartphones during the first three months of this year, according to the research firm IDC. Huawei shipped 59 million smartphones in the January-March period, nearly 23 million more than Apple.___RIPPLE EFFECTSThe U.S. sanctions could have unwelcome ripple effects in the U.S., given how much technology Huawei buys from U.S. companies, especially from makers of the microprocessors that go into smartphones, computers, internet networking gear and other gadgetry.The list of chip companies expected to be hit hardest includes Micron Technologies, Qualcomm, Qorvo and Skyworks Solutions, which all have listed Huawei as a major customer. Others likely to suffer are Xilinx, Broadcom and Texas Instruments, according to industry analysts.Being cut off from Huawei will also compound the pain the chip sector is already experiencing from the Trump administration's rising China tariffs.As expected, the Commerce Department on Monday announced a grace period of 90 days that applies to existing Huawei smartphones and networking equipment. The grace period allows U.S. providers to alert Huawei to security vulnerabilities and engage the Chinese company in research on standards for next-generation 5G wireless networks. It also gives operators of U.S. rural broadband networks that use Huawei routers time to switch them out.The Commerce Department could extend the temporary license to continue to ease the blow on smartphone owners and network operators with installed Huawei gear. Whether that happens could depend on whether countries including France, Germany, the U.K. and the Netherlands continue to refuse to completely exclude Huawei equipment from their wireless networks.Still in place are requirements that government licenses be obtained for any U.S. sales to Huawei unrelated to existing equipment.___COULD THIS BACKFIRE?Huawei is already the biggest global supplier of networking equipment and is now likely to move toward making all components domestically. China already has a policy seeking technological independence by 2025.U.S. tech companies, facing a drop in sales, could respond with layoffs. More than 52,000 technology jobs in the U.S. are directly tied to China exports, according to the Computing Technology Industry Association, a trade group also known as CompTIA.___WHAT ABOUT HARM TO GOOGLE?Google may lose some licensing fees and opportunities to show ads on Huawei phones, but it still will probably be a financial hiccup for Google and its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., which is expected to generate $160 billion in revenue this year.___THE APPLE EFFECTIn theory, Huawei's losses could translate into gains for both Samsung and Apple at a time both of those companies are trying to reverse a sharp decline in smartphone sales.But Apple also stands to be hurt if China decides to target it in retaliation. Apple is particularly vulnerable because most iPhones are assembled in China. The Chinese government, for example could block crucial shipments to the factories assembling iPhones or take other measures that disrupt the supply chain.Any retaliatory move from China could come on top of a looming increase on tariffs by the U.S. that would hit the iPhone, forcing Apple to raise prices or reduce profits.What's more, the escalating trade war may trigger a backlash among Chinese consumers against U.S. products, including the iPhone. "Beijing could stoke nationalist sentiment over the treatment of Huawei, which could result in protests against major U.S. technology brands," CompTIA warned.Load-Date: May 22, 2019End of Document

FCC Chairman Pai Issues Statement on China Mobile InternationalTargeted News ServiceMay 9, 2019 Thursday 9:21 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 706 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Federal Communications Commission issued the following statement by Chairman Ajit Pai:Re: China Mobile International (USA) Inc., Application for Global Facilities-Based and Global Resale International Telecommunications Authority Pursuant to Section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as Amended, ITC-214-20110901-00289"Last week, I was honored to be part of the United States delegation to an international conference on 5G network security hosted by the Czech Republic. There was a broad consensus at this gathering that network security is not only a priority but a necessity. And through close collaboration among over 30 nations, the conference produced a set of 5G security principles that reflect the common understanding that the "security of 5G networks is crucial for national security, economic security and other national interests and global stability." This was a major accomplishment and concrete evidence of the progress the Administration has made on the international stage on this issue."The work that we are doing here at home also is vital to ensuring that wireless networks are safe and secure. Along those lines, I joined several other Administration officials yesterday in a detailed briefing of members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. While I can't discuss what transpired at the meeting, I can say that at the intersection of national security and communications lies a strong bipartisan consensus in favor of proactive measures to protect our networks at the front end, not as an afterthought."Another facet of the FCC's domestic work involves ensuring that foreign entities seeking to provide telecommunications services in the United States do not pose a risk to our national security. And that brings us to the matter at hand."In 2011, China Mobile USA applied to the FCC seeking to provide international telecommunications services in the United States. As we normally do, we asked the Executive Branch for its views on this application. After a lengthy review process, the Executive Branch last year recommended that we deny the application for national security and law enforcement reasons. And after carefully reviewing the record, I agree that rejecting China Mobile's application is the right call."Simply put, granting China Mobile's application would not be in the public interest. China Mobile ultimately is owned and controlled by the Chinese government. That makes it vulnerable to exploitation, influence, and control by that government. And in the current security environment, which features Chinese government involvement in computer intrusions and economic espionage, there is a significant risk that the Chinese government would use China Mobile to conduct activities that would seriously jeopardize the national security, law enforcement, and economic interests of the United States. Among other things, if this application were granted, the Chinese government could use China Mobile to exploit our telephone network to increase intelligence collection against U.S. government agencies and other sensitive targets that depend on this network. That is a flatly unacceptable risk."I will put it plainly: When it comes to our national security, we cannot afford to make risky choices and just hope for the best. We must have a clear-eyed view of the threats that we face and be prepared to do what is necessary to counter those threats.

30 YEARS AFTER TIANANMEN SQUARE, A CHANGED CHINA LARGELY IGNORES THE MILESTONEStates News ServiceJune 7, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1581 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: PHILADELPHIA, Penn. BodyThe following information was released by the University of Pennsylvania:You've been in Beijing this week. What's the mood like there? Does it feel different?The mood was no different as far as I could tell after I arrived a few days before June 4. Security was heightened around Tiananmen Square, but there has been increased security for the past several years after an incident in which a van crashed into people on the sidewalk. Basically, after that incident they put barriers in place to limit easy access to the huge open square and sidewalks in front of the Forbidden City, and to enter the square you have to go through a security checkan X-ray and bag check like at airport screening. It's the same routine as I've encountered on visits to the square for the past few years. The result is much smaller numbers of people roaming around, which is the point, I think.More broadly, the regime's approach is to nip any trouble, from their perspective, in the bud. I was surprised, however, that my local subway station did not have the usual additional security, the People's Armed Police, that is put in place during other events, like the annual meetings of the National People's Congress.The U.S. coverage has focused on how tightly controlled things are in Beijing. Is that accurate? Did that surprise you?I think some folks in the U.S., and maybe some here, don't realize how controlled things are normally. It's baked into daily life. So the added tightening was not remarkable. As I said, the regime seeks to head off any trouble and it has stepped up preventive measuresthat is, political and security controlsquite a bit over the past six years since Xi Jinping became party leader.One distinctive step that was obvious to me this time was the very effective shutdown of virtual private networks (VPNs). Like many foreigners, I rely on a VPN to access news sites, Google and Gmail, and social media while in China. My VPN has always been one of the most reliable and effective. It would not work for the three days I was here after June 1 when using my laptop; the Wi-Fi would disconnect until I turned off the VPN and restarted the computer without it. But for some reason, the VPN continued to work on my iPhone. That enabled me to be in touch with the VPN vendor and find out that they were scrambling to find a solution. Before they figured it out, June 4 became June 5 and the VPN crackdown was over.Aside from the hassleI had to work on a paper for a workshop here and limited internet access made that tougherthe takeaway is that the regime has gotten much better at shutting down access to banned sites by using VPNs, and probably is confident that it can do this effectively for at least several days whenever it wants to.All these controls, and the fact that the topic of Tiananmen Square 1989 is taboo here, means that it is not openly discussed or even dealt with as a fact of history. Some seem to think this means that people here don't know about what happened if they are under a certain age, approximately 35 years old. But it is hard to be sure. As my former colleague, Yuhua Wang, wrote in the Washington Post, knowledge is shared by parents and grandparents at home. And millions of Chinese tourists and students have gone abroad where they often find out more about what actually happened.So my working assumption is that the regime has effectively limited but not eliminated knowledge about the events. More importantly, it relies on the tools at the disposal of an authoritarian state to ensure that it forecloses any challenge before it can get started, an approach based on the lessons the Communist Party of China (CCP) draws from the collapse of communist regimes that followed shortly after Tiananmen in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.What did you think of the large turnout for the Hong Kong vigil? What do you think that means for the Chinese government and its relationship with the people of Hong Kong?As a major anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown, a larger crowd would be expected to gather if it could. And the good news is that they still could, despite concerns about China increasing its influence over the Hong Kong authorities. As for the people, at least for those who took part and others who may have sympathized, it reminds Beijing of something it already knowsthat there is a large fraction of Hong Kong's residents who are unwilling to see Hong Kong become too much like China is today.Hong Kong is now sovereign Chinese territory, but the agreement that led to China regaining sovereignty from Britain's colonial administration in 1997 was that it would be defined by one country with two systems. Hong Kong residents who resent Beijing's heavy hand want two systems to mean two systems.What's changed, and what hasn't, since the 1989 protests? China's role in the world has been transformed, but is the government's relationship with its people all that different?This is huge topic that is hard to boil down to a few sentences. Many things have changed since the protests, including the end of the positive view about China's possibilities for liberalization after the regime demonstrated it would do whatever it had to do to repress challenges to its one-party rule. But the biggest change since the immediate aftermath of the crackdown in terms of the regime's relationship with the people is that the relationship rests on an implicit but obvious bargain: as long as the party delivers the goodsincreasing prosperity, including not just rising wealth but an improving quality of life, improved medical care, and greater attention to food safety and environmental degradationthe people will support, or tolerate, or at least not openly challenge the regime's grip on power.As China's economy has taken off and as it has begun to play a larger role around the globe, inspiring pride that reinforces satisfaction with an improving standard of living, the bargain has held.What else do you think is significant to talk about in terms of China, its government, and its global reach as we mark this anniversary?It is important to remember not only the sacrifice of those who suffered, and others who continue to suffer, because the regime refuses to tolerate any independent challenge to its ideas or preferences, but also that it is wrong to reduce one's understanding of China to a single historical event or dimension. It is too easy, and misleading, to hold a cartoonish view of China and life in China.One of the reasons it is important not to rely solely on mass media new reports for one's understanding of China, is that reporters naturally focus mainly on the problemsin all countries. I know plenty of really smart Americans who hold remarkably simplistic views, positive and negative, of China. It is too important a country for the U.S. and the world for so many to remain uninformed, or to settle for cartoonish views. It would be great if more people could read books about or take courses on China or visit China and do more than go the Great Wall. But that is almost certainly an unrealistic wish from someone whose job makes it easier it's never easyto follow what's happening in China.The anniversary comes at a touchy time for U.S.-China relations, with talk of a major trade war. What are you hearing? Do the Chinese take President Trump's threats seriously?Another huge topic. In some respects, the trade war has become a gift to the regime. Its response that has relied on appeals to patriotism to stand up to foreign bullying and threats, including lots of TV programming on the Korean War, focused attention on something other than the Tiananmen anniversary.The regime definitely takes the economic and technology conflicts seriously. They are prepared to wait until the U.S. comes up with a way forward that the Chinese side doesn't think is humiliating. They seem to understand that the standoff will hurt China more than the U.S., even if both sides will be hurt. They seem to be willing to bet that China is better able to take the pain than is the U.S.In any case, both President Trump and President Xi need a face-saving way to work out a truce because a full-blown trade war looks like it will be very costly, potentially resulting in a fundamental reworking of the international economic order into an American and a Chinese bloc, disrupting global supply chains, reducing efficiency, and hampering technological progress, and perhaps fostering a global recession.Arguably of greater long-term significance is that President Trump's approach has already convinced China's leaders that they cannot remain as dependent on the U.S. as they have been for critical technological inputs, because of the Huawei experience, or other commodities, because of the soybean experience. Agreement or no agreement, they will double down on improving their ability to provide for themselves.Whether they can succeed or not is an open question. But in light of the massive government resources being devoted to the effort, and in light of China's successes over the past two decades at moving up the value chain while growing, I wouldn't bet against it. Unless the U.S. gets serious about dealing with its own shortcomings in education, infrastructure, and RandD in areas other than in the biomedical/health sectors, as Zeke Emanuel has written, this could be bad news for the U.S.It is possible that we'll look back at this experience one day and conclude the U.S. won the battle but China won the war.Load-Date: June 12, 2019End of Document

FAMILY OF CHINA'S DETAINED FORMER INTERPOL PRESIDENT GETS ASYLUM IN FRANCEStates News ServiceMay 14, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 700 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:France has granted political asylum to the family of former Interpol chief Meng Hongwei after placing them under police protection, their lawyer has said.Meng's wife Grace and the couple's two children were granted political asylum by the French immigration authorities on May 2 , her lawyer Emmanuel Marsigny told AFP.She had earlier told police she was the target of an unsuccessful abduction attempt at the beginning of the year.Meng went missing last year during a trip back to China.He is under investigation for corruption at a secret location "on the outskirts of Beijing" after Interpol accepted his resignation "with immediate effect" on Oct. 7, 2019.Interpol gave no reason for the resignation, nor did it make any public comment on the detention of its president. Meng had been elected to lead the international police agency until 2020.He was officially charged this month with accepting bribes and using them to acquire several properties during his tenure as head of China's Marine Police service, and vice minister for public security.Grace Meng, whose Chinese name is Gao Ge, was left behind in France with scant information, other than a social media message from her husband telling her to "wait for my call," and then a knife emoji signifying danger.She then hired the French law firm of Marsigny Avocats and the London-based Lindeborg Counsellors, who specialize in international cases, to help find him.The Lindeborg website describes its team of lawyers as including a former Interpol General Counsel and Legal Affairs Director, and offers experienced legal counsel to those wishing to challenge "red notices," or international arrest warrants issued by the Lyon-based organization.Grace Meng said recently that Chinese officials had presented "no proof whatsoever to back up their charges," according to AFP, which reported that she still fears kidnap attempts.In an interview with France's Liberation newspaper in January, Grace Meng said she had been invited to leave France in the company of two well-connected Chinese businessmen, while the Chinese consulate in Lyon had tried to get her to collect a letter from her husband in person.She also reported being followed into a hotel by a Chinese couple who attempted to gather information about her.Overseas-based Chinese activists say China has a long track record in cross-border abductions.According to Germany-based law scholar Qian Yuejun, who edits the China-Europe Herald newspaper, said the asylum claim was entirely necessary, given China's tendency to treat the families of criminal suspects as if they are implicated in their loved-one's crimes."Meng Hongwei's wife and children shouldn't be implicated, regardless of whether he is guilty or innocent," Qian told RFA. "But wives and children are affected in countries that lack human rights."He said Gao has also put herself at risk by calling for help from the international community."In the eyes of the Chinese government, this is a political act, and it is seen as anti-government behavior," Qian said. "Given these two factors, she should definitely get political asylum."Meanwhile, U.S.-based legal scholar Teng Biao said Meng's detention took place suddenly, and with no transparency."If Meng Hongwei, the president of Interpol, can disappear at any time, then imagine how safe the rest of the Chinese population is," Teng said. He said that while Meng's investigation is being framed as part of President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption, it is largely political in motivation."Xi Jinping achieves his goal of neutralizing his political opponents through the anti-corruption campaign," Teng said.He called for greater vigilance from the international community regarding Beijing's creeping overseas influence operations."There are hidden dangers in the form of human rights violations when China inserts officials into various international organizations," Teng said. "The international community should have a clearer understanding of political systems like China's."Reported by Ng Yik-tung and Tam Siu-yin for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by the Mandarin Service.

Huawei will help build Britain s 5G network, despite security concernsiCrowdNewswire (English)April 24, 2019 Wednesday 10:50 AM GMTCopyright 2019 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 939 wordsBody         UK Prime Minister Theresa May has signed off on letting Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei help build  non-core  parts of the country's 5G infrastructure, including antennas and other network components, according to The Telegraph.

Continue reading Huawei will help build Britain's 5G network, despite security concernsUK Prime Minister Theresa May has signed off on letting Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei help build  non-core  parts of the country's 5G infrastructure, including antennas and other network components, according to The Telegraph. The decision was made today by the National Security Council, of which May is the chair, and has drawn considerable criticism from other UK politicians who fear Huawei's supposed ties to the Chinese government may open British citizens, companies, and government agencies to cyberattacks and other forms of espionage.GCQQ head Jeremy Fleming, who has warned against cyberthreats from China and Russia in the past, is said to have given a speech in Glasgow, Scotland today to members of the intelligence agencies of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the US warning against such threats from foreign adversaries, according to The Telegraph. Other members of GCHQ have expressed concern over use of Chinese telecommunications providers. But the organization's official position appears to be that the threats can be managed and minimized due in part to Huawei's involvement centering on  non-core  network infrastructure.The decision is a notable departure from other members of the very alliance Fleming is said to have addressed today. The Trump administration has tried pressuring allies to stop using Huawei equipment after banning domestic government agencies and contractors from using the Chinese companies' products in official work capacities. Australia and New Zealand have both banned Huawei products from working on domestic telecom infrastructure projects in the respective countries, while New Zealand has gone so far as to prevent a domestic company from using Huawei equipment as part of its country-wide 5G rollout.The White House was mulling over an executive order that would do the same as of December of last year. When Trump announced a new 5G spectrum auction earlier this month, he was silent on the administration's position on imposing a trade ban on Chinese telecom equipment, but it is reportedly still on the table.As is the case with most Chinese companies, Huawei denies any involvement with its country's government and claims the reach of the PRC does not extend beyond China's borders. However, there is ample evidence that China, alongside Russia and Iran, have spent years reportedly attacking foreign military and corporate infrastructure to steal trade secrets and to spy on competing country's national and business-related efforts. As a result, the specter of the Chinese government has hung over almost all dealings with the country's biggest players, including entertainment and social network behemoth Tencent, search engine Baidu, consumer electronics giant Xiaomi, and massive telecom component suppliers like Huawei and ZTE.Huawei denies working with the Chinese government, but the US is still waryNonetheless, Huawei is fighting the US government ban on its products in court by attempting to prove the ban is unconstitutional. When contacted by The Vergelast month, a number of US security experts and policymakers weighed in on whether Huawei posed a national security risk if it were to participate in the country's 5G infrastructure expansion. Huawei is a Chinese state-directed telecom company with a singular goal: undermine foreign competition by stealing trade secrets and intellectual property, and through artificially low prices backed by the Chinese government,  Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) told The Verge.  The Communist Chinese government poses the greatest, long-term threat to America's national and economic security, and the US must be vigilant in preventing Chinese state-directed telecoms companies, like Huawei and ZTE, from undermining and endangering America's 5G networks. Similarly, Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) said,  There is ample evidence to suggest that no major Chinese company is independent of the Chinese government and Communist Party   and Huawei, which China's government and military tout as a  national champion,' is no exception.  Warner thinks allowing Huawei to contribute to the US's 5G infrastructure  could seriously jeopardize our national security and put critical supply chains at risk. Security, legal, and policy experts polled by The Verge were less outright critical of Huawei and its potential involvement with the Chinese government and voiced concern about the lack of evidence. But some, like Syracuse University Professor William Synder and OpenVPN CEO Francis Dinha, said it's reasonable to consider Huawei a threat considering the future implications of 5G networks that are built with inherent vulnerabilities.  Even if Huawei is not committing the sort of crimes for which a US grand jury indicted it, any company that supplies such a large percentage of the market for components of telecommunications networks and has such ties to the People's Liberation Army is a threat,  Synder writes.Tags:  See Website:            https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18513295/huawei-5g-great-britian-uk-theresa-may-china-hacking-fears-infrastructureContact Information:Nick StattTags:           Wire,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: April 24, 2019End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 33 of 456House Transportation Committee Issues Testimony From Guardian Six Consultancy  Page 35 of 456FCC Commissioner Carr Issues Statement on China Mobile International  Page 43 of 456Faculty question moratorium on Huawei research funding as U.S.-China tensions intensify  Page 51 of 456Senate Judiciary Committee Issues Testimony From Center for Strategic & International Studies  Page 67 of 456Rep.
